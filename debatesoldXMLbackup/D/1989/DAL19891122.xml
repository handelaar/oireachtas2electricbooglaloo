      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret to have to raise this matter but I think it should be raised in the House.  Some time ago my colleague, Deputy Austin Currie, put down a number of questions to the Minister for <Col N="1194" /> Foreign Affairs asking about a number of incidents involving the UDR and endeavouring to find out if the Government were taking any action.  In a letter dated yesterday you informed Deputy Currie that the questions were disallowed on the basis that &ldquo;the questions anticipate the statements regarding Anglo-Irish relations to be made this week&rdquo;.  I do not know what is the basis for that conclusion. We cannot anticipate what anyone might say in a series of statements. It should in fact be a debate, not a series of statements.  Questions in relation to specific incidents deserve to stand on their own, to be treated on their own merits and not to be bound up in a debate which is forthcoming.  On this basis it seems that from now on almost any questions about budgetary or financial policy could be disallowed on the grounds that they anticipate statements the Minister for Finance might make in the House next January.  I would urge you to take a much more disconnected view of the relationship between questions and statements.  I would ask you to reconsider this matter and allow these questions, which deal with specific issues and incidents, to be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy raised the matter.  What has been done in this instance is in strict accord with normal practice.  Normally at European summits the Taoiseach has met the British Prime Minister <i>en marge</i> of the Council.  Accordingly I allowed a question yesterday by Deputy Dick Spring asking the Taoiseach if he would make a statement on any discussions he had with the British Prime Minister in the course of the recent European Summit, if he took the opportunity to raise with her the case of the Birmingham Six and if he would make a statement on the matter. The Taoiseach in his reply to Deputy Spring's question stated <i>inter alia</i> that the Government will deal with the Birmingham Six case and other Anglo-Irish questions during the course of this week's statements on Anglo-Irish relations.  In my view the questions ruled out of order by me all related to Anglo-Irish relations <Col N="1195" /> and accordingly I had no option but to disallow them.  This was strictly in accord with normal procedures.  There is this week a two-day debate on Anglo-Irish affairs in which a goodly number of the Members of this House may participate and ventilate their views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I am not at all convinced by what you have said.  I could make a similar argument.  I could say, for example, that we all know that the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council have met on a number of occasions in the past couple of months and that these issues could or should have been dealt with during the course of those meetings. These are questions relating to specific issues.  The debate to be held in the next couple of days should be about general matters of policy and not necessarily about specific incidents.  I submit that in following this particular line you are creating at least the possibility that the Government will be able, wittingly or unwittingly, to stifle questions in this House simply by saying we are going to have a debate on that issue in the next couple of weeks.  You will remember, Sir, that in the last Dáil we had this same kind of discussion about a series of questions on economic matters that were ruled out of order because we had a budget debate either forthcoming or going on.  The interpretation you are giving to these provisions of Standing Orders is an interpretation which muzzles this House rather than helps the process of parliamentary debate.  I must ask you to reconsider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that it is in accordance with normal practice. Questions have on a number of occasions been disallowed as anticipating statements or debate on various subject matters. For example, recently in the case of statements on the NESC, on 24 and 25 October, I disallowed five parliamentary questions.  This is quite common practice where questions anticipate debate on specific matters.  However, I will take into account what Deputy Dukes has said to <Col N="1196" /> see if there is any further leeway I can provide.</P>

      <P>I should like to pursue the point made by Deputy Dukes because it is a dangerous restriction on questions, one of the few freedoms Deputies have in the House.  In your reply did you confirm with the Taoiseach that this matter would be dealt with in his statement tomorrow or Friday?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for your assurance to Deputy Dukes that you will again look at this matter.  When you do will you bear two factors in mind?  The first is that these questions relate to matters of very substantial concern to the Nationalist community in the North and to people on the island generally in so far as they relate to specific allegations against the UDR being accompanied by the RUC&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you also bear in mind that these questions were put down some weeks ago well in advance of any notice to this House that the debate on Anglo-Irish affairs would occur?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not get an answer to my question.  You have allowed Question No. 53 on today's Order Paper which deals with matters affecting Northern Ireland.  The grounds that you used to disallow Deputy Currie's question apply precisely in regard to that question. Could you now &mdash; or at a later point &mdash; explain this apparent inconsistency in your ruling?</P>

      <P>Yesterday, with your permission, I raised with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social Welfare the position of Coolock Community Law Centre and I welcomed the news that the centre would be looked after.  Will the Taoiseach or the Minister communicate with the centre at the earliest possible date in relation to the Government's intentions as there is extreme concern among the staff and the community in Coolock about this matter?</P>

      <P>Last week the Dáil discussed the raising of the levies in relation to bovine diseases.

      <P>I concur with the comments and sentiments of Deputy Spring as far as the future of the civil legal aid board is concerned.  In view of the crisis obtaining following the very serious comments of their chairman and also on account of the way this House addresses questions to the Minister for Justice, it is very important that this matter be raised at the earliest opportunity either by way of an Adjournment Debate or a general debate in the House, particularly when one notes that in the entirety of this session half an hour of the time of this House has been devoted to questions to the Minister for Justice.

      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 21 to 26.</P>
      <P>I am proposing this amendment in response to concerns expressed on Committee Stage that the Bill should have more definite provisions regarding commencement. By deleting section 2, the Bill will no longer have to depend on commencement orders to bring it into operation; instead it will automatically come into operation as soon as it is passed.  I hope the provision which exceeds the requirement Deputy Shatter wanted in his Committee Stage amendment will be acceptable to the Deputies. I believe it is the best way forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's approach to this issue because I think we are all anxious to get the Bill on the Statute Book.  While there are certain aspects of the Bill about which I have reservations and in respect of which I tabled amendments on Committee Stage, I deliberately desisted from tabling amendments on Report Stage so as not to draw out the process on Report Stage. I want to see this Bill enacted.  There may be some warts or gaps in it but it should substantially improve the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern was that if the Bill was enacted with section 2 as originally drafted, there would be no certainty when this legislation would become operative. I welcome the fact that the Minister has accepted the arguments from this side of the House that the Bill should, in effect, become law upon signing by the President.  I hope the Bill becomes law rapidly and that the local authorities will <Col N="1208" /> look to their obligations which will immediately apply upon the Bill becoming law in the context of trying to tackle the major problems of dereliction, particularly in urban areas.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>The substance of this amendment is identical to an amendment proposed by Deputy Shatter on Committee Stage.  It requires the Minister, in the context of a CPO under this Bill, to pass on to the objector the comments a local authority may submit to the Minister in relation to an objection.  The objector will then be allowed a period of 21 days to make observations to the Minister on the comments of the local authority.  I recommend this amendment to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down this amendment &mdash; I raised this matter on Second Stage &mdash; because I felt the requirement to review the market value of the land once every five years was insufficient as the market value of land could &mdash; and from experience has &mdash; increase out of all proportion in that time and that a levy based on 1984 values would be considerably out of date today, particularly because of the rate at which property values are increasing.  To leave a gap of five years would be insufficient.  I propose in my amendment that the market value should be reviewed after three years.  I note that the Minister's amendment proposes the local authority can review the market value of land at least every five years.  I should like the Minister to clarify if this would allow a local authority to review the market value of land more frequently than five years.  If that is the case I will not move my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put on record my reservations about amendment No. 5 in the Minister's name which proposes the deletion of the words &ldquo;on a prescribed date&rdquo;.  If the prescribed date is removed, as proposed by the Minister, in relation to the frequency of valuation as I understand the law, there will be no legal obligation on a local authority to have completed by a fixed date &mdash; whether it is three years or five years, which seems to be the direction we are going &mdash; this revised valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I support the tenor of what is being proposed by The Workers' Party representative, Deputy Gilmore, and the Minister, my concern relates to my experience with Dublin Corporation who are probably the biggest offenders in respect of dereliction and their current total <Col N="1210" /> inability to carry out their present functions in relation to valuation.  If there is no requirement to have a valuation carried out by a prescribed date, then the valuation section within the corporation will not meet the deadline which I believe they should have to meet.  I want to tell the Minister, on a point of information, that the valuation process for the sale of local authority houses and flats has not yet been completed and large sections of the corporation's stock of apartment buildings have not been valued because of massive delays and shortages within the department.  Unless there is a prescribed date built into the Bill in regard to the frequency of the renewal of market valuations then, from my interpretation of the law, there will be no severe onus on a local authority to revise the market values accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn is right, and it was because of the difficulties he referred to in regard to certain local authorities that I could not go along with Deputy Gilmore's original idea.  The first valuation will be carried out as soon as possible after the register has been compiled. It is interesting to note that my amendment is much more flexible and will permit a local authority to carry out a revision as often as is necessary but with the stipulation that it must be carried out at least once every five years and as often as a local authority so wish.  This greater flexibility surpasses what Deputy Gilmore intended and covers what Deputy Quinn thinks might be a restriction on some local authorities in regard to their attitude towards these matters.  I think both points are covered by my amendment; flexibility is being provided but the revision has to be carried out at least once every five years, and can be carried out more often.  The first valuation will take place as soon as possible after the register has been compiled.  I think my amendment is a good solution to both points.</P>

      <P>This amendment is in response to the wishes expressed by all Deputies on Committee Stage and there should be a possibility of dealing with serious offences in higher courts which would have the power to apply more severe penalities. The amendment proposes that a contravention of section 12(4) may be tried on indictment and that upon conviction a court may propose a fine of up to £25,000 together with a fine of up to £2,000 per day for a continuing offence and/or a term of imprisonment of up to two years.

The scale of penalty proposed in this amendment, which probably has the agreement of the House, relates to the real world in terms of the market value of much of the property which has been deliberately left derelict.

Am I right in thinking that a fine shall not exceed <Col N="1212" /> £25,000 as a once-off amount but that there will be a running taxi meter of an additional fine of £2,000 for every day of contravention?

      <P>I welcome the fact that we have reached this Stage.  I should like to put on record my thanks to the Minister for his taking on board amendments proposed by this side of the House by different parties.  They have improved the Bill and it is always welcome to be part of a real legislative process as opposed to being asked on the Opposition Benches to simply rubber stamp legislation.  The Minister's approach to <Col N="1213" /> the Bill was welcomed.  I hope the provisions prove to be effective.  I should like to sound one note of caution which is that the Bill will be as effective as the local authorities are in carrying out their functions under it and as the Department will be in monitoring what the local authorities will be doing.  It must be remembered that we still have the residual problem that was referred to by myself and other contributors in the course of the debate, which is, as Deputy Quinn rightly remarked a short time ago, that the local authorities, and in particular Dublin Corporation, have been a major cause of dereliction.  Long term road widening plans that have no realistic prospect of being implemented have turned dynamic and vibrant areas of Dublin into what have looked at times like war torn battle grounds resulting from Second World War bombing exploits.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation require not just to act in the enforcement of the Bill under the powers conferred on them.  There is a real change of attitude required on the part of road planners within the corporation as to what is needed in Dublin. They should have a wider and broader understanding of the impact on the city of plans and proposals brought forward that have little prospect of being implemented.  If we are truly committed to wiping out urban dereliction we must realise that there are problems in the private sector and there are problems caused by local authorities that impact on lands owned by local authorities and lands owned by people in the private sector who, without being subjected to unrealistic and unimplementable proposals from local authorities in the context of development plans, would deal with their lands differently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my hope that the legislation will be a landmark not just in a different statutory approach to the problem but that in local authorities, who share a significant portion of the blame for some of our urban dereliction, and in particular I pick out Dublin Corporation in that regard, there will be a major change of attitude.  I hope that change of attitude will be reflected in the approach adopted <Col N="1214" /> in the final stages of the preparation of the Dublin development plan which is taking place.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on bringing forward the Bill which has been threatened upon us by so many previous Ministers for the Environment.  The work done in the past is now coming to fruition and the Minister is to be congratulated on that. As Deputy Shatter said, it is important to point out that the work is really only beginning.  It will be for the Minister to introduce the regulations which will give effect to the provisions of the Bill.  I am thinking in particular of the form of the register under section 9.  I urge the Minister and officials of the department of the Environment not to give any excuse to any local authority that would enable them evade their obligation to have the necessary register of derelict sites completed within one year.  Section 9 is sufficiently explicit to enable a local authority to compile a draft register that will meet their requirements.  I urge the Minister to ensure that the necessary regulations required to give effect to the provisions of the Bill are produced as quickly as possible so that local authorities will not be able to hide behind the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speakers I welcome the Bill.  If its provisions are implemented there is no doubt that the effectiveness of local authorities in dealing with derelict sites will be enhanced.  However, I have a number of reservations about its provisions.  My first reservation relates to the extent to which local authorities will be in a position to implement the provisions of the Bill.  We are aware that the Bill provides for the compiling of a register, the administering of that register on an ongoing basis, establishing the market value of derelict sites and the introduction of a levy. However, to implement those provisions local authorities will require additional staff and resources.  My experience is that local authorities are very short of staff and resources.  They have been plundered <Col N="1215" /> off in recent years as a result of voluntary redundancies and cutbacks of one kind or another.  Frankly, I am extremely apprehensive as to whether local authorities have the staff or resources to implement the provisions of the Bill. There will be a lot of work involved in compiling the register, identifying the sites and in administration.  I would like to get from the Minister an undertaking that he will respond favourably to requests for additional staff from local authorities to enable them implement the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to have legislation on the Statute Book and to say that the problems of derelict sites have been dealt with under the Bill but that is not enough. That is like our response to air pollution. We passed a Bill in 1987 dealing with air pollution but the problem of smog in Dublin City has not been dealt with.  I do not want people to be looking at derelict sites all over the city and elsewhere in two or three years time and the Minister responding by saying that we have a new Act to deal with them but that it was not possible to implement its provisions because of a shortage of staff or resources at local authority level.</P>
      <P>My second concern relates to the provision for compulsory purchase.  It is unfortunate that my amendment to that provision was defeated on Committee Stage.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that where a local authority make an application to the Minister for the compulsory purchase of a derelict site he will not delay in responding to that application.  Local authorities have various matters on the Minister's desk and in some cases they are waiting for a number of years for an order to be made or approval to be given.  I do not want to see the same thing happen in connection with derelict sites.  If local authorities go through all the difficulties of tracking down the owners of derelict sites, serving notices and then trying to purchase the site compulsorily, I do not want to see their efforts frustrated by delays, for whatever reason, at ministerial level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My third reservation is on the question <Col N="1216" /> of the levy.  I am still concerned that some developers &mdash; who are past masters at getting around the planning process and finding loopholes, which were never intended &mdash; may find ways of getting around the levy by submitting planning applications and attempting to frustrate the efforts of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the fact that the Minister has responded postively to a number of amendments tabled by Opposition Deputies.  I hope the Bill will be an effective method of dealing with the problem of dereliction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their good wishes.  The Minister joins with the Deputies in expressing the wish that the matter will be treated seriously and in a responsible way by the local authorities.  I do not think there was ever a question of a lack of local authority staff to deal with dereliction.  We already have laws on dereliction on the Statute Book.  However, the local authority in pursuing breaches of the existing law were never able to conclude the process satisfactorily and remove the dereliction because of a lack of teeth in the legislative process.  This legislation removes that disability. I am quite satisfied that the local authorities have the necessary resources to handle the matter.  They have the will to tackle the problem and for a number of years they have been seeking the necessary legislation to do the job properly. Local authorities will have a great opportunity, when the Bill is passed into law, to give effect to what they have been seeking to do for a number of years &mdash; to deal effectively with dereliction wherever they find it.  I do not think it will be very difficult to compile the register.  I would seek local authority members playing a very active role and this was part of the thinking behind the Minister's attitude. They are getting the opportunity to involve themselves, they will see the register, and will help to compile and keep it updated.  From my knowledge of the way local authority members contribute at local authority meetings, they will be most anxious to see this legislation on dereliction in place because they will <Col N="1217" /> have a direct input into it.  There will be no undue delay on this Minister's part in clearing compulsory purchase orders.</P>
      <P>I see this Bill as a modern legislative vehicle to deal with something which has been a blight on urban areas for many years.  I am pleased that the Bill will come into effect as soon as it goes through the other House.  I intend to see it through the other House as quickly as possible.  I thank all Deputies who have contributed to the debate.</P>

There has been general agreement in this House that a Dún Laoghaire Harbour Authority should be established.  The Minister has promised that it would be established and we were told that the names of the members of the interim authority and the terms of reference for such an authority would be announced before now, so perhaps the Minister can enlighten us during <Col N="1218" /> the course of the discussion.

      <P>My decision has been conveyed to you.  It is quite clear that the reason your amendment was ruled out of order is as stated by me: it involves a potential charge on the Revenue and is furthermore in conflict with the provisions of the Bill as read a Second Time.  With regard to your suggestion that the matter be extended to include a harbour authority for Dún Laoghaire, let me say the question of the establishment of a harbour authority or planning arrangements are separate issues which are outside the scope of the Bill.

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because you Sir, believe that it would incur an additional charge on the Exchequer and that it is outside the scope of the Bill. However, I must express my disappointment at this, because I believe there is an urgent need to set up a harbour authority and because the Minister promised in this House that within a few days of the Second Reading &mdash; which is now ten days ago &mdash; an interim harbour authority would be appointed.  To date this has not been done.  However, anticipating that the amendment would be ruled out of order, I tabled the amendment that is now before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled this amendment because I believe we should have a harbour authority Bill before the House.  The Bill before us is just a transfer of jurisdiction <Col N="1220" /> from one Department to another and is basically a transfer of responsibilities without additional improvements for Dún Laoghaire harbour.  It is unfortunate that we have this Mickey Mouse Bill before us, which is doing nothing to further promote or develop the area taking account of neither the wishes and desires of the people of Dún Laoghaire nor the recommendations of the Planning Review Group, which published a report a year ago.  The Planning Review Group strongly recommended the setting up of a harbour authority, set out what that authority should do for Dún Laoghaire and outlined the areas where specific developments be they commercial, recreational or leisure should take place. This Bill does nothing in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is very important that there is a time limit to this Bill so that it will come back to the House within two years in the event of a harbour authority not being set up. I am tabling this amendment as a precautionary measure, hoping of course that the Bill will never have to come back to the House, that a harbour authority Bill will have been passed within the two years concerned.  I would urge the Minister to recognise the importance of developing this tremendous asset not just to the borough of Dún Laoghaire but to the nation.  There is tremendous potential there particularly for recreational development and subsequently for employment.  In the area of marina development, all the ancillary activities that can result from such a development in the area would give additional employment in an area with high unemployment at the moment.  It is important that the Minister recognises the importance of this.</P>
    <P>It is important too that reports commissioned by former Ministers on which public money has been spent are not left on the shelf to gather dust but that Departments act constructively on them. This is an ideal opportunity for a Department to act constructively on the report of the review group which is basically a highly commendable report.  The Minister should not avail himself of this opportunity.  I would again ask him in the <Col N="1221" /> House today to let us know when he intends bringing legislation before the House to set up a Dún Laoghaire harbour authority and, in the meantime, when he intends announcing an interim harbour authority, which of course is only a fake-out and is unacceptable because what we should have is a proper harbour authority and legislation dealing with it should be before the House.  There are tremendous opportunities and tremendous potential in this regard.</P>
    <P>What I am concerned about is the delays in and the shying away from the setting up of a harbour authority.  Why is there fear of this?  What exactly is going on?  What is the reason for the legislation not being before the House?  Are there some vested interests being accommodated or some persons or groupings of people with specific private interests requiring protection and are the Department protecting them at present?  We in this House would like to know the real reason.  The people of Dún Laoghaire and the members of the borough council are particularly concerned that permission for the further development of the harbour should not be given until a proper harbour authority is set up.  I hope the Minister will recognise and accept that.  I hope that, in hiving off responsibilities in the future to an interim authority, he will not be able to hide under the cloak of that authority in the event of their giving permission for specific developments in relation to Dún Laoghaire harbour.</P>
    <P>I have tabled this amendment because of my fears that a Dún Laoghaire harbour authority may not be established.  I hope that within the two years proposed in the amendment the provision for a harbour authority will have been passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas and that a proper harbour authority will be in place in line with the wishes of the people of Dún Laoghaire borough and with the recommendations of the report of the planning review group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Taylor-Quinn's amendment.  The main requirement that has been sought in Dún <Col N="1222" /> Laoghaire for a long time is the establishment of a harbour authority, that that harbour authority would draw up a management plan for the harbour, that it would harmonise that plan with the plans of Dún Laoghaire borough council for the development of Dún Laoghaire borough itself, that there would be orderly development and management of Dún Laoghaire harbour, that the facility the harbour provides would be used to enhance the prospects for recreational use by a greater number of people than is the case at present and that it would do something to create much needed employment in the area.  That objective seems to have had the verbal approval of Government for some time.  The Minister is on record on a number of occasions as having stated that it is his intention to establish a harbour authority.  In the middle of September he promised a deputation from the borough council that he would announce, within two weeks, the names of members and terms of reference of an interim harbour authority. That promise was repeated in this House almost two weeks ago by the Minister of State and the announcement was to be made by last Wednesday but we are still waiting for it.</P>
      <P>The Minister should clarify today whether he is going to establish an interim harbour authority; if so, who the members of that interim authority will be and what are its terms of reference.  He should not delay any longer in making that announcement because the longer he delays the more speculation it is giving rise to.  There is increasing speculation that we are getting back to the gubu days of early 1988 when proposals which were totally unacceptable to the people of Dún Laoghaire were being foisted upon us and local people were very concerned that they had no input to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I have one reservation about Deputy Taylor-Quinn's amendment it is that two years is far too long to have to wait &mdash; although I appreciate the reasons she has stated two years &mdash; for the statutory establishment of a harbour authority. There are a lot of developments now taking place in the whole harbour area <Col N="1223" /> and I have some concern that Dún Laoghaire will miss out on those developments if the appropriate measures are not taken to establish a harbour authority. There is considerable concern locally about the future of the car ferry.  Everybody knows that the future of the car ferry in Dún Laoghaire depends on the improvement of passenger facilities and the Minister is on record as supporting this.  Again there is concern that without a harbour authority to make the case for Dún Laoghaire harbour, those improvements in facilities will not take place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but I am bound to say that I gave to Deputy Madeline Taylor-Quinn and to the Deputy in possession quite a considerable amount of latitude in respect of their continuous references to a harbour authority.  I have to again state that the Bill we are discussing in committee is very narrow in its scope; it merely involves the transfer of responsibility for Dún Laoghaire harbour from the Commissioners of Public Works to the Minister for the Marine.  The question of a harbour authority, planning arrangements and all matters pertaining thereto are clearly outside the scope of the Bill.  I want to dissuade Members from any further extensive reference to a harbour authority because it simply does not arise on this Bill.  By reason of the close relationship of the two matters the Chair has given quite a lot of latitude but wishes to dissuade Members now from making Second Reading speeches on this, the Third Stage of the Bill in respect of a harbour authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask Deputies from now on to confine their remarks to the amendments before us and to the Committee Stage proper of the Bill.  I hope you will accept my advice on this matter and accept further, as I said earlier, that I have given some considerable latitude in the matter of the extension beyond the scope of this Bill to the provision of a harbour authority. The matter of a harbour authority for Dún Laoghaire will have to be <Col N="1224" /> decided at another time.  There is no further scope for it within the confines of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In some respects I think you are summarising the state of play regarding this whole issue because it is becoming increasingly clear to me that the idea of a Dún Laoghaire harbour authority is very much becoming an unmentionable term in this House.  I would be quite happy to stop using it if the Minister was willing to simply state the names of the members and terms of reference of the interim authority he promised to establish some time ago, if for no other reason than to put some of the local members of his own party who are expecting to be nominated to it out of their agony.  At my last count, the membership of the authority will far exceed the number of members, six or seven, originally intended.</P>
      <P>I was addressing myself to the amendment put down by Deputy Taylor-Quinn and pointing out that two years would be too long to wait for a harbour authority to be put in place.  I accept the Deputy's reasons for putting the amendment down and I am quite happy to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me make one final point, and some clarification is required from the Minister on this.  As you said, a Cheann Comhairle, this is very limited legislation, too limited.  The Minister has now made two speeches in this House, the first in July when introducing the Estimate for the Department of the Marine and the other some days ago in moving the Second Stage of this Bill.  I find it strange that he made no reference in either speech to the report of the planning review group which is now 12 months old and which sets out the formula for the future management and control of Dún Laoghaire harbour and future plans for it.  I am greatly concerned that this report may now be dead as far as the Minister and his Department are concerned.  I appreciate, a Cheann Comhairle, the point you have made, that this is very limited legislation, but this is a very important issue in my constituency.  This is my constituency's biggest asset and <Col N="1225" /> the most important element of our local economy.  I find it very difficult to address myself to this subject without dealing with the wider issues I have referred to. I said on Second Stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy considerable scope.  I am sure he appreciates that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to overstay my welcome but I wish to make the point that the issue involved is much wider.  If this Bill had gone through 12 months ago to give effect to something that was already in place this would have been understandable but it is a great pity that we are dealing with limited legislation when in fact what is needed is a Bill to establish a harbour authority and for us to get on with the proper management and development of Dún Laoghaire harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  I would like to remind the House that if we had put this Bill through 12 months ago we would not have had the benefit of the Deputy's wisdom in putting it through.  Therefore, we cannot but gain in putting it through at this time.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to put a limit on this Bill or when I will bring forward any further legislation for more permanent arrangements at Dún Laoghaire.  In considering what permanent arrangement is best suited for Dún Laoghaire I will take into account the various comments made here by the Deputies representing their parties and whatever points are made in Seanad Éireann when it is going through that House, plus the report of the Dún Laoghaire review group, mentioned by Deputy Gilmore, and also the views of the interim harbour board which I am setting up, the terms of reference and the personnel of which will be announced in the next few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me make a few comments on Deputy Taylor-Quinn's contribution.  I would like to point out to her, and I know this from visting Dún Laoghaire and keeping in contact with people living <Col N="1226" /> there, that the people of Dún Laoghaire have already expressed their delight at the many innovative developmental actions &mdash; I am sure the Deputy will vouch for this &mdash; which have taken place in Dún Laoghaire since this Department took over control of the harbour on 1 January 1989.  As you pointed out, a Cheann Comhairle, all we are doing is giving statutory effect to what has already happened in that matter.</P>
    <P>I agree with both Deputies when they say that Dún Laoghaire harbour is a national asset and a marina development, which, as the Deputy from Dún Laoghaire knows, I spoke about when I met him on a deputation, has great potential for employment in the area.  I think the last word I said to that deputation was for them to give their best thought and consideration to marina developments for that purpose, for the general economic development of the area and, of course, the provision of employment which is the result.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Taylor-Quinn that the report is not gathering dust.  In fact, there is no dust in my office.  She also mentioned fear.  As there is no dust, neither is there any fear.  Therefore, innuendoes of any kind are not in order in that regard.</P>
    <P>Let me now take up some of the points made by Deputy Gilmore without referring to what is out of order.  He said that greater use of Dún Laoghaire harbour is desirable for recreational purposes.  I think he will agree with me when I say that the thrust of our activity has been in that direction since we took over on 1 January this year.</P>
    <P>I think I have answered already the Deputy's point on the interim board.  We took great care in working out the terms of reference.  I am sorry if there has been angst in Dún Laoghaire, as the Deputy indicates, because of this delay.  I would not like anybody, including the supporters of the Deputy's party or of my own, to be suffering from any undue angst in this regard.  The review group will not be ignored.  As I have already stated, the contributions made in this House and in Seanad Éireann, along with <Col N="1227" /> the recommendations of the review group and the interim board, will be taken on board and nothing will be ignored.  I am opposed to the amendment.</P>

    <P>Sections 3 to 6, inclusive, agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No.4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The terms and conditions of employment of any member of staff who is employed by the Commissioners or by the Minister at Dún Laoghaire Harbour shall not while he is in the employment of the Commissioners or of the Minister, be less favourable to him than those prevailing immediately before the transfer of control.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In any situation where the control of any employment or any body is being transferred there is understandable concern among the staff who work there about where they stand.  There is concern among the people who work in Dún Laoghaire harbour, the employees of the Office of Public Works and the Department of the Marine, first about the security of their employment and second about their conditions of employment.  It is important that in a Bill like this there should be specific provision to protect the rights and interests of the employees concerned.  Virtually everything has been covered in the Bill, property, money, contracts, legal proceedings.  No specific clause has been written into the Bill which would protect the interests of the employees.</P>
      <P>The amendment I am proposing would seek to do that.  It would be a fairly standard clause which appears in quite a lot of legislation to protect the interests of employees and make sure that there would be no worsening of their position and that their position, following the transfer of control, would be no worse than it was previously.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will accept that amendment which I feel would strengthen the Bill and allay any fears which the employees at Dún Laoghaire harbour may have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Friday week when the Bill was first mooted in the House certain suggestions were made to <Col N="1231" /> the Minister who said he would consider them.  I believe he was very sincere in his approach.  An important aspect of the Bill is how it will affect the people of Dún Laoghaire.  It is also important that the workers of Dún Laoghaire be safeguarded in any Bill that comes before the House.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that this is purely a technical Bill to enable transfer of control from one Department to another.  I emphasise the need for protection for the people who live and work in Dún Laoghaire.  I believe this amendment allays any doubts or fears they may have regarding their future.  In the event of a harbour authority being established in Dún Laoghaire, Dún Laoghaire port will go from strength to strength, and we can look forward to an increase in the workforce there, but we must alleviate the fears of people who are already there.  I have had experience on the trade union side and I know that when there is a change-over of any nature, technical or otherwise, certain fears are expressed by the workforce about how it will affect them.  Those fears should be allayed and people who have worked all their lives in Dún Laoghaire should be protected.</P>
      <P>I have no hesitation in asking the Minister to accept this amendment which copperfastens protection for the workforce. This should be in the Bill.  The last day we debated this the Minister indicated that it would not affect the workforce, but this would copperfasten it into law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate and understand the sentiments expressed by Deputy Gilmore in tabling this amendment, and he must be commended for doing so.  While on the face of it this Bill appears to be a technical one, the people on the ground see it as a major move. People who have worked for the Office of Public Works and operated in Dún Laoghaire for many years now see a new structure, management and Department taking over the running of Dún Laoghaire <Col N="1232" /> harbour.  Needless to say, that raises certain apprehensions, fears and concern about their future and how long they will remain in employment in Dún Laoghaire. With the possible change in the usage of the area and new developments of various kinds, they may be particularly apprehensive about their future and whether they could be subject to transfer within the public service to the Department of the Marine or another section of the general public service.  One must understand and appreciate these concerns.</P>
      <P>In tabling this amendment Deputy Gilmore has given the Minister an ideal opportunity to allay any fears the present employees of the Commissioners of Public Works in Dún Laoghaire may have, and to assure them that their future is secure in Dún Laoghaire, that their existing conditions of employment will be at least maintained, if not improved, under the new structures in the Department of the Marine and in future under the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Authority. When he is putting together the legislation I ask him to keep in mind the employees in Dún Laoghaire.  I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. Unfortunately, when the Second Stage of the Bill was being discussed last Friday I was in Limerick and was not able to participate in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As somebody born in Dún Laoghaire I know of many families there, fathers and sons, who have worked in the service of Dún Laoghaire harbour and they cannot, for the life of them, understand the nonsense that we are transferring responsibility for the maintenance and control of Dún Laoghaire harbour from one Department to another.  Everybody knows that what we really need and want is a harbour authority, as has been indicated in the recent past.  This is more of the nonsense bureaucracy that goes on in this country, and in the middle of it all the employees who have spent a lifetime working in the service of Dún Laoghaire harbour do not know whether they are coming or going.  The last people ever <Col N="1233" /> consulted on any of these matters are, of course, the staff.  While political decisions are taken in Cabinet rooms people forget that many families depend for their livelihood on Dún Laoghaire harbour not alone maintaining the <i>status quo</i> but availing of its potential for improvement in the future.</P>
    <P>There are rumours that the maintenance staff in Dún Laoghaire are going to be transferred to the centre of Dublin.  That is more nonsense.  Is the property owned by the Office of Public Works outside the harbour of Dún Laoghaire to be transferred?  Will the employees have to face the added expense of bus fares from and to Dún Laoghaire, plus extra hours travelling when they have to go back to Dún Laoghaire to carry out the maintenance needed throughout the harbour area?</P>
    <P>There is also the post of harbour master.  Perhaps we will have such a person in the Department of the Marine in future who will be responsible for the control and maintenance of the harbour and the staff working there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore's amendment gives us an opportunity of not alone giving an assurance to the staff who have spent many years in the service of the State working in the harbour of Dún Laoghaire but of having certain pertinent questions answered before this nonsense is completed.</P>
    <P>If the Minister and his Government have thought this out, he owes it to everybody here today when replying to Deputy Gilmore's amendment to spell out loud and clear what is going to happen to the staff, where they will be located, who will be responsible from a management point of view for the day-to-day position and what will happen to the property owned by the Office of Public Works outside the harbour which is not covered by this Bill but which was used for staff, materials and so on needed for the various maintenance jobs that have to be done in the harbour.</P>
    <P>If we have an opportunity to vote against this Bill, I hope I can persuade my colleague, Deputy Taylor-Quinn, to do so on the basis that we reject the <Col N="1234" /> bureaucracy and the nonsense that is going on here.  The Minister was out in Dún Laoghaire a few weeks ago and announced the establishment of an interim harbour authority for Dún Laoghaire, which is the first phase in setting up a full harbour authority.  Now we see the Fianna Fáil Government with their PD allies voting down a reasonable amendment suggesting that if we have to have nonsense we will have it for only a short period and that the necessary legislation will have to be brought forward to have a harbour authority in place in Dún Laoghaire.  Then this nonsense we are going through will be stopped, at least after a period of two years.</P>
    <P>For the life of me I cannot understand why we are wasting taxpayers' money on this sort of nonsense and civil servants who have far more important things to do with their time are dragged in here to spend hours on legislation being put through the House to transfer responsibility from one Department to another when the Minister is out in the constituency announcing he is going to set up a harbour authority.  Is it any wonder people are cynical about what goes on in this great old establishment when we can give no assurance to the staff, when we have no concept of what the future management structures are going to be and what is to happen to these staff?  Are they to be shunted into the centre of Dublin with, as I said, the added expense of travelling in and out on buses or the DART or whatever means of transport they want to use?  This would involve the loss of working hours, coming back again, during the course of their working day to carry out the work they are doing there at present.  Nobody would believe that we could be so stupid as to do what we are doing here.</P>
    <P>A Cabinet decision was taken about three or three-and-a-half years ago to set up a harbour authority for Dún Laoghaire.  It has been denied in this Chamber on occasions, but I know that a Cabinet decision was taken and that the Department were instructed to proceed with the preparation of legislation for the setting up of a harbour authority.  I heard <Col N="1235" /> the Minister of State, about 18 months ago, deny flatly in the House that this ever took place.  I was present when it took place.  I was also present when the then Taoiseach arrived at the Dún Laoghaire Chamber of Commerce, on the same evening that that Cabinet meeting was held, to announce formally the decision to set up a harbour authority. Two-and-a-half or three years later the only piece of legislation we have got is the transfer of responsibility of Dún Laoghaire harbour from the Office of Public Works&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Minister wants to go out to Dún Laoghaire and play politics and give commitments that he will announce interim harbour authorities and then we do not hear anything about them, well then that is his business.

When I say things the Minister does not like to hear that is his problem, but he will not shout me down.  If the Minister is serious in any way about this whole piece of nonsense at least, to show his goodwill towards the staff, he could accept this amendment in the name of Deputy Gilmore.  When replying to the amendment I hope he will give us the type of information I sought in relation to the future of the staff, the management structures and the location of the staff. Perhaps he might also avail of the opportunity to let us know the names of the interim harbour authority before we complete this piece of nonsense.  He might then get some good out of the whole debate.</P>

      <P>I would like to say that I support the amendment put down by Deputy Gilmore.  I will not take up the time of the House because the three Deputies who have spoken have adequately dealt with the staff position which, of course, is very serious.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this very reasonable amendment.  Apart from anything else, it should act as a reassurance to the staff that this is specifically built into this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to say, as a former practising trade unionist, that I regard Deputy Gilmore's concern for the security and conditions of work at Dún Laoghaire as a legitimate concern. Under the present regime no concern has been expressed to my Department with regard to our arrangements.  I agree with Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan who spoke in much the same terms about the importance of the workers and his concern for fears that workers may have regarding the transfer.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn in measured&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy who?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, Deputy Taylor-Quinn in a measured and concerned way said there was a certain apprehension <Col N="1237" /> about the work and working conditions of the staff.  The objective of the Bill is to prepare the way for a development of the harbour in such a way that there will be more workers, more employment and more development in the harbour than there has been for some time.  I am surprised that Deputy Barrett came in here, obviously trying to make up for missing the Second Stage of the Bill, to talk about the nonsense we are going through.  He is not very closely in touch with Dún Laoghaire harbour in his own constituency if he does not know already that since 1 January of this year there has been considerable development under the new non-statutory arrangement whereby my Department have charge of the harbour. If we were aware of what was happening in his own constituency he would know that the people, including the public representatives of all parties in the area, have welcomed the new energy that is being injected into the activities in Dún Laoghaire.  In relation to livelihoods, I have already made the point that we want to develop the harbour in such a way that there will be more work available in the area and our staff in Dún Laoghaire are not being transferred anywhere.  I do not know where he got that idea.  He must have been reading some fairytales because no such transfer is envisaged.</P>
      <P>He kept talking about &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo;.  He was totally inaccurate in that I did not go out to Dún Laoghaire and announce the formation of an interim harbour authority. If the Deputy had been <i>au fait</i> with what was going on in his constituency he would know that a representative deputation from Dún Laoghaire, which included an intelligent and articulate member of his own political party, met me and it was at that meeting that this was promised.</P>
      <P>Regarding the actual amendment, I took very great care with section 7 and consulted legally.  I have been advised that the new subsection proposed by the Deputy is adequately covered by section 7 of the Bill.  It is important that we should take a little care when reading section 7 which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1238" /> Every bond, guarantee or other security of a continuing nature made or given by or on behalf of the Commissioners to any person in the performance of a function transferred by section 3 of this Act, or by any person to the Commissioners and accepted by or on behalf of the Commissioners in the performance of such a function, and in force immediately before the appointed day, and every contract&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;it was in relation to those words that I asked for legal advice.  I am informed that that includes workers contracts&mdash;</P>
    <P>or agreement in writing made between the Commissioners in the performance of such a function and another person and in force but not fully executed and completed immediately before the appointed day, shall continue in force on and after the appointed day and shall be construed and have effect as if the name of the Minister were substituted therein for that of the Commissioners and such security, contract or agreement shall be enforceable by or against the Minister.</P>
    <P>All the industrial staff who became employees of my Department on 1 January 1989 and are employed under contract were written to in November 1988 and informed that they retain their basic conditions of employment, such as rates of pay, entitlement to sick pay and superannuation benefits.  They have also been informed that their employment in the Department of the Marine is, as was the case in the Office of Public Works, subject to the terms and conditions negotiated on their behalf by the National Joint Industrial Council for State Industrial Employees.  The unions representing the industrial staff have also been given this information.</P>
    <P>I have taken on board the concern of Deputies for the workers in Dún Laoghaire.  I have indicated that there is no proposal to transfer them anywhere and that their work contracts etc. are valid and hold for them now as they did when they came under the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <Col N="1239" />
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister took Deputy Seán Barrett to task over some of the things he said.  I agree by and large with what Deputy Barrett has said. During the Second Stage debate I said something similar when I said it was a waste of parliamentary time debating a Bill to give statutory effect to something which is already in place when what is really needed is the establishment of a harbour authority and the implementation of the more acceptable recommendations of the planning review group.</P>
      <P>Regarding this amendment, I do not agree that section 7 covers adequately the protection of the employment of workers at Dún Laoghaire harbour or their conditions of employment.  One of the few things I share with the Minister is that I, too, am a former practising trade unionist, although I suspect that the circumstances of my departure from practising as a trade union official and the Minister's departure may have been somewhat different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not paid either.  At least the Minister got a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; when he was going; I did not.  There is a difference between stating in a general way that contracts are protected and providing specific protection.  If we carried the Minister's logic to its conclusion we would leave the Bill as section 7 and argue that it covers every other eventuality. Why is it claimed that section 7 automatically covers the rights of workers but not necessarily the questions of money or property, which are provided for in section 2?  Neither do I accept that a letter or an agreement, as the Minister describes it, is as strong as building into legislation the statutory protection of employees which I am seeking.  In any situation where there is a change of ownership, a new employer, some kind of amalgamation or merger and a shift in the employment of staff, it is essential that the employees be protected.  The kind of letter the Minister has spoken about could, if circumstances changed, be altered.  It does not substitute for <Col N="1240" /> building into the Bill the provision I am seeking.</P>
      <P>The amendment I have tabled is a direct lift from other legislation passed by this House which protects the right of employees in State organisations.  I do not believe that the workers at Dún Laoghaire harbour should enjoy any less protection than other employees in a State organisation which has had some kind of change approved by this House. I am very disappointed that the Minister has not agreed to accept the amendment or at least given an undertaking to introduce a similar amendment on report Stage.  That being the case, I will want to put this amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Gilmore in his amendment.  It is rather unfortunate that the only reply the Minister could give to the points I made in the debate was to engage in a personal attack on me and my so-called lack of knowledge of the Dún Laoghaire constituency. I will leave that to people to judge.  I have spent 45 years of my life in Dún Laoghaire and I do not need a Cavan man to tell me what is going on in Dún Laoghaire every day of the week.</P>

      <P>Yes, the Minister did. The staff in Dún Laoghaire are confused. If a worker who has been employed in Dún Laoghaire for 30 or 40 years by the <Col N="1241" /> Office of Public Works hears that the Government of the day have got a grandiose notion of transferring responsibility for the Office of Public Works to the Department of the Marine, that worker will be wondering what is to happen to him.  Then he hears the same Minister announce the setting up of an interim harbour authority as the first step to the setting up of a harbour authority.  He further scratches his head and is at this point about to pull his hair out, worrying what his position will be under the harbour authority.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore's amendment and the points I am making are vitally important from the point of view of the ordinary staff who have been working for years in Dún Laoghaire.  The Minister should consider the valid points being made on this side of the House and not become so edgy about defending a secret deputation he met.  He certainly did not give any notice to me as a Deputy from the constituency that such a deputation was coming to meet him to discuss an interim harbour authority.</P>

      <P>I learnt of it when the Fianna Fáil Cathaoirleach of Dún Laoghaire Corporation went on radio and announced that the Minister had been in the constituency and that she had walked around the harbour with him.  She said he gave her a personal guarantee that within a week the names of the members of the harbour authority would be issued.  If the Minister wants to attack me on a personal level I can give back as much as I have to take.  This is a political ploy.  Employees of Dún Laoghaire harbour, some of whose grandfathers spent their lives there, are pawns in this game. I support Deputy Gilmore, as I hope every representative of this constituency will do.  We must see to it that these unfortunate employees are not used as pawns and that when the Minister gets another political idea we will not have another secret meeting which leaves the workers wondering what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1242" /> I know what is happening in my constituency because I was present in the maintenance yard of the Office of Public Works which is staffed by employees whose main job is to service Dún Laoghaire harbour.  The staff in the maintenance yard were told they were being moved into town; I did not dream that notion.  If the Minister says that there was never any intention of moving staff from Dún Laoghaire I invite him to come with me to talk to those who told me they had been notified they were being moved into town.  The Minister could also check his files and he will find correspondence from me in which I made appropriate inquiries on behalf of the staff, asking why they were being moved into town.</P>
    <P>I stand over every single word I said and if I want to raise a point on these issues on any day of the week I will do so and if I have to go to Limerick to deal with other business as spokesman for Industry and Commerce I will do so without a lecture from anybody.  It is just unfortunate that the business was ordered for the day I had the appointment in Limerick.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he had issued a letter to the staff in Dún Laoghaire giving all sorts of assurances.  However, the Minister did not have the right to issue a letter of that sort to the staff in Dún Laoghaire because, until this Bill is passed, the Department of the Marine have no legal power to issue such a letter to the staff giving them assurances because they have nothing to do with Dún Laoghaire harbour. What validity does the Minister's letter have?  At present, the legal statutory power for Dún Laoghaire harbour is vested in the Office of Public Works and will be until the Bill goes through the Houses of the Oireachtas, is signed by the President and becomes law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore's amendment is very important and I congratulate him for tabling it.  The Department of the Marine have no function other than an agency function which may have been supplied by the Office of Public Works pending the passing of this legislation, but they have no legal power to give any guarantees to anyone.  I do not see how this <Col N="1243" /> legislation can be affected by the letter. I do not foresee any massive difficulties arising if this amendment is accepted.</P>
    <P>It is stated in the amendment that the terms and conditions of employment of any member of staff employed by the commissioners or by the Minister at Dún Laoghaire harbour shall not, while he is in the employment of the commissioners or of the Minister, be less favourable to him than those prevailing immediately before the transfer of control.  How does that in any way affect this legislation apart from giving a proper guarantee to the staff that the Minister is so anxious to satisfy?  If the amendment is not accepted it is clear that we are seeing more of the old fashioned, dogmatic approach of the Fianna Fáil Government prior to 1982 and which was not so apparent in the period between 1987-89.  At that time I was Opposition spokesman on Justice and the then Minister, Deputy Collins did not shoot down a reasonably good idea because it was not his, he gave me the opportunity of considering it for Report Stage.  On a number of occasions he accepted proper amendments and this also is a proper amendment.</P>
    <P>The lives of people and their families are at stake and when they hear all this talk about the transfer of responsibility and a new harbour authority they are rightly concerned because they have given their lives to this place.  The minimum we can do is to accept Deputy Gilmore's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister indicated he would not be accepting the amendment because section 7 adequately covers the provisions made for staff.  I am sure the Minister is aware that normally when there is a takeover of a group trade unions make sure that adequate protection is provided for their members.  In passing the Bill it is incumbent on Members to ensure that there is protection for the employees at Dún Laoghaire harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about the protection of jobs; unemployment is rampant, there are serious cutbacks in various areas and <Col N="1244" /> people are genuinely fearful that their jobs could be at risk in the future.  I accept the point that changing times bring changing practices for employees, and trade unions are quite capable of covering that aspect.  However, all public representative have a responsibility to copperfasten the provisions in the Bill to protect the employees.  I will not refer to personalities because we are debating the future of people's employment at Dún Laoghaire harbour.  It is not a time to make personal attacks on anyone but it is very important to make our points clearly.  The Minister said that there was protection in the Bill but, if he is so sure of that, he should not be afraid of the amendment.  If he accepted it on Report Stage it would be a good day's work.  To a certain extent, Deputy Gilmore's fears are justified and we are trying to allay them.  I again ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Gilmore's amendment.  I was very disappointed with the Minister's reaction to it.  While he has given an assurance to the House that he had this matter closely examined by legal advisers and that he is happy in relation to the position of the workforce at Dún Laoghaire harbour, I am not convinced by his arguments.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his attitude to this amendment and if he is not prepared to accept it now he should at least consider it for Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;employees&rdquo; is not mentioned once in the Bill.  It is strictly a bureaucratic Bill dealing with the transfer of powers, jurisdiction and functions of one Minister to another.  The position of employees is not dealt with and, therefore, Deputy Gilmore must be commended for tabling this amendment.  As my colleague Deputy Barrett pointed out, the position in relation to the Minister for the Marine in any negotiations with the employees is literally a casual discussion, rather than one that has a legal bond.  The simple reason is that the Department of the Marine &mdash; until this Bill has been passed by both Houses &mdash; are unable to act legally in consultation <Col N="1245" /> with employees.  Any discussions that have taken place or any letters exchanged between the Department and employees would not be legally binding if subsequently tested in the courts.  That is the reality of the position obtaining.  While there may be goodwill on the part of the Minister, there is no strict, legal binding on any communications between the Minister and employees prior to the Bill being passed.</P>
    <P>Section 7 needs the extra reinforcement incorporated in Deputy Gilmore's amendment.  The Minister would be unwise to ignore its contents since they have merely been lifted from other legislation passed in regard to other transfers from one Government Department to another.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Minister should be reluctant to accept the amendment. The reasons the Minister has advanced are not sufficiently sound and do not convince me that the future of the employees of Dún Laoghaire harbour will be vested there.  I have no doubt but that their future will be secure within the entirely of the public service but that is entirely different.  For people who, throughout the entirety of their working life, have lived and worked in Dún Laoghaire, being brought within the ambit of the overall public service constitutes quite a different ball game.  It would appear that is what the Minister has in mind but he has not said so clearly in the House this morning.  That is something needing clarification.  We want to be assured in no uncertain terms that these people will continue to be employed in Dún Laoghaire.  There is nothing in this Bill to give us such assurance and indeed what the Minister has said in the House this morning would suggest quite the contrary.  I am afraid, from what the Minister has said already they will form part of the public service but that their future within Dún Laoghaire harbour will not be secure.</P>
    <P>For that reason I full support Deputy Gilmore's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Seán <Col N="1246" /> Barrett should construe as a personal attack on him any remarks I made.  There was no such intention on my part.  We were having what I considered to be a rational debate on Committee Stage until Deputy Seán Barrett introduced strident notes, calling the whole Bill a nonsense&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;saying that his heart bled for the workers.  He then accused me of having some kind of secret meeting with representatives of Dún Laoghaire Borough Council.  That amazes me because Dún Laoghaire Borough Council requested at an open, public meeting that I should meet them.  The deputation was chosen publicly at a meeting of Dún Laoghaire Borough Council.  Deputy Seán Barrett says I met in some kind of secret hole or corner place with these people.  I can tell Deputy Seán Barrett that on that deputation was a very articulate, intelligent and positive member of his party, councillor Aine Elliott.  I reject the suggestion that I was meeting secretly any deputation from Dún Laoghaire.  If Deputy Seán Barrett wants to confirm what I am saying here he can consult his own party councillor, Aine Elliott, on Dún Laoghaire Borough Council.</P>
      <P>I want to reiterate that the staff with whom we are dealing in this Bill, now coming into Roinn na Mara, are not being transferred into town.  I want to put that clearly on the record no matter what other interpretation is put on it.</P>
      <P>With regard to what Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan had to say, if I thought there was even the slightest possibility of an employee's position being endangered I would accept this amendment.  My contention &mdash; one based on due and careful consideration and on legal advice &mdash; is that section 7 adequately covers the position. I would accept the amendment if I thought there was even a scintilla of evidence that the position of the employees could be endangered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor-Quinn said that, in the circumstances, she was not convinced of the value of section 7. I want to reiterate <Col N="1247" /> that the employees have not expressed any concern to Roinn na Mara.  However, as Deputy Taylor-Quinn said, it is true, that as of now, there is no statutory base for what is happening.  Indeed, in regard to the positive things already happening in Dún Laoghaire there is no statutory base.  It is to give a statutory base to what is happening that this Bill is being taken through these House, a Bill which, incidentally, <Col N="1248" /> Deputy Seán Barrett said was a nonsense.  Deputy Taylor-Quinn quite rightly knows that there is substance in the Bill.  It is a technical Bill but one which gives statutory authority to the transfer.  Deputy Taylor-Quinn used the word &ldquo;reinforcement&rdquo;.  By its use she is inferring that section 7 does indicate that contracts, including contracts of work and so on, are adequately safeguarded by the provisions of the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with tolls, rates, dues and other charges.  I should like the Minister to give an indication of the type of charges he has in mind and the income the Office of Public Works have received from Dún Laoghaire harbour.  What amount of money does the Minister anticipate his Department will receive from the harbour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The section simply seeks to transfer to the Department powers in respect of tolls, rates, dues and other charges given by section 7 of the 1924 Act or my any other enactment.  It simply is giving to the Minister for the Marine powers that resided in the Commissioners of Public Works.  The tolls, rates and dues are, of course, variable and, as the House will know, a great deal of the revenue for Dún Laoghaire comes from the ferry.  In fact a very substantial percentage of the total revenue comes from the ferry service. The powers given in the 1924 Act are to be transferred to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say how it came about that his Department increased the charges to small boat owners, particularly those who use the inner harbour area?  I am referring to people who have been associated with Dún Laoghaire harbour for years and who operate out of the harbour with their small boats.  There are not many people involved but they were using the only facility available to those who are not members of the local yacht clubs.  Will the Minister explain how his Department had the authority to increase the charges for those boat owners before the Bill was passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas? Will the Minister give us an assurance that the charges will be reduced for those who are on low incomes and cannot afford to pay them?  There is no doubt that the big increase in the charges will mean that people on low income will be forced out of the harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like an assurance from the Minister that this section will not be used to increase those charges.  There is a fear <Col N="1251" /> locally that those who use the harbour facilities, and who cannot afford membership of the local yacht clubs, will be squeezed out.  It must be remembered that we are talking about the location selected for the controversial marina proposal that I and the general public in Dún Laoghaire vigorously opposed when it was mooted in early 1988.  People are concerned that an attempt is being made to hype up the charges on the boat owners who use that part of the harbour so that they will eventually be squeezed out.  If that happens that part of the harbour will be handed over for marina development, as was originally intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mr. Taylor-Quinn Mr. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is specific and the Minister, in response to questions by Deputy Barrett, merely quoted the wording of it.  Will the Minister give details of the Department's policy in relation to the powers now being vested in him under section 8?  The Department must have some idea of the revenue they will raise in tolls, rates, dues and other charges and what they propose using the money for.  Is the Minister in a position to tell us the amount of money raised by the Office of Public Works in the last financial year?  Were they in a position to cover all expenses involved in the management of the harbour from the revenue they received or did the State incur any expenditure?  Will it be the policy of the Department to operate in a similar fashion?  Will it be their intention to increase the charges at Dún Laoghaire and to use the revenue for developmenT purposes?  Have they any idea of the revenue they require and the use they intend to put that revenue to?</P>
      <P>Those who use the harbour should be made aware of the tolls, rates, dues and other charges that are likely to be imposed by the Minister and what use he will make of the revenue.  He should tell us if he is likely to increase existing charges and from what date.  The Minister should explain why his Department have increased the charges, as referred to by Deputy Gilmore, when they are not legally entitled to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a further one or two points.  At present the people of Dún Laoghaire and the traders do not know the basis of the charges.  The issue was last debated in 1924 and 65 years later no one knows why £X is charged for a service, the basis for the charge and the policy of the Department of the Marine.  We do not know what the policy of the Department of the Marine is on cargo coming into Dún Laoghaire harbour, the granting of authority to certain individuals to bring in cargo ships to Dún Laoghaire, the maintenance of the East and, in particular the West, piers. I am sure the Minister is aware of the condition of the West pier, which is nothing short of scandalous and is dangerous for old people.  Will the revenue generated by the increased charges be used for the proper maintenance of the piers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat what I said earlier &mdash; and to which the Minister took grave exception &mdash; this is nonsense legislation.  The planning review group went to a great deal of trouble outlining the potential of Dún Laoghaire harbour, but like many reports, it is gathering dust.  The benefit in having a harbour authority with local representation be they the members of Dún Laoghaire Corporation who are elected by the local people, or representatives of the people who use the harbour is that more information would be available to the general public on the Department's policy.  We had no way of finding out who decided what with regard to income and expenditure when the harbour was under the control of the Office of Public Works, and that information is still not available now the Department of <Col N="1253" /> the Marine have responsibility.  Before agreeing to the section, we are entitled to know the basis for the charges, and the use to which this money will be put.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore asked what will happen to the individual who brings his boat to the harbour and sails around it. Will he be faced with increased charges? The section provides that the Minister will have power to determine charges, so perhaps the Minister would outline the present level of charges, the basis for these charges, the policy of expenditure on the harbour and whether it is intended to make a profit.  Is it envisaged that the income will be greater than expenditure on maintenance?</P>
    <P>The average person thinks Dún Laoghaire Corporation are responsible for the appalling condition of the West Pier.  People are inclined to contact Deputies and councillors &mdash; I am sure they have been in touch with Deputy Gilmore, Deputy Hillery, Deputy Andrews and Deputy Barnes &mdash; and ask what they are doing about the West Pier, but we have no answers.  If we make inquiries, we can be told it is none of our business as we have no say in the collection or spending of the money. However, we have an opportunity before we pass this section to decide whether we want to transfer power willy nilly without knowing the consequences of transferring those powers.  This would not happen if we had a harbour authority because we would have representatives on the harbour authority and we would get regular reports.  We would know their future plans and how the proposals would affect existing amenities.  It would be open for everybody to see.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is not as silly as one might think.  The effects of the Bill are not merely to transfer powers from the Office of Public Works to the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has the slightest intention of setting up a harbour authority because that would be giving away power.  People do not like giving away power.  I think the setting up of an interim harbour authority is a sop. The Minister is a highly intelligent man. <Col N="1254" /> A highly intelligent man would not come into this House and try to persuade 166 Deputies that it is logical to transfer responsibility from one Department to another if he intended setting up a harbour authority within 18 months to two years.  I may be wrong, but this section gives us the opportunity to find out if this is a money making exercise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will respond to a number of points raised by Deputies.  Deputy Gilmore raised the point that there was not statutory authority for charges already being made.  I want to tell the House that everything we have been doing since I January 1989 was as agents of the Commissioners of Public Works, and that is the legal basis upon which we have been proceeding.</P>

    <P>Deputy Gilmore also asked about boats for recreational purposes.  I do not <Col N="1255" /> think anybody who has looked at the actual charges would regard them as exorbitant and out of the reach of somebody who has a boat for recreational purposes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor-Quinn asked what the revenue is used for and one of the most important charges on the revenue is to pay the staff.  We spent quite a while debating section 7, which copperfastens the rights of the employees.  Probably the most important thing for an employee is the wherewithal to pay wages and salaries. That is the most substantial charge on the revenue generated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett rightly says that Dún Laoghaire Borough Council are not responsible for the condition of the piers. It is not fair for any citizen to accuse them of neglect.  I have been to Dún Laoghaire and I agree that a great deal of development has to take place.  I want the House to accept that the thrust of the legislation, although a technical Bill, is to prepare the way for the type of development which was adumbrated by Deputy Barrett in his contribution.</P>

As the Taoiseach is also aware, there is the entire facade of the old Abbey Theatre lying in a backyard in Dalkey awaiting some attention.  In view of this and the fact that Dublin will be the Cultural Capital of Europe in 1991, would the Taoiseach not consider funding this archive so that we would have an official Irish Theatre Archive in full blossom by 1991 instead of having it based in temporary headquarters as at present?</P>

      <P>We accept this magnificent building and we give credit where credit is due for whatever help was given by the Taoiseach in his various capacities. But after all, the areas designated for the gallery are really a collection of very small rooms &mdash; the soldiers' bedrooms. Would the Taoiseach not agree that for presentation purposes and security purposes and because of the location of the Royal Hospital, away from the centre of activities and the possibility of getting casual visitors, it should be designated only as a temporary location for the Gallery of Modern Art and that a more suitable and central location should be sought for the permanent location?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not agree. I rely on the advisory committee who advised that it was a suitable location. The complaint that the Deputy has that it consists of a number of small rooms is not very valid.  That is not quite true, but in any event, I understand that there is now a tendency in modern galleries to have a collection of smaller spaces rather than one huge space, so from that point of view it is entirely appropriate as a gallery of modern art.  On the advisory body that I established there are a number of people competent to make decisions about whatever adaptations need to be made.  There are architects and artistic people on the body who can look at that aspect.  My general advice is that it is entirely in keeping with the modern development of that type of gallery. As to its geographical location, it is quite suitable because in this area of the <Col N="1266" /> city we have the National Gallery and we now have the Gallagher Gallery and the Municipal Gallery in Parnell Square and there will be a new cultural centre of the Custom House Docks site.  With the addition of a modern art gallery in Kilmainham there will be a nice circuit of galleries around the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that there will be one board for the entire complex in Kilmainham when the period of the present board expires.  That is the only reasonable way in which activities can be conducted there on a satisfactory basis.  Will that board have a statutory base with the independence and the rights that the National Gallery have and will they get permanent funding as distinct from the lottery funding, however great that might be, because that is an unsatisfactory way in which to fund a permanent structure such as the National Gallery of Modern Art?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the initial stages, it will be funded by the national lottery because that is the way in which we can give it access to reasonably substantial funds.  In the initial stages I suppose the funds will be devoted to acquisitions so that a central core of works can be built up.  Thereafter, I suppose we can consider funding it directly from the Exchequer. The same would apply to giving the company a statutory basis.  The company an at present incorporated under the Companies Acts and that has worked satisfactorily. We should see how that system works with regard to the new gallery.  If there is a need then to put it on a statutory basis that can be considered.  For the time being, the company system is working well with regard to the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, generally.  They have a very considerable programme of events and run it satisfactorily.  I am, not inclined to make any changes at present.  I would like to have the present company get the new gallery under way, appoint a curatory and see how things go and, if necessary we can look at it again in a few years time.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence the reason for the delay in bringing forward the commission's report in relation to pay and conditions in the Defence Forces having regard to the fact that the commission was set up some considerable time ago and also having regard to the fact that the problem has existed for some time and that the facts and concerns and representations by the Defence Forces were made a long time ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 12, 14, 22, 49, 58 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>In July last the Government established an independent commission under the chairmanship of Mr. Dermot Gleeson, S.C., with the following terms of reference:</P>
      <P>To carry out a major review of the remuneration and conditions of service of the Defence Forces having regard to their separate and distinct role and organisation and to make recommendations.</P>
      <P>The Government, after consultation with the Chief of Staff, requested him to appoint three teams &mdash; one each for Privates, Non-Commissioned Officer's and Officers &mdash; which would have responsibility to prepare and present the case on behalf of their particular group.  The composition of the teams was as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> (a) for Privates: Six members of the rank of Private or equivalent; (b) for NCO's: Six Non-Commissioned Officers of the ranks of Warrant Officer, SergeantMajor, Flight-Sergeant, Company-Sergeant (2) and Staff Quartermaster-Sergeant; and (c) for Officers: Six Officers of Commandant rank.</P>
    <P>Each of the three teams includes a representative from each of the four Commands, one from the Air Corps and one from the Naval Service.  The representatives on each team were nominated by the members of the ranks represented by that particular team.</P>
    <P>In the case of each team three Officers were appointed by the Chief of Staff to assist in the preparation of its submission.</P>
    <P>In August last the commission placed advertisements in a number of newspapers inviting interested persons and organisations to make submissions to it not later than 30 September 1989.  There was no restriction as to who might make a submission.  Subsequently the commission at the request of the three military teams agreed to extend the deadline for the receipt of their submissions to 15 November 1989 to ensure that the most comprehensive case would be prepared. I understand that the teams' submissions were, in fact, presented to the commission on that date.  The task assigned to the commission is an extensive and complex one.  In the circumstances the question of delay does not arise.</P>
    <P>A firm of management consultants was engaged to provide assistance to the three military teams in preparing their submissions.</P>
    <P>I understand that the commission has decided not to issue an interim report and to concentrate instead on producing a comprehensive report at the conclusion of its deliberations.  It will be a matter for the Government to consider the commission's recommendations when they are made.  The question of an interim payment, as such, does not arise but the various increases in pay and allowances which were awarded in December 1988 arising from the report of the interdepartmental committee on pay and allowances for the Defence Forces, are <Col N="1273" /> being implemented on schedule together with the further increases relating to the final phase of the public service pay agreement.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that the new commission is an entirely independent body and that my Department's only role in regard to it is one of facilitating the commission on request.  In that connection arrangements have been made over the last few months for visits by members of the commission to a number of military barracks, posts and installations.  I have no function as regards the manner in which the commission may decide to conduct their business.  They are completely independent within their terms of reference.</P>

      <P>As this is the first occasion on which we have the opportunity of hearing from the Tánaiste in his role as Minister for Defence I welcome him.  I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well.</P>
      <P>Having said that I have to say that, in view of the long deliberations that will, of necessity, be undertaken by the review commission, I am disappointed that the Minister can not see his way to considering the gesture of goodwill suggested. Would he not consider that it would be a well received gesture in view of the disciplined restraint by members of the Defence Forces as they await the outcome and the recommendations of the review body to make an interim payment to them in the lead up to the Christmas period particularly in regard to the universal view in this House that standards of pay within the Defence Forces are not as they should be?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that we have now got this matter moving on constructive lines.  We hope to establish a permanent basis on which pay and conditions within our national Army can be guaranteed into the future. <Col N="1274" /> It is important that we await the commission's final recommendations on a very complex and wide ranging area before we come to a firm decision as to how we implement their recommendations. Any interference with what they are pursuing at the moment in a very complex area would be premature and might do harm.  I appreciate what the Deputy has said about the discipline and restraint being exercised by the members of the Defence Forces.  I am sure that they will continue to exercise that discipline and restraint.  They have had absolute freedom of access to this commission and they appreciate that.  I feel very strongly that we should leave it at that.</P>

      <P>I would like to join with Deputy McCartan in congratulating the Minister for Defence on his first occasion here for Question Time and wishing him every success.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether he can confirm reports, which seem to be backed up by his own information there, that it is likely now to be June or July of next year before the commission report?  Could he also confirm that in the meantime there is no inhibition on his giving whatever he likes, by way of bonus, to the various Army personnel? In view of the moral obligation that all the Members of the House feel towards our Army personnel, would the Minister not now consider making some bonus payment over the Christmas period at least?  That would have the support of everybody in this House.  I have no doubt that the Minister himself would like to do so.  Could he confirm then that there is no inhibition on him in this respect and that it is purely a decision for the Government?</P>

      <P>A lot of effort has been put into this and representations have been made over a long period to get this independent body established.  That is the important aspect, both from the point of view of the military personnel and their families, and the nation as a whole.  Now that we have this independent body in place it is important that they should look <Col N="1275" /> into this matter in all its aspects.  In fact the postponement of the date for receipt of their conclusions largely arises out of the representations being made to them by the interested parties on behalf of the different sectors of the Defence Forces who want this matter looked into in great detail and not settled overnight in a facile fashion.  I appreciate the motivation behind the Deputy's suggestion which is an excellent one but I feel it is better that the matter be settled once and for all on a solid basis rather than making <i>ad hoc</i> decisions now while the work of examination, investigation and consultation is proceeding with the representatives at the various sectors of the Defence Forces.</P>

They will arbitrate, investigate, examine, consider, consult, decide and make recommendations on a whole range of issues relating to the vexed question of pay and conditions in our Defence Forces, and we will come to finality by way of Government decision following their recommendations.  I am proceeding along that path which I regard as the best and most constructive path, and that was so approved in public statements issued by members of the opposing parties after I announced the establishment of this commission last July.</P>

All political parties agree on the importance of our national Army in the whole structure of our State.  I believe we should proceed as we are proceeding and have this matter concluded properly at the end of the day rather than interfering in any <i>ad hoc</i> manner that may push expectations in a certain direction and may be perceived in the wrong way. The commission are there and I propose to leave the position precisely as I have stated.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 16, 24 and 40 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year I instructed the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces to make preparations for the establishment of a new structure in the Defence Forces for ongoing consultations and information on remuneration and related matters and for this purpose to examine the structures <Col N="1279" /> in use in the defence forces of other European countries.  In recent months a number of non-commissioned officers and privates of the Permanent Defence Force submitted individual notifications indicating that they are contemplating the formation of a representative association.</P>
    <P>These matters, which are very complex and have implications for command and discipline, require careful consideration before a decision is taken.  The necessary studies have been in progress in consultation with the various authorities concerned and are being pressed ahead as quickly as possible.  The military authorities have been in touch with their counterparts in a number of countries and have sent small teams to visit Britain and Denmark.  Visits to a number of other countries are being arranged for the near future.</P>
    <P>The three military teams which were recently engaged on the preparation of submissions to the independent Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces, are being consulted on the question of the proposed new structures.</P>
    <P>All matters affecting the administration of the Defence Forces are enshrined in the Defence Force Regulations made under the Defence Act, 1954 and whatever structure emerges from the current studies will also be provided for in regulations.  The development now in contemplation would represent a major policy change for the Defence Forces and therefore requires the most careful analysis, which is being done.</P>
    <P>The whole matter is being thoroughly examined and will be brought to a conclusion with all due expedition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the newly formed Army representative association have taken considerable legal advice and that legal advice is that they are entirely legal and in breach of no laws nor of the Constitution?  Is the Minister's <Col N="1280" /> advice that the newly established association are legal and is he going to grant them recognition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, this whole matter is being examined internally by the Chief of Staff and I have outlined the sort of investigations that are taking place.  This is all happening now and discussions will be taking place in the weeks and immediate month or so ahead.  There will be consultations between the three teams concerned, between the representatives of the three sectors in the Defence Forces and between the Army and my Department.  It may require specific regulation to cater precisely for what is envisaged. There is a great deal to be teased out here as to the function.  In principle I am agreeable to a structure of this kind, a representative group structure being established through which representations can be channelled and where the members of the Permanent Defence Forces can meet and organise and decide on what avenues they wish to pursue under what headings.  All this has to be teased out and that is happening currently. It is a question of bringing all that together, and my task will be to encourage that over the next number of weeks.</P>

      <P>If the Minister looks at the question in the name of Deputy Mac Giolla he will see that the question asks what is the estimated cost of such an acquisition and the purposes for which it will be used.

      <P>I join other Members in wishing the Minister well in his new portfolio. I assure him of our full support and I am relieved that at last we are able to get some positive answers to questions about the Defence Forces.  I thank the Minister for that.  I welcome the new recruitment policy which will provide a better opportunity for planning the structure of the Defence Forces.  Will the Minister ensure maximum recruitment in the Border <Col N="1291" /> areas to the 27th, 28th and 29th Battalions who have to carry the main brunt of security duties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In all probability that will be the case.  I appreciate that they carry the major brunt, which is the cross-Border security effort.  It is carried largely by the recruits from the area mentioned by the Deputy.  I am certain the Army authorities are aware of it but I will bring it to their attention again.</P>

      <P>Wastage is a variable factor.  There was a period when personnel were leaving, but the position now seems to have stabilised.  There is the normal age wastage but I presume the Deputy is referring to other wastage.  It appears to have stabilised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">

      <P>We are maintaining the level of strength, which is the same last year as this year, give or take a couple of hundred.  We have maintained stability <Col N="1292" /> but we hope to increase numbers next year.  If the trend towards diminution in wastage which has been showing in the latter part of this year is maintained we should be into a plus situation in 1990 after this recruitment.</P>

      <P>I welcome moves in this regard.  If I omitted to say it earlier, I welcome the Minister in his new portfolio and wish him well.  While we welcome the report, it will not deal with the problem. Soldiers are having to work up to 80 hours a week due to under-staffing.  The Minister's proposal will not come near to resolving those difficulties.  The family life of soldiers is being affected because of under-staffing.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the change of policy in regard to women.  Does the Minister intend building into the intake of recruits any policy of positive discrimination in favour of areas of unemployment, recognising this as a major step forward in offering jobs in the Defence Forces?  Has the Minister any policy of ensuring discrimination in favour of areas of unemployment, particularly in urban Dublin?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The urban area of Dublin will be a major recruitment area anyway. The Deputy is aware of that.  Military criteria will be the primary consideration. Capacity for a soldier's way of life will be the important aspect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to congratulate the Minister, coming from Longford-Westmeath which I am sure is a constituency dear to his heart.  The recently published Book of Estimates shows a 12 per cent increase for salaries of military personnel.  Does the Minister envisage a Supplementary Estimate to pay for the 1,000 recruits or is it intended that they should be covered in the Estimate already published?  If so, how will he facilitate any rise in salary as a result of the report of the commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any rise in salary that may be consequent on the commission's report is a matter for the future.  The recruitment is covered in the current Book of Estimates.  That decision is part of a budgetary programme.  As regards whatever the Commission may recommend, sin ceist eile.</P>

      <P>It is intended that 100 recruits will be enlisted in the Naval Service early in 1990 as part of the recently announced intake of recruits for the Permanent Defence Force.

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have enough people, and we will be recruiting 40 of the 100 personnel required as early as next January for many of the purposes envisaged by the Deputy.  A further 60 recruits will enlist in March 1990.  This will be a great opportunity to recruit people with hi-tech skills that can be developed further in the very advanced marine technological facilities on these boats.  Indeed, they are the best in the world and the Deputy is right to emphasise that aspect.</P>

      <P>The question of further closures of posts is the subject of examination in my Department.  It has been decided to dispose of Collins Barracks, Dublin, but its closure will depend on the relocation of the military units at present located there.</P>

However, I do not want to have military personnel spread over too many barracks, leading to much higher overheads and maintenance which is wasteful of military personnel. We should aim towards a more mobile Army, Navy and Air Corps and supply them with the best modern equipment. In the Estimate for next year there is a substantial extra amount provided for transport.  It is more important to put money into equipment instead of buildings.</P>

They are not confined to these five countries; if they make a case they can go to any other country and <i>vice versa.</i>  In fact, the Swedes are talking about coming here next year to look at us as an excellent fellow-neutral country with Defence Forces who are engaged in the service of a neutral state with a neutral policy.</P>

If courses arise which are of mutual interest they hear about it on their own internal grapevine and if it is considered useful for officer A, B or C of the artillery to go and see a development in a particular army they make a request and he goes to see it.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we reported progress I was concluding my remarks in reply to points made by Deputies Taylor-Quinn, Gilmore and Barrett.  I indicated that anybody who was blaming the Dún Laoghaire Borough Council for the state of the piers was being unjust to the council. Hitherto, the Commissioners of Public Works were responsible for the piers and the purpose of this Bill is to transfer the responsibilities, powers, etc., from the Commissioners to the Minister for the Marine.</P>
      <P>I think I answered all the other points which were raised by the Deputies and I want to express my appreciation to them for their contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned we were trying to establish in pounds and pence the sort of income which will be received through the various charges outlined in section 8 and the sort of expenditure involved.  Before we decide to transfer powers from the Office of Public Works to the Minister for the Marine it is important that we know the policy in relation to the charges which will be imposed for various activities in the harbour.  I think that is a reasonable request to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that before we adjourned <Col N="1357" /> the Minister may not have had the figures available but I hope that during the break his staff in the Department got some indication as to what type of moneys we are talking about.  At the end of the day the public do not have a vehicle available to them so that they can have a say in what is charged, on what basis the charges are made, on what basis the harbour will be run and the activities which should be allowed which will bring this income into the Department.  We need to know the answers to these relevant questions before the Dáil is asked to agree to transfer the powers in respect of tolls, rates, dues and other charges from the Office of Public Works to the Department of the Marine.  Perhaps the Minister can give us more definite information as to the policy in relation to the charges which will be made and the type of activities which will be permitted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point about moneys, as I stated, these will go to the Exchequer.  The policy with regard to rates is, of course, one of commercial consideration.  In other words, the charges will be decided purely on a commercial basis.  Naturally, as a guideline, charges in similar ports on this side or on the other side of the Irish sea, or on the Continent, will be taken into account when deciding what charges are to be made.  With regard to the question about the annual revenue I can state that the vast bulk of the revenue &mdash; I do not have the details to give the House &mdash; at Dún Laoghaire comes from the ferry activity.</P>

Under the previous administration of the harbour this was cloaked in secrecy and while global figures were given to the House at various stages as to the income the Office of Public Works receive from the harbour and the expenditure they incurred there was a great reluctance to give details of what was involved.  There was a particular reluctance to detail what was involved in relation to the financial and leasing arrangements between the <Col N="1358" /> Department and the yacht clubs.  The House, or the public, have never been told of the arrangements involved, the terms of the leases or the charges, if any, that are applied to the yacht clubs for the use of public property and public facilities at Dún Laoghaire harbour.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett is correct in asking that such information be made known to the House.  Earlier I raised a question about the small boats that use the inner harbour. The Minister took the liberty of considerably exaggerating what I said in regard to this on Second Stage.  In fairness, I gave credit to the Department of the Marine for some improvment in the way the harbour has been managed since they took it over.  However, I would not put those remarks in the same exaggerated terms that the Minister did.</P>
      <P>There is considerable concern that since the Department of the Marine took over they have targeted the coal harbour areas for particular attention for charges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in regard to this.  The section deals with tolls, rates, dues and other charges.  Earlier I drew the Minister's attention to the fact that his Department, since they took over the running of the harbour, have <Col N="1359" /> targeted the coal harbour area for increased charges, as they targeted that area for what they described as a cleaning-up operation.  My concern is that the coal harbour area is the very sensitive part of the harbour that is used by the ordinary people of Dún Laoghaire and was identified as the site for a marina development which was publicly and politically controversial.  There is considerable local concern that the targeting of that area for increased charges on boat owners is part of the process of clearing out the boat owners from that area to make way for a private marina development. That view has been re-enforced by statements contained in the report of the planning review group which referred to the trawler men who used Dún Laoghaire having to go to Howth and base themselves there.  This is a critical point and the Minister should clear it up.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister say that there will not be any marina development in the coal harbour area?  Will he allay the fears of the small boat owners who consider the increased charges as a type of Trojan horse action to get them from the coal harbour in order to make way for a marina development?  If the Minister clarifies those questions he will lay at rest many fears that exist in the area.  The charges were increased by the Department before the Houses of the Oireachtas passed this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell Deputy Gilmore that I, too, am very much committed to transparency.  I do not subscribe to the philosophy of people trying to do things in an underhanded fashion or, as the Deputy said, engage in Trojan horse type activities.  I gave the Deputy details of the charges involved and informed him of where he can get details of them.  Tonnage and goods rates are given in the document, Dún Laoghaire Harbour, County Dublin, Schedules of Tonnage <Col N="1360" /> and Goods Rates Leviable by Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland as from 1 January 1989, now the Minister for the Marine acting as agent for the Commissioners of Public Works.  The Deputy was supplied with that document.</P>
      <P>Yachts moored at the harbour &mdash; incidentally, I am not a member, fortunately, of a yacht club and if I were I would probably be more aware of the costs to yacht clubs &mdash; are currently subject to a licence fee of £70 per annum.  Public boat yard charges are as follows: dinghies, £30 per season; individual storage spaces for larger craft &mdash; these do not belong to the ordinary people of Dún Laoghaire &mdash; £100 per season; power driven which, £25 per vessel; hand operated crane, £5 per vessel; supply of water to yachts, £1 &mdash; a bottle of Ballygowan almost costs that amount; supply of water to others, £5. As I told the Deputy it is not the practice, for obvious reasons, to divulge information regarding commercial transactions with individual parties involved in renting property.  Commercial enterprises are more than anxious to maintain their own commercial secrets because they are in competition with others.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore referred to the coal harbour area but I thought I had made it plain to the House that the interim board would be advising me about the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour, that I would be taking into account the conclusions of the punctilious and detailed report of the group under the chairmanship of Professor McAleese. Deputy Gilmore is asking me to say that this or that will not happen before the interim harbour board have considered the matter and before anybody else has had an opportunity of making an input. I am not going to do that.  That is precisely the purpose of setting up an interim harbour board and asking them to consider the total development of the harbour for the good not merely of the citizen of Dún Laoghaire but of the country and taking into account all the activities, including leisure activities, to be developed at Dún Laoghaire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has answered most of the queries I had wished to raise.  I wish to put on record that there is a genuine fear that charges may escalate when the Department of the Marine take control of Dún Laoghaire harbour.  There is a genuine fear among the users of the harbour that a Government Department, divorced from Dún Laoghaire, would set exorbitant charges. Deputy Barrett was quite correct when he said this would not arise if there was a harbour authority because the people themselves would control it in conjunction with the Department of the Marine.  I ask the Minister to make all possible haste in setting up an interim harbour authority so that the people could enforce the charges they saw fit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that at long last we have managed to extract the details of the charges.  We started to extract the information at 12 noon and eventually we got some idea of the level of charges.  Interestingly, there is very little difference between the rate charged to a dinghy owner and a yacht owner.  The person who owns a yacht is charged only £40 more than the dinghy owner whereas he should be in a position to pay much more than the ordinary Joe Soap who owns a dinghy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister, when deciding on the level of charges in future should consider the ordinary people who can only afford a dinghy.  We seem to be threading on politically sensitive waters when we talk about the coal harbour in Dún Laoghaire.  There is a tendency to close in and one has to wonder if there is an element of truth in what Deputy Gilmore had to say on the ordinary person being priced out of the harbour so that eventually it would be used so seldom that there would be little option but to go ahead with the development by private operators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Minister assure the House that no development will take place until <Col N="1362" /> a proper harbour authority is set up and that such authority decide on the development that takes place.  We have repeatedly sought this assurance in the House on Second and Committee Stages, but to date none has been forthcoming. With regard to the overall financial position of Dún Laoghaire harbour, will the Minister tell us whether it has operated on a sound financial footing, breaking even or making a surplus or has it made a loss over the past number of years?  Could the Minister outline his future plans for the development of the harbour and the charges that will be made for the services provided?  It is extremely important that this House knows, and as a result the people involved know, what charges may be imposed on them in the future.  The dinghy owner, the yacht owner and indeed the ferry operator &mdash; the ferry terminal is extremely important for the viability of Dún Laoghaire harbour &mdash; would like an indication on the future level of charges.  The Department of the Marine must have some idea at this stage, but if they have not it is a very poor lookout and makes the Bill a greater farce than it is already.  I hope the Minister can answer these questions.  He should let us know exactly how viable the harbour has been in the past; has it made a surplus, a loss or broken even?  Would the Minister specify the percentage rate of increase in charges, if there is to be an increase? Could he further indicate the income he hopes to take from the harbour in the forthcoming financial year and how he intends to use this money?  We know the Minister has already told the House that the priority is to pay the wages and salaries of employees.  However we would like a clear straightforward account with less shying and hiding of the Department's policy on the harbour.  There is a certain amount of sidestepping the issue. I hope the Minister comes forward and gives an account straight from the shoulder rather than the convoluted diverse account which we have received during the course of the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure Deputy <Col N="1363" /> O'Sullivan that it would not be the purpose of this Department to escalate charges and I would not accept that this Government Department, which is only three years in existence, would have a hardening of the arteries with regard to the activities of the Department.  We will be in a position to suit the charges to the commercial value of the services given.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor-Quinn said she was grateful that she had succeeded in extracting information.</P>

      <P>The information the Deputy sought and which she thought she was extracting all day was already available.  The tooth was already out.  The interim board we are setting up will play a big role in determining the pace, the nature and the extent of the development. The Deputy also asked whether the harbour was breaking even.  I am pleased to tell her and the House that there has been a surplus on the operation of Dún Laoghaire harbour for the past three years but before that it was making a loss.  It is important to remember that a foreign commercial company are operating the ferry from Dún Laoghaire to Holyhead, and that the company purchased the harbour at Holyhead as well as the old British company from the British Government.  That is the kind of atmosphere in which we are living, in which we make our commercial decisions and, of course, in which we retain certain commercial information.  The Deputy will <Col N="1364" /> appreciate that as I have found she has been level headed and balanced in her attitude to the activities of the Department of the Marine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>When the interim board is put in place will it have the power to recommend the small dinghy owners should not be charged for the use of the waters?  When they produce financial recommendations do they have to get the blessing of the Department of the Marine to enforce them or do they have autonomy in these matters?  May I further ask the Minister whether, in developing the harbour for different types of ferries that may come into it in the future, the interim harbour board will have a part to play in determining the cost or type of development or will it be a matter for the Department to decide and that the interim board will only be a talking shop? It is probably a bit annoying for a Minister to have to deal with a Deputy on a Bill concerning the Deputy's own constituency. Naturally we would have more of an interest than most others in this matter.  I do not want to imply that the Minister is not concerned about Dún Laoghaire harbour or its development but it is hard to explain the feeling that people living in Dún Laoghaire have about the harbour.  First, they treasure it very much and recognise that it is an essential part of the local economy.  We have heard rumour after rumour in recent years that the ferry was going to go and we have had discussions with Sealink.  It was rumoured that there were moves in Dublin Port and that they were manipulating to get a major ferry port in Dublin harbour.  All of these rumours keep circulating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dún Laoghaire harbour is unique in so far as the people there do not have any control over it.  If we look at the position at Cork Harbour, we will see that Deputy O'Sullivan has an entrée into the development of the harbour through the commissioners.  The same applies in Limerick and Dublin ports.  For some peculiar reason there is a massive reluctance to give that level of independence to Dún Laoghaire harbour.  When we match this <Col N="1365" /> with what was attempted 12 months ago or more it leads to more suspicion.  This whole matter is shredded with suspicion and I cannot for the life of me understand that we are involved in a wrangle over the transfer of authority from one Department to another and that we are not going to have a harbour authority.</P>
    <P>Trying to find out if this rumour is true and if what the guesthouse owner told one over the telephone is totally exaggerated or if she heard it on good grounds is like pulling out teeth on a daily basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to stray just a little occasionally to make their point. What I am trying to explain to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and you are a very patient man sitting there listening to me, is that the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour is going to cost money.  The level of fees charged forms <Col N="1366" /> part and parcel of the income that will make this development possible.  To retain the ferry service there must be development as different types of ships and more modern needs will have to be catered for.  When I begin to stray a little I am trying to get back to base to try to find out if moneys will be made available. All of these issues are intertwined.</P>
      <P>I notice that the Minister is loosening up a little.  Perhaps following lunch we are in better form but can he assure us a little more and tell us what this interim board is all about?  Can he indicate if this is the first step towards the setting up of a harbour authority and if there will be some liaison between the local authority and Members of this House so that we do not have to keep putting down parliamentary questions, being cut off after two minutes, that we do not have to seek continuous deputations in an effort to get a little information and that Dún Laoghaire Corporation would not have to spend half their monthly meeting time discussing these issues?  That is why I feel a sense of frustration.  I cannot speak for anybody else, but after all the talk of the last three and a half years when we thought we were getting a harbour authority, after all the suspicion and the peculiar developments which took place, there is still a reluctance to let Dún Laoghaire go when everybody else has their freedom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have talked about establishing an all-party committee and about the reform of local Government. We have decentralisation.  For example, there are now offices of the Department of Social Welfare in Sligo yet Dún Laoghaire harbour has to be kept under wraps.  There is something missing but I have not found the missing link yet.  I am hoping that by the time this Bill has passed through the House I will have all the little bits and pieces together, that I will know, for example, if there will be a 25 per cent increase in the fees charged for the berthing of a yacht or a punt in Dún Laoghaire harbour and if there is to be some liaison with the local council. We need to know on what basis charges are to be made.  Is it going to be a scratch <Col N="1367" /> of the head job with people saying they will be increased by 25 per cent this year to see how they will get on or will they be similar to the fees charged in Cork, Limerick, Howth or Holyhead?</P>
    <P>May we also have some indication as to whether there is likely to be an increase in employment in the harbour as a result of the development and income generated? I think, and Deputy Gilmore would bear me out on this, that the unemployment rate in Dún Laoghaire is above the national average.  Therefore, every crumb we can get&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If I upset or detain somebody as a result, tough luck, but I am determined to use every vehicle open to me within the rules of this House and with your blessing or endorsement to leave here with some picture.  At the moment I have not got a picture.  The only thing we have is this document which seems to be gathering dust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Friday week the Minister of State <Col N="1368" /> on Second Stage of this Bill gave an assurance that the membership of the interim board would be announced within a week.  Three weeks prior to that the Minister told us that the harbour board would be set up and the names released within a week.  None of this has happened.  So far as I am concerned, this is just another episode in the story of Dún Laoghaire harbour.  Some time ago we had the marina problem when public meetings and marches were held.  The people of Dún Laoghaire are entitled to that information. Why is it that Dún Laoghaire has to be different as a harbour?  Why the reluctance to give it independence when we have all sorts of other areas with such development potential having independence? That question has never been answered.  When I had an opportunity to be part of the decision-making process that decision was taken.  There appears now to have been a reversal of that decision.</P>
    <P>I do not know why we cannot have our independence.  It will not affect anybody nor deprive the State of massive amounts of money, but it can make a hell of a difference to the livelihoods of many people in Dún Laoghaire who depend on the harbour and the inflow and outflow of traffic.  It is also a beautiful amenity belonging to every person in the country, not just to the people of Dún Laoghaire. When we get an opportunity in this House to debate an important asset like Dún Laoghaire harbour I would like to leave here feeling that I have done the best I can to get the maximum information to help to put in place some sort of structure that will help to bring about the type of development we are looking for.  We are not here wasting our time as a crowd of cranks.  We are trying to bring about a situation where the potential as outlined in the report can be brought to fruition, so that we can get the sort of development spoken about there.  We do not want to have another two or three years of continuous wrangling about the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very helpful if we managed to get some clarity at the <Col N="1369" /> end of this discussion.  The Minister, in his earlier reply to me, seemed to be under the impression that anybody who has anything larger than a dinghy in the coal harbour is a member of a yacht club and can well afford to pay charges which have been increased from £5 to £100 for winter storage.  That increase must be a record charge this year.  I assure the Minister that if he is under that impression, he is wrong.  There are people who use winter storage moorings in the coal harbour who are not wealthy people, who use their boats for family recreation, or perhaps for a little fishing, and they are now being required to pay charges of £170 a year, taking the mooring and storage charges, before they pay for insurance or put the boat into the water at all.  For somebody on a low income that is a substantial amount of money and would certainly discourage many people, particularly those on a low income, from participating in this type of recreational activity.</P>
      <P>I saw from a press cutting that the Minister was recently at a function where he launched a new company, Irish Yachting Finance, to help boat owners cope with mounting costs of club fees, etc., and he stated that it was important to keep marine recreation within the scope of the ordinary person's budget so that it does not become the preserve of millionaires, tycoons or even Government Ministers. My objective is to make sure that the facilities at Dún Laoghaire harbour, which up to now have, by and large, been the preserve of millionaires, tycoons and Government Ministers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;can be used by the great majority of people.  For that reason I am anxious to see that those charges are kept down and that where a case for a reduction is made to the harbour management, it will be considered sympathetically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the Minister's reply to my earlier remarks I understood him to say that until the interim board have been established and draw up a plan for Dún Laoghaire <Col N="1370" /> harbour, permission will not be given for development in the harbour or for the construction of a marina.  Will the Minister clarify that, as I felt the Minister expressed it in a negative way whereas it should be expressed positively?  Of course, we have been waiting for the interim authority for so long now that I am beginning to wonder if the PDs are not looking for membership of it, thus the delay in announcing its membership and its terms of reference.</P>
    <P>I was surprised that the Minister did not deal with the question of the charges and the terms under which leases are held by the yacht clubs and that he described these as commercial transactions.  The House was previously informed about the amount of money Sealink pay to the State for their facilities at Dún Laoghaire harbour and that presumably is a commercial transaction, so why can this House not be told the terms of the leases under which the yacht clubs use the facilities at Dún Laoghaire harbour?  That is a fundamental piece of public information. Why are we not being told?  Why is that being described as a commercial transaction when in relation to Sealink, which is a real commercial transaction, there was no trouble at all in giving us the information?  Could it be that the management of Dún Laoghaire harbour, the reluctance to establish an interim authority and the privilege that has been traditionally enjoyed by the yacht clubs are interconnected and that there is concern that the establishment of a harbour authority will bring into the open some kind of privileged treatment which some institutions have been enjoying in Dún Laoghaire?  The public are entitled to that information.</P>
    <P>The State owns the harbour and if some organisation or body has the use of the harbour we should know under what terms.  We are talking here about the entire waterfront and the bulk of moorings which are under the control of the yacht clubs.  As far as leisure use is concerned, the harbour is substantially controlled by the yacht clubs.  The people are entitled to know the terms under which those facilities are made available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1371" /> In relation to the question of the car ferry, it is becoming like the great national aims.  Everybody is in favour of retaining the car ferry in Dún Laoghaire but we know that there is a very strong lobby to have a unified car ferry terminal in Dublin port.  Straight away, if that is conceded it will prejudice the position of the car ferry in Dún Laoghaire.  We know that passenger facilities in Dún Laoghaire are sub-standard.  We know that the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead crossing is the shortest sea route between this country and Britain and that it is the most widely used.  Something like 40 per cent of sea passengers out of this country use the Dún Laoghaire route.  We know that when the Channel tunnel is built sea crossings, particularly this route, will be critically important.  What will the Government do about the improvement of passenger facilities at Dún Laoghaire? Are there plans?  I know that Sealink have a plan for which they have sought funding.  Have the Government made any application for European funds?</P>

      <P>Deputy, you are intelligent enough now to realise that you are extending your contribution beyond what is provided for in section 8. I would ask the Deputy to return to port and deal with what is in the section in respect of tolls, dues and other charges. The harbour's pedigree and other things are all very interesting but they are not relevant under this section.  I am anxious to raise anchor on this section as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope you will afford me the same amount of leniency as you have afforded some of my colleagues.  I am addressing myself to section 8.  The Minister did say that Sealink provides the single, largest financial contribution at Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Far be it for me to make Sealink's case.  They are perfectly capable <Col N="1372" /> of making it themselves.  My case is made irrespective of who would be running the ferry.  The point I am making is that the car ferry is the single greatest generator of income for the State in Dún Laoghaire. The need to upgrade passenger facilities has already been identified.  I am simply trying to establish whether the Government have any plans to obtain funds from the European Community or to put money directly into the upgrading of passenger facilities at Dún Laoghaire harbour.  What are the Government's plans?  I know this much: if passenger facilities at Dún Laoghaire harbour are not upgraded then all the rhetoric and waffle about keeping the car ferry in Dún Laoghaire and all the talk about the importance of it to the borough, will not keep that car ferry there.  As the Minister rightly pointed out, this company, now a privately owned company, will make commercially based decisions, and I am fearful that the car ferry will be lost to Dún Laoghaire unless there is an investment in the terminal to improve passenger facilities.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the deputation. I was on the deputation and I was very glad to hear the Minister state his commitment to the retention of the car ferry in Dún Laoghaire, but that is contingent on investment in the car ferry terminal and in passenger facilities.  I would like the Minister to clarify the position and let us know whether or not the Government have any intentions in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to take up the points made by Deputy Barrett. The interim board will be set up in the next few days.  Its terms of reference will impose on it an obligation to advise me on all aspects of the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett said that, as a native of Dún Laoghaire, he has a special interest in the harbour, that he treasures it and that he is worried about rumours he has heard and suspicions that he has. I would like to scotch the rumours and allay his suspicions about the commitment of Roinn na Mara to the development of <Col N="1373" /> Dún Laoghaire.  I want to assure him of that commitment.  I am sure constitutency pressures are high and that the worry about the downgrading of the harbour or the loss of the ferry must be a cause of great concern to the Deputy.  I would like, as my good deed for the day, to scotch the rumours and clear away any suspicions the Deputy has about the future of Dún Laoghaire harbour.  I hope the Deputy will accept my assurances on that matter.  The whole purpose of the interim board is to absorb the spirit of Dún Laoghaire which makes Deputy Barrett treasure it, to take the advice of whoever has useful advice to give as to how the harbour should be developed.  I am not giving a wrong impression about the charges for dinghies and larger craft. The House should reflect on the fact that the highest charge of £100 per season is less than the cost of one packet of 20 cigarettes per week and the charges that are now in operation are roughly geared to cost of living rises, so there is nothing untoward or outrageous about these charges.</P>
    <P>I, too, would envisage the development at Dún Laoghaire as a development which would make marine recreation available to as many as possible across the social spectrum.  I would not like a development whereby only those who could afford to be members of yacht clubs could use the facilities.  There will be no development without the advice of the board and the people in the best position to give that advice.  This is not a political issue.  The car ferry is the most substantial earner for Dún Laoghaire and it is my policy to retain it there.  I admit that the passenger facilities are inadequate and need updating.</P>
    <P>I want to put it on the record of this House that the State have invested substantial sums of money in Dún Laoghaire in the past.  To those commercial enterprises, native or private, that level criticisms at Dún Laoghaire, I would like to say that the facilities that are available there have been put there by the Irish people without any charge on any foreign enterprise or firm.  The Government put <Col N="1374" /> in a substantial programme for the expenditure on structural funds, including the development of harbours.</P>
    <P>When we are being criticised by others I would like the House to bear in mind that our citizens have invested very heavily in the development of the ferry service in Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have now got from the Minister on this section a fairly wide ranging scholastic dissertation on his ambitions of what he envisages for Dún Laoghaire.  I am interested to hear him say this new interim authority will absorb the spirit of Dún Laoghaire.  He might like to elaborate in greater detail on what the absorption of the spirit of Dún Laoghaire in effect means.  I suggest the authority would want to be very porous to absorb the entire spirit of Dún Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>As the debate has progressed this afternoon it has become increasingly evident that section 8, which deals with tolls, rates, dues and other charges, is closely intertwined with the setting up of this interim authority.  Granted the interim authority are only going to advise the Minister on taking advice from the borough council, but I suggest it would be of massive relief to him as Minister and he would be unloading major political burdens and harassment if he were to take the opportunity on the Floor of this House to name the interim authority and have it over and done with.</P>

People could relate to the interim authority, contact them in a consultative capacity in relation to the tolls, rates, dues and other charges. It would satisfy all other Members on this side if we had that.  The Minister might take this opportunity to announce to the House the interim authority.  I am sure he knows exactly who they are.</P>

    <Title>Horse Breeding Bill, 1985: Committee Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to be consistent with the Second Stage debate I want to put down a marker and say I have serious reservations about the repeal of the Principal Act of 1934 in so far as it means that henceforth no stallions in any category will be licensed.  There are a number of reasons we should travel this road very slowly.  First, this is a most inopportune time to ask this House to deal with this Bill.  I know it has been in abeyance for quite a long time and that there have been suggestions from the various factions of the horse breeding industry about which I will speak in a moment.</P>
      <P>I note from a press statement today the announcement of the new horse advisory body.  I note that the Minister has appointed the members of the board and has set up this new non-thoroughbred advisory committee to advise him on the industry.  I see nothing wrong with that; that is reasonable in its own way.  No matter how good or bad they may be &mdash; as far as I am concerned &mdash; they will be just as good as Bord na gCapall, although the Minister went to great lengths to point out that this new body do not constitute a replacement of Bord na gCapall. I am sure all the members are professional in their own right.  I wish them well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no hang-up whatever about the composition of the board.  However, as there is always likely to be on such <Col N="1385" /> occasions, I note there are one or two omissions.  I am somewhat surprised that the Irish Shows Association are not represented on that board.  They do much good work at various agricultural shows. Now that they have brought their organisation to a professional pitch &mdash; they hold all-Ireland finals for yearlings and so on &mdash; it is difficult to understand why they have not a representative on the board.</P>
    <P>The kernel of this Bill is the repealing of the 1934 Act whose provisions stipulated that stallions in excess of two year olds, other than thoroughbreds, who had to be licensed to date will no longer have that obligatory requirement applied to them henceforth; in other words it will be, as it were, open season with no control as such.  I know that opinions within the horse breeding industry differ as to whether that is a good or bad thing.  I have never yet met two people in the horse breeding industry who were of the one mind in that regard.  Obviously the advice given the Minister is to the effect that the Principal Act should be repealed and that henceforth there be no licensing system at all.</P>
    <P>I would ask that scrutiny of this Bill be the first item on the agenda of the new advisory horse body.  They are entitled to examine its provisions.  It is not reasonable or fair to deny a group of people as committed to the horse industry as are those nine or ten members of the new body the possibility of examining this Bill.  That is tantamount to saying: we will first change the laws and then we will give you a look in on the sideline.  So much expertise resides within that group &mdash; from a reading of the list of names &mdash; it would be of benefit to the Minister and the House that we ascertain their views.</P>
    <P>While I do not profess to be an expert in this field I was born and reared with horses.  Because the whole of the horse breeding industry is so important to us, and is likely to become even more so in the future, I do not think we should rush through this Bill even though it has been in abeyance for many years and has fallen with Dála and had to be reinstated.</P>
    <P>I believe there should be some form of <Col N="1386" /> control.  I will give the House an example. When I served as a junior Minister in the Department of Agriculture it was decided that we should forget about all sorts of controls so far as bulls &mdash; breeding animals &mdash; were concerned.  The thinking at the time was that if a farmer wanted to cut off his nose we should allow him to do so because he would be doing so in the full knowledge that he was inflicting injury on himself.  I have to admit that many farmers did inflict injury on themselves. At the time I must admit I felt it was better to have a free-for-all, no licensing, no bull inspections or whatever. I was of that opinion for commercial reasons.  I genuinely believed that if somebody was seriously engaged in this industry he would have to take note of the fact that the market required a certain product and that he would use the best breeding facilities available.  I have to say many of them did not, so much so that even now the Department use a certain system of inspection.  It has been contended that, unless one has such inspections, we would be left with the worse specimens the various breeds could produce. I know it is not fair to equate that example with the horse breeding industry but my genuine fear is that, if we abolish the policing methods obtaining as far as stallions are concerned, we will wind up in a worse position from a quality point of view.</P>
    <P>If ten or 12 mares or stallions are being inspected, whatever they are being inspected for visually, it is okay if they are being inspected by keen eyed judges. I am not saying I am that keen eyed because it is a while since I was involved with horses but it could be argued from a genetic and breeding point of view that the judges did not have a clue what they were looking for other than that the horses conformed well to their breed type, that they looked well, had solid legs, etc.  I have noticed over the years, as have many others who have an interest in this industry, that a man who had no accreditation other than that he made a living from dealing in horses &mdash; the real university of life so far as this industry is concerned &mdash; would recognise a problem <Col N="1387" /> that perhaps five departmental or Bord na gCapall officials would not have seen in a month of Sundays.  Some people are very sharp and there are none so sharp as those who are involved in the horse industry.</P>
    <P>I accept that it is very difficult to legislate for this area but I ask the Minister to take on board the proposal I am making. Before we make a decision on the Bill the Minister should hand it back to the advisory horse body he has appointed so that they can have a look at it for a month or two.  If the Minister then brings their recommendations back here I will gladly facilitate the passage of the Bill.  Since I have become Opposition spokesperson on agriculture I have spoken to a number of people involved in the horse industry and I must confess that they are equally divided as to whether the 1934 Act should be repealed.  Not everybody agrees with the Minister, or for that matter disagrees with him, but there are a couple of technical questions I should like to get answers to, and I hope the Minister will have the answers to these questions when he replies.</P>
    <P>As the Bill stands at present there is an exemption from inspection for thoroughbred stallions.  I understand this provision has been in force for years.  It is not right to say that because they are exempt the same system should apply down the line.  There are far more stallions down the line which are not as expensive and may not be treated in the same way as the thoroughbreds.  Artificial insemination is very important at present both in horse breeding and cattle breeding, and even in regard to sheep. However, with present technology people will have no trouble importing semen.  If we do not have a licensing system how can we be sure that semen came from the source it was supposed to have come from?  How are we going to check the source and where is there certification? Many people are worried that a coach-and-four could be driven through this legislation.  I read with interest the contributions of Deputy Doyle and Deputy Davern when they spoke last <Col N="1388" /> year or the year before and it is obvious that they take the horse business quite seriously.  No answer was given on that occasion as to what would be done in those circumstances.  I do not have the answer either but I hope the Minister has. If he does not have it, obviously it is time for him to go back and have a look at the Bill again.</P>

      <P>I want to intervene here to say that what we are dealing with now is the Committee Stage of a Bill which comprises two sections only; section 1, the repeal of the Horse Breeding Act, 1934, and section 2, the short title.  I want to dissuade members from the notion that they may now have a Second Reading debate all over again. We cannot go back to the Second Stage of this Bill.  There are no amendments on Committee Stage to my knowledge and I must ask that we approach the Bill as it is presented to us now in two sections, an Act to repeal the Horse Breeding Act, 1934.  That is precisely what is before us. I must dissuade the Deputy in possession from making what seems to me to be a purely Second Reading speech.  The Second Reading of this Bill is long since past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to question your interpretation, and I do so in the knowledge that I know exactly what your ruling is.  Even though the title of the Bill is short this has nothing whatsoever to do with the content of it.  In fact it was argued on Second Stage that very little information was given for the repeal of legislation which could have far reaching effects.  All I am doing is asking the Minister straight questions.  I think that is what Committee Stage is for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite entitled to ask those questions but <Col N="1389" /> I have given him a lot of latitude without interrupting him at all.  However, I am concerned lest Members try to create a Second Reading of this Bill all over again. That would not be in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to continue by asking, and hope I am in order, that the Minister take on board my suggestion that this Bill be handed over to the newly appointed horse advisory body.  They were not in existence when we were debating the Committee Stage of the Bill; they were set up only two or three days ago.  This body were probably in the pipeline for the past couple of months and it is extraordinary to think, because of the way Dáil business is organised, that the brains of the best nine or ten people so far as this industry is concerned, or so the Minister must think, cannot have a look at the Bill before we decide on it.  If I was a member of that board I would begin to wonder why I had been placed on it.  All I am asking the Minister to do is to give them an opportunity to look at the Bill, even after Committee Stage.  I believe the Bill is important enough for the Minister to do that.</P>
      <P>Because of the numbers on the other side of the House, if the Bill is put to a vote it will be passed anyway but I sincerely hope there will not be any necessity to go that far because the horse industry is very important.  I should like the Minister to give great consideration to the question of imported semen.  As the Bill stands, he could be opening a sluice gate which we would not be able to control. A system of inspection should be set up and there should be some follow-through so that breeders, the people I am worried about at the moment, will have certain documentation, whatever it is worth, to show that there is a certain line of breeding for a particular animal.  It has been said many times by people in this business that this documentation is not worth the paper it is written on, that what is required is performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only this very day I got a letter back from the Department about the offspring of a stallion which is owned by a constituent of mine.  Because the stallion <Col N="1390" /> died and had not been blood typed this offspring cannot be registered as of now. I am told that this animal, from a specimen point of view, is as fine an animal as there is in the country.  Evidence of that is the fact that a person in Northern Ireland is prepared to pay £7,500 for the animal, provided the documentation is presented with it.  It is against that type of background that I am suggesting that there should be some overall control of registration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The horse breeding industry here has been neglected for many years.  We have produced some of the best horses in the world and we are all aware of how valuable the horse industry has been for Ireland.  That is one of the reasons I am worried about the provisions of the Bill.  It appears that we are to be muzzled in the debate on a Bill that deals with one of our most important industries. Surely the Minister realises how valuable horse breeding is to our economy. There is no doubt that we are only skimming the surface as far as the potential of that industry is concerned.  That cannot be contradicted.  The quality of the Irish horse is recognised internationally and up to 50 per cent of the best showjumpers in the world were bred in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industry needs to be reorganised and the Department should devote special attention to that.  A suggestion has been made that we should allow the half-bred industry to develop but in my view there is a greater need for our pure bred animals.  There are many international buyers who are prepared to pay any money for quality pure bred Irish horses.  In the last 20 years the half-bred industry has seriously declined to such an extent that the number of foals produced annually has dropped to 2,500.  The sad fact is that we have more international buyers than we have horses for them. That is an indictment of the Department which allowed that industry to die.  As a Member from a county with a proud horse breeding tradition I urge the Minister to rescue it.  We have the Boherbue <Col N="1391" /> and Caheragh shows which attract international buyers annually.</P>
    <P>I agree with the remarks of Deputy Connaughton concerning the licensing of stallions.  The new board should make a decision on that important aspect of the industry.  I do not want to see our horse breeding industry reduced to a scrub industry.  We are all aware of the damage done by scrub bulls to many herds and it is not hard to visualise the amount of damage scrub stallions would do.  If there is to be a future for our horse industry we must have proper breeding and handling. We cannot afford to have any slip-shod methods used by fly-by-night operators whose only concern is to make a quick buck.  The time is opportune for the Minister to set a headline for the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the process of repealing that legislation it is important that I should point out the vital facts to the Minister.  I welcome the decision to pay a grant of £400 for Irish draught mares. I urge the Minister to continue along that road and introduce a grant scheme for the construction of stables for the Irish draught mare, particularly in the disadvantaged areas.  There is a lack of housing for the draught mares in those parts of the country and it is for that reason I appeal to the Minister to introduce a scheme for the construction of stables in the disadvantaged areas.  This would enable the farmers in those areas to engage in horse breeding and thus get a bite of the cherry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>

      <P>The market will dictate which stallions will be used.  The progeny of the breeding will dictate the market.  Nobody in the half-bred industry would be foolish enough to think they could use any stallion and then get the type of money that Deputy Sheehan mentioned.</P>
      <P>I was very disappointed that Deputy Sheehan did not mention Millstreet which has been grant aided by this Government and has become a centre of equestrian excellence.  Perhaps it is bigotry against Noel C. Duggan.</P>

They will advise the Minister in six months or a year's time, but I am sure the question of licensing will not be an issue.  The market will dictate the necessity of licensing.  I think that registration is the better suggestion.</P>
      <P>The only point which Deputy Connaughton made which I think is relevant is whether the importation of semen will be allowed.  If it happens I cannot see any sudden burst in the half-bred industry because people will still prefer the natural method.  It is part of the business to see the stallion.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Sheehan's request for a grant scheme to house draught mares, he should know that any half-bred animal is better left out in the fields and on the hills than being put into housing where it will pick up diseases such as coughs and colds.  I appeal to the Opposition to let the Bill pass so that the new advisory board can advise on how best to develop the half-bred industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do my utmost to address my remarks to section 1. However, I must point out that section 1 entails the repeal of the previous legislation and this in turn opens up the whole matter.  I respect your commands a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I reiterate the views expressed by my colleagues, Deputies Connaughton and Sheehan on the advisability of proceeding with the legislation at this time.  I am not certain whether it would be better to allow an interim period so that the new advisory body could refer to the previous legislation and the proposed legislation and then they would be in a position to advise the Minister on the future of the non-thoroughbred industry.  I think that might be a worthwhile suggestion.  The Bill has been held up for quite a long time and a delay of another month or two will not make any great difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not so sure that I agree with Deputy Davern when he says the market place determines the quality of the animal or the breeding tactics in the non-thoroughbred industry.  It most definitely affects the thoroughbred industry, but that is a different story.  It has been known in the past that non-thoroughbred animals which may not have the best possible lineage have achieved a high standard in the show grounds and in the market place.  Even though the lineage <Col N="1395" /> may not have been of the best, they were still able to excel in their class.  For that reason there are weaknesses in Deputy Davern's argument.  It will be much more difficult to control the breeding in the non-thoroughbred industry than in the thoroughbred industry because there are not large sums of money involved. However, it is equally important to do so.  We still have a fairly proud history in the draught classes and the draught mares and stallions are recognised as being of the highest possible standards.</P>
    <P>The possibility of artificial insemination was referred to.  What suits the non-thoroughbred industry may not suit the thoroughbred industry.  Artificial insemination would not suit the thoroughbred industry because the industry deals on a worldwide basis and, in particular, with the American market. The reference to artificial insemination in the thoroughbred industry sets off alarm bells.  If it was agreed that artificial insemination was acceptable to the non-thoroughbred then, as Deputy Connaughton has said, it would be very difficult to certify the origins of the semen and ultimately the thoroughbred industry could progress in the same fashion.  If that were to happen, this Bill could have negative knock-on consequences for the thoroughbred industry.  This area needs to be looked at by the advisory body at this stage.  I fully respect the quality of the people which the Minister has chosen for the advisory body but I wonder if it would be a good idea to have them review what we are doing now so that they would have the opportunity of advising the Minister on it.</P>
    <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle may think I am wandering outside of section 1.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having read the Second Stage speeches, I know that a wider area was covered, as is appropriate.</P>
      <P>It might be a good idea if the Minister were to take advice from the advisory body before proceeding with section 1 of the Bill which proposes to repeal the 1934 Act.  We have all agreed on the necessity for an advisory service, and the necessity for a governing body to replace the defunct Bord na gCapall.  It is absolutely essential that there is a body with responsibility to determine the manner in which the non-thoroughbred industry is to progress in the future.  With all due deference to the Chair, there is a considerable market for expansion in that area.</P>
      <P>I am not going to broaden the debate but we have not even begun to develop the draught horse industry and this needs to be taken into account.  At this stage the 1934 Act is obsolete.  The industry needs to be developed bearing in mind present day requirements in the areas of leisure and trotting.  The Minister of State might like to comment on those areas in his reply.  I hope he will.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you have reminded Deputies on both sides that this is a very short Bill, the purpose of which it to repeal the Horse Breeding Act, 1934.  The proposal to repeal the Horse Breeding Act, 1934, was published in this Bill way back in 1985.  It arose out of a recommendation of a subcommittee on breeding set up by the then Bord na gCapall and this recommendation was accepted by the Minister of the day.  If one were to summarise what the Deputies have said, it is <Col N="1397" /> pretty clear that it is recognised that under that Act a purely clinical examination is carried out.</P>
      <P>Inspections are carried out in the case of first time applicants only.  Once licensed a stallion is not re-examined but the licence has to be renewed each year. The subcommittee established by Bord na gCapall strongly recommended that this Act be repealed and this argument be discarded.  They made this recommendation because of the rapid decline in the number of stallions being licensed. Let me point out to the Deputies that in recent years there has been no demand to the Department of Agriculture and Food, who have responsibility for this matter, to retain this particular Act and to operate it in the way some people would like to see it being implemented.</P>
      <P>At the time Bord na gCapall felt that the only route to take was to establish a register of approved stallions.  The inspection system is quite thorough and the stallions are examined for soundness, confirmation, movement, temperament and so on.  That examination is obviously proving to be quite satisfactory.</P>
      <P>Let me now deal with some of the points made by the Deputies.  In relation to the advisory committee established by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, its membership covers the broad spectrum on the industry and I am sure the names of the individuals involved are available to Deputies on the other side of the House.  I am sure they would agree when I say that these people know the industry very well and are aware of the needs of the industry. I am sure with the co-operation of the appropriate division in the Department they will do a good job.  Deputy Connaughton argued that a particular association should have representation on the board but it comes down to where one draws the line.  It is a matter of getting people with knowledge and expertise on the advisory committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan raised the possibility of operating a grant scheme for stables. I can tell him that such a grant scheme is at present under consideration, but I <Col N="1398" /> cannot go any further than that at this stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton referred to the use of semen.  I am sure he had embryo implantation in mind.  This question will have to be considered in the context of EC legislation and the liberalisation of trade within the Community.  The EC proposals contain no provision for controls on breeding, such as a licensing system.  The EC legislation will provide for certification &mdash; this deals with the misgivings of Deputy Connaughton &mdash; of semen traded within the Community.  We will have to accept semen imports from member states provided of course there is adequate certification.  Obviously this matter will have to be considered in the context of the EC proposals.</P>
    <P>This is a very narrow debate.  We are talking about the repeal of this legislation and discarding the licensing arrangement. I would like to broaden the debate slightly for a moment and I beg your indulgence in the matter.  It has to be seen in the context of the proposal which has been brought forward&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair will naturally be reluctant to remind the Minister that he too must be subject to the rules and Standing Orders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone thinks he is right.  I am only right in so far as I know Standing Orders, as does Deputy Connaughton.  He realises that however interesting it might be to indulge in equine and equestrian matters, it is not appropriate to do so on section 1.  There is an obligation on the Chair to remind the House of that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, that is not the responsibility of the Chair. All these meanderings and wanderings would have been appropriate on a Second Stage debate.  I feel it is unnecessary for <Col N="1399" /> me to say this because I know Deputies present have as good an understanding of this as I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have regard to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's feelings on the matter.  Let me briefly say that the proposals which the Minister set out in the national programme for the development of a non-thoroughbred horse industry, which I am sure is available to Deputies on the other side of the House, are adequate and will see the industry develop steadily over the years and consolidate its position.  That is all I have to say on the matter.  It is a short and narrow Bill and we must leave it at that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton knows it would be all right to do so if it were pertinent to section 1 but we cannot have dialogue across the floor on matters which are related to horse breeding in general but are not appropriate to section 1 which states that: &ldquo;The Horse Breeding Act, 1934, is hereby repealed&rdquo;.  That is what we are dealing with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Minister of State is in an expansive mood, <Col N="1400" /> there are a couple of questions I would like to put to him with your permission. Certainly we will not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is anxious to put one or two relevant questions, I will allow him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been liberalisation of the EC animal health rules. Obviously this is of huge importance to Ireland, not alone to the horse industry but in a much bigger way for our cattle and sheep industries.  The Minister of State would appear to be saying that a certain type of certification will be required.  That does not answer the question as to the identity and the source of the semen or the embryo transplant.  How can one be sure that one knew exactly the origin of the semen?  This is something that a lot of the more enlightened horse breeders want to find out.  Within the context of what we are talking about this evening it is important to get a clear steer on that one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any reference to artificial insemination in the 1934 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not have much of that then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore it is not appropriate to this.  It is not in it and we cannot talk about it.  We are repealing an Act as the Deputy will understand and appreciate.  There would perhaps be some case for referring to what was in that Act but to refer to something that was not in it is not in order on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be a consequence of it.  I am sure the Minister can give us some indication as to what his Department propose to do after this legislation is repealed.  It is vitally important. I still maintain that the new Horse Advisory Board should have been given an opportunity to look at this Bill for all the reasons we have stated.  That is <Col N="1401" /> something we could not talk about on Second Stage because the advisory body was not there.</P>
      <P>The Report Stage of this Bill will not be taken today so I would ask the Minister between now and Report Stage to refer the Bill to the advisory group and we will all be relatively happy if they believe this is the right thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The certification obviously must cover the requirement that Deputy Connaughton feels will be necessary.  I accept the point that the impact on the development of AI and embryo transplantation in the horse breeding industry will be very significant.  The Department are fully aware of this potential and are aware of the genetic improvement which these techniques will afford the industry. The introduction of new legislation to facilitate this may well have to be considered in that context.  We can draw from the experience of the use of these techniques in other sectors in agriculture and that information will be readily available to the Department when we consider bringing forward necessary proposals in that regard.  I assure the Deputy that the certification will cover the misgivings he has about EC procedures in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see that Minister, but I have to take your word for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to what the Minister has just said I accept that as time goes on modern technology developments will take place which may be beneficial to the industry but it is very difficult, as my colleague has just said, to be in a position to authoritatively determine whether the certification is authentic. It will be virtually impossible.  I accept that in the case of non-thorough-breds the tendency towards abuse will not be as great as it would be in the thoroughbred industry where large amounts of money will be at stake but nonetheless there is considerable room for abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1402" /> The purists in the horse industry generally are opposed to artificial insemination because it automatically raises the question of the certification and the ability to prove that the certification is absolutely above board.  In the case of the non-thoroughbred industry with which we are dealing here, it would be a good idea if the Minister had some response from the advisory body at this stage in relation to AI.  The Minister would probably find that some are in favour but that more are not in favour.  The other problem relates to the ability of the market to control what happens&mdash;&mdash;</P>

While the Minister seems to be happy that the certification which will be available will be authentic and will protect the industry here, I am not so certain.  It might be as well if the Minister had the advice of the advisory body he has just set up before proceeding further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would join with Deputy Durkan in appealing to the Minister to delay the implementation of this legislation until the body appointed in recent days by the Minister has reported.  One aspect of the body that has been appointed is that while there is a substantial horse breeding industry in County Clare we seem to have got no representation on this committee.  I received today a letter from members of the west Clare horse breeding association asking that different things be included and that the Minister would give some kind of aid to the people in this sector of the agricultural industry.  This Bill has been around since 1985, so I do not understand what the urgency is now.  Why does the Minister want to proceed now <Col N="1404" /> when he is apparently trying to be constructive by asking a committee to examine this aspect of agricultural life?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Carey appreciates that misgivings of those kinds would have been appropriate to Second Stage but not to Committee Stage.  Unfortunately that is the position in which the Chair finds itself.  That is the reason the Chair must remind the House <i>ad nauseam,</i> and I do not propose to keep repeating it to every Deputy who has been here to hear it.  This section deals with repealing the Act and Deputy Carey is not at liberty to address this problem in the fashion he would wish.  There will be other opportunities when this can be done but unfortunately, as the Deputy knows, on Committee Stage that freedom is not allowed.</P>

The cost factor has not been raised.  I would like to know how much the cost had to do with the decision to repeal this legislation.  How much money will the repeal of this Act save the Department?  Did this decision have more to do with saving money than with horse breeding?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of a calculation in 1985 there would be an approximate saving of around £14,000.  Let me say while I am on my feet that for Deputies on the other side of the House to ask <Col N="1411" /> me to start anticipating what legislation might be brought forward for the industry in the years down the road or after the advisory committee have made recommendations that changes should be made in particular areas is going too far.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, I assume your interpretation will be just as tight on the short title of the Bill, but on this section let me ask the Minister if he will still accept that the advisory body should have a look at this in the next couple of weeks before we go to Report Stage.  I am trying to get an answer on that all day but I do not seem to be having any success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation came forward as a result of the recommendations of a subcommittee on the industry who were established in 1985.  The recommendation came from that subcommittee and was accepted by the Minister for Agriculture of the day.  That is how that Bill arrived on the Floor of his House.  It cannot be said that the industry at that time did not have an input into the decision to introduce it.  It had.  The whole licensing arrangements have gone into decline.  Applications for licences have declined dramatically.  Effectively these arrangements have not been operated for a number of years and there is absolutely no demand to operate them again with any force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many reasons that the demand has evaporated, principally that the level of profitability was very low.  People did not see money in it and they were not involved. However, the Minister seems hellbent on keeping this Bill away from the new body. <Col N="1412" /> The Minister for Agriculture and Food has a great deal of expertise and I cannot understand his reluctance to refer the Bill back.  It has nothing to do with the law. You cannot on the Floor of this House prevent from happening something that is going to happen anyway.  However, I would like to be assured by this body that they believe what the Minister is doing is absolutely right.  Is there any sort of niggling suspicion on that side of the House that they might not?  Those people, drawn, as the report I have here says, from nine or ten various sectors of the horse industry, must be entitled to look at the Bill.  I cannot understand why the Minister is backpeddling from that suggestion.  There is nothing ulterior about it.  It would seem to be the most normal thing in the world.  I hope that when we come back here on Report Stage the Minister will be able to tell us that the board have examined the Bill.  This, too, will give them a certain degree of importance.  They are an advisory body and if they are not going to act in that capacity I do not know what they will be doing.  We should know by the time we reach Report Stage what their views on this Bill are.  I see this legislation meandering along, to quote the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Obviously it is going to become law anyway with the consequent repeal of the 1934 Act.  All I am asking is that the benefit of the wisdom of those 13 people, men and women, be brought to bear on the Bill.  Their views would have no binding in the House or in law so this is not asking too much.</P>

      <P>Deputy Connaughton is really drawing the long bow on this.  He knows better than anybody else in this House that the proposal to repeal this Act was introduced in 1985.  No compelling reason has emerged since that proposal was made nor since the Bill was published and circulated to warrant a change of mind in relation to it.  The Deputy knows from his ministerial experience that if pressure is to build up to have a change of heart in relation to legislation it will soon manifest itself.  That has not happened in relation to this Bill.  There is a realisation within the industry that there is a need to proceed with it and get it through this House as quickly as possible. <Col N="1414" /> I appeal to Fine Gael, even if they have abandoned the Tallaght strategy, to accommodate us in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I elaborated at length last night on my reaction to the Labour Party Bill and my reason for tabling a reasoned amendment thereto.  The Labour Party must be complimented in that they provided the springboard to coin a phase, for this important debate through the circulation of their Bill.  Fine Gael proposed the correct response with my proposal to refer the issues arising out of the Bill and related issues to an independent body for examination and recommendation.  The Government have made their contribution by accepting the principle of my amendment and by announcing the appointment of such an independent body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment, which I cleared with my party last week, proposed the examination of these issues by the Law Reform Commission. The Minister indicated that he agreed with the substance of my amendment but he was concerned about <Col N="1416" /> referring the matter to the Law Reform Commission who might not be able, because of their heavy workload, to produce a report as quickly as we should like.  On that basis he announced that his response to my amendment was the establish of a committee under Judge Martin to carry out an examination of the issues in the context of our criminal procedure.</P>
    <P>We have made such progress and there are just a few outstanding issues which need to be teased out.  In accepting the substance of my amendment the Minister merely referred to his invitation to Judge Frank Martin to chair a committee of experts and his acceptance of that invitation. It is very important that without further delay the Minister should make a full statement on this issue.  I understand that he was not in a position to do so when responding to my amendment.  I presume, having made the decision in principle to accept the amendment, his first job was to find a chairman.  There are other relevant issues.  What terms of reference will this committee have?  Then there is the membership of the committee. Will it be a committee of lawyers or a broad-based committee?  I should prefer the latter.  We have no knowledge of the Minister's views on these matters. Both the terms of reference and the membership of the committee need to be decided quickly.  Perhaps the Minister would confirm at an early date that the committee will have research and other staff available.  I should also like an indication as to the time within which the committee are to report and confirmation that there will be a Dáil debate on the report as soon as possible after it is available.</P>
    <P>What has happened in relation to this Bill raises the whole question of criminal law reform and the need not just for an <i>ad hoc</i> response to this Bill but for an approach which would involve a comprehensive criminal law reform programme. That question needs to be addressed urgently.  It could be done by the establishment of a criminal law reform commission, separate from the <Col N="1417" /> existing Law Reform Commission.  Alternatively the mandate and the membership of the existing Law Reform Commission could be extended.</P>
    <P>I believe all Members share the concerns expressed by Deputy Spring in presenting this Bill to the House.  We are all anxious to ensure that miscarriage of justice will not occur in this jurisdiction, just as we are anxious that it should not arise in relation to Irish citizens elsewhere. We must have the appropriate machinery to deal in this jurisdiction with substantive allegations of miscarriages of justice.  I hope we will have the report of Judge Martin's committee available to us with the minimum of delay and that we will have the opportunity of returning to these issues in a full debate as soon as that report is to hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Due to circumstances beyond my control I was unavoidably absent from the House yesterday and it was only in the last hour or two that I had the opportunity to study the Bill and the text of yesterday's debate, particularly the Minister's speech.  I compliment the Minister on his initiative in establishing this committee under Judge Martin.  The need for such a committee has been obvious for some time.  It was proposed with varying degrees of seriousness by Members on all sides of the House during the past few years.  I am delighted that Deputy Ray Burke as the Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice has seized the initiative and decided to appoint the Committee. Deputy O'Keeffe and others have referred to the hope that this committee will report as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share that view but, nevertheless, these are serious issues that affect the liberty of the subject.  In such issues, changes in the law and criminal procedure require mature and careful consideration. I am not for one moment recommending that the Martin committee should unduly delay their proceedings but these matters need to be studiously considered with a view to getting the best possible recommendation. <Col N="1418" /> It is a difficult area which, as I said, goes to the heart of the liberty of the subject. Consequently, it cannot be the subject of a rushed report by a committee of experts chaired by Judge Martin or anybody else.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his response and initiative in setting up this committee.  I also compliment him on his speech which, as I said, I only read briefly.  I welcome the generosity of his response to this Private Members' Bill.  I recall several occasions when we were on the Opposition benches, when we moved Private Members' Bills and the response was less than generous, to put it mildly. I could cite several examples but the debate is not about that.  I am not saying that all Ministers during that period adopted a negative and stonewalling response, there were one or two honourable exceptions in Ministers who took on board suggestions from the Fianna Fáil side of the House.  However, I have rarely, seen a response to a Private Members' motion or a positive proposal by the Opposition that received such a generous and immediate response as that contained in Minister Burke's speech last night.  Deputy McCartan seems to find that remark amusing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCartan is always informative and entertaining on these matters and I look forward to hearing from him.  In moving the Bill, Deputy Spring asked how the problem of the Guildford Four arose.  I would argue that the question is not how the problem arose but why.  We all know that the problem arose because the police in Guildford in the south-east of England, conspired in large numbers to fabricate evidence, to swear false oaths and to beat confessions out of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1419" /> The conspiracy was not confined to the Guildford police, it involved people in the office of the British Director of Public Prosecutions so far as the withholding of alibi evidence was concerned.  A situation like that can arise at any time if the will is there.  If one focuses on why the problem arose, one will find that it cannot be solved by legislation or regulation.</P>
    <P>I very rarely have the opportunity of listening to BBC radio but coming up in the car this morning I decided, for a change, to switch to BBC radio 4.  I switched over at about 8.30 a.m. and the presenter was reading a letter from a lady in Surrey on the question of the Guildford Four which is commanding a lot of media attention in Britain at the moment.  I do not remember the exact wording but the tenor of the letter was that she did not give two curses about the Guildford Four or the Birmingham Six.  She was very sorry for the victims of that appalling outrage but she was also sorry for the police who had been in trouble as a result. It is that attitude among a very large section of the British public that has given rise to this problem.</P>
    <P>I have occasion to do some work in the United Kingdom and I have contact with many people there.  I know that that is the prevailing attitude among the section of the population in Britain who like to think of themselves as ordinary, fair-minded and right thinking citizens.  Naturally, if that is the view of a large minority of the population of the UK it will be reflected in the police force of that state, the Civil Service and the Judiciary. That is the problem which has given rise to this case and the miscarriage of justice.</P>
    <P>There is no similar analogous situation here.  We do not live in a country where a minority of foreigners engage in terrorist and quasi-political crimes.  Therefore, there is no incentive on the part of our police, Judiciary or legal officers to engage in the sort of conduct which took place in the Guildford Four case.</P>
    <P>It is facile to argue, as Deputy Spring seemed to last night, in so far as I understand him, that regardless of why the situation arose there, it could also arise <Col N="1420" /> here and he mentioned ways of preventing it.  The police force of Guildford went to extraordinary and painstaking lengths to fabricate evidence against those people and intentionally put them away for life.  If the law in the United Kingdom or Scotland was that some corroboration is needed to a confession of guilt on the part of the accused, can anyone imagine that the police would not have gone a minuscule step further and fabricated further so-called material evidence against those people?  I could name 20 ways in which it could be done with every little effort or ingenuity on the part of the Guildford police.  The problem is, therefore, essentially a political one and the outcome of the Guildford Four case will do a lot more to reduce the possibility of that recurring in the United Kingdom than legislation or judicial decisions.</P>
    <P>On reading Deputy Spring's speech one would imagine that it is the law in this country that an uncorroborated confession made by an accused person can of itself be sufficient to lead to a guilty verdict.  Of course that is not the law and Deputy Spring knows it very well as a legislator and from practical experience at the Bar.  The law here is that in order to incriminate an accused person a confession of guilt made by a person must be a voluntary confession and even to say that does not fully state the law because the Irish courts have now decided that, in some cases, even a voluntary confession of guilt on the part of the accused will not necessarily lead to a conviction if the trial is unfair.  The courts have expressed in the clearest possible terms that the right to a fair trial is a constitutional right, an individual right which is enshrined in the Irish Constitution. That is the law in this country and is the background against which we are considering this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill has two parts.  For my purposes I have divided them into a main and subsidiary part.  I am not attributing any numerical order to Deputy Spring; I am subdividing them for my purposes. The Minister dealt in some detail with what I call the subsidiary part which deals with the right of a Minister for Justice to <Col N="1421" /> refer a case to the courts if evidence is presented or allegations are made that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.  That is a proposal similar to that contained in section 17 of the English Criminal Appeal Act, 1968.  I do not want to dwell on that at any length; the Minister dealt with it adequately.  If I have time at the end of my contribution I will refer to it briefly.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the main part of Deputy Spring's proposal, namely, that some material evidence should be needed in addition to a self-incriminatory statement made by an accused to ensure that person's conviction, in other words, statements of guilt made by the accused himself, whether voluntary or otherwise, will not necessarily lead to his conviction; there must be some further evidence.  The law in this country is that confessions must be voluntary and, even if voluntary, a conviction might still not be secured if the whole proceedings of the trial fall short of what the court would consider to be a fair trial, which is a right enshrined in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>Looking briefly through a few recent decisions of the Irish Courts of Criminal Appeal one is struck by the painstaking, arduous lengths to which the Judiciary go to ensure that, in cases based on confessions, the confession falls within the term &ldquo;voluntary confession&rdquo; as defined by the courts.  I might mention in passing that, in a great many of those cases, when the matter comes before the Court of Criminal Appeal or is on appeal to the Supreme Court, as the case may be, there is no dispute about what actually happened. The method of questioning is something that is admitted and the only question is whether that admitted method of interrogation or questioning falls, or whether a confession produced by that admitted method of interrogation falls within the term &ldquo;voluntary confession&rdquo; as defined by the courts.  I am not saying that is so in all cases.  In some cases the question of how the confession was got, the precise details of the interrogation, is a matter of great dispute but, in many cases there is no dispute.  If a man was questioned for 40 hours or 42 hours in an underground passageway <Col N="1422" /> rather than an interview room or whatever, does this form of interrogation fall within the term &ldquo;voluntary interrogation&rdquo; for the purposes defined by the courts?</P>
    <P>As examples of the lengths to which the Irish courts will go in examining every single, minute detail of the interrogation to discover whether that interrogation was in accordance with the Judges Rules or was otherwise voluntary as defined by a series of court cases, a number of cases that could be quoted.  One such is the People v. McNally, Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 February 1981.  I know Deputy McCartan will have some more incisive experience of those matters.  I saw his name mentioned in one or two of the reports.  This case arose from the Sallins mail train robbery.  One of the questions at issue before the Court of Criminal Appeal was whether the interrogation of Bernard McNally and that of Osgur Breathnach &mdash; which ultimately produced confessions &mdash; produced &ldquo;voluntary confessions&rdquo; for the purposes for which that term has been defined.  In McNally's case, in the course of his confession, he gave details of a van used in the course of committing the crime.  Unless I am misreading the facts of the case it would appear to me that the police were very strongly of the view, as were the court, that he could not have known the details about that van unless he was involved in some way in the crime. His verbal confession was not reduced to writing.</P>
    <P>The Judges Rules which govern the taking of statements and the interrogation of prisoners stipulate that such statements have to be reduced to writing. The question at issue was whether the failure of the police authorities to reduce that confession to writing rendered the confession involuntary or was in breach of the Judges Rules to such an extent that the confession should be excluded for the purposes of proving guilt.  The Court of Criminal Appeal held that in fact it should.  Admittedly the fact that the confession was not reduced to writing was not the only factor that influenced the Court of Criminal Appeal, but it is quite <Col N="1423" /> clear from the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal that, taken in conjunction with other factors, it was a major factor that influenced them in arriving at the conclusion they did.  The President of the Court of Criminal Appeal, Mr. Justice Finlay, referred first to the fact that McNally had made various allegations of brutality against the police which the trial judge did not accept.  Even taking into account the fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal and the trial judge believed that McNally had actually lied to the police, that he had lied on oath in the original trial, nevertheless the conviction was struck out.  Mr. Justice Finlay said:</P>
    <P>The Court is not satisfied that the Court of Trial was correct in law in admitting these verbal statements into evidence.  No explanation, other than a previous course of conduct, was tendered to the Trial Court for the failure of the two Garda witnesses directly concerned to make a note of the alleged verbal admissions made by the applicant and to afford him an opportunity of correcting, amending or rejecting them.  Bearing in mind that each of these alleged verbal admissions occurred in what are usually described as the early hours of the morning after very lengthy periods of questioning and interview extending over 44 hours, interrupted by one night's sleep only, the court is not satisfied that there were any circumstances proved before the Court of Trial which would justify the exercise of its discretion in favour of admitting in evidence these verbal statements notwithstanding the undoubted breach of the Judges Rules.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other cases which can be quoted as evidence of the careful and painstaking way in which superior courts in this country scrutinise the evidence, closely examine every detail of the interrogation, to ensure that the confession of guilt is voluntary, as they have defined &ldquo;voluntary confession&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the case of the co-accused, Osgur Breathnach, it was held by the Court of <Col N="1424" /> Criminal Appeal that the circumstances surrounding the making of his statement, which followd 40 hours in custody, after his repeated insistence on the presence of a solicitor &mdash; which was not granted &mdash; raised doubts as to whether that confession was voluntary.  Again the President of the Court of Criminal Appeal, Mr. Justice Finally, had this to say:</P>
    <P>On the admitted and accepted evidence concerning these statements, however, the position would appear to be that this applicant was a person fully and amply aware of his rights and had, on a previous occasion in connection with arrest and suspicion of the same crime, adamantly refused to be interviewed or to discuss the crime with any member of the Garda Síochána until his solicitor had arrived.  On this occasion, having maintained the same attitude after his arrest for a period of approximately 40 hours, suddenly, at 5.20 in the morning, he decided to make a full confession of his participation in this serious crime.</P>
    <P>The learned judge went on to refer to the judgment of Mr. Justice Sachs in the case of The Crown v. Priestly &mdash; 1967 Criminal Appeal Reports &mdash; on the question of what constituted oppressive questioning so as to render a confession involuntary. In that case the judge said:</P>
    <P>To my mind this word in the context of the principles under consideration imports something which tends to sap, or has sapped, that free will which must exist before a confession is voluntary.</P>
    <P>That is the standard of law applied by the Irish Judiciary in determining whether a confession is voluntary.  Applying that standard and those principles to the facts of this case the court found as follows: that the unexplained change of attitude of the applicant at questioning concerning the crime after a period of 40 hours in custody, together with the fact that the questioning, which immediately preceded the making of the statement, took place not in the regular interrogation room but rather in an underground <Col N="1425" /> passage which had a somewhat intimidating atmosphere, together with the fact that the making of the voluntary statement occurred in the early hours of the morning, together with the fact that the accused had repeatedly requested the presence of his solicitor &mdash; which presence was not granted &mdash; served to raise doubts about the confession and render what was an apparently voluntary confession involuntary.</P>
    <P>There are other cases I could quote but time does not permit.  I know that a number of my colleagues and Members of the Opposition want to contribute.  In the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions v. Pringle, judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, 2 May 1981, which referred to an appalling incident at Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon, where gardaí gave chase to people who had robbed a bank and a garda was shot dead after an exchange of gun-fire. Nobody had any sympathy for the perpetrators of that crime.  From a layman's point of view, it would be obvious to a five year old child watching a reconstruction of that crime on television that Pringle was guilty.  One of the perpetrators of the crime got away but the Garda found Pringle hiding out, wounded and armed.  Nevertheless, the Court of Criminal Appeal went to great lengths to examine the extent of his interrogation &mdash; so far as I can recall this was not in dispute &mdash; and applied the test of <i>voluntarius</i> to it.</P>
    <P>If I was a cynical person I would say Deputy Spring had opportunistic motives for bringing forward this Bill at this time. I would also say he wants to command the Left, he is worried about the challenge of The Workers' Party, he wants to be seen as the champion of civil liberties and he wants to cash in on the publicity surrounding the unfortunate Guildford Four who have suffered quite enough.  If I was cynical I would say that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that if the Government were to accept this Bill, which was conceived and prepared in haste by Deputy Spring, it would result in a fundamental blow to the system of criminal justice in this country.  I hold constituency clinics a few times a week as do Deputy Ferris, Deputy Spring and every other Deputy in this House &mdash; fortunately or unfortunately, as the case may be, that is why we remain in this House &mdash; and some of the complaints I hear relate to the level of crime, the lack of protection people have and how people accused of crimes can walk out of court on a technicality because police cannot prove the case.  While arguments can be advanced for the main part of Deputy Spring's Bill there is no doubt that it would give rise to a huge increase in the process I have spoken about and almost insurmountable difficulties would be placed in front of the Garda in a great number of criminal cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to give the House one brief example of this.  I recall at the start of the eighties hearing an announcement on a radio news programme that a girl from, I think, County Mayo had disappeared without trace.  There were all sorts of rumours going around about her disappearance, one of which referred to two Englishmen who were visiting the country.  Descriptions of these people were given out on television, radio and in the newspapers and we were told to report anything suspicious or whether we had seen anybody who looked like these men.  A couple of weeks later another girl disappeared without trace in County Wicklow.  The level of terror rose and people were afraid to walk the streets in <Col N="1427" /> certain areas because it was rumoured that those people had been seen there.</P>
    <P>Due to good detective work they were eventually apprehended.  One of them made a statement incriminating the other.  This case of the Director of Public Prosecutions v. John Shaw culminated in an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  If anybody is interested in reading about this case it is reported on page 8 of the 1980 <i>Irish Reports.</i>  Maybe my reading of the case is in some way flawed but if the law was as Deputy Spring proposes it would not have been possible to convict that individual.  Nobody doubted that the man was guilty, and nobody doubts it to this day.  There is no great outcry for the release of John Shaw, the Essex One, who is languishing in Mountjoy, because everybody knows, including John Shaw, he is guilty.  Under the law which Deputy Spring proposes John Shaw would have walked away.  Is that the sort of system of criminal justice he wants us to have?  If it is, he is welcome to it but it is not the sort of system I want to see in this country and it is not the sort of system we should have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>How is the Deputy so sure about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not to say that there are no problems in the present system. Of course, there are problems.  There will always be problems and we will never get a perfect system but the solution to those problems lies in reducing the possibility of improper confessions being obtained by the Garda.  We should reduce the possibility of the Garda obtaining improper confessions from people.  That is the road we should go.  This is what the Minister has suggested and it is the road the Government intend to go.  It is the right, logical and only road to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regardless of what legislation is introduced in this House, a great deal will depend on the integrity and honesty of both the Garda and the Judiciary.  I have seen no great evidence, except for one appalling period in our history, of widespread corruption, fraud or attempts by <Col N="1428" /> the Garda to fit people up.  So far as the courts are concerned, all the evidence is the other way.  The best protection which can be given to an accused person lies not only in the honesty of the Garda but in the vigilance of the Judiciary.  The Judiciary must ensure, as they have continually tried to ensure in the past, that confessions of guilt are truly voluntary and accord with Judge's Rules.  Even if they are voluntary and accord with Judge's Rules, they should also accord with the principle enshrined in the Constitution whereby an accused person is entitled to a fair trial.</P>
    <P>There are also a number of other things we can do.  The Minister referred to the Treatment Regulations under the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  These are exacting regulations which lay down the rules for interrogation of prisoners.  They incorporate the recommendations of the Ó Briain Committee.  I am sure there are members of the Labour Party who would not like to be reminded of the circumstances under which the Ó Briain Committee came into existence in 1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to that. The power of the Minister for Justice to make regulations for the audio and visual taping of Garda interrogations was proposed in conjunction with the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  It is a matter of regret to me that those regulations have not yet been put in place.  However, I note from what the Minister said that preparations for these regulations are far advanced and it is my earnest and honest hope that they will be introduced in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the possibility of providing for mandatory warnings to a jury about the danger of convicting a person solely on the basis of uncorroborated confessions.  That is a worth-while recommendation.  I do not think it is strictly necessary because I believe juries will be conscious of this <Col N="1429" /> themselves.  Certainly in the case of non-jury trials the Judiciary are always conscious of this.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the record of the Government, of which Deputy Spring was Tánaiste, between 1982-87.  They introduced the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  I participated on the Committee Stage of that Bill and anybody who has studied the debates on that legislation in the Official Report will know that the legislation which ultimately emerged was very different from the legislation which was initially proposed.  That was because a number of Deputies from all sides of the House, with the shameful exception of the Labour Party &mdash; and the record will show that &mdash; participated in the debate. The Minister for Justice at that time, my constituency colleague, Deputy Michael Noonan, was receptive to our ideas and we managed to have some provisions taken out of that Bill which were nothing more than an echo of the penal code which was introduced in the Soviet Union in the thirties by that other great civil libertarian, Joseph Stalin, to whom I understand some of Deputy McCartan's party still owe allegiance.  That is the record of the Government in which Deputy Spring participated.  I accept his motives and I take them at face value but the Bill is flawed.  The solution lies in another direction and I do not have any hestitation in recommending to the House that it should reject the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tempted to answer directly some of the very obvious mistakes in law and fact outlined by Deputy O'Dea but I shall endeavour to address them as I proceed and in the context of what I intend to say.  In introducing the Bill Deputy Spring indicated that his proposal arose directly out of and in the aftermath of the Guildford Four case.  It is worth recalling some of the more salient features of that unfortunate saga and relate them to what we are attempting to address and deal with in the debate.  On 5 October two bombs exploded in public houses in Guildford killing five people and injuring about 50 others.  On 7 November 1974 another <Col N="1430" /> bomb was thrown through the window of a pub in Woolwich killing two innocent people and injuring 27 other innocent people.  The Irish Republican Army were responsible for those atrocities and it would be remiss of all Members of the House in a debate like we are having not to record yet again our condemnation of their practices, their objectives and their methods.</P>
      <P>Within one month of those two atrocities four people were arrested, detained questioned and charged.  Paul Hill, Gerard Conlon, Carole Richardson and Patrick Armstrong were charged and brought before the courts charged with offences relating to Guildford and Hill and Armstrong were also charged, though subsequently not prosecuted, with offences relating to Woolwich.  The four were convicted solely on statements of admission extracted from them while detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, then in operation, in circumstances in which they were deprived of both sleep and food, without access to lawyers or legal advice and in consequence of beatings inflicted on them. They were kept in isolation and without any form of supervision whatever.</P>
      <P>It has now been established that important alibi evidence and testimony that would have been helpful to the defence in the course of their trial was wilfully withheld from them and their lawyers by police officers and senior officers of the courts of the highest standing.  Those problems, and the problems of poor police practices and of dishonest practices by lawyers of the courts and officers of the courts, including in this instance the Director of Public Prosecutions and the now Attorney General in the British Administration, Sir Michael Havers, cannot be addressed in the form of a Bill but, nonetheless, they spring directly from the facts and must be addressed in any debate on the consequences of the sorry saga.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The accused, in time, were convicted and sentenced.  The conditions and lengths of their sentences, are worth mentioning because they were a direct consequence of what happened at the <Col N="1431" /> time.  Carole Richardson, then a minor, was sentenced to life imprisonment at the pleasure of Her Majesty the Queen; Gerald Conlon was sentenced to life not to be released until at least 30 years had expired; Patrick Armstrong was sentenced to life until at least 35 years had expired and Paul Hill was sentenced to life never to be released except in the greatest exceptions involving age or infirmity.</P>
    <P>The conditions Paul Hill was detained under are worth mentioning.  On a visit to him in October 1987 he recalled to me, and other Members, that he had at that time served 1,441 days in solitary confinement. In fact, at the time of his release he had spent more than three years at various times in solitary confinement. He told us that he had been awarded £1,500 by a court of law for beatings he had sustained at the hands of others when in Hull Prison, that he had been moved in October 1987 on 47 occasions to different prisons and that he had never spent longer than six weeks in any one cell.  Those conditions were imposed upon him, and his co-accused, arising directly out of what has been described as, and rightly so, a monstrous conspiracy of deceit by the Guildford police force involved in the investigation. They are problems that we cannot address in a Bill of this type.</P>
    <P>In time those people were afforded an appeal but that appeal was inadequate to deal with the pressures and prejudices that existed or to try to redress the wrongs that had been perpetuated at the trial.  It is a similar tribunal that has been mentioned in the context of the Bill before us for the purposes of reviewing cases as and when they might arise here.  The Court of Appeal then, and I believe the Court of Appeal now, will be unable to probe into, address or deal with the scale of the problems that can arise in circumstances similar to those that occurred in Guildford and similar to a number of cases that we have experienced in our jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>In time the Balcombe Street accused, when arrested and sentenced, made admissions in regard to the crimes for <Col N="1432" /> which the Guildford Four had been convicted. Their evidence was brought before the Court of Criminal Appeal in Britain and, again, the court, and the lawyers were not prepared to be swayed or offer any relief to the four innocent people then serving sentences for the Guildford bombings.</P>
    <P>The case of Annie Maguire arose directly from the detention of the Guildford Four.  The evidence used in the Guildford case was employed to convict those in the Maguire case.  The statements or information extracted from the Guildford accused were used to lead the police directly to the family.  That is not addressed in the Bill and it could not be but we must deal with it and we would be remiss in not mentioning it tonight. Finally, in the context of referring to the Guildford Four case, tribute should be paid by the House to the three solicitors involved.  Alastair Logan, from the outset as a young lawyer in Guildford stood by the accused in the face of huge pressures and animosity both from within and outside his profession.  We should also pay tribute to Gareth Pierce and Michael Fisher.  The House should record its appreciation of their commitment and unrelenting drive for justice on behalf of their clients.</P>
    <P>Those facts help to put into context what we have to try to address in the debate tonight and in any legislation we seek to draw up.  I should like to deal firstly with the matter of questioning, interrogation and admissions that might arise.  I should like to make a point to Deputy O'Dea, and anybody else who suggests that we have not had abuses in this area brought before our courts.  I worked through the period he appeared to be referring to &mdash; he did not specify it &mdash; a period of black history as far as police investigation is concerned, the era of the heavy gang, as a professional solicitor and I can say that we have perpetrated Guildfords in this jurisdiction. Unless we address the law and take steps to protect accused people in the future we will commit them again.</P>
    <P>The fundamental question in this context is whether we are prepared to <Col N="1433" /> address the drift towards police interrogation and investigation centering in the police station and relying on a police station orientated investigation entirely. Are we prepared to allow the law, and conditions of the law, to continue so that we will prosecute by admission, and admission only?  This trend in our law, and it definitely exists, is closely linked to times of panic when we were faced with crimes of atrocity and terror in our jurisdiction.  I believe it started in 1973 when we capitulated in this House in the face of terrorist bombs in the city and introduced the infamous Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act.  It was repeated in 1976 with the Emergency Powers Act, where powers can be introduced by the mere resolution of the Minister to allow for seven days detention of accused persons.  This is a specific provision which aids and abets the form of police station oriented investigation and leads to abuse, the type of power that was used so effectively in the Guildford Four case under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.</P>
    <P>We have continued to use the 1939 Offences Against The State Act for crimes that were not specifically intended as offences against the State.  The statistics given by the Minister show that over 1,000 people per annum are detained under the Act and in the vast majority of cases this leads to no charge or court action.  The blackest moment in the trend towards police station interrogation as a means of solving crime was the administrative decision by the Minister for Justice of the day to introduce the interrogation squad, now known and exposed in <i>The Irish Times</i> as the heavy gang.  Guildford type crimes were perpetrated by them during our time.  Some people are still in prison, serving sentences as a result of activities of that squad.  It would be wrong of us not to mention this and be clear about it.  We will do no service to this debate if we are not prepared to recognise our own potential faults in this area and by doing so recognise the potential for faults in the future.</P>
    <P>The work of the heavy gang led to the <Col N="1434" /> establishment of the Ó Briain commission. The main thrust of the Ó Briain report, which was available in 1978, has not yet been acted upon.  The report advocated that where an accused is brought into custody for questioning under any circumstances, he should be afforded the benefit of a custodian guardian, somebody appointed by a sergeant or somebody of higher rank or, under section 30, an inspector or a policeman of upper rank with explicit duty or obligation to look after the interests of the person detained.  That has not been acted on.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, in 1984 we introduced the Criminal Justice Act which allows for a minimum six hours detention. As illustrated at the time and as is the reality today, depending on the hour of the day or the circumstances of detention this can mean the accused being detained for questioning for 40 hours and upwards.  The Act advocated full video taping and recording of any interview. This comes to the nub of the issue on how we can act.  The concept of corroboration will not provide the remedy Deputy Spring is looking for.  What we must do is invade the police station interrogation centre and interview room with all of the safeguards available to us that have been advocated and recommended since 1978. The 1984 Act allows for video taping and recording.  The Minister of that administration and the current Minister have not acted to introduce regulations under that provision.  The Ó Briain report has been ignored.  To suggest that the provisions of the 1984 Act take on board the main thrust of the Ó Briain report is to mislead the House in its purport and intent.  The idea of a custodian guardian is good if it were properly implemented and utilised.  I believe we can never introduce safeguards to the extent we need them in the context of corroboration. However, we can bring some form of scrutiny and security into the interrogation and interview centre so as to satisfy any court of inquiry on a subsequent date that matters were as either side maintains. The essential ingredient of the <Col N="1435" /> argument is that confessions or statements of admission are potentially good evidence, even where they stand on their own.  It would be a mistake to introduce an absolute law excluding the statement of confession or admission simply because there was not any other extraneous evidence supporting it.  I appreciate that Deputy Spring has said he is prepared to flesh out the content of the Bill.  This has been welcomed as it has helped us to address this debate and I welcome his receptiveness to our suggestion that he look further at it.</P>
    <P>People who commit murder often admit to their crime out of remorse.  It is not unusual that a person who has committed a serious crime goes into a Garda station years later saying that he can no longer live with the deed and must bare his chest.  Are we to say that such a person, making a full and voluntary confession, should not stand liable to conviction? I doubt it.  Often a person caught red-handed during the course of a crime will admit to other crimes of a similar nature committed in the same locality or in similar fashion as a means of ingratiating himself to the investigative personnel and should suffer the wrath of the court when presented for sentence.  Are we to say that these crimes should go unrecorded simply because no other extraneous evidence is offered?  Where an accused makes an admission we have to address seriously the circumstances in which we would allow that accused retract his statement simply because the police had failed to establish extraneous evidence.  These are features that should be looked into.  The Minister has offered a mechanism whereby an expert committee will examine the case.  These aspects should be looked at much more carefully.</P>
    <P>I do not say that the principle contained in Deputy Spring's provision is entirely wrong, but it certainly needs modification. It is well capable of modification in the course of due deliberation.  The concept of corroboration is difficult and has caused difficulties not only in this House but in the courts with the result <Col N="1436" /> that the trend is to move away from the concept of corroboration, as instanced by the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a misunderstanding in the course of the address made by Deputy Spring with regard to the law on referrals in Britain. I have to mention this because it is central to my critique on the way the British authorities have handled the referral of cases.  The same provision as he proposes in his Bill exists in English law under section 17 of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1968.  As my time is limited I will not read it out in full.  What has happened under this provision, which has possibly led to misunderstanding, is that the Home Secretary has extended it by administrative definition.  Douglas Hurd has consistently refused to refer cases under its provisions by insisting on material extra evidence being established.  When an injustice is investigated so many years after the act it is exceptionally difficult to address that requirement.  That is why the Guildford Four case has been so slow in being referred back to the Court of Appeal, that the Birmingham Six Case is in the logjam and that we cannot get the opportunity to address the wrong in the Annie Maguire case.  Nonetheless, this provision is welcome and is an important addition to our armoury.  For that reason I commended this provision to the Minister for consideration in any legislation he subsequently examines in the light of the report of the committee of experts.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that in the course of this debate no one has seriously suggested that there is anything wrong in principle with an administrative officer like the Minister or the President granting pardon or clemency in circumstances where we in this House or the public at large can identify or expose an injustice.  I pay belated tribute to the Minister for Justice of the day for the premature release of Nicky Kelly from serving the full sentence that was imposed on him.  There were still a long number of years to serve when he was released.  No one suggested <Col N="1437" /> at that stage that there was any interference with the administration of justice and no one would complain in any circumstances if a Minister were to act to revert a case to the Court of Appeal or to grant clemency or pardon, to the extent he can under the 1951 Act.  It is an important principle to recognise that our courts are limited in the way they can address cases and in the way they can redress wrongs when they arise.  The Court of Criminal Appeal has a limited jurisdiction.  It is a creature of statute and it works within very defined parameters. There are instances where it cannot simply put right what has initially been put wrong.  How can the Court of Appeal reconstruct the prejudice, the pressures and the anxieties of those investigating and prosecuting to get someone to answer for the great atrocities of Birmingham and Guildford ten, 12 or 15 years later when they inquire into the facts?</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of concern about the way the Court of Appeal is trammelled by its own rules.  In recent cases lawyers arguing for appellants constantly sought to broaden the terms of reference of the Court of Appeal so that it could act as a tribunal of inquiry.  Perhaps the Minister would ask the committee of experts to examine whether a case could be made for broadening the terms of reference and powers of the Court of Appeal.</P>
    <P>I welcome Deputy Spring's Bill as it gives us an opportunity to address the issues arising out of the Guildford case.  It has its obvious limitations.  It is a modest proposal but it is one which has at least prompted a good response.  I welcome the establishment of the committee of experts as announced by the Minister. While he will not have a right of reply, before the end of this debate he may be able to tell us what their terms of reference will be, give us some indication of when he expects them to report and if he is prepared to act on all or only on those recommendations he selects.  The Ó Briain report was to have been acted upon but this did not happen.  Provisions inserted into the 1984 Act have not been acted upon.  I would like to get a firm <Col N="1438" /> commitment from the Minister before the end of this debate that whatever recommendations the Martin committee of experts make they will be acted upon.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it would be wrong of us to pass from any debate or discussion on these issues without referring to the Birmingham Six case.  Six innocent people are still languishing in prison.  I was in the Court of Appeal in London when the most recent judgment was handed down, in December last year.  In the last sentence of his judgment I recall Lord Lane directing a very strong word of warning to the Home Secretary.  He pointed out that in the course of the appeal he had listened, and the more he listened the more he became convinced that the verdict at the original trial was right and the appellants would not be allowed to appeal.  He said he wanted the Home Secretary to take those matters on board in considering whether to send any further cases before that tribunal in similar circumstances.  Lord Lane was telling Douglas Hurd that he did not want the Guildford case or the Annie Maguire case to be presented before his court.</P>
    <P>We must remember that it was the investigation carried out by the Somerset and Avon police which exposed the miscarriage of justice in the Guildford case, and not the Court of Appeal in Britain, Lord Lane, or anyone else like him.  We must redouble our efforts and not seek to have the Birmingham Six case sent back to the Court of Criminal Appeal in Britain as it will not get the type of investigation or inquiry it deserves, but rather we should press the Home Secretary, Mr. Waddington, to ensure that at an early stage the Royal prerogative of pardon is visited upon those unfortunate six people and that they be released without delay.</P>

      <P>I did not want to interrupt the Deputy but from recollection I think he stated that there were Guildford Four cases in this State. I think he made that statement.

      <P>I too welcome this Bill, limited and flawed as it may be, as it gives us the opportunity to cover the ground covered by Deputy O'Dea, by the Minister last night and by Deputy McCartan in perhaps a more provocative way.  I too feel that all human institutions are frail and we can never be confident that our institutions have not been as frail as our neighbours.  Circumstances at a particular time may force institutions and human beings in a particular direction. An attempt is being made with this Bill to close loopholes in the law which have been highlighted by the recent dramatic and welcome developments in the case of Gerard Conlon, Patrick Armstrong, Paul Hill and Carole Richardson, the Guildford Four.  Above all else, that case and the related cases of Annie Maguire and her family and the Birmingham Six teach us the folly of putting blind and stubborn faith in any human institution. The blind faith among the establishment figures in Britain, their almost mystical belief in the truth and efficacy of judicial institutions have been illuminated for what they are, the ultimate in human folly, by this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Guildford case has also illuminated the human frailty of the prisoner under pressure following an arrest.  This is a point which was covered more than adequately by Deputy McCartan.  Young men, such as Paul Hill and Gerard Conlon, picked up for a crime in which they played absolutely no part were, under duress, willing not only to ignore their own innocence but to confess guilt and, even more dramatically, to implicate other innocent people.  There were circumstances which I hope, but doubt, are unique to the Guildford and Birmingham cases.  At the time there was mass hysteria, political clamour for revenge and a fanatical gutter press fanning this hysteria.  More importantly, although related to all of those points, <Col N="1440" /> there existed within the police establishment &mdash; and it seems now within the highest levels of the British judicial administration &mdash; a great evil, an evil which led otherwise good men to do what was wrong, an evil which led good people to do what was bad.  That evil led those men to stand doggedly by their great untruth through the long and tragic years when Annie Maguire and her family rotted in British cells, during which Giuseppe Conlon died and through the thousands of days of solitary confinement of Paul Hill.</P>
    <P>More importantly, the same stubborn adherence contributes to this day to the continued torment of Hugh Callaghan, Patrick Hill, Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, Billy Power and John Walker, the Birmingham Six, and their families.  I say these things not out of any sense of triumphalism nor because I harbour any ill-will towards the nation in which these black events occurred, but rather because they illustrate the need for a move in the direction which this Bill hopes to propel us.  The need for some means of reviewing a case even after the final court of the land has given its final view, where the circumstances emerging over time so require, and the need to ensure the validity of the conviction won on the basis of uncorroborated evidence, are pressing needs indeed.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said last night in reply to Deputy Spring there is a sufficient similarity between the laws and institutions of justice of this land and the institutions and laws of the United Kingdom to justify our being sufficiently concerned at the unthinkable vista which has been opened by the Guildford case. There is a sufficient similarity between our institutions, our police procedures and our courts and those in Britain for us to be anxious to very urgently review the operation of our own system of justice.</P>
    <P>There is no difference between us on this aspect of the matter.  There is a need for great urgency in strengthening our institutions in response to the weaknesses which are now evident.  Last night Deputy Spring said it would strengthen our hand in our contacts with the British <Col N="1441" /> if we put our own house in order &mdash; I am not so sure that contacts with the British would be my primary motive in looking for improvements in our system. However I share his interest in improving our system where such improvements are needed.  The only difference between us lies in the manner of our response.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea has already focused on the issue of confessions.  I avoid repetition I will focus on what could be termed the institutional side of the issues raised by Deputy Spring.  While I do not wish to cover ground already covered and I have not the expert knowledge to cover the aspects of confessions covered by Deputy O'Dea and the Minister last night and by Deputy McCartan just now, there is a central folly in the proposition contained in the Bill which would attempt to ban convictions on the basis of an inculpatory statement unless the evidence is corroborated by some other material evidence.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have amply illustrated that this is not a workable proposition.  It is clear, as Deputy McCartan said, that sometimes many years after a crime, when evidence has gone, an individual may turn up and confess due to feelings of guilt or remorse or whatever, and it would be wrong if the crime were to remain unsolved simply because we moved in the direction proposed in the Bill.  It is equally true that occasionally sometimes hideous crimes occur such as the one to which Deputy O'Dea referred where young girls in Galway and a young girl in Mayo were murdered, where ultimated very limited evidence is produced but a conviction is gained because of a confession.  As Deputy O'Dea said at that time, it is obvious that the persons involved in those crimes were as guilty as sin and it would have been very wrong indeed if they could not have been visited with the full rigours of the law simple because we were hidebound in the manner envisaged in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring will agree, on mature reflection, that that portion of the Bill was perhaps drafted in haste and is clearly unworkable.  I do not wish to impute any negative suggestion or motive to Deputy <Col N="1442" /> Spring.  The Bill is welcome because it gives us the opportunity to focus on those things.  Deputy Spring's proposals also have an important institutional aspect and in the remainder of my comments I will focus on that.</P>
    <P>There is a flaw in the institutional proposition put before us by Deputy Spring. Deputy Spring suggests that we should import a provision which exists in section 17 of the English Criminal Appeals Act, 1968.  Deputy McCartan is probably attributing too much to himself when he suggests that he was the first person to spot that aspect of the Bill, because he was not.  It is odd that in terms of our law this should be our response to the Guildford case.  It is very odd indeed if one looks at the circumstances of that case and at the circumstances of the Birmingham Six case.  The problem in the case of the Guildford Four, in the case of the Birmingham Six and in the Maguire case is not that there was a lack of a mechanism to permit a review.  As Deputy McCartan said, echoing what the Minister said last night, there is in British law a mechanism for a review.  Whatever the problem was in these cases it was not the lack of a review mechanism.  If any conclusion can be reached from the British experience it must surely be that the safeguards along the lines of section 17 of the 1968 English Act do not work or at least that they are unlikely to work unless special circumstances exist.</P>
    <P>There were after all very special circumstances in the case of the Guildford Four.  There was a constabulary which was clean, which was interested in justice and which was willing to contemplate the vista which Lord Denning and others like him felt could not be contemplated, that is, the vista of mass police collaboration in committing a crime.  There was also the fact that the original police paper work was still on file 15 years after the case.  It is obvious that the original investigating constabulary were cock-a-hoop that they had hidebound these innocent men, to the extent that they could leave this incriminating evidence lying on file. I have no doubt that if we went with fine tooth combs through all the police files <Col N="1443" /> involved in the Birmingham Six case, whatever the chances were before Somerset and Avon came up with this extraordinary finding in the Guildford case, there would be no trace of such evidence now.</P>
    <P>Contrast the case of the Guildford Four with the case of the Birmingham Six.  There is now clear evidence that the West Midlands force, the investigating force in that case, were, and until recently remained, not just willing and able but as force of habit bent the rules to get convictions.  This has now been proved to the point where the British Home Office has been sufficiently concerned to move in the direction of an investigation.  Sadly, the Home Secretary stopped pushing that investigation far enough back to benefit the Birmingham Six.  There has for a long time been positive proof as to the criminal incapacity of the forensic scientist in this case and there remains the stubborn unwillingness of those who advised the British Home Secretary and of those who have been Home Secretary to recognise that this case, too, is wrong.</P>
    <P>Two years ago I with other Members of the House including Deputy McCartan met with the British Home Secretary and raised the case of the Six.  The infirmity of the case against the Six was put very clearly, as it had been put before and since to Mr. Hurd and as it has recently been put to Mr. Hurd's successor.  The response which came back was complex but always negative.  The fact is that the institutional arrangement envisaged in section 17 of the 1968 Criminal Appeal Act in England is a political one and it requires politicians with strength to put it into effect.  The system which operates in England under the 1968 Act is too political and too subject to pressure, even self-imposed pressures as, for example, happened in the case of Mr. Hurd, to work well.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Birmingham Six it was pointed out to the Home Secretary &mdash; it was pointed out more than once when we met him, by Deputy Andrews &mdash; that forensic tests which were applied to the Six by Mr. Skuse were unsafe and <Col N="1444" /> that on the basis of the evidence which subsequently emerged were also probably doctored.  If any human being wanted clear evidence that something was wrong and that there was something new in this case, that was the evidence, and yet the Home Secretary cautioned us that one could not import either forensic science standards which existed in the late 1980s or even the judicial standards relating to the quality of evidence which existed in the late 1980s into a reconsideration of a trial which took place in the late 1970s.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to pillory a member of the British establishment or a person for whom I have some respect, but if those human errors can occur in Britain we would be foolish to suggest that they could not be repeated here.  I do not make the point to pillory Mr. Hurd but to illustrate how infirm the type of measures envisaged by Deputy Spring in this Bill are.  It would be wrong, for a variety of reasons, to try to introduce the restriction on convictions through confessions.  Secondly, the institutional aspect of the Bill, would not, I feel, be workable.  Nor, on the basis of the experience that we have from Britain, would that section of British law imported into Irish law have a great deal to recommend it.  I am not saying this to in any way attack or undermine Deputy Spring's bona fides in this matter.  Before he came into the House, I had congratulated him on introducing the Bill because it is important that we should at this time sit back and not just criticise British institutions but review the operation of Irish institutions.  We cannot throw stones if we have not put our own House in order.</P>
    <P>The Minister last night said that the nature of criminal justice inevitably involves a dilemma as to how errors should be corrected.  That is our dilemma now.  The Minister responded to Deputy Spring's proposals in great detail.  I have neither the time nor the technical expertise to go into them in as detailed a fashion as he did.  The Minister informed us last night &mdash; and this was very welcome &mdash; that he had received the permission of the Government to proceed with the <Col N="1445" /> appointment of the Martin Committee. It strikes me that a review along the lines envisaged by the Minister is the best response to the circumstances in which we find ourselves at this time.</P>
    <P>Our law is very complex.  There is a whole set of factors which come into interplay at this time.  Our laws are different from those in the UK not least because we have a fine Constitution, a well drafted Constitution, a Constitution which has passed the test of time.  I feel that Deputy Spring should folow the Minister's suggestion and withdraw this Bill, secure in the knowledge that the concern which prompted him to propose these measures are commonly shared on all sides of the House, he can derive some satisfaction from the fact that the Minister chose this occasion to announce the appointment of the commission.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to compliment the Minister on his actions.  It is time to conduct the type of review he suggested last night.  I am sure all Members of the House will join with me in wishing Judge Martin and the members of the committee every success in the speedy fulfilment of the ardous task that lies ahead of them.</P>

      <P>In speaking on this Bill tonight I would like to refer to what has been said by the Minister and particularly by my colleague on the Government side of the House, Deputy Willie O'Dea.  He said, that on the one hand, he did not wish to be facetious or to accuse Deputy Spring of ulterior motives or liberalism, but on the other hand suggested that if we wanted to have criminals running free it was not the kind of jurisdiction that he, Deputy O'Dea, wanted.  That was an unfair accusation particularly from a person who has had no experience whatsoever in the Department of Justice, as Deputy Spring has had, or indeed in Cabinet, as had Deputy Spring where he was privy to what was before Cabinet on these important matters.  Deputy O'Dea withdrew his remarks but, at the same time, got them on the record.  Deputy Spring's bona fides should not be questioned by somebody of the calibre of Deputy <Col N="1446" /> O'Dea.  Nor should the bona fides of the Labour Party be questioned in this manner because we have a strong record both in and out of Government in this area, a record that we, as the oldest political party in the country are proud of. We owe no apologies to Deputy O'Dea for introducing this kind of legislation in Private Members' time.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer in particular to what was said by the Minister for Justice last night.  Then I want to outline my party's response to the proposal the Minister has put forward for dealing with the issues that are under discussion in this Bill.  I do not intend to do more than summarise the arguments put forward in favour of our Bill because these were adequately ventilated last night by Deputy Spring.</P>
      <P>To summarise, in the aftermath of the Guildford Four case, a number of responsible commentators have made the important point that there can be little room for complacency in our jurisdiction about a number of the issues that arose in this case.  Two specific points were made.  First it will be remembered that the case was referred to the court of appeal by the British Home Secretary. There is no equivalent procedure here.  If a similar injustice were to occur in Ireland &mdash; and we hope and pray that there would never be a similar injustice here &mdash; there would be no way in which a case could be re-opened by a court.  The Guildford Four case has also thrown into sharp relief the practice that applies both in England and in Ireland of relying solely on confessions to secure convictions.  The facts of the Guildford case have raised serious doubts about the propriety of this practice which does not apply throughout the United Kingdom.  In Scotland, for instance, the Rules of Evidence provide that an accused person cannot be convicted solely on the basis of an uncorroborated confession.  That is why we have asked the Dáil to agree to this short, simple Private Members' Bill which deals with both of these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally there has been a welcome for the fact that the Labour Party initiated this Bill, first because it allows <Col N="1447" /> Members to discuss what has happened in another jurisdiction but to reserve their position about whether it could happen in this jurisdiction.  It provides for a reference procedure which can be availed of by the Minister for Justice.  It also introduces a rule that no accused person can be convicted solely on his own uncorroborated confession made in police custody. There is a case to be answered; we must put our own house in order.  In this House and at public meetings etc, we have all criticised the British approach to justice.  We have criticised the British approach to justice for Irish citizens in particular and have done so in the recent past.  There is no doubt that we will continue to do so whenever such criticisms seem warranted.  We believe there would be widespread support here for any measure that would ensure that we could never have a Guildford Four case in Ireland.  Irrespective of what Deputy McCartan may have said, we feel that nobody here would like to see a case like that occurring here.</P>
    <P>The Minister took what can only be described as a strange position in relation to the Bill we have put forward.  In the first place he appears to have gone a long way towards recognising that the deficiencies in the law which the Bill highlights do exist.  He expresses sympathy with us about the intentions of the Bill. However, the Minister's contribution stops a long way short of proposing urgent action on an issue that he appears to recognise requires urgent action.</P>
    <P>There is a number of points in the Minister's speech with which we take issue.  Many of the arguments put forward by the Minister last night are simply wrong.  In our opinion the Minister's response is not correct.  It is necessary for us at this stage to deal with this matter in a sympathetic way.  The Minister made the point that in the event of a Guildford-Four-type case arising here it would be possible for the Government to recommend a pardon to the President and to free the wrongly convicted person by that method.  That misses the point of our Bill entirely.  I suggest that the Minister take <Col N="1448" /> cognisance of our position in that regard. Clemency is possible under the British system, so is a Queen's pardon.  The safeguard, as the Minister called it, a presidential pardon, is copied directly from British law into our law.  Still under British law there was the Guildford Four case.  A pardon is not an acquittal.  We have heard evidence from people who were convicted in England, wrongfully in our opinion, being offered pardons but they wanted to be acquitted of the charges levelled against them.</P>

      <P>I thank you for allowing me to bring to the attention of the House a calamity, for it is nothing short of that, in the town of Castlefinn in County Donegal along the Border.  Partition dealt this area a raw deal in 1921, as was the case of Donegal as a whole.  No county has suffered more from partition that County Donegal, a fact very often forgotten by successive Governments in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A family business was founded in Castlefinn in 1920 so it has been in existence since the foundation of this State. That family business has been employing people since, some of whom are now fourth generation.  Sixty-five jobs are at stake at the moment, but there is potential there for 100 jobs.  The company manufacture top quality shirts.  About two years ago they employed top marketing and production personnel to <Col N="1449" /> advise them on getting into a higher grade of production, which they did but that has not worked out too well.</P>
    <P>This factory was opened in 1982, the old factory having been destroyed by fire. The IDA and the other State agencies came to the rescue of Porter's factory at their time of crisis after the fire in 1979. The fire destroyed the building but it did not destroy the trade.  At the moment the company face a two pronged attack; they are short of capital because interest rates on borrowing are too high and, of course, they have a marketing problem.  They have a marketing problem in the export market and from cheap imports and that is causing a crisis.  It would be a calamity and no credit to any Government or any person in public life if we did not take a stand on this very severe crisis in a small community.  Here are a family who have been employing three and four generations of people in Castlefinn and who over the last 60 years have contributed in a major way to the economy through the pay packet, income tax, social welfare contributions and the spin-off effects in a small community.  There is but one month left.  The stocks on hand will keep them going for a month and then closure is threatened.</P>
    <P>Many people from that area are in my neighbourhood but in Deputy McGinley's constituency and they have a companionship in the factory that they are very proud of.  The labour force admire the way the factory has been managed and the management appreciate deeply the efforts put in by the workers who have been described as the best labour force in Ireland.  There are excellent factory premises, top rate workers and machinery that can manufacture garments that can compete with the best in the world.</P>
    <P>My appeal this evening to the Minister and the Government is to come to the rescue of the Porter factory in Castlefinn by making money available, if that is possible.  I see no reason it should not be possible.  Córas Tráchtála should step in and help in the marketing field.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the Porter family for the way they have handled this <Col N="1450" /> and for the concern they are showing in trying to keep the factory open.  They are in an impossible position.  I make this final appeal to the Minister to come to their aid because their contribution to the formation of this State and to its economy cannot go unnoticed at this time.  Castlefinn is a town devastated by unfair cross-Border trade.  People go across the Border to buy cheaper goods and the business people in Castlefinn are having a tough time.  It is depressing to go into the village at any time despite the best efforts of everyone concerned.  It will be totally devastated if this factory is allowed to close.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Harte, for sharing his limited time with me.  As he said, Castlefinn is in my constituency and the workers whose jobs are on the line at the moment are divided between the two constituencies. We are both very interested in the future of this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Harte said, Castlefinn is a Border town that has experienced the kind of difficulties that Border areas have been subjected to for many years.  It is in the Finn valley and while there is excellent agricultural land there, there are but few industries.  In Castlefinn itself the Porter family, who have had their factory there since 1920, were the main employers in the area and have provided excellent employment for between 60 and 70 workers these last 70 years.  They have produced an excellent quality shirt not alone for the Irish market but for the UK market.  Indeed, only months ago plans were announced by the Minister's predecessor, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, for major expansion at the factory, the job numbers were to be doubled there.  It came as a massive shock to the workers of Castlefinn last Monday week when they were put on notice that their jobs were on the line and that they had only a few weeks left.  As I said, there are very few industries in this part of Donegal.  Another major industry in the <Col N="1451" /> town of Convoy, a long established industry that employed hundreds of people, the Convoy Woollen Mills, closed down about two years ago.  If Castlefinn were to go now it would be a devastating blow to that area.  The workforce are mostly female but in that part of Donegal they are the main breadwinners for their families. If the factory is to close I can see it contributing certainly to higher unemployment in the area and ultimately to more emigration, something we can ill afford in Donegal.  We have one of the highest rates of unemployment in the country and the highest rate of emigration.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to get all the agencies involved, the IDA, his own Department and any other agency who could have an input into this to try to retrieve the jobs of these 60 to 70 people.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I reiterate what Deputy Harte has said, that the Porter family, first established in Derry at the beginning of the century, came into Donegal and have built up an excellent relationship with the people of Castlefin, particularly their own employees.  They are held in high esteem.  I ask the Minister to give every consideration to a solution so that the management and control of this factory will be left if at all possible with the Porter family.  If they were to leave the country or lose this factory after their record and the esteem they have earned in the community it would be a major blow to that part of the country.  I ask the Minister to keep these points in mind and do everything possible.  If the jobs go it will be a lean Christmas indeed for the 70 families who are dependent on the work in this factory for their livelihood and it will end in higher emigration and higher employment.  We are depending on the Minister to do his best.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the proposed closure of H. G. Porter Limited manufacturing operation at Castlefin, County Donegal.  That concern has been expressed here so well by Deputies Harte <Col N="1452" /> and McGinley and it has also been expressed by my colleagues, the Minister of State at the Department of the Gaeltacht, Deputy Gallagher, and Deputy Mary Coughlan.  Indeed, the consequences for the workforce involved, many of whom have given long years of service are serious.</P>
      <P>The firm in question has been operating in Castlefin since 1921 and had concentrate on the manufacture of shirts for the home market since 1966.  The company experienced difficulties over the years including the destruction of their premises by fire in 1979.  Adverse factors such as the advent of free trade, cheaper imports and changes in the market place with a growth in market share of the multiples have contributed to the firm's difficulties.  The elimination of tariff barriers, after our entry into the EC, resulted in rapid and very substantial penetration of our home market by imports from other member states and from low cost sources.</P>
      <P>The demise of the long-established Porter factory is another addition to the list of companies who have been unable to withstand this competition from imports.  I am conscious of the adverse impact, both economically and socially, of the loss of 61 jobs as a result of the proposed closure of the H. G. Porter factory and I have asked the Industrial Development Authority to do everything in their power to try, in the first instance, to advert to closure, if possible, or to secure an alternative industry for the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rationalisation and restructuring have taken place on a wide scale in the clothing industry since 1973 when we joined the EC.  This is part of an ongoing requirement to adopt changing market opportunities and to restructure to meet competition at home and abroad.  Nevertheless, the process has been a painful one with significant job losses.  Considerable resources have been employed in the past decade by the State to help clothing companies in this restructuring process and to increase their competitiveness. Strategies have been in place since the early eighties and are <Col N="1453" /> continually being refined to assist the industry in its efforts to rationalise and restructure.</P>
    <P>These strategies involve the State agencies working with companies to help them address their specific needs by assessing their competitive strengths and weaknesses, by increasing the scale, by assisting them to adopt a strategic marketing approach and to formulate appropriate action plans.  The clothing sector at present needs to strategically place itself in order to exploit the opportunities which 1992 will bring and also to withstand the challenges of increased competition.  It will be necessary for the sector to place increased emphasis on management, design and marketing functions and to exploit the advantages of quality and quick response to the needs of the consumer in order to remain competitive in the face of the inevitable increase in imports from low cost sources.</P>
    <P>The Deputies have expressed support for the factory and its product but, unfortunately, we have not complete control of the home market.  Indeed, there has been far too much imports into this country and far too many people are buying imported products and are not supporting companies such as H. G. Porter who are producing an excellent product.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that the Deputies' points have been noted here this evening. In consultation with the company and the IDA we are doing our utmost to assess the situation and to retain this industry, if possible, but otherwise to look at alternatives.</P>

      <P>Deputy Spring gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the many legal aid centres which are closed and the difficulty in getting an appointment in some that are open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity of raising the issue in relation to the legal aid board centres, both in the city of Dublin and throughout the country.  The reality is that there is now chaos in the provision of legal aid services.  It takes at least three months to secure an appointment at a legal aid centre outside of Dublin, and in the city of Dublin, as I understand it, the position is even worse. In many of the centres the doors are effectively closed because the centres cannot cope with the volume of business.</P>
      <P>The crisis in funding and staffing which has gripped the legal aid system has led to a point where the system is on the verge of collapse.  To make matters worse the centres which are half operational are expecting, and trying to plan for, an expected 25 per cent increase in clientele as a result of the Judicial Separation Act. For hundreds of families the availability of new legal remedies, under this Act, will simply not be open to them.  Families under stress will find that the months spent queueing for an appointment will, indeed, add to and exacerbate the difficulties with which they are living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party repeatedly warned during the Dáil debates on the Judicial Separation Bill that it would be essential to allow for a District Court jurisdiction if the legislation was to be of value.  Both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael consistently refused to make any concession on this <Col N="1455" /> point.  The immediate predecessor of the Minister for Justice promised in the Dáil during the discussions on that Bill that he would seek an extra allocation for free legal aid to enable the legal aid centres to cope with the obvious increase in demand and in pressure that would be generated by the Bill.  I should like to say to the Minister for Justice that he must now deliver on that promise made by his predecessor. I would also say that our legal aid system has undergone a period of crisis under the Finana Fáil administration and there are signs, as matters stand at present, that it will get worse. The essential reason is that the Government does not particularly care about the provision of a free legal aid service.</P>
    <P>There has been little or no increase in funding over the last number of years.  In fact, in the 1988 Estimates for the Office of the Minister for Justice there was a reduction of 1 per cent in the grant-in-aid for the Legal Aid Board.  This is at a time when the budgets of State legal agencies, such as the Office of the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions, will be increased by 7 per cent and 10 per cent respectively.</P>
    <P>The four new centres which were opened in 1984 are threatened with closure as there has been no provision made for Exchequer funding for these centres. The centres at Tralee, Athlone and Tallaght and the second centre in Cork were opened and financed with moneys which are now virtually exhausted and no provision has been made by way of Exchequer funding to substitute for this money.</P>
    <P>I would also add, from a practical point of view, in relation to the running of a rural legal aid office, with which I am familiar in the town of Tralee, that the likelihood is that the solicitor in the office will have to deal with courts within and up to a 50-mile radius.  In that centre there is one solicitor and one member of a clerical staff.  Quite often the solicitor will have to attend court on an emergency basis: it can be in County Clare or indeed in West Limerick.  This, in effect, means that all his appointments for that day <Col N="1456" /> have to be postponed when it is already taking up to three months to get an appointment.  It is a ludicrous situation whereby all the work load for that day has to be cancelled because of the failure of the Government to appoint, in this case, a second solicitor or even a temporary solicitor to help to cope with these situations.</P>
    <P>The Legal Aid Board are confronted with major difficulties.  I would like if the Minister of State, who is standing in for his colleague, the Minister for Justice, would be able to tell me that as of tomorrow morning, if it has not been happening already, action will be taken to bring some help and some comfort to the people who need legal aid.  There is a veritable crisis in the provision of civil legal aid and it seems certain that some centres throughout the country will have to be closed down if more money is not provided to back up the service generally. To underline the full impact, I emphasise that certain centres have had to close their doors for months on end to catch up on the backlog of work which has been accumulating.</P>
    <P>Even when the centres are open, as I know from my experience in Tralee, people still cannot get appointments. Most often appointments are needed to deal with emergency family problems concerning matters such as the custody of children.  A High Court Judge remarked recently in regard to such a case that legal aid was not available despite the urgent necessity of a woman looking for custody of her children.  Obviously if something is not done this will have serious effects. When people are looking for an appointment proceedings have frequently been initiated already.  People need to be able to respond by way of legal representation in such proceedings.  Quite often barring proceedings have to be adjourned or delayed to allow for legal representation. As everyone knows, justice delayed is justice denied.</P>
    <P>In the current Book of Estimates an additional 24 per cent is being provided in the allocation for free legal aid.  This provision is too late.  By then the crisis will be so severe that people working <Col N="1457" /> within the service will never catch up on the problem that now face them.  I would ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister for Justice that something must be done immediately because of the grave problems which many people, most often the weakest members of society, are facing due to their inability to gain access to the legal aid service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of the scheme of civil legal aid and advice in 1979-88 delivered on a commitment by the Government which went as far back as 1974 with the establishment of the Pringle committee on legal aid.  Many of the rules in the scheme are, despite claims to the contrary, in line with the recommendations contained in the Pringle report, published in 1977.  The setting up of the scheme also enabled the State to fulfil its obligations as regards access to justice as a result of the decision of the European Court of Justice in the Airey case in 1979.</P>
      <P>While I do not accept Deputy Spring's contention that the situation in the legal aid service is chaotic, unfortunately, the development of the scheme has not progressed as the Government would have wished.  The onset of severe difficulties with the public finances has meant that the expansion of the scheme has had to be curtailed along with many other programmes with public expenditure implications. The need to get public expenditure not only under control but to reduce it was, and still remains, the paramount consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some expansion since the scheme started to operate in 1980. This was possible as a result of the windfall non-Exchequer moneys made available for various purposes, including civil legal aid, in the Funds of Suitors Act, 1984.  That meant the opening of four additional law centres at Tallaght, Tralee, Cork and Athlone in the period 1985 to 1987.  This brought the number of full time law centres operated by the board to 12 and enabled it to open further part-time law centres, bringing their number to 19 in all.  Plans to open another <Col N="1458" /> four law centres at Dundalk, Portlaoise, Castlebar and Letterkenny had to be shelved regrettably because the funds of suitors available were only sufficient to finance the four additional centres already opened.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the public service staffing embargo brought with it further problems for the Legal Aid Board. Despite the filling of some posts on an exceptional basis which were lost because of the embargo, the board continued to suffer a reduction in their experienced staff, particularly among their solicitors.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, throughout these difficult years the board have endeavoured to meet the need for legal services.  That meant and continues to mean dedication way above the norm by the board's staff, particularly their solicitors who are in the front line, so to speak.</P>
    <P>I know that it is a feature of the scheme that some of the law centres have to close from time to time to new applications. When arrears of work are cleared, the centres re-open.  In some instances, notably in Dublin, this period of closure can be protracted and, of course, this is very regrettable.</P>
    <P>However, it needs to be stated that even while a law centre may be closed for a period to new cases, emergency cases, i.e. those cases which in the opinion of the board require immediate access to a solicitor, are dealt with as and when they arise.  The type of cases in this category include those where there may be the immediate threat of violence to a spouse or children, or sexual abuse or where there is a danger that a child may be removed from the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I do realise, nevertheless, that the scheme is under strain and that the visible signs of that are that more law centres are finding it difficult to cope with the demand for legal services.  Neither have I any problem in accepting that the new remedies available under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill, 1989, which is in force since 19 October last will place further demands on the board's resources.</P>
    <P>It was for these precise reasons that I was able to get certain concessions for <Col N="1459" /> the board.  It was not easy.  As I have already stated, the allocation of resources of any particular State funded body must be considered in the light of the constraints which apply to all areas of public expenditure at present.  Notwithstanding the difficult financial circumstances, I was able to get the necessary funding for the continued operation of the board's four law centres at Tallaght, Tralee, Cork and Athlone.  This is the first time since their establishment that those centres will be funded directly from the Exchequer. Their funding from other non-Exchequer sources expires at the end of this year.  I was also able to get approval for the board to recruit a substantial number of staff at both solicitor and administrative levels.  The number of such extra staff is 20 and includes seven additional solicitors.  The cost of these measures is in the region of £425,000 and brings the grant-in-aid available to the board in 1990 to £2.163 million, which is almost 25 per cent up on their figure for 1989.</P>
    <P>It has been claimed that this increase of £425,000 is misleading since it will chiefly go to keep open centres already in existence though funded from non-Exchequer sources.  The point I want to emphasise is that it is a real increase in the amount of taxpayers' money going to legal aid.  Nothing can take from that and it is a concrete expression of the Government's concern.</P>
    <P>I know that this does not go as far as the Legal Aid Board would have wished. There is no provision for extra law centres <Col N="1460" /> over and above the 12 now in operation and the board wanted more staff. However, I regard the measures as generous in the present circumstances. For the first time in recent years the board are actually getting an increase in their allocation, and a substantial one at that. My first priority in relation to the legal aid scheme is to get the existing service running reasonably smoothly again before any question of expansion is considered and the measures I have announced will assist in that aim.  One of the main consequences of the recruitment of additional staff should be an improvement in the waiting periods to see a solicitor at law centres.</P>
    <P>Of course I would like to come here and announce that the board could now open more law centres at several new locations, but I cannot.  We can only provide for what we can afford at present. That is not to say that when the financial climate improves the position cannot change.</P>
    <P>As regards the new remedies provided for in the Judicial Separation Act, I intend to keep the situation under review. If further measures are called for we may be able to make further provisions.  The House can be assured that I, in line with what I have done since coming to office, will accord the greatest priority possible to meeting these requirements as speedily as financial resources permit.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 23 November 1989.</P>

      <P>The contributory spouses' and children's pension schemes for members of the Permanent Defence Force are based on similar schemes which apply in other areas of the public service.  I am not aware of any anomalies in the case of dependants as suggested in the question.</P>
      <P>Under the Defence Forces pensions schemes, the minimum service required by an NCO or private to qualify for a pension and gratuity is 21 years and maximum pension is payable after 31 years' service &mdash; regardless of age in either case.  These arrangements are not paralleled in any other area of the public service.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> The Security Council of the United Nations has approved the establishment of a United Nations Observer Group in Central America (ONUCA) in response to requests from the Governments of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.  The mandate of ONUCA is to conduct on-site verification of: (a) the cessation of aid to irregular forces and insurrectionist movements and (b) the non-use of the territory of one state for attacks on other states.</P>
    <P>In response to a request from the Secretary-General, the Government have indicated their willingness to provide 18 officers for this mission.  These officers would be located in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and <Col N="1309" /> Costa Rica.  The detailed arrangements are at present being worked out and ONUCA is expected to be deployed in the next few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The combined strength of the Reserve Defence Force was 16,339 on 30 September 1987; 16,616 on 30 September 1988 and 16,686 on 30 September 1989. It is expected that the current strength levels will be maintained in 1990.</P>
      <P>The purpose of a first line reserve is to provide a pool of trained personnel who are available at short notice in aid of the civil power or in a time of emergency to increase the strength of understrength regular units.</P>
      <P>The FCA have mainly a local defence role which enables their units to provide military security in their own areas and to relieve Permanent Defence Force units in those areas when circumstances so require.  Similarly the role of the Slua Muirí is to assist the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>The reduced provision for the Reserve Defence Force in my Department's Estimate for 1990 reflects the termination earlier this year of the arrangements under which members of the FCA were employed on full time security duties. The majority of personnel concerned opted to join the Permanent Defence Force.</P>

I might point out that, under the Finance Act, 1986, pensioners and other persons aged 65 and over are entitled to a refund of deposit interest retention tax to the extent that they are not otherwise liable to tax on the relevant deposit interest.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 7 November 1985 and payment was authorised on the basis of her contribution record in 1983-84, the contribution year governing her claim. According to the records of the Department at that time she had 52 contributions paid at class A in this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Her insurance record was subsequently reviewed at the request of her employer <Col N="1330" /> and, following an oral hearing of the case on 24 November 1986, the appeals officer held that the employment from April 1983 was insurable at Class J.  As contributions paid at this class are not reckonable for disability benefit purposes, payment of benefit was disallowed.</P>
    <P>Following correspondence on the part of the person concerned the appeals officer agreed to re-open the case and a new hearing was scheduled for 2 October, 1989.  However, this hearing was postponed at the request of the solicitors acting for the person concerned. The case will be re-scheduled for hearing by an appeals officer as soon as possible. The matter will be reviewed in the light of the appeals officer's decision.</P>

      <P>The community alert programme was devised by Muintir na Tíre in response to a series of attacks in 1985 against elderly people living in rural areas.  It involves local communities working in close liaison with the Garda Síochána to identify elderly people who may be living in vulnerable situations. Members of communities participating in the scheme visit such people <Col N="1331" /> and report any suspicious events in their area to the Garda.  There are 166 such schemes in operation throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that it has recently been decided that the promotion of Community Alert should become a specific responsibility of the Community Relations Section of the Garda.  A working party has been established comprising officials from Muintir na Tíre and selected community relations and crime prevention officers to examine possible ways of expanding and improving the Community Alert programme.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities and Muintir na Tíre have my full support in their efforts to expand the programme and I am confident that their efforts will meet with a positive response from the entire community. Community involvement is of course a vital element in the continued success and expansion of Community Alert.</P>

      <P>Proposals to reduce the amount of Garda time spent in court are constantly under review by the Garda authorities and by my Department and a number of measures have been taken.  Over the past number of years considerable progress has been made, in the context of the computerisation of court offices, on scheduling court cases so that cases being dealt with by a particular garda are listed together for hearing so far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important recent development is the greater use of summons procedure in <Col N="1332" /> the Dublin Metropolitan Area, whereby persons arrested for certain minor offences may be released and proceeded against by way of summons, instead of being charged and brought before the next sitting of the District Court.  This procedure is intended to reduce the amount of Garda time spent in court on adjournments and the Garda authorities are encouraged by initial results.  The procedure is currently being monitored so that any worthwhile improvements can be introduced to maximise its effectiveness.</P>
    <P>Some other measures aimed at giving further savings in the amount of Garda time spent in court are currently being examined.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there are indications that young persons, in particular young women, are starting to smoke in increasing numbers and this is, of course, of particular concern to me.  With regard to the legal situation I would refer the Deputy to the Tobacco Health (Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988, which came into force on 12 July 1988.  This Act prohibits the sale of tobacco products to persons under 16 years of age and it also restricts the sale of cigarettes to a person otherwise than in packets of ten or more cigarettes.  The Act also prohibits the importation, manufacture, sale or otherwise disposal of an oral smokeless <Col N="1336" /> tobacco product.  This product is marketed towards young people and its use has serious consequences.  I am particularly pleased therefore that it is banned in this country and that Ireland is the first EC member state to have taken such action.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Act enables me to make regulations to prohibit or restrict smoking in designated areas and designated facilities.  I will shortly be signing these regulations to give effect to this section.  The current legislation is designed to create an exemplary environment for young people and I do not see any need to bring forward new legislation at this stage.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board, having regard to the resources available for the dental services, gives priority for routine dental treatment to children attending national school, to eligible nursing and expectant mothers, and to disabled, elderly and handicapped persons.  The names of applicants from categories other than those referred to are placed on waiting lists to be referred for treatment when resources become available.  The Eastern Health Board continue to provide emergency treatment for the relief of pain to persons in all categories.</P>

      <P>The person in question is awaiting orthodontic treatment and was assessed by the Eartern Health Board's visiting orthodontist on 23 November 1988, following which his name was placed on the board's waiting list for orthodontic treatment. The Eastern Health Board are making every effort to improve the availability of orthodontic treatment for those on the waiting list.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to announce recently that the Government have made an additional £300,000 available to the health board orthodontic service.  This will permit orthodontic treatment to begin immediately on 500 top priority cases drawn from the eight health boards.  I am aware that there is a need to provide further additional funds for the health board dental services and, taking into account the available resources and the health care priorities, will bring about an improvement in the health board dental service, including the orthodontic service, as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115, 116 and 117 together.</P>
      <P>I would like to explain that the admission of a patient to hospital is a matter for clinical decisions of the consultant concerned and the hospital authority. Non-urgent elective cases may be put on a waiting list to ensure that emergency and urgent cases can be dealt with promptly. I would suggest to the Deputy that if the patient's condition has deteriorated he should return to his general practitioner who would be in the best position to assess and then, if necessary, to stress the urgency of the case to the consultant concerned.</P>
      <P>I allocated an additional £250,000 to Temple Street Hospital in order to significantly increase the level of service available there.  This included £50,000 which has permitted the treatment of an additional 200 cases to date and it is hoped to do a further 50 before the end of this year.  I also allocated £50,000 for ENT equipment.  The remaining £150,000 has also allowed beds to be reopened and an additional 250 patients to be treated.  The hospital regards the reduction of the waiting list for ENT as its immediate priority.  I expect that significant progress can be made in regard to clearing the waiting list in the coming months.</P>

      <P>As Deputy John Bruton was informed in a written answer on 14 November 1989, six new intervention projects were initiated in the schools year 1989-90.  County Meath was included for <Col N="1347" /> one of the projects.  The location of each of these projects is as follows: Laois, Presentation Convent, Portarlington; Tipperary, Coláiste Chriost Rí, Cahir; Tipperary, Presentation Convent, Ballingarry; Louth, Our Lady's College, Greenhills, Drogheda; Monaghan, CloChar Lughaidh, Monaghan.</P>
      <P>Information on the mechanism of the scheme was also submitted to the Deputy on 14 November 1989.  More details of the operation of the scheme are given in the attached annex.</P>
      <P>The operational costs of the scheme of intervention projects for the financial year 1988 was £39,500, inclusive of payment of substitution of visiting teachers. The estimated cost for the financial year 1989 is £54,000.</P>
      <P>The scheme has been most successful in increasing the numbers of girls studying the physical sciences at leaving certificate level.  There are presently in excess of 400 girls studying physics or chemistry in projects schools.  It should be noted that these are schools in which the relevant subject &mdash; physics or chemistry &mdash; was not being provided on the curriculum prior to the intervention by my Department.</P>
      <P>An independent evaluation of the scheme was carried out on behalf of the Department in April/May 1988 by Dr. D. Ní Charthaigh, Thomond College, and Dr. C. T. O'Sullivan, UCC.  The report of this evaluation was submitted to the Department in October 1988.  The evaluators noted, <i>inter alia</i>, that the projects have been very successful in promoting physics and chemistry in girls' schools which have not previously included these subjects on the curriculum.  Significant numbers of pupils have elected to study physics and chemistry and the projects have established a firm basis for the future development of the subjects within the project schools.</P>
      <P>Plans are being prepared for the establishment of new projects in September 1990.  These new project schools will replace those project schools in which the subject will have been firmly established by the end of the current school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1348" /> ANNEX</P>
    <P>As regards the Department of Education pilot scheme of intervention projects in physics and chemistry, the Department of Education Science Inspectorate, as part of the National Programme for Equality of Opportunity for Girls in Education, developed a scheme of intervention projects in 1985 with a view to increasing the numbers of girls studying the subjects physics and chemistry in the senior cycle.</P>
    <P>The scheme in action in brief is based on the provision of either physics or chemistry in schools which do not have these subjects in the senior cycle.  Such schools are termed project schools.  The scheme also sets out to provide assistance to other schools in the region of the project school where the subject in question is in need of development &mdash; these schools are called associated schools.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the duration of the scheme:</P>
    <P>Phase I &mdash; Two or three years involving direct class teaching in project school plus support service to associated school in the region.</P>
    <P>Phase II &mdash; Continuing support service to appropriate schools in the region for a period as deemed necessary.</P>
    <P>Following the Department decision to implement the scheme of intervention projects, the inspectors of science examined the provision of the subjects physics and chemistry at senior cycle in Irish schools with particular reference to all-girl schools and co-educational schools. Arising from this survey schools were selected for participation in the project. The following is the procedure for initiating an intervention project.</P>
    <P>As regards initiation of intervention project within the scheme, first, a school in need is identified.  In selecting schools the importance of having a representative sample is recognised.  Factors which must be borne in mind in this regard are the geographic location of the school, the social background of the pupils and the type of school.  Second, a suitable visiting teacher is selected.  This teacher must be experienced and capable of motivating and enthusing pupils.  Third, agreement must be reached with the management of <Col N="1349" /> the visiting teacher's own school &mdash; this school is known as a base school &mdash; to release the visiting teacher for a period each week.  It is recognised that this imposes restrictions on time-tabling in the base school and requires considerable co-operation from the management of the school.  Fourth, suitable substitute teachers must be found to take the place of the visiting teacher while this teacher is in the project school.  This may not always be a simple matter, especially in rural areas.  Fifth, suitable arrangements must be made for the provision of an assisting teacher in the project school. This must be done in consultation with the management and staff of the school. The assisting teacher is also known as a take-over teacher since he/she will continue the teaching of the subject at the end of the project.</P>
