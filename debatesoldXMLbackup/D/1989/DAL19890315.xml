      <P>It is proposed to take No. 9.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed that in relation to No. 9 the proceedings on the Committee Stage and the Report and Final Stages shall be brought to a conclusion, if not previously concluded, at 1.30 p.m. and 7.00 p.m. respectively by one question in each case which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>It is further proposed that the Dáil shall adjourn not later than 7 p.m. today until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 12th April 1989.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a suggestion as to how the House should deal with these matters.  I think that we have a very large number of sad examples of small, probably inefficient, under-capitalised industries, particularly in the agri-food sector, going broke, throwing people out of employment.  How I would like to see the House dealing with this matter is to show a sense of responsibility about these things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Now is the time to take a major new initiative in relation to those caring for elderly relatives at home. The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that the prescribed relatives' allowance which heretofore had been paid in addition to a pension to an elderly relative should now be paid direct to the carer.  I hope that in time we will have a situation where the qualification for this allowance will be extended and that the allowance &mdash; at present £28 &mdash; will be increased at least to the minimum of the supplementary welfare rate.  The prime change needed is to ensure that the allowance is paid direct to the person providing the care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a reply yesterday from the Minister for Finance to a question I put down on this issue.  I asked him whether the prescribed relative's allowance payable to a person in receipt of an old age contributory pension who was being cared for by a relative is assessable for income tax purposes when calculating the income of the person in receipt of the pension.  I <Col N="770" /> had come across a case where an elderly pensioner who was being cared for by a relative was being assessed for income tax on the small additional amount being paid as well as his contributory pension.</P>
    <P>The reply I received yesterday from the Minister for Finance shocked me.  He stated that the Revenue Commissioners have advised him that the prescribed relative's allowance is paid as an increase in certain taxable social welfare pensions, including contributory old age pension, and as such forms part of the taxable income of a recipient.  If any additional corroboration was required of the need for a change, this certainly provides it.</P>
    <P>I urge the Members of this House and the Minister in particular very strongly to make this major change.  It is now 21 years since the prescribed relative's allowance was introduced and now is the time to ensure that it is paid to the prescribed relative.  It is right and proper that elderly and incapacitated relatives should, if at all possible, be cared for at home.  The change I am proposing would encourage that development and is an additional reason to support the change. Accordingly, I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the amendment and if Deputy O'Keeffe presses his amendment the Progressive Democrats will vote for it.  At a time when it costs up to £1,200 per week to maintain a geriatric patient, of which there are many, in an acute hospital we need to do everything to encourage care within the community, and in particular care within the family.  This would be better for the person concerned and cheaper as far as our social welfare and health services are concerned.  It is a disgrace that for so long we have not recognised the role of carers in maintaining people who are not able to look after themselves in their own homes and for keeping them in their own homes in a more humane and caring environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many organisations, such as the National Council for the Aged, who are concerned about this issue have for a long time urged that greater recognition be <Col N="771" /> given to the role of those looking after elderly or sick relatives.  It is not open to us in an amendment to suggest an increase in the prescribed relative allowance &mdash; and Deputy O'Keeffe said if he could he would have done so &mdash; as a first step in recognising their unique role and the great care they give to members of their families.  The State should go down the road of paying this allowance directly to the person concerned.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments on this because, except for the financial implications in the future, I cannot see any argument for not paying the allowance directly to the person concerned.</P>
    <P>Last evening Deputy O'Keeffe gave the example of a tax bill arriving in relation to this payment.  That is very strange and very wrong.  Many people would be prepared, with some small recognition from the Department of Social Welfare, to cease employment and stay at home to look after an elderly parent, brother or sister as the case may be.  Given the health care and the care generally which would be provided, and particularly the financial savings which would accrue if this measure were to be introduced, this would be a welcome change and one I would like to see us give due recognition to.  Perhaps the Minister will accept the amendment, but if he does not and it goes to a vote we will be delighted to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the sentiments expressed by Deputy Harney.  As the Minister is aware, I raised this matter both last year and the year before.  If I recall correctly, the Minister indicated that he would give consideration to this proposal which I raised on the Second and Committee Stages.  I share the view that this money should be paid to the person providing the service.  I do not see any logic in paying it to the elderly person because at present it is deemed to form part of their individual allowance and effectively amounts to a payment for services provided by another person.  It is <Col N="772" /> that carer who should be given the payment. The necessary safeguards would have to be introduced to ensure that there would be no abuse &mdash; I think the Minister referred to this issue last year.  Like Deputy Harney, I appeal to him to accept the amendment.  If Deputy O'Keeffe puts it to a vote, we will have to support it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I too support this amendment.  It proposes to transfer the money paid to a pensioner at present in respect of care provided by a relative at home to the carer.  This would be an important change primarily because of the dignity it would confer on the carer. Mainly women take on the job of caring for elderly relatives.  It has to be said that, even if we were to agree to this change and I hope the Minister will, people who find themselves in this position cannot live on dignity alone.  It is proposed to raise the allowance from £27.30 to £28, but this sum is not adequate to live on. A woman who provides this care even if she has adequate contributions, is not entitled to unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit, and a whole range of other benefits she would be entitled to receive if she chose not to be a carer.  This is not acceptable given the alternative costs which would be imposed on the Government if all these women were to withdraw their services and the consequent costs of providing care in institutions, as well as the actual rights of the individuals concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I agree with the concept of community care, in this country this largely means care by women in the home.  Not many back-up services are being provided for women who find themselves in this position.  It is true there is a skeleton service of nurses who call, but their workload is so great that they can make only a limited number of visits to a home where a sick elderly person is being cared for.  A woman who cares for a relative on, virtually, a 24 hour basis needs a holiday break at various times of the year. I am aware that in some parts of the country a very good service is provided in this regard, but in other areas such a <Col N="773" /> service is non-existent and no respite is given to the women concerned.</P>
    <P>There are many factors involved in this issue and, as I said, I fully support the amendment which proposes that the money paid at present to the claimant should be paid directly to the carer.  The amount of money being paid and the back-up services provided for carers need to be seriously examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of what has been said in relation to this allowance.  It is mysterious that the person who is caring for the elderly person, the carer, should not receive the allowance.  Some of these people give up jobs to look after elderly members of their families.  With so much emphasis now on community care in general, we should change to a system of making the payment to the carer.  Community care should be provided primarily by family members.  If this allowance were paid to the carer, the family member, that would be a move in the right direction, a real move towards underlining the emphasis we place on community care.</P>
      <P>The aspect Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned about tax had not occurred to me. I was not aware of it.  Again it underlines the need for a change immediately and I hope the Minister will be able to undertake to make that change in the Bill. With other Deputies I see this as a very valuable first step.  The rates of allowance could be looked at in future Bills.  There is a double argument here.  We are saving money by paying this allowance to the carer and possibly cutting down on the bill for care of geriatrics in institutions. We save also in that if the allowance is attractive enough the carer will opt for the prescribed relative's allowance and possibly will opt out of receiving other higher payments he or she might be entitled to.</P>
      <P>I support these moves and urge the Minister, if at all possible, to incorporate these changes into this Social Welfare Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a word in support of what Deputy Dempsey said.  I <Col N="774" /> see a great deal of sense in this proposal. Against that there is a very powerful incentive for the person in receipt of prescribed relative's allowance to hand over the allowance to the person caring for him or her.  Deputy O'Keeffe is no doubt aware that if the person in receipt of the allowance does not hand over to the person looking after him or her, a sum at least equivalent to the amount of the allowance, that person can approach the local labour exchange and make the point that he or she can no longer afford to look after the prescribed relative, that they are now available for work and actively seeking work.  That would entitle the person to unemployment assistance. Therefore, there is an incentive for the person getting the money to hand it over to the person who is looking after him or her.  On balance it would make more sense if Deputy O'Keeffe's proposal were adopted, but I have no particularly strong feelings on it one way or the other because the incentive is there when the person can claim unemployment assistance. If he is not getting the prescribed relative's allowance he can then claim unemployment assistance which I understand is higher.</P>

      <P>I have found it is quite difficult to prove to a social welfare officer that a person is available for work when the social welfare officer knows that person is living at home with a parent or other relative who needs care and has in the past been providing that care, and the relative is in receipt of prescribed relative's allowance.  It would be far <Col N="775" /> better for this allowance to be paid directly to the carer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

      <P>That would be the consequences of the Deputy's suggestion that they should go to the employment exchange and say they are not receiving the allowance and therefore are available for work.  They do not wish to do that. They wish to receive the allowance in their own right, and in my view they are entitled to do so.  Therefore, I think it unreasonable to put them to the trouble of having to go to the employment exchange and say they are available for work because they are not getting their due prescribed relative's allowance.  It would be much more sensible if they were paid what is their due regard directly by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleagues here.  People caring for prescribed relatives should try to get the allowance for themselves.  I urge the Minister to try to give the prescribed relative's allowance to bachelor farmers in particular who live with their fathers or mothers and who have almost no income. They probably had an income on unemployment assistance but the social welfare officer may have gone to them and found that their means were in excess of the guidelines.  I am talking about very small farmers.  Their income from farming does not have to be very much to put them over the limit which is approximately £45 per week.  Any bachelor who is looking after his father or mother and running a small farm is entitled to prescribed relative's allowance because of his small income.  I ask the Minister to speak to social welfare officers in this <Col N="776" /> regard and to ask them not to be so hard on these people.  By caring for their parents, they are keeping them out of institutions.  Consequently, they are saving the State money.  I ask the Minister also to provide that people who qualify for the prescribed relative's allowance qualify also for the free electricity allowance. The people I am talking about are debarred from this allowance by reason of the small incomes these bachelor sons derive from farming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree strongly with Deputy Brennan on this.  The scope of the prescribed relative's allowance is far too narrow.  The scheme could be usefully employed to save the Exchequer moneys. There are considerable numbers of people in public institutions today at considerable cost to the State who would perhaps be maintained at home if people close to them were in a position to maintain and care for them at home.  I suppose it is easy to say these people should do that anyhow but very often, particularly in rural Ireland, one finds the people concerned, the relatives, have extremely low incomes and have to work at least a few days a week outside the home to supplement their incomes.  More often than not, therefore, they are in no position to give full time care and attention to a very close relative.  It is nonsensical when one considers that for perhaps an additional £30 a relative could be maintained at home for a full week whereas that relative could be in an institution at the expense of the State at a maintenance cost of not £30 a week but a minimum of £30 a day.  I urge strongly the payment of the prescribed relative's allowance to people who are caring for their relatives and find themselves unable to maintain them out of their own resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously this is an area which interests Deputies generally.  One might ask why nothing has been done about this for some 21 years since the scheme was introduced.  It was introduced in a very particular way.  The relatives were described very clearly and the circumstances were clearly defined and limited.  This morning's discussion shows that Deputies see a lot of other things associated with it and, of course, I see these things as well.  Deputy O'Keeffe pointed out that there is really a need for a carer's allowance.  This is not as broadly based as a carer's allowance which would obviously be much wider.  The number of people who would be covered, the additional cost and the fact that the payment is a supplementary payment would have to be considered.  When we see these parameters we can understand how over the past 21 years it has never been paid directly.</P>
      <P>If the prescribed relative's allowance is paid to the pensioner then the pensioner has at least some leverage and control in ensuring that the care is provided.  This must be borne in mind.  The State does not have the continuing control.  That is another reason it is paid specifically to the pensioner, who would have control of it in the first instance.  I know that among my own backbenchers and Members on the other side of the House there is a wide interest in having even this payment paid directly.  It is paid to a brother, a sister, a half-brother, a half-sister, a son, a daughter, a step-son, a step-daughter, a grandson, a granddaughter, a son-in-law, a daughter-in-law, a nephew, a niece, a brother-in-law or a sister-in-law of the pensioner.  The prescribed relative must not be a married person who is wholly or mainly maintained by a spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various criticisms have been made of the scheme.  They include the claim that many pensioners who require constant care and attention do not receive the allowance because entitlement is conditional on care being provided by a prescribed relative.  Married persons who are wholly or mainly maintained by a spouse <Col N="778" /> cannot qualify as prescribed relatives for the purpose of the scheme.  Although the allowance is only payable where the prescribed relative is not engaged in employment outside the home and in receipt of, or entitled to, any other benefit, pension or allowance from the Department of Social Welfare, the rate is a restricted rate, which will be £28 from July.</P>
    <P>The scheme is open to further extension and further cost.  Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment is put in such a way that it does not in itself involve additional expenditure.  As far as cost is concerned, it makes no difference whether the prescribed relative's allowance is paid to the pensioner being cared for or to the person providing the care, apart perhaps from some minor additional administrative cost.  It would require additional pension books to be prepared for the prescribed relatives.  It is clear from what Deputy O'Keeffe had to say that while his amendment confines itself to this aspect, he also has in mind other changes in this scheme He referred to the low level of the allowance, and to the need for improved arrangements to assist people in keeping elderly relatives out of institutions.  Any discussion of the prescribed relative's allowance scheme inevitably raises the broader question of payments to people looking after elderly relatives generally and the need for improvements in this whole area.</P>
    <P>The prescribed relative's allowance scheme is quite restricted in its application. It is an increase in pension payable to pensioners who are incapacitated and who need full-time care and attention. The care and attention must be provided by a prescribed relative who must not be engaged in employment outside the home, must not be entitled to any other benefit or allowance and must not be a married person being maintained by his or her spouse.  The purpose of the allowance is to provide some degree of support to a pensioner towards the additional cost of having a relative in the household.  In this regard it is akin to an increase in pension for an adult dependant. It was never intended as compensation to the relative for the service <Col N="779" /> which he or she is providing.  It is based on need and not on providing payment for services rendered.</P>
    <P>A recent report commissioned by the National Council for the Aged estimated that there are currently some 24,000 elderly persons living at home and requiring full-time care and attention.  The number receiving the prescribed relatives' allowance is about 2,000.  The council have recommended that where an elderly person is medically certified as requiring full-time care and attention an allowance at the same rate as the prescribed relative's allowance should be payable, irrespective of who provides the care and attention.  Secondly, they recommend that persons providing full-time care who but for this would be eligible for unemployment benefit or assistance should be entitled to the equivalent of these payments as a right.  Clearly, these recommendations would change the whole nature of the existing arrangements and would have very significant financial implications.  They would involve two payments, one to the pensioner and another to the carer.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Social Welfare took a different approach.  They recommended that the prescribed relative's allowance be replaced by a social assistance allowance payable directly to the carer, which would be at the same rate as unemployment assistance.  It can be inferred from this that the commission's approach was that the allowance should be based on need and not be a payment for services.  This issue will have to be addressed also by the National Pensions Board in the context of their examination of pension arrangements generally.</P>
    <P>I have not come to any final conclusions as to how the prescribed relative's allowance scheme should develop in the future.  I am satisfied, however, that we need to reappraise in a fundamental way the role of the scheme in the context of arrangements generally for looking after incapacitated elderly people.  In the light of the various reports on this matter, I hope to bring forward proposals in this whole area in the fairly near future.  In <Col N="780" /> the meantime, I am somewhat reluctant to make changes in the scheme pending a fundamental reappraisal of it.  I agree there is a case in certain circumstances for paying the existing allowance direct to the carer rather than to the pensioner. I would be concerned, however, that it would not automatically withdraw the allowance from pensioners who already have it, as this might not be appropriate or desirable in all cases.  What I propose, therefore, having listened to the various points made, is to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage which would give me power by regulation to pay the allowance direct to the carer in certain circumstances to be prescribed. The solution I have in mind is that for all new cases after a certain date the allowance could be paid to the carer but that for existing cases this would require the agreement of the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>In any of the changes we have made, as Deputies will be aware, we have tried to include a saver so as not to upset people.  That was done in the free fuel scheme and in other schemes.  The purpose of the saver is to ensure that we do not do anything we would not like to see happening.  It is probable that in most cases the option could be taken up.  As Deputy O'Keeffe pointed out, it is true to say that the Revenue Commissioners consider the prescribed relative's allowance as an increase in what is a pension and is a taxable social welfare payment. As such it forms part of the taxable income of the recipient and, therefore, stands to be taxed.  In many cases it is not taxed but where the question is raised it has to be taxed.  The change will be of benefit to the pensioner and will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I agree with the principle in Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment.  He recognises that there is widespread agreement about it in the House.  If he agrees I will bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to make the changes he has in mind.  We will have to look into this to see how we will make arrangements for those who get the allowance at present.</P>

      <P>In some ways we are <Col N="781" /> witnessing a maturing of the parliamentary process.  It is refreshing that a well argued case from the Opposition for constructive change can secure all-party support, including that of the Government party.  In the light of what the Minister has said we can embark on a new era where proper recognition can be given by way of direct payment to those caring for elderly relatives at home.  The attitude adopted by the Minister confirms my faith in the parliamentary process.  Since the principle I have proposed is acceptable to the Minister I am prepared to follow the course proposed by the Minister. The best procedure is to withdraw my amendment on the undertaking given by the Minister to bring forward on Report Stage an amendment covering the principle I have proposed.</P>

      <P>In page 7, after line 52, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Where the Minister proposes to make regulations under this section, a draft of the regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and they shall not come into effect until a motion approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the fact that amendment No. 11 was ruled out of order on the basis that it would impose a charge on the State, a matter I will deal with when we are debating the section.  In amendment No. 12 we are proposing that the regulations which the Minister makes under section 6 be brought before the House for debate by the House by way of a positive motion.  Section 6 provides <Col N="782" /> for allowances for widowers and deserted husbands.  I have raised this matter on a number of occasions.  Most regulations made by Ministers are by way of a negative motion.  That means that the Minister makes the regulations and then puts a motion before the House to the effect that unless the regulations are annulled by the House they will stand.  The effect of that is that there is no option for Deputies to move a motion to annul the regulations.  It can only be done in Government time of Private Members' time.  Clearly, such a motion would not be moved in Government time because it would be a Government Minister who would be proposing the regulation.  Private Members' time is so scarce and sought after by the various parties that it is impossible to have a motion of that type moved in Private Members' time. The reality is that parties like The Workers' Party do not have access to Private Members' time and, therefore, cannot move a motion.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of this new section, and of the amendments to the social welfare system, the Minister should introduce any regulation under this section by way of a positive motion. In other words, I want the regulations approved by the House and that would require a discussion and a vote by the House.  I have made that suggestion in relation to other Bills and pointed out that I do not expect that every regulation should be brought before the House by way of positive motion because, clearly, that would mean that we would spend all our time approving regulations. However, in this instance the issues involved, and the way the section will be implemented, are so important that it would be worthwhile for the Minister to bring the regulations before the House for debate and approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the sentiments expressed by Deputy De Rossa.  It may be said that the various regulations are listed on the Order Paper when they are made by the Minister concerned but I do not think that is good enough.  Members must read the Order Paper and try to <Col N="783" /> secure copies of the regulations.  Usually it is possible to obtain copies of regulations from the Library but the position is not that simple at local level.  When social welfare recipients are debarred from receiving benefit under regulations they approach Members at their local clinics to question the decision and the Member must go to the local employment exchange to ascertain under what regulation the payment was stopped.  I suggest to the Minister that copies of social welfare regulations should be circulated to Members before or at the same time as they are issued to local employment exchanges.  I do not think it is right that when a constituent raises a question with a Deputy about a regulation the Deputy must go to the local employment exchange to get the information. Members, who are responsible for making the laws, should be given all relevant information about changes in regulations. It would be a simple matter of putting copies of the regulations in the post boxes of Members.  In my view that would meet, to some degree, the points raised by Deputy De Rossa.</P>
      <P>The Minister should bear in mind that some of the regulations made in the last two years have affected the entitlement of social welfare recipients.  I am asking the Minister to undertake to instruct his officials to make the regulation orders available to the Members at the same time as they appear on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to the motion because it could create practical difficulties.  It is a motion that is normally suggested by financial administrators who are concerned to prevent me from straying too much and being too flexible in looking after the people for whom I am responsible.  I know that is not the Deputy's intention in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of ensuring that people are aware of the regulations which are made in social welfare generally I would like to assure the House that <Col N="784" /> before a regulation goes anywhere it is laid on the Table of the House.</P>

      <P>Having a regulation which has to come before the House first to be approved is normally only done in extreme circumstances such as when there is a question of imposing a new liability, like increasing rates of contribution, or where civil rights are involved on the justice side.  These special arrangements are made when there is concern that they might not operate very well in practice anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 (2) provides that the new schemes for widowers and deserted husbands will come into operation on such day or days as may be fixed by order.  In addition there are various other regulatory powers contained in the section which will be used to apply a number of the provisions of the widow's non-contributory pension scheme to the new schemes for widowers and deserted husbands. These include technical and administrative provisions in relation to the making of claims, the time and manner of payment of pensions, provisions relating to the recovery of overpayments, prosecutions and dealing with instances in which a claimant has an entitlement to more than one payment. The regulatory powers contained in section 6 will also be used to apply the disqualification provisions which exist in the case of the widow's non-contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit and allowances schemes to the new schemes for men.  These provisions relate to cohabitation, residence outside the State, <Col N="785" /> detention, legal custody etc..  Finally, the regulatory powers will also be used to specify the circumstances in which a man will be regarded as having been deserted by his wife for the purpose of entitlement to the new deserted husband's allowance.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposed by The Workers' Party, amendment No. 12, would mean that all of these regulations would require a motion of approval by each House of the Oireachtas so it would be administratively quite inflexible, would require a good deal of time and could cause a great deal of delay.  I do not accept that there is any need for this amendment.  Most of the matters to be covered by the regulation are technical administrative provisions which, incidently, are already being applied in the case of widows and deserted wives.  I would also point out that the regulatory powers relating to the existing schemes available to women do not require a motion of approval.  If we were to do this we would be saying that in relation to schemes for men we have to have a motion passed by both Houses whereas this would not apply in the case of women.</P>
    <P>I have already outlined on Second Stage the principle features of the new schemes including the conditions of entitlement, the rates of allowance and the means of assessment which would be applied.  As I have said, the proposed regulations will deal with technical administrative matters and the provisions of the regulations will be the same as those currently applied in the case of the existing schemes available to women.  I do not accept, therefore, that there is any need for the proposed amendment. Finally, I would envisage the new schemes being brought into force by October next.  I would be concerned that their introduction would be delayed in the event that the necessary regulations required a motion of approval.  It is open to Members, if they do not agree with any of the regulations laid before the House, to come forward and say so and to have a vote on them.  I appreciate that since Deputy De Rossa's group in the <Col N="786" /> House is very small they might have difficulty in succeeding in such a motion; but that is the democratic arrangement. It is still open to the Deputy to raise the matter in the House or in any other number of other ways.  If the Deputy had any difficulty in relation to any technical administrative measures I would certainly be prepared to listen.</P>
    <P>Here we are dealing with a situation where we have a scheme that is operating satisfactorily.  Our problem was that there were people who did not come within the scheme but who could benefit substantially from it and I am making the arrangements to bring them in under the same technical and administrative arrangements as apply under the existing scheme.  There will be an opportunity at a later date to consider the whole question of the alone parents' allowance which is a much wider area with a lot of ramifications.  At this stage I appeal to Deputy De Rossa not to press this amendment because it would make life more difficult for us in implementing the scheme and I am anxious to have it in as early as possible in October.  I believe it is reasonable that the arrangements for this scheme should be similar to those which apply to women.</P>

      <P>The debate on this amendment is interesting.  It highlights the difficulty of reconciling the theory of parliamentary democracy with practical application.  On an abstract level I would tend to favour the approach outlined by Deputy De Rossa and I understand his reasons for tabling this amendment.  On the other hand, the case made by the Minister is fairly convincing, that because of the timetables in the House the result of strictly applying this approach might involve a failure to implement a progressive move.  Therefore, in this case the practical arguments win.  However, it would be helpful on this amendment or on the section if a few of the worries that some of us have about this particular scheme were put to rest by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I would just mention one matter which particularly concerns me. The regulations will relate to the new <Col N="787" /> scheme of allowances for deserted men who are caring for children.  I am glad this proposal is being implemented at this stage.  I am concerned about the regulation which will specify the circumstances in which a man is regarded, for the purposes of the section, as having been deserted.  I am concerned in particular about the grey area of men who may be separated from their wives by mutual agreement or because of mutual incompatibility and it would be helpful if the Minister could give an indication of the circumstances in which he proposes a man will be regarded, for the purposes of the section, as having been deserted. That would put a lot of our fears to rest.  I hope the Minister will give a fairly liberal interpretation.</P>

      <P>At this point I do not propose to press the amendment.  I raised the matter because I am concerned that we do not have the opportunity to discuss regulations which are brought in by way of a negative motion.  I made this point before and I hope to continue to make it.  Some way has to be found for this House to deal with regulations which are brought in by way of negative motion. In theory, we have a system at present but it does not operate for all intents and purposes.  I have been in this House for almost seven years and a negative motion has never been debated in that time.  I know, from going back over the records, that a motion of that kind has not been debated in this House since 1973 or some such time; it goes back quite a long time. There clearly is a need to look at our <Col N="788" /> procedures to see how this problem can be overcome.  The only way I have of raising the matter is by introducing amendments for positive motions for regulations and Bills that come before this House.</P>
      <P>I take the point the Minister has made that having positive regulations in relation to this matter could create more practical difficulties than is worthwhile. We do not know at this point what specific regulations the Minister will be bringing in.  He said they will be of a technical nature, and that may well be, but technical regulations in this area affect very directly the way in which a person can qualify for or be excluded from a benefit. Various regulations have been introduced over the years which are of a technical nature but have the effect of confining benefits and assistance to particular categories or excluding particular categories from allowances and benefits.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to press the amendment but I would urge the Minister to seek ways to have the regulations he is proposing to bring in discussed in some way.</P>

      <P>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I proposed two amendments &mdash; Nos. 10 and 11 &mdash; to section 6.  Basically they proposed to convert the proposed widower's and deserted husband's allowance into a lone parent's allowance which would include widowers and deserted husbands and also would include single fathers who are caring for children.  The single fathers could be unmarried fathers or men who have been divorced &mdash; obviously not in this State because we do not have divorce &mdash; in Britain or elsewhere.  Because these people are divorced they would be considered as single.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a particular case in mind of a <Col N="789" /> man who was divorced in England and was given custody of his child.  He is an Irishman and came to Ireland to raise and care for the child because he felt it would be better to bring the child up here.  That man found he was not entitled to unemployment assistance.  He told the labour exchange, quite honestly, that he was caring for the child and they said they could not give him unemployment assistance because he was not available for work.  He was told he could get supplementary welfare allowance, which he claimed and got, but found it was so inadequate for himself and his child that it was not possible to live on it.  That man and his child returned to London.  He is quite sore about the fact that he was unable to get an adequate income to keep himself and his child in Ireland.  That is a specific case that came to my attention, but there are not too many individuals in that circumstance.</P>
    <P>There is obviously the single parent's allowance which is paid to unmarried mothers, and I have argued in the House that that should be payable to men in the same situation.  The Minister has indicated that that would have financial implications, and that is true to some extent.  It has been quite difficult to locate statistics of how many men would be involved, but I got a reply from the Taoiseach to Question No. 46 of 7 March 1989 in which I asked him the number of households where unmarried and divorced men are caring for dependent children in the State and the number of children involved.  The reply was:</P>
    <P>Whereas the precise information requested by the Deputy is not available the following data from the 1986 Census of Population may be of help. The analysis is based on the family cycle coding of individual family nuclei as enumerated at the Census.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that where the marital status of the father is single, there are 83 families with children under 15 years of age and the number of children involved is 106; the number of families with some children under 15 and some over 15 is four, and the number of children is 13.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="790" /> That gives a figure of 87 families &mdash; 119 children &mdash; of single men who are caring for children.  If you include families with children over 15 years of age &mdash; they could be a lot older than 15, they could be in their twenties but some of them may be dependants &mdash; the number in that category is 23 and the number of children is 25.  There is a total of 110 families of single men caring for children, and the total number of children involved is 144.</P>
    <P>In regard to the divorced category, the number of families with divorced men caring for children under 15 years of age is 88 and the number of children involved is 136; the number of families with some children under 15 and some over 15 is 35, and the number of children involved there is 100.  The total of those two categories amounts to 123 divorced men caring for children, with 236 children involved.  Of the two categories, of single and divorced men caring for children &mdash; in some cases children under 15 years of age and in others over 15 &mdash; that is a total of 210 families and 355 children.  If one includes the divorced category with children over 15 years of age then the figures rise to 330 families with 515 children involved.  As a rough guide, if one includes the first two categories &mdash; those families with children under 15 and others over 15 &mdash; one is talking of expenditure of less than £1 million, or approximately £700,000 or £800,000, in order to pay the same rate as will be paid under the new deserted husband's and widower's allowance.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister indicated that he was considering the implications of paying a lone parent's allowance which I very much welcome.  However, he indicated that there were some complexities involved.  There may be complications involved that I do not see at present, but I cannot see that it is any more complex than the issues involved in providing a widower's or deserted husband's allowance. If we are to ensure the kind of equality to which this State, at least in theory, is committed, then we should ensure that all men have the same rights and opportunities to raise their children, <Col N="791" /> whether they be widowers, deserted husbands, divorced or single unmarried fathers.  They should be given the same opportunity of rearing their children as mothers in similar circumstances.  I would press the Minister for his views on the question of a lone parent's allowance.</P>
    <P>By way of a general welcome for the provisions of section 6 I should say that the concept of a widower's allowance is long overdue.  I have argued on a number of occasions on Finance Bills that widowed men are treated unfairly under our taxation system.  They are also clearly discriminated against under our social welfare system.  The same is true of deserted husbands.  Probably there are not large numbers involved but, nevertheless, they do exist.  There was a famous case of a Mr. Denis Dennehy in my constituency who took his case to the High Court seeking a deserted husband's allowance.  Strangely enough, he failed in his case on the basis that our Constitution provided that the woman's place was in the home but did not provide that the man's place was in the home, which was an odd interpretation.  Nevertheless, that is what our Constitution provides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I might make a general comment on this section.  The extension of these payments for one parent families to fathers is welcome as far as the Labour Party are concerned.  The Minister will be aware that I raised this matter on every occasion on which we discussed a Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill repeat the condition that the parent living with and caring for the children must be deserted by his or her spouse.  That aspect needs to be examined.  For example, under the present definition of &ldquo;desertion&rdquo; the other spouse must have left of his or her own volition.  That involves proving to the Department of Social Welfare that the marriage had broken up, proving that it had not broken up by agreement but rather unilaterally on the part of one partner. In my opinion that is irrelevant to the financial needs of either spouse.  Yet the difference in the terms of payment is <Col N="792" /> substantial.  For example, in respect of a lone man or woman bringing up two children there are payments of £74.80 per week under the new rates of deserted wife's or husband's allowance and £62 per week in respect of supplementary welfare allowance.  I raised this matter before.  I might bring to the Minister's attention again, that, effectively, the same conditions are enshrined in this Bill even though the change in the rate of benefit is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Very often it is found that a husband and wife will agree to separate rather than go into court and wash all their dirty linen there, whether it be a family court or elsewhere.  Rather they will go to a local solicitor and agree mutually to draw up an acceptable agreement.  Very often there is substantial abuse of the female partner who, rather than suffer the trauma of court proceedings, will agree to separate.  There may be other grounds for separating, such as the wife being involved with a next-door neighbour or whatever, when, again, rather than resort to court proceedings, they may agree mutually to separate.  I really do not see any difference in the circumstances in which they agree to separate because we do not have legislation providing for divorce. Therefore the only remedy available to them is to agree to separate.  They probably agree to do this as the lesser of two evils rather than continue a life of misery together with the children suffering in the process.  I would ask the Minister to examine that aspect, on the basis that they agree mutually to separate, always provided there are acceptable reasons for their doing so and tell us when the case should be treated as desertion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's proposal is welcome and long overdue.  It is time widowers and deserted husbands were granted an allowance under the social welfare code.  I take the point made by Deputy De Rossa in relation to unmarried fathers caring for their child or children. The social welfare code should look after persons and children, regardless of whether they be male or female; they <Col N="793" /> should be treated equally.  However, it has to be said that this provision maintains a distinction between the way women and men are treated under our welfare code.</P>
      <P>Now the irony is that on the death of a man who has been paying social insurance, his wife is entitled to claim a non-contributory widow's pension on the basis of his contributions.  But if she dies, he is not entitled to make the same claim on the basis of his insurance contributions. That seems to me to be discriminatory. It also appears to highlight something I have maintained for a long time &mdash; that in no sense is social insurance what it is purported to be. Rather does it lead to many anomalies. It does not necessarily afford people who pay contributions higher entitlements at given points when they apply for welfare payments.  We should recognise once and for all that it merely constitutes another form of taxation.  Indeed in many-circumstances, it does not confer additional entitlements on persons in given categories.  This is one such category within which it will not entitle a widower or deserted husband to any additional benefit.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage the Minister referred to the need to move towards the concept of a lone parent family allowance.  I would urge him to move in that direction.  There are at present six different rates payable to lone parents caring for children and it is time to have a single allowance for the woman or man who is looking after the dependent children.  Will the Minister clarify that the proof that is required of women to show that desertion has taken place will be demanded from the man also?  Presumably, the new provisions we will deal with later in the Bill will also apply to deserted husbands, in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last evening I said there were long delays in the processing of applications for deserted wife's allowance. The assistance claim seems to take an undue length of time to process.  The Minister promised that he would review the procedures for the processing of applications for deserted wife's allowance, and I urge <Col N="794" /> him to do so.  Obviously, similar delays will apply to the processing of the deserted husband's allowance.  I urge the Minister to ensure that these applications are processed as quickly as possible.  In a later section we will talk about the definition of a qualified child, but it is relevant here where there are anomalies between the different age groups and as to when a dependent child is a dependant. All children in full-time education, regardless of their age, should be regarded as qualified children for the purposes of a dependent child allowance. Whether the child is 22 or 23, that child should be considered as a dependent child if the parent has to survive on social welfare payments in order to maintain the family.  It is wrong, particularly nowadays when university courses take four or five years or even longer to complete, that a child in full-time education should not qualify as a dependent child after the age of 21.  However, I will deal with this in the next section which deals with the definition of &ldquo;qualified child&rdquo; because it is more appropriate to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My main concern with this section is to ensure that in tackling a very obvious anomaly we do not create another one.  I have indicated earlier that I welcome the provisions introduced by the Minister.  However, I wish to raise two points with him.  Section 6 provides for the payment of a non-contributory allowance for widowers and deserted husbands.  What is the position of a widower, a deserted husband, a separated husband or indeed a lone father who has a contribution record and who cares for the dependent children?  I am anxious to ensure that somebody in that situation would not be in a worse position than somebody who did not have a contribution record and was in a similar position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point relates to the scope of the provisions for a deserted husband's allowance.  The key would be the regulation which would specify the circumstances in which a man is to be regarded for the purposes of this section as having been deserted by his wife.  The <Col N="795" /> Minister is aware that in legal terms the definition of desertion can be quite narrow.  I can foresee situations where in general terms men will be regarded as having been deserted but in strictly legal terms they may not be so regarded.  As has been mentioned by Deputy Bell there is also the question of a separated husband, who may have separated by mutual agreement or because of some basic incompatibility with his wife.  The answer lies in the manner in which the regulations specify the circumstances in which a man is to be regarded as a deserted husband.  It is quite essential that the regulations governing this be drafted in as wide and liberal a way as possible.  This may resolve my concerns that in clearing up an anomaly by introducing this section, further anomalies will not be created.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to the welcome extended by the Opposition speakers to this innovation on the part of the Minister.  The concept of a widow's pension and a deserted wife's allowance are long standing.  In my opinion the Minister is moving a great distance forward in introducing the concept of payments to deserted husbands and widowers.  That will stand as one of the most fundamental reforms of Irish social welfare law since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise one or two technical points.  First, with regard to the regulations that will be introduced to cover such circumstances as desertion, will they be similar to those which currently apply to the deserted wife?  If not, why not? I cannot see any good or fundamental reason for such differences but perhaps there are such reasons and if so I would like to hear them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the point made by Deputies Bell and Jim O'Keeffe on the question of voluntary separations, but we have to bear in mind that the concept of a voluntary separation is a vague concept.  Do we introduce a definition of desertion to cover a situation where people sit down and decide they are incompatible and while there is nothing fundamentally <Col N="796" /> wrong they decide they will not live together any longer and so they seperate? I hardly think the term &ldquo;desertion&rdquo; can be so broadly defined as to include that concept.  However, on the other hand, people may agree, in a moment of sanity, that because of the mental or physical cruelty suffered by one or both they will separate &mdash; in other words the concept of a constructive desertion.  I ask the Minister to make the definition of desertion as broad as possible to cover a concept like constructive desertion.</P>
    <P>On the question of the second last amendment &mdash; amendment No. 11 &mdash; proposed by Deputy De Rossa, I fully agree with the thinking behind it and I see exactly what he is trying to achieve. However, I do not know if the Minister will be in a position now or on Report Stage to give us some indication of what the definition of desertion in the regulations to be made under this section will mean.  If the Minister cannot give us some indication at this early stage, I would like him to assure the House that the definition would be as wide as possible.  I ask the Minister to give some indication as to when those regulations will be introduced. As I have said, the legislation involves fundamental reform of social welfare law, which has been welcomed by all sides of the House.  I, too, welcome it but I would like to see it implemented as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I note that on the question of a widower's non-contributory pension, a widower is defined as a person with at least one qualified child living with him.  Qualified child is defined later in the Bill.  When the qualified child who is living with the widower ceases to come within the definition of a qualified child, for instance, because he goes over the age limit, does the widower's pension cease at that stage?  If the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; there could be a serious anomaly in that a person in his late fifties or early sixties who had been in receipt of a widower's pension for some considerable time would suddenly lose the pension and have to fall back on unemployment assistance. That would involve a dramatic drop in income as the rates stand at present.  I <Col N="797" /> do not know whether the answer to my question is: &ldquo;yes he will lose the pension, if the child ceases to be qualified&rdquo;.  If that is the answer I do not know whether it is possible to avoid the anomaly that will thereby arise for those elderly people.  It is our duty in this House to try to head off these anomalies in so far as we can foresee them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>First, in reply to Deputy O'Dea, the answer is yes.  This is something that will have to be considered further in the future.  We have a scheme which is based on dependence.  Much of what Deputies O'Dea and De Rossa had to say demonstrates the point I made earlier, that in fact there are a great deal of ramifications when you talk of broadening the scheme.  For instance, there is the lone parent allowance and all the implications of that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney raised the question of the age relationship for the children.  The age now will automatically immediately go up to 21.  That is one of the hidden benefits.  I know the Deputies want the same means test for everyone, but the fact is that the means test for widows is better.  There will be a direct benefit in that area.  There are other indirect benefits as well.</P>
      <P>Deputies raised the question of separation, particularly separation by agreement, and the question of constructive desertion.  Broadly speaking, constructive desertion is included at present, but separation is not.  Separation is obviously quite different from desertion especially where there is separation by agreement.  That is one of the matters that will have to be considered in a broader consideration of one comprehensive scheme which is what Deputy De Rossa proposes.  Other Deputies are also interested in dealing comprehensively with the problems involved.</P>
      <P>Deputies generally recognise that this scheme is a very substantial improvement. The section brings in a new deal for widowers and deserted husbands.  In the case of a widower with two children curently on supplementary welfare allowance there will be an increase of £22.30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="798" /> A widower with five children will get an increase of £40.30.  It is a very substantial, widely welcomed improvement.  The section provides for payment to widowers and deserted husbands with dependent children on the same lines as the non-contributory widow's pension and deserted wife's allowance scheme.  When I say &ldquo;on the same lines&rdquo; I mean that the lines will be similar, that the regulations will be similar, but I cannot say at this stage that they will be exactly the same in every aspect because there may be some technical reasons as to why there would be minor differences.</P>
    <P>A widower with two children in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance currently gets £56.80 a week.  Under the new scheme he will get £74.80 a week, an increase of £18 per week.  Those with large families will gain even more.  A man with five children would get £80.80 under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and this will increase to £115.30 under the new arrangements, a very substantial increase of £34.50 a week.  This is in addition to the increase in child benefit for large families which would increase the weekly gain to £36.05.  It is, as Deputies have said, an improvement that is long overdue.</P>
    <P>I estimate that 5,500 men will benefit from the new schemes.  The introduction of these new schemes also represents a major standardisation in bringing about equality of treatment between men and women in this whole area.  I also consider that there is scope for standardisation in this area.  With the introduction of these new schemes there will now be six separate social assistance schemes providing income support for lone parents.  These schemes will also differentiate between men and women.  Accordingly, I am examining the possibility of replacing these schemes by one lone parent allowance scheme which would apply to parents bringing up children on their own.  In this context the position of lone parents who are separated, of fathers who are unmarried or who have been divorced in another jurisdiction and who may not come within the scope of the existing schemes is being examined. <Col N="799" /> Complex legislative changes will be required to provide for such a scheme but I hope to be in a position to bring forward proposals in the matter later in the year.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise to Deputies that the step we are taking here, as Deputy O'Dea has said, is a major step.  The fact that we are now going to cover deserted husbands is a major step forward.  That, in itself, facilitates the development of a broader, more comprehensive scheme and in that sense it must be regarded as a major breakthrough.  I am very happy with the progress I have made in this direction.  It represents a major change in thinking.</P>
    <P>I have been very concerned for some time with the special difficulties of men on low incomes left to rear children on their own.  As Deputies are aware, entitlement to unemployment assistance is conditional on the claimant being available for work and proving that he is also genuinely seeking work.  In many cases it is not possible for widowers or deserted husbands to satisfy these conditions when they have to look after young children on their own.  In these circumstances the only fall-back is recourse to supplementary welfare allowance, the lowest level of social welfare payment.  In recognition of the difficulties of men rearing children on their own, the Government have decided to introduce two new social welfare assistance schemes for widowers and deserted husbands with children. These schemes are provided for in section 6 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 198A (1) of the 1981 Act provides that a widower's non-contributory pension will be paid to a widower who has at least one dependent child residing with him and who satisfies a means test equivalent to that applying in the case of a widower's non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised a question about the contributory scheme.  A person with stamps would qualify here but on the same means test as would apply to the assistance scheme.  It is not a contributory scheme.  It does not come under the insurance fund.  That is something which is being examined further.  It is part of the overall equal treatment <Col N="800" /> considerations which are being considered at European Community level. This is a separate scheme similar to that which applies to women in the assistance schemes.  It only applies to widowers who have at least one child residing with them.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea wanted to know what would happen when the children were grown up and the person in question was older.  The scheme carries on until children are aged 21 while they are in education. What happens then will be considered further in the future in the general context of other things.  Now, of course there is the pre-retirement allowance which has come in at the other end and perhaps those two things will come to meet one another at some stage.</P>
    <P>One could say that for women there is a single woman's allowance which applies from the age of 58 and that there is no single man's allowance at that level. Deputy Mattie Brennan earlier raised the question of single men in these circumstances. I am afraid there are many anomalies in the system, especially as far as equal treatment is concerned but we are making a great deal of progress in removing anomalies in a practical way.  I hope to go on with that type of work.</P>
    <P>Section 198 (2) of the 1981 Act provides that the rate of pension shall be the same as the rate which applies in the case of widow's non-contributory pension. With the increases provided for in section 4 of the Bill, together with the rates for children, a man with three or more children will have the benefit of the higher rate of child dependant allowance which applies in the case of widows.  Section 198 A (4) provides that a widower who has remarried will be disqualified from receiving a widower's pension.  That also applies to widows.  Section 198A (4) empowers the Minister to make regulations in relation to widower's non-contributory pension which may apply any of the provisions of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, or regulations made thereunder to the new scheme.</P>
    <P>In assessing the income from employment an amount of £6 per week together with a further £6 per week in respect of each child dependant is disregarded in <Col N="801" /> the means assessment for widow's non-contributory pension.  In addition, deductions are also allowable in respect of travelling and child minding expenses which are incurred.  These are indirect benefits which come to bear straightaway under this scheme.  The cash value of any investments in property, other than the family home and bank deposits, etc., are assessed at the rate of 5 per cent of their total value to obtain the yearly income from investments.  Having allowed a deduction of £200, plus £100 in respect of each dependent child, the income from the letting of land is assessed in the same way as earnings from employment.  Therefore, the means assessment is similar to the means assessment for widows and in that sense is beneficial.</P>
    <P>Deputies have covered a great deal of what is in the section as a whole.  Deputy O'Keeffe raised the question of the lone parent's allowance and it was also raised in Deputy De Rossa's amendment which was withdrawn.  When the legislation was being drafted, consideration was given to the possible introduction of a lone parent's allowance in place of the new schemes for widowers and deserted husbands. Any such scheme would have a much broader application in that it would include persons not covered by the proposed new schemes provided for in section 6, that is, unmarried fathers, prisoners' husbands and men and women who are unable to satisfy the criteria used to establish desertion.  The introduction of the new schemes for widowers and deserted husbands must be seen, therefore, as a first step towards equality for men in the areas of survivors and family benefits.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe asked about the criteria to be applied.  The criteria used in the case of the deserted wife's scheme to establish desertion are as follows: (a) the husband must have left of his volition and must not have lived with the claimant at any time during the three months preceding her claim; (b) the husband must have wilfully refused or neglected to contribute towards the support and maintenance of his wife and children; (c) the <Col N="802" /> claimant must have made, and must continue to make, reasonable efforts, with the means available to her, to trace her husband and to prevail upon him to contribute to her support and that of her children and the husband must not have resumed living with the claimant.</P>
    <P>In relation to the requirement that the woman must make reasonable efforts to trace her husband and prevail upon him to contribute to her support and that of her children, where she does not know of his whereabouts she is expected to inquire from his relatives and friends and his employer or the employment exchange, if he is unemployed, in an effort to trace him.  If she suspects that he has gone to the United Kingdom she may be requested to contact the UK Department of Health and Social Security in this regard.  In cases where a husband's whereabouts are known and where it is considered that he is in a position to support his family, the claimant will usually be required to have a maintenance summons served on him. These are the criteria which exist at present.</P>
    <P>The regulatory provisions contained in section 198B (3) (c) empower the Minister to recover overpayments which may arise as a result of a revised decision of a deciding officer or an appeals officer taken in the light of new information coming to hand.  A similar provision already exists in the case of the deserted wife's allowance scheme.  In general, overpayments are only recoverable in cases where fraud is involved.  On the introduction of the deserted wife's allowance scheme in 1970, however, it was considered that because of the possibility of considerable changes occurring in a recipient's circumstances, the Minister should have a discretionary power to recover overpayments arising for reasons other than fraud.  It was envisaged at the time that such overpayments could arise in a variety of ways, for instance if the deserted wife received substantial maintenance retrospectively or if she received a substantial insurance payment on the death of her husband.  It is considered that similar powers should be taken in the <Col N="803" /> case of the deserted husband's allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>In general the powers which are included here are similar to those which apply to the widow's allowance scheme and the deserted wife's allowance scheme.  The question of the lone parent's allowance scheme is one which we are examining and we hope to come up with proposals later in the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from what the Minister has said that the question of an allowance for unmarried fathers is not, at this point, opposed on the basis of cost but rather because of the complexities of whatever regulations or legislation it would be necessary to introduce? May I also ask the Minister if it is possible for him to indicate what effect earnings would have on the new allowance for widowed men and deserted husbands?</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the means test as applied to widows for non-contributory pension would be applied in this case but the argument widowed men have put to date in relation to this problem is that when they are unemployed they receive less, whether on benefit or on assistance, than the widow would receive on the pension.  Where they are working they would not be entitled to any additional payment.  By way of an example, if he has the information to hand, can the Minister tell us the effect this allowance would have on a man with, say, three or four dependent children? What amount would he be allowed to earn and still get the full rate of widower's allowance?</P>
      <P>In relation to section 6(2), the Minister is taking the power to appoint days for the implementation of these sections, and he may introduce them on different days. He has indicated that he would hope to have this in place in October, but does he intend to introduce both the deserted husband's and the widower's allowance on the same day or, close to it, or does he foresee any difficulties at this stage which might delay its introduction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the last question <Col N="804" /> first, we hope to introduce the two at the same time.  When bringing in the Bill we have to make provision for every conceivable thing that might happen because we do not want to find out later, when we are ready to implement it, that there may be some difficulty and that the two cannot be introduced at the same time. It is the intention to introduce the two schemes at the same time, but if there is any technical reason this cannot happen, that eventuality would be covered.</P>
      <P>In assessing the income from employment an amount of £6 per week together with a further £6 in respect of each child dependant is disregarded in the means assessment for widows non-contributory pension.  If she has five children that would amount to £36.  In addition, deductions are also allowable in respect of travelling and child minding expenses which are incurred.  That would be a further allowance.  A man with four children could still get the maximum pension allowance and have an income of £1,560. In addition to that he could receive the child minding allowance, which could be up to £30 per week, and travelling expenses so there is much to be teased out in this area but basically what I want to do is provide similar arrangements to those applying in the case of widows. We will be working out the detail and providing scales and advice in relation to the amounts which can be earned.  This would be a very important element for somebody who has, for instance, three, four or five children and who would still be able to earn a certain amount on top of the payment.  It is a very good scheme in that sense; there is no question about that.  The allowances are generally regarded as among the best allowances in the case of widows and they will apply in these cases also.  The Deputy was right in saying that a number of men do not realise that their earnings can be of a reasonable level and they still qualify for the allowances, including the child minding allowance.  Beyond that we go into the area Deputy O'Keeffe spoke about, that is, the insurance based scheme, which is another question.</P>

      <P>Section 7 provides for the payment of child dependant allowance up to the age of 19 years as against 18 years under existing provisions in the case of all recipients of long-term social welfare payments where the child continues in fulltime education. The purpose of this amendment is to correct a minor textual error in section 7.  It is purely a technical amendment. The section is, of course, very important in that it allows the increases to be paid for children up to 19 years.  I know Deputies will generally welcome this provision.  I would regard it as a first and important step towards bringing the age up to 21 years, something I hope to achieve in the future.  I ask the Deputies to support the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much approve of this proposal. It must be a fundamental part of our <Col N="806" /> social policy that we encourage so far as we can our young people to remain in school, and this should certainly extend to the children of those who are in receipt of social welfare payments.  One of the most outrageous anomalies I have seen since I have taken over as spokesperson on social welfare for Fine Gael was denying people on social welfare a free fuel allowance because their children happened to exceed the age of 18 years and were at second level schools.  That was absolutely outrageous.  However, this is a step on the way to rectifying that anomaly.  Deputy Harney's amendment has been ruled out of order but I think we can all subscribe to the principle of it. The Minister said that this is a first step on the way to raising the age further.  It would be helpful if he could give us an outline of the cost involved in that process. I should like to see the age raised further as soon as possible and if the cost involved is not too great I would encourage the Minister to introduce such a change at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the improvements which are being made in this amendment.  Many people on long-term unemployment assistance were in a difficult situation and were forced to go onto supplementary welfare benefit when their child reached 18.  Because of the longer school programme many school children do their leaving certificate examination at 19 years so it is right that the anomaly in regard to the allowance should have been corrected.  However, this brings me to a more general point, and I sought to do something about this in an amendment which, as Deputy O'Keeffe has said, was ruled out of order on the grounds that it would have Revenue implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the social welfare code generally, where children are in education, regardless of their age, and where social welfare, is the sole source of income for a family such children should be considered as qualified children.  Different ages are now used for the purpose of paying different allowances.  In relation to widows and <Col N="807" /> widowers' non-contributory pensions and so on the age is for dependent children to be 21 years and for other categories like long-term unemployment benefits and so on the age is to be 19 years. Different ages apply to different categories of welfare recipients but we need to rationalise this system.  We need to make it fairer, more consistent and have one definition of what a qualified child is so far as age is concerned.</P>
    <P>If a child is still in full-time education this should be good enough for the purposes of paying the dependent child allowance.  God knows there are not many children of social welfare recipients in full-time education at 21, 22 or 23 years because if that is the sole source of income for a family and given the disgraceful grants system operating in this country, it is only in very rare cases that children of that age are in a position to be in full-time education.  However, where a child is in full-time education and a grant is payable to help that child stay in full-time education, the obvious demands which are placed on a family by way of additional living expenses and the maintenance of the family should be regarded in our social welfare code and the qualifying age with regard to education should be for as long as a child remains in school studying for a primary degree, a certificate at a regional technical college, a diploma or whatever or is in formal schooling in the sense of secondary schooling or whatever.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the Minister comment on this and tell us what the likely cost would be of removing the age prohibition which exists at present.  I am sure the Department must have some statistics in relation to this matter.  These statistics might not exactly be bang on because we are not good at keeping statistics in relation to these matters but I imagine the departmental officials would have a fair good idea of the cost implications that might be involved of disregarding the upper age limit for the purposes of paying child dependant allowances and describing as a qualified child, the child of social welfare recipients generally.</P>
    <Col N="808" />
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of repeating myself, I compliment the Minister on this further humane reform of the social welfare code.  I take the point that Deputy Harney is making and agree with it.  Who does not?  The Government have moved to correct a very serious anomaly here.  I would like to see a million different things done today, as I am sure would be the case with the Minister and with Deputy O'Keeffe and everybody else, but there is the question of limitation of financial resources.  Apart from his fantastic grasp of the subject and the reforms he has managed to introduce today, I want to compliment the Minister on how he has managed to get such a large slice of the cake for social welfare at a time of financial stringency, when the Government are trying to pay the interest on a colossal national debt which doubled in size between 1982 and 1987.  He is to be congratulated on getting such a large allocation, which shows his commitment and that of the Government to the poorest section in our society.</P>
      <P>I know that the age up to which parents can claim for children will be extended as financial circumstances improve.  In the light of what the Minister is doing, there is one small, and perhaps niggling, point that I want to make.  All sides of this House have paid lip-service from time to time to attaining simplicity in legislation and have stressed the undesirability of legislating by reference.  If it would be technically possible, I would prefer that a section be inserted which would simply set out the categories of social welfare recipients who can claim for children up to the age of 19 and those who can claim for children up to the age of 21 years. The section as it stands is practically indecipherable to the average layman.  If technical limitations allowed, the insertion of such a section would make much more sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of answers to the last point.  First, this change refers to all long-term social welfare recipients, whereas previously it applied, for instance, only to widows and <Col N="809" /> deserted wives.  This makes matters much simpler.</P>
      <P>The question of simplicity generally is one on which I am very keen.  We have brought in a consolidation Bill and I would be anxious that by next year we would address again the matter of consolidation. This takes much technical time in the Department but I am very concerned that we consolidate once again.  The consolidation carried out in 1980 and finalised early in 1981 took a great deal of time.  A ten year gap should be more than enough.  On the other hand, we are doing a great deal of regularising and streamlining.  It would be better if consolidation came after much of that work was accomplished, so that further change would not be necessary.  That is something I shall keep in mind.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe asked about the cost of this measure in the first instance.  This is £2.2 million for extension up to 19 years.  We are talking only about the amendment at the moment; the Deputies will have an opportunity later to raise questions on the whole section.  In line 30, page 8, the phrase &ldquo;of over the age of 18 years&rdquo; is used.  This is technically to ensure similarity to a phrase which appears in line 23 of &ldquo;on or over the age of 18 years&rdquo;.  This is purely a technical drafting matter.  Deputy O'Keeffe asked about extension up to 21 years.  The cost of that change would range between £6 million and £8 million, depending on who were included.  If children of all social welfare recipients were included it would be an estimated £8 million; if the change were restricted to long-term recipients the cost would be approximately £6 million. They are the estimated figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like a little more progress to be made on many other sections which need to be discussed.  On this section, to follow up the point made by Deputy Harney, it would be desirable that the age be extended.  We welcome the Minister's proposal of an extension from 18 to 19 years for children of long-term social welfare benefit recipients who are in full-time education, leaving the age at 18 years for the children of recipients of unemployment and disability benefit and unemployment assistance.  There should, however, be an extension to take in all children up to the age of 21 years, as is at present the case of children of widows.</P>
      <P>One can see the thinking in the educational system that children of working-class people, generally speaking, did not continue on to post-primary education level.  Thankfully, that situation has improved, although at the present time the matter may be at a standstill, to say the least.  Children are staying on longer at school and in many cases it is not possible for children whose parents are in receipt only of social welfare benefits to get that opportunity.  They should be encouraged.  I know the Minister made the point that this was a start.  I assume he would have intentions eventually to extend the scope to 21 years.  I make a special appeal on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not deal earlier with a question raised by Deputy Harney.  The question of extending the benefit to 21 years is very important.  I regard this as a first step towards such extension across the board.  It is a matter of resources in future budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="811" /> I agree with Deputy Bell that education is of paramount importance.  Anything we can do to encourage children whose parents' circumstances are very restricted and where incomes are low should be done.  It is with that in mind that we have made the extension to 19 years at this time.  It will cover children doing repeat leaving certificate examinations and also cover others going on to third level education in whatever form. The cover is broader than just those doing repeat leaving certificate examinations. One suggestion was that we would cover only those doing those examinations, because that is fairly common nowadays, but we have gone further than that and the extension is to 19 years across the board.</P>
    <P>To come back to Deputy Harney's point, I cannot give a figure for continuing with those in full-time education. There is a figure of £6 million to £8 million in relation to continuing up to 21 years of age and, using that as the basic criterion, it obviously would have further cost implications but I do not have an estimate of what they would be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney also referred to the fact that the grants are inadequate.  This was one of the main reasons against increasing payments on social welfare to those aged 19, 20 or 21 because at that stage if, by definition, the parent of the child was on social welfare the grants should be taken up&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">

      <P>They are not taken up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It shows the complexity of these matters.  You must look at the overall picture and ask what social welfare could achieve and what could be done through the grants system.  Deputy Harney's point rang a bell with me because that argument has been used against doing this.  It was also an argument used in favour of doing it for children at secondary level because, at third level, the grants came into operation and different circumstances applied.  That was one of the arguments in favour of <Col N="812" /> extending cover to people who were repeating the leaving certificate.</P>
      <P>This is an important development in relation to the section generally because there was an anomaly in relation to widows.  They had been covered up to 21 years of age and now widowers and deserted husbands will be covered up to the same age.  The other long-term social welfare payments will apply up to the age of 19.  The payments covered by this provision are: the old age contributory pension, the retirement pension, invalidity pension, long-term unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance, the old age non-contributory and blind pensions and the disablement pension to persons in receipt of unemployment supplement.  It has a fairly wide application and has been broadly welcomed. There is no need to go into the different sections at this stage but if there are any questions about subsections I will be glad to answer them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an appropriate section to stress the need for a much more serious reform of our social welfare system.  We are dealing here with pay related insurance contributions and the Minister has provided for increases in the ceilings.  I am totally of the view that there is considerable room within the social welfare system for reform which will encourage job creation.  I take this opportunity to press the Minister to get these necessary reforms under way.  At the moment, insurance contributions are paid by employers and employees and, very simply, they are a pay roll tax and a tax on employment.  We must see how they can be changed, varied or modulated to encourage job creation.</P>
      <P>The most consistent criticism of the social welfare system &mdash; which strikes a strong responsive chord in me &mdash; is that people on social welfare cannot in many instances afford to take a job offered to them.  That particularly applies to people with large families.  There is a duty on all of us to ensure that that kind of disincentive to employment within the social welfare system should be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very high on the list is the need to reform the PRSI payments.  I do not want to go into full detail at this stage, but I very strongly urge the Minister to seriously consider a number of proposals. The first is in relation to the employer's social insurance contribution.  As the system is framed at present it favours capital intensive industry as opposed to labour intensive industry.  There is a way in which the employer's social insurance contribution system can be changed to reverse the trend and favour labour intensive sectors.  That on its own will encourage more employment and does not <Col N="814" /> necessarily mean a cost factor.  The rates can be changed to cover the point.</P>
    <P>The Minister should introduce a system which would allow a lower rate of RSI payment for employers in certain labour intensive sectors which would be a start. It has been done in other countries but nothing has been done here to change the trend of RSI contributions on employers favouring capital intensive employers. The system should be changed so that labour intensive sectors are charged at a more favourable rate for employers.  I am also totally of the view that the employee RSI contributions must be modulated. There should be a low rate for the low paid.  This too has been done in other countries but not here.  Why?  Any changes made can be paid for by varying the rate generally.  It could be paid for in relation to variations of the upper limit. There are a number of ways of doing it and if we are committed to helping the low paid it is absolutely essential that this change takes place.  Bluntly, there should be a system whereby the low paid are exempt or pay at a lower rate.</P>
    <P>I saw that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Nigel Lawson, in his budget speech yesterday focused on this point.  On the first £43 per week the rate is 2 per cent as opposed to the higher rate of 9 per cent.  That is one way of doing it.  Another way has been proposed by a number of my colleagues in this House.  They propose exempting from PRSI contributions the first £1,000, £2,000 or £3,000 of income in a year.  The figures involved would be fairly substantial. Exempting the first £1,000 of income would give a figure of £43 million, to be doubled and trebled in exempting the first £2,000 or £3,000 of income respectively.  I would like to see us move in that direction but this may be difficult given the financial constraints, but one way or another I would like the principle to be accepted, that for the low paid a more favourable regime should be applied.</P>
    <P>The third point I wish to make in relation to PRSI payments is that some favourable provision must be introduced to encourage the long-term unemployed <Col N="815" /> to come off the dole.  There should be an exemption for a short period or a lower rate should apply in respect of the long-term unemployed.  This would encourage such people to work and an employer to take a person in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance off the dole.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to make on this issue which arises indirectly is that there should be a single means test, but I will not go into detail on this now.  I urge the Minister very strongly to take on board those four points, for us to take our courage in our hands and look at the system of pay-related social insurance and to accept and appreciate that these pay roll taxes amount to taxes on jobs.  If we are seriously interested in job creation let us make the necessary changes so as to ensure that, so far as possible, the disincentives are removed from the social welfare system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Keeffe, I very strongly believe that pay-related social insurance amounts to a tax on labour.  The fact that some of the proceeds from PRSI contributions are applied in a certain way does not change that.  The irony is that the more one earns the less one's income is subject to PRSI contributions because of the exemptions in place at the higher income levels. Because of the way the present system is operated and the present ceiling, employers are encouraged to take on highly paid workers at the expense of lower paid workers as a certain proportion of one's income is exempt from PRSI contributions.  I believe this is wrong.  I equally believe, at a time when almost 20 per cent of the workforce is unemployed, that the last thing we should do is place a tax on employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the family income supplement is not being taken up by all of those entitled to receive it.  It is estimated that up to 20,000 families are entitled to receive it, as outlined by the Minister recently, rather that the 25,000 families initially estimated.  At present just over 5,000 families are taking up this supplement and this indicates that it is not <Col N="816" /> possible through that mechanism to target assistance at low income families. This may be due to the complicated nature of the system and the fact that it is not possible to find out who these people are and so on.</P>
    <P>The most effective way to help low income families would be to stop taxing them.  The findings of the ESRI survey carried out on behalf of the Combat Poverty Agency indicate, at the 60 per cent level of income, that 17 per cent of the families living in poverty are headed by a person in employment, but what do we do?  We tax them into poverty.  Even if a person earns only £500 a year they still have to pay tax in the form of PRSI. The Government made great play of the changes they made in the budget which will be implemented in the Finance Bill but those taxation benefits for low income families will be of no use to somebody who earns £3,000 or under per annum as they will still have to pay PRSI at the same level.  The Minister will probably say that they will get some marginal benefit because of the changes in the family income supplement but they certainly will get no benefit from the tax changes proposed in the budget.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is any justification for having PRSI distinct from the tax system.  We should amalgamate the two with a proportion of taxation being set aside.  A social security tax should be applied right across the board with no exemptions at the higher income levels, but whatever justification there may be for moving in that direction there is no justification for subjecting even the first £1,000 of income to PRSI contributions while exempting income from PRSI contributions over and above a figure of £16,700.</P>
    <P>In a reply to a parliamentary question last week the Minister informed me that it would cost about £82 million to exempt the first £2,000 of income from PRSI contributions.  I would like to think that the Minister would do this as it would provide an incentive for people to find work and help low income earners.  The money could be recouped by making other changes, through removing the <Col N="817" /> ceiling and by extending PRSI to other categories of workers.  I see no justification for exempting public servants or Dáil Deputies.  Either everyone pays or no one pays.  It is wrong that some people have to pay while others do not.</P>
    <P>We need to do everything we can to encourage job creation.  A more effective way of getting a contribution from employers would be to place a tax on turnover rather than on employment. Incentives should be given to labour-intensive industries to expand and take on more labour.  A social security tax could be applied on employers on the basis of turnover rather than on the number of employees on their payroll. The fact that we give a special PRSI allowance to PAYE taxpayers is an indication of the detrimental effect this tax has had and we do this because we recognise that it acts as a huge disincentive and represents an additional tax on those in this category.</P>
    <P>I am aware that PRSI has now been extended to the self-employed but we recognise that it acts as a disincentive to work.  Given the extent of poverty arising out of the high levels of unemployment we should, rather than penalise employment, do everything we can in the social welfare system and tax code to encourage the creation of jobs.  I strongly believe that PRSI amounts to nothing more than another tax but regardless of the perspective with which one looks at this and even if one says that it amounts to a social insurance contribution and is necessary from the point of view of welfare, there are better and fairer ways of raising the same level of revenue which do not act as disincentives to employment and do not discriminate against low income earners.</P>
    <P>In relation to the extension of PRSI to farmers and the self-employed, I would like the Minister to tell us the amount of money he expects to collect this year.  I understand that the figure contained in the Book of Estimates for 1989 is below the figure given by the Minister last year when the proposal went through this House.  I would like him to indicate how <Col N="818" /> the system has worked.  Perhaps information could be more formally sought by way of parliamentary question but I would like the Minister to give some broad indication of the success of this move and to indicate whether or not the collection mechanism in place at present is operating effectively.</P>
    <P>It seems strange that we apply the youth employment levy at a flat rate on all incomes but do not do so when it comes to PRSI.  I do not know what the justification for this is.  These sections as suggested by the Minister should be opposed because they are anti-employment, put more people into poverty and are in no strict sense a social insurance fund.  Throughout the discussion on this Bill to date we have seen how many categories of workers who pay PRSI will not be entitled to any additional benefits. Some long-term recipients of unemployment assistance will now get more than people on unemployment benefit. Widowers who have made contributions will not be entitled to claim on the basis of those contributions.  There are many such examples in the social welfare code. We seem to be restricting benefits all the time.  It is about time we recognised this for what it is.  It is time that we were more honest in how we described it, that we amalgamated it into the tax system, levied it across the board and raised it on the basis of turnover and not of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment to this section seeking that the income cutoff point should not be raised was ruled out of order.  I put down that amendment not because I do not believe people on incomes higher than that specified at the moment should not be paying it on that other income but because of the way in which the Bill proposes to reduce the benefits available in relation to pay-related benefit.  I would not argue that the present PRSI system is perfect, but I do not go down the road proposed by Deputy Harney and Deputy O'Keeffe who argue that PRSI is a tax on jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two things are being confused here.  I think what they are putting forward is <Col N="819" /> probably the employers' argument &mdash; that because they have to pay an employer's contribution this is a tax on them creating jobs.  I would accept that argument if there was any evidence that Irish capital was in any way breaking down doors to invest in jobs, but the figures available to us from the IDA, for instance, point out that of all the investment they have sanctioned for grant aid in 1987 and 1988, only 26 per cent is coming from indigenous capital and the rest from abroad.  Clearly, those who invest from abroad do not see the PRSI system as an obstacle to coming here creating jobs.</P>
    <P>As other speakers have said, capital is more beneficially treated with regard not necessarily to the social welfare system but to the tax system.  There is an imbalance with regard to labour and capital intensive investment, but I would argue, contrary to what the other two speakers have said, that there should be a neutral position between one and the other.  We do not want to go down the road of encouraging labour intensive industry at the expense of upgrading and introducing the most up-to-date technology.  We can see the effects on industry which failed to modernise in the banking industry at present.  Jobs are being lost there and fairly harsh decisions are being made in relation to letting staff go because over the years the baking industry refused or failed, for whatever reason, to modernise and ensure they were competitive.  The same happened in previous years in the milling industry, when Ranks closed their doors.  I do not think the argument made by Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy Harney really holds up.</P>
    <P>For instance, only one in every five companies in this State pay any tax because of the nature of the tax system. Therefore it cannot be argued that that is a discouragement to creating jobs.  I agree there needs to be a more neutral régime between labour and machines, but I would be very loath to see us going down the road of encouraging the employment of people simply because there is tax benefit or PRSI at the end of <Col N="820" /> the road, regardless of the effect that may have on either the pay of those who would be employed or the future prospects for the industry concerned.</P>
    <P>For those who are concerned about low pay, the simplest and most straightforward way of dealing with that problem is to introduce minimum pay legislation. It has been done in other countries.  In the United States, which one might call these days the home of capitalism minimum pay legislation has been introduced. The problem of people being trapped in poverty as a result of low pay would be eliminated by the introduction of minimum pay legislation.</P>
    <P>The question of competition from companies in various labour intensive industries who are using part-time labour needs to be looked at because that is probably a much greater disincentive to employers paying their PRSI contributions. At the moment if you employ a person for less than 18 hours a week you are exempt from having to make your PRSI contribution.  You are also exempt from a whole range of protective legislation for employees.  It would be better to concentrate on that area and on the minimum wage legislation as a way of dealing with the problem of low pay and unfair competition with those who are paying full PRSI.</P>
    <P>Let me draw the Minister's attention to my amendment No. 27 which, unfortunately, will not be reached.  It deals with a person convicted of social welfare fraud.  I have come across a case of a person who was convicted and fined and automatically had benefit withdrawn for six months.  To my horror I discovered there is no&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have come across cases where there is a double penalty on a family because, for whatever reason, and we can debate for the rest of the term the reasons behind it, a person charged, convicted and fined then finds his benefit is withdrawn for six months.  As things stand the Minister has no discretion whether this should be withdrawn. I am asking him to change the legislation so that he will have the discretion to grant the benefit in certain circumstances.</P>

      <P>The list of amendments shows amendments put down by me to sections 9 and 10.  There is a typographical error there which is not the Minister's fault.  It should be amendments to sections 8, 9 and 10.</P>
      <P>We are opposed to those three sections on the basis that they impose a further tax on employees, employers and the self-employed. The level of taxation is too high as it stands.  The reduction in PRSI payments means that workers generally would be better off saving that money, on which they would get a much better return.  A large section are paying PRSI for nothing since they do not qualify for anything.  It states in the explanatory memorandum that the rates of contributions are not being increased.  I find that difficult to understand when we are talking about raising the ceiling for both employees and employers.  If the Minister can demonstrate to me that the changes in sections 8, 9 and 10 mean that nobody will have to pay any more, naturally we will support those sections.  The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Section 8</i> provides for an increase from £16,200 to £16,700 per annum in the ceiling for contributions payable by employees and from £16,200 to £18,000 per annum for contributions payable by employers.  The rates of contributions are not being increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is correct we will be supporting the Bill but it is an error and if employees, employers and the self-employed will <Col N="822" /> have to pay more as a result of these sections, we will be opposing the Bill. Perhaps the Minister would clarify the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between the rate, the amount and the ceiling.  The things which contribute towards the amount are the rate and the ceiling or some exemptions.  The rate is not being increased.  It remains at 5.5 per cent.  People always think in terms of 7.75 per cent because in addition to the 5.5 per cent there is the youth employment levy and the 1.25 per cent health levy.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The rates remain unchanged but the ceilings are changed. I would point out that this is the lowest percentage increase in the PRSI ceiling for the past eight years.  We are not doing badly.  We have to maintain the social insurance fund.  If it is claimed that we should not have a social insurance fund, that is a different argument.  I want to have such a fund because it is good for workers.  If something much better can be suggested and well provided for, we can look at that.  I would want more than one bird in the bush and I would want to be assured that we had good social security for workers on which they could rely.</P>
      <P>In 1982 the increase in the ceiling was 11.8 per cent; in 1983 it was 37 per cent &mdash; that was the first year of the Coalition Government.  In 1984 they must have felt they had done enough in the previous year and there was no increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1985 the percentage increase in the ceiling was 6.2 per cent, while it was 6.5 per cent in the following <Col N="823" /> two years.  The increase in 1988 was 4.5 per cent and now it is to be 3.1 per cent, the lowest of the increases in the past eight years.  It is certainly very reasonable. This, at a time when all the rates are being increased, is a fair achievement.</P>
      <P>Social insurance provides comprehensive occupational protection for workers and their families.  A broadly-based system of financing ensures that the risks of unemployment, sickness, etc., are spread as widely as possible across the working community.</P>
      <P>The use of the PRSI system to regulate the labour market has been examined on a number of occasions.  A number of general points should be noted.  In gross terms, employers' PRSI costs only amount to about 6.5 per cent of overall costs.  Labour costs in general and employers' PRSI in particular are low in Ireland when compared with most European and OECD countries.  Labour-intensive industries in Ireland already enjoy a significant competitive advantage in this regard.  The most recently published OECD comparisons &mdash; 1986 &mdash; indicate that Government revenue from social welfare contributions amounts to only 5.7 per cent of GDP compared with the EC average of 11.6 per cent and an OECD average of 9.3 per cent.  The employers' element of PRSI contributions, currently 12.4 per cent, reducing to 12.2 per cent from April, is the second lowest in the EC.  Any reduction in PRSI contributions would have to be met by higher taxation or increased PRSI rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1986 the National Economic and Social Council was particularly struck by the absence of conclusive evidence on the likely employment impact of reducing employers' PRSI contributions.  A 1983 EC study entitled <i>Social Security Financing and Effects on Employment</i> concluded that the role of PRSI in employment creation is very narrow.  An OECD report in 1985 on labour market flexibility concluded that cutting pay-roll taxes is unlikely to increase employment. Employer contributions are very much an integral part of this system, reflecting <Col N="824" /> employer obligations as part of the community.</P>
    <P>Any exemptions of income or variations in the rate of contribution would lower the yield to the social insurance fund.  The estimated cost of selected exemptions in 1989-90 is as follows:</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the steps he will take to ensure that research carried out under the auspices of ethics committees in different hospitals will continue, in view of the recent problems arising out of the insurance difficulties concerning the implementation of the Clinical Trials Act, 1987; and if he will ensure that such research is facilitated at the earliest possible date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already set in train steps which will ensure that clinical research will continue to take place in our hospitals.</P>
      <P>At the outset, when the controls set out in the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987, became operational in December 1988 I indicated that I would be monitoring closely the implementation of this legislation.  As the House will be aware, this legislation brought Ireland to the fore in terms of statutory control over clinical research and I would be most anxious to ensure that the Act is, and is seen to be, working effectively.  The aim of the legislation is to provide a balanced framework within which clinical research is facilitated and those participating in clinical trials are protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the coming into force of the Act just three months ago, the concerns of certain ethics committees with regard to their potential legal liability have been brought to my attention.  I have tried to <Col N="826" /> allay these fears by meeting with representatives of the interested parties and conveying the legal advice available to me on the matter.  I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 14 column 218 of the Official Report of 6 December 1988 where I set out the position about the legal advice comprehensively.</P>
    <P>I am fully appreciative of the potentially serious effect which the present impasse might have on clinical research and, in order to expedite a resolution, I have asked representatives of the hospitals, clinical researches, Federation of Irish Chemical Industries, the Health Research Board and my Department to consider the operation of the Act with particular reference to the difficulties which have arisen in certain hospitals and clinical research in general in this country and to report to me by the end of March 1989.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to the serious concern about the long hours that junior hospital doctors have to work and the possible effect that these long hours could have on important medical decisions they are required to make; if he intends to take any steps to have the hours reduced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 5 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>The Labour Court, in Recommendation No. 11840, issued on 4 May 1988 recommended <i>inter alia</i> that, as a means of reducing the hours which non-consultant hospital doctors are required to work, the aim should be to ensure that all rosters are for not more than 65 hours per week on average.  This recommendation was accepted by management and by the Irish Medical Organisation. This commits the Irish hospital system to significantly shorter working hours than is being aspired to in the UK hospital service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the recommendation was issued, management, consultants and non-consultant hospital doctors at local level have engaged in discussions to draw up rosters which adequately reflect the service requirements in each hospital and in the light of the recommendations for the 65 <Col N="828" /> hour week.  Agreements have been reached in a number of areas and rosters implemented.  Where disagreement has been recorded, a monitoring committee, consisting of representatives of management and the Irish Medical Organisation with an independent chairman have been examining such cases in detail and making appropriate recommendations.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that implementation of the Labour Court recommendation will result in a significant reduction in the hours being worked by non-consultant hospital doctors and a considerable improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of medical care available in our hospitals.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the views expressed by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland concerning the training implications of a 65 hour week for non-consultant hospital doctors.  I would point out that the monitoring committee have, in a number of cases, recommended payment for hours in excess of 65 where there is agreement on all sides that the introduction of a 65 hour week would not be practical.  I feel that this is a reasonably flexible approach and represents a realistic solution to the difficulties, which the college foresees in relation to surgical training.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he has received a letter from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland drawing attention to the fact that this might seriously hinder the training of surgeons here and that the reciprocal arrangements which exist between the Royal College of Surgeons here and their counterpart in England and Scotland may be lost if we do not have sufficient time allocated to the training of surgeons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It would vary from job to job and the post a junior hospital doctor filled at a particular time.  For example, a doctor working with a skin consultant would be able to work for longer hours than if he or she was with a busy surgeon.  The hours would vary from time to time but, in principle, I would accept 65 hours as being a reasonable time.  However, we have to have regard to the needs of patients and to the needs of the doctors for their own training purposes. With the variety of hospitals around the country the rostering cannot always be arranged on the basis of the 65-hour week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be possible for the Minister to give us some assurances that in the hospitals where different conditions prevail doctors will operate to some standard set by him as to the maximum acceptable number of hours, or points beyond which he feels are not acceptable?  Will the Minister agree that there should be some reassurance to the public that the Minister is exercising control in regard to this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the monitoring committee will ensure that the hours worked are the appropriate hours in the circumstances.  I would like to assure the public that I am satisfied that doctors are not working hours that would constitute a danger to the public. The hours worked by doctors are appropriate and there is no risk to the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not want to comment on a specific case.  I repeat that I am satisfied that the hours worked by <Col N="830" /> doctors in this country do not create a risk for patients.  Indeed, as regards junior hospital doctors, I should say the 65-hour week is the lowest in Europe.  For example, in the United Kingdom they are going to have a trial period of 72 hours, reducing the number of hours doctors work there.  I am satisfied that there is no risk to patients from the number of hours worked by doctors. Having said that, I am also satisfied that the monitoring committee will ensure that the hours worked by junior hospital doctors comply with the agreement reached within the Labour Court.  But, in some cases, it may be necessary for doctors to work more than the 65 hours in order to meet patients' needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>In 1987 I initiated a comprehensive review of the acute hospital service with the objective of ensuring that the resources available are deployed with the maximum effectiveness and that a high level of service is available on an equitable basis throughout the country.  This review led to a planned reduction in bed numbers through a mixture of bed closures, hospital closures and the rationalisation and the amalgamation of services.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that as a result of this initiative we have in this country a hospital organisation and an adequate level of service for the population.  I have no plans at this stage for further hospital closures other than those already announced or for any radical change in organisation.  The responsibility for the immediate role of any individual general hospital lies in the first instance with the relevant health board or hospital authority. In my view this is as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> However, it is an important part of my responsibility, as Minister for Health, to keep under review the general roles and interrelationships of health board and voluntary hospitals to ensure that an efficient and effective hospital service is provided for the patients who require the service.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, the health boards have responsibility for the administration of the hospitals under their jurisdiction.  As the Deputy will be aware, there are the eight health boards but there are also approximately 40 voluntary agencies, including the large major hospitals in Dublin, funded directly by the Department.  We would have a responsibility there.  We would also have overall responsibility to ensure that there was an efficient hospital service available to all our people.  In regard to the specific instances the Deputy raised &mdash; Mallow and Castlereagh &mdash; I should say they would be the responsibility of the Southern and Western Health Boards respectively.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the plans he has to establish the cause of the significant increase in the number of deaths of infants under 12 months during the first six months of 1988, especially as the overall trend in such deaths has been downward in recent years; if he intends to investigate any possible link between poverty and the deaths of babies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current issue regarding the purported significant increase in the number <Col N="833" /> of infant deaths during the first two quarters of 1988 has arisen as a result of a failure to exercise caution in the interpretation of registration data.  The quarterly reports on vital statistics from which these figures have been taken do not provide information on the numbers of infants actually dying during that quarter but only on the number of infant deaths which were registered during that quarter.  Since infant deaths are relatively infrequent, the timing of the registration of these events can cause considerable fluctuations in the quarterly data.  The fact that a high proportion of these deaths occur in large maternity hospitals where a number of registrations may be submitted together would tend to exacerbate these variations.  My Department are currently endeavouring to ensure that maternity hospitals are prompt in registering infant deaths and that they do not submit registrations in batch form.  It is hoped that some of the fluctuations in quarterly data may in future be avoided in this way.</P>
      <P>In relation to the 282 infant deaths which were registered during the first six months of 1988, the Central Statistics Office have confirmed that 124 of these deaths actually occurred during 1987. Furthermore, the total number of registrations so far processed by the Central Statistics Office relating to occurrences of infant deaths during 1987 gives a total of 459.  This figure could increase somewhat with the addition of registrations received during the last half of 1988, but there is certainly no basis for concluding that there has been any underlying increase in the level of infant deaths in recent months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is quite correct in his statement that the trend in infant mortality has been downward in recent years.  The reduction in infant deaths has in fact been very rapid.  The infant mortality rate is now only a quarter of what it was 25 or 30 years ago and compares favourably with the levels experienced in most developed countries.  This is an achievement which should not be underestimated reflecting, as it does, quite <Col N="834" /> marked improvements in overall health and health care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that an increase on our infant mortality rate while the international level is dropping must be a matter of grave concern?

Does he intend examining the possibility of health cuts having this type of effect on the infant mortality rate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out in my reply, there is absolutely no evidence that there is any increase in the incidence of infant mortality in this country.  For example, the figures available represent the number of deaths registered during the quarter, not the number of infants who actually died.  As I pointed out also, in replying, in relation to 282 infant deaths which were registered in the first six months of 1988, the Central Statistics Office have confirmed that 124 of those deaths actually occurred during 1987.  It will be seen that almost half of the deaths registered in the first half of 1988 had occurred in the year 1987.  Therefore, it is not correct to draw a conclusion that there has been an increase in the infant mortality in this country.</P>
      <P>To answer the second part of Deputy Sherlock's question on the links between poverty and infant mortality, obviously we are always concerned &mdash; and this is not new &mdash; that there is a higher risk of morbidity and mortality in the lower income groups.  We are constantly addressing this and we would hope, through the health promotion unit, to do some studies to see what can be done to reduce the incidence of both sickness and death in the less well off groups.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be a little more forthcoming about the action he proposes to take to avoid batch registration of deaths?  I think it makes a bit <Col N="835" /> of a cod of the figures if we find that the interpretation is liable to be so misleading as they have been in this instance.  Further, is the Minister satisfied with the registration of the causes of infant mortality maintained by his Department to identify possible different sources that may be arising?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the second part of the question first.  Yes, I am satisfied that they are accurate in so far as certification of deaths generally is. I am satisfied that the causes of death in infant mortality cases are accurately registered and there has never been any suggestion otherwise.</P>
      <P>On the question of registration, as I pointed out in my reply, the registration per quarter is recorded by the Central Statistics Office.  If one wants statistics fairly rapidly, it is difficult to know how one can ensure that one will get just the deaths that are recorded, because as the Deputy is aware the requirement under law is that registration must be effected within 12 months of a death so there is time available for the person registering the death.  As I pointed out in my reply, sometimes in the large maternity hospitals they may register a number of deaths that occurred in the previous quarter together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>I can look into that matter.  From memory, I believe that under the 1876 Act it would be necessary to amend the legislation to reduce the time limit in which deaths must be registered from the current 12 months. However, I will undertake to write to the maternity hospitals in regard to infant mortality.  It would be more difficult where persons die outside hospital to have the deaths registered.</P>

      <P>I did not understand from the Minister's reply whether he is happy with the progress that has been made in welfare services for the elderly in the community care area as he did not say anything about that.  There has been a very low uptake of the home help and prescribed relative's allowance, although the Minister for Social Welfare indicated today that he will pay the prescribed relative's allowance to the carer which is certainly a welcome change.  Would the Minister indicate if he is satisfied with the community care programme for the aged and whether he has immediate plans to improve the situation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In my reply I answered the question asked by the Deputy but the Deputy is now broadening the question.  Certainly, we have plans to improve the facilities for the care <Col N="837" /> of the elderly.  I would point out that the community care services are very good.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>There is a whole range of services available to the elderly and there have been improvements in many services, for example, the public health nursing service, the home help service, etc.  However, with regard to the specific question, one area where good work is being done all the time, but where further work needs to be done, is the provision of respite care, so that those carers who wish to avail of a few weeks' holiday or if there is a crisis can avail of accommodation that would be available or help to look after the elderly.  Such schemes are working successfully in St. Mary's Hospital, Phoenix Park, in Blanchardstown Hospital and in Baggot Street Hospital.  I would like to see this scheme extended, and we have written to the health boards asking them to consider how that particular scheme could be extended as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that he has plans for the implementation of a policy for the elderly.  When does he intend to implement the plans?  May I ask about the home help scheme?  Would the Minister agree that because of cutbacks this service is totally inflexible and it is nearly impossible to get a home help from the health boards?  Has the Minister any plans for the training of home helps as is proposed in the policy for the elderly? Further, would he not agree that it is a highly cost effective service rather than institutionalising elderly people and that it is highly desirable from the community point of view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined what we are doing in terms of support for carers to develop and extend the respite care service, which is available in a number of areas.  I am glad to say that a great deal of progress has been made in this regard. On the broader question raised by Deputy Stagg, ideally an elderly person should be able to live out their lives in <Col N="838" /> their own home, and there are support services available to ensure this happens where it is possible and practicable.  Families have an obligation towards their elderly parents.  Indeed, we can be very proud of the way families look after their own elderly.</P>
      <P>The community also has a role to play in ensuring that the elderly can live in their community, for example, the old person's dwelling scheme, hostels and small homes in their own community are available.  It is only when these facilities for one reason or another are unsuited to the elderly person that they should have to go into permanent residential care.  That is the direction we are moving.  I might also add that the change in the general medical service scheme will allow the general practitioner to participate more actively in the team concept of the delivery of primary care and in my view this will be of benefit to the commuity, and to the elderly in particular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the apparent lack of urgency with which the Minister seems to be dealing with this matter; was he surprised to find that less than 2 per cent of the 66,000 carers were able to have home help, that less than 10 per cent were getting any nursing help and that less than 9 per cent overall were getting a reasonable level of support services? Does he not regard that as a serious indictment of the community care services available to cares in the home? Would he accept that it would cost approximately £350 million to substitute for this care if it had to be provided through State funding?  In view of that would the Minister not bring forward more specific plans than those he has indicated here today to do something definite within a specific time?</P>

I am concerned that, particularly in the larger urban areas, the inner city for example, there is accessibility to services that are available. This is something that needs to be addressed so as to ensure that people have access to the services available when they need them.  The public health nursing service and the home help service is available in each community care area of the health board.</P>

Would the Minister agree that the schemes he is describing are skeletal and so thin on the ground that most people who need the services simply cannot get them?  That includes the home help service, the nursing service and other community services.  Would the Minister agree that the reason for that is that the Minister did not provide the money to the health boards to expand the community care services when he cut back on institutional care?</P>

      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 8, 24 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that I undertook to review the operation of the community drugs schemes.  This review has now been completed and the Government have accepted my proposals as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> The present long-term illnesses scheme as currently constituted will be retained.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a drug subsidisation scheme for persons with limited eligibility who have a regular and continuous requirement for expensive medication due to a long-term medical condition.</P>
    <P>The scheme will be tailored to cater for those in greatest need, that is, those people who are on continuous and expensive medication.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are being made so that the financial outlay by the individual patient on medication will be kept to the minimum.  At the moment, a patient can claim a refund in respect of the amount of expenditure in excess of £28 per month. While it will not be possible to reduce this threshold at this stage, the new arrangements will ensure that that amount is the maximum which an individual will have to pay in a month.</P>
    <P>I have already commenced discussions with the health boards, the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and other interested parties regarding the details of the scheme with a view to its earliest possible implementation.</P>
    <P>The present drugs refund scheme will be retained in its present form for casual users.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us anything we do not know?  Does he consider that it is necessary to include asthmatics in the long-term illnesses scheme, because of the terrible circumstances of people especially where families are all asthmatic and cannot afford to pay the £28?  Is the Minister aware of the anomaly that exists in dispensing drugs under the long-term illnesses scheme, whereby the chemist gets the retail price plus the 50 per cent mark up which means in effect that it costs more to dispense drugs under the long-term illnesses card than it does under the medical card?  Will the Minister consider that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the variation between the long term illnesses scheme and the medical card scheme as it affects the payment for the drugs.  We <Col N="842" /> are constantly considering that to see how it can be improved.  As regards asthmatics, the first thing I would point out is that 40 per cent of the population have a totally free comprehensive medical service, including free drugs.  The new scheme where individual patients will only have to pay £28 month will be available to everybody.  There are many in society who have expensive treatments which are ongoing, for example, those with high blood pressure, with cancer or with skin diseases.  The advantage of the new scheme announced is that all these people will benefit from having to pay only £28 a month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify that having reviewed the community drugs support schemes he has decided that there should be no new additions to the long term illnesses list?  Will he also clarify how many of the existing drug refund users he reckons will fall into this new category who will just pay the £28 up front, and how many will be deemed to be casual users?  This announcement by the Minister will give the vast majority of the people concerned the old problem of having to pay a lot of money up front, wait until the health board adjudicates on whether the drugs were for use in the month in question and then perhaps discover that they will get a much lower refund than expected.  Will the Minister clarify the dividing line between casual and non-casual?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Casual in this sense relates to where the patient receives drugs just once, in other words, he is not on continuous treatment.  The patients who are on continuous treatment in successive months are the patients we are targeting this scheme on initially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to long term illnesses, the Minister's review turned up no new additions such as lupus or any of the other conditions for which a case has been made for inclusion in this scheme? I take it that none of those illnesses is acceptable to the Minister to qualify as a long term illness?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme is targeted towards the expenses of patients.  It is very important that we ensure that every patient who is paying large amounts of money for medication should benefit from whatever scheme we introduce.  If I was to put one category into the long term illnesses scheme, it would be justifiable to put them all in.  Unfortunately the State's resources would not stand up to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the selection of illnesses included in the long term illnesses scheme is subjective in the first instance, that to include diabetes and cancer, for example, and not to include people with renal failure is very much a subjective view? Would the Minister agree that it is only fair and right that anybody who has to have ongoing medical expenses of the nature we have described should be covered under the long term illnesses card?  Would the Minister also agree that the use of generic drugs and the payment of a dispensing fee on the same basis as applies in respect of medical card holders to pharmacists, would probably save the kind of money that would be required to extend the categories of illnesses covered by the long term illnesses card?  Is the Minister having discussions with the pharmacists in relation to the fee payable and can he tell us when he expects this new scheme to come into operation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are ongoing discussions with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, the representatives of the pharmacists. I would hope to see the scheme introduced towards the middle of the year.  As regards the patients who should be in the long term illness scheme, I accept what the Deputy says that there are anomalies.  Ideally, we would like to be able to include everybody who is on continuous treatment, in the long term illness scheme, but in fairness to the patients, we have to work within our <Col N="844" /> budget.  It is important that we should ensure that every patient who is on long term treatment will benefit from the new scheme, and that is what we are doing in this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am expressing my disappointment at the Minister's refusal to extend the long term illness scheme which was the basic request.  Will there not be an enormous administration cost in the operation of the £28 per month type of scheme, and can he tell the House how he envisages that scheme will operate? Will the chemist have to fill out forms?  Will the health boards have to adjudicate on the case?  Who will do all the paper work that will be involved? Would it not be cheaper and more effective from the patient and the State's point of view to put people with long term illnesses, who require long term treatment on the long term illness scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the present scheme is expensive in terms of administration because, as Deputy Bruton pointed out, patients' prescriptions, their accounts or receipts from pharmacists have to be processed by the local health board.  I would envisage that there would be a reduction in the amount of administration necessary for the new scheme. I would hope it would be a computerised scheme similar to the scheme which exists at present for holders of GMS medical cards.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Stagg's disappointment that we are not extending the long term illness scheme to include everybody, what we are doing is an enormous advance in regard to the drugs refund scheme because the major problem people face was the very large outlay each month and having to wait two to three months to receive a refund.  I had somebody with me recently who was waiting since Christmas to receive over £300 by way of refund.  They will not have to face that sort of long delay under the new scheme.  They will not even have to pay out that money in the first instance, and I believe that is an enormous advance.</P>

      <P>In all health board areas persons covered by medical cards who attend outpatient psychiatric clinics obtain their medication free of charge. Depot injections are also provided free. These arrangements cover the great majority of patients.  Practice varies, however, between health boards in relation to persons who are not covered by medical cards.  In two areas the drugs are provided free of charge.  In the rest of the country the patient is given a prescription which he has dispensed in the ordinary way, as is the case with patients <Col N="846" /> attending any other outpatient clinic.  I have arranged for officers of my Department to raise these variations with the chief executive officers of the various health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the practice actually has changed in some areas, that patients attending St. Dympna's Hospital in Carlow and patients from that hospital who are visited in their homes by the nurses, have recently been refused free medicines and have been given prescriptions?  Would the Minister agree that the policy of bringing such patients &mdash; a highly desirable policy &mdash; into the community and keeping them there is being attacked or undermined by the fact that medicines will no longer be available to them free of charge?  Would he consider giving such patients a special medical card to cover the cost of the particular drugs, and the regime of drugs required, to enable them to stay in the community?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what Deputy Stagg said that there has been a change in the practice in particular health board areas and, indeed, over the years there has been a change in many health board areas in regard to the supply of medicines. I suppose there is no area of medicine that has changed as much as psychiatry over the years.  It is a matter of clinical judgment what particular system is adopted: in one psychiatric catchment area one psychiatric hospital decides to provide the drugs and in another they do not.  As I have pointed out to the Deputy, we will discuss the variations with the chief executive officers of the health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>My own view is that it is a matter of clinical judgment.  It raises a fundamental question as to whether the general practitioner or the doctor from the psychiatric hospital, a psychiatrist, assumes responsibility for the ongoing management of the patient.  The trend in psychiatry has changed very much over the last 20 years when it was a hospital based service.  With the advent of modern drug treatment, the service has become very much community orientated.  In the context of the working party report Planning for the Future subscribed to by all Members of the House, it would appear that the general practitioner service will play a greater role in the management of patients.  Against that background a decision has to be made as to who will be responsible for the dispensing of the drugs.</P>

Is the Minister aware that for the first time ever in the areas I am talking about specifically that patients are now being charged for drugs and that arising from that they are going without drugs? Is the Minister aware that this will undermine the whole community aspect of psychiatric care because the public are now afraid of patients who are not getting the drugs they require for their treatment and they are out in public?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he has any proposals to provide financial assistance for general practitioners who establish group practices in rural areas, and who wish to establish community health centres in order to provide emergency and basic medical services in addition to ambulance facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of community health centres is a matter for each health board in the light of overall health priorities and in the context of available financing.  I am satisfied that the new agreement with medical practioners in the GMS provides sufficient incentives to encourage the establishment of both group and partnership practices, where such groupings are seen to provide a more effective and efficient service to eligible patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new agreement specifically provides for access to health centres, dispensaries and other health board accommodation to approved group practices and partnerships, together with enhanced fee payments for an extended range of special items of services and a continuation of the provision for payment of grants for practice premises development at the discretion of the health board.  Assistance towards the cost of <Col N="850" /> employing practice staff is also available to individual doctors or group practices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>While accepting the Minister's viewpoint that it is up to each health board to decide the level of their services, would the Minister not accept that there is a need for an overall policy from his Department in that respect; also that it is not practical for the majority of health centres to cater for a new rationalised service, particularly where there is a grouping of four or five doctors, and that the existing health centres are not adequate to cope with such a new service? In view of the earlier comments by the Minister in respect of community orientation and the need for a greater role by the general practitioners, would the Minister not accept the rationale of amalgamating existing individual group practices, existing GP services, in order to eliminate duplication, to provide easy access to second opinions, to enhance preventative medicine, to give better family planning services and overall to lessen the pressures on existing hospital facilities and outpatient services, particularly in the light of ongoing and impending hospital closures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The new general medical services scheme will do exactly what Deputy Higgins would wish: it will improve the facilities for general practitioners to work from the fiscal environment and the thrust of the new scheme will support group practices and the integration of practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the new scheme does not give any incentive to encourage the amalgamation of practices or the development of group practices, as suggested by Deputy Higgins?  Would he also agree that if we are to give the kind of expert choice to the public in the community, as opposed to having them depend on hospitals, this is the only way to proceed? Would he further agree that many services could be carried out in GP surgeries for about 20 per cent of the cost of providing the service in a public hospital and <Col N="851" /> that, therefore, there would be enormous savings to the Exchequer if we were to move in this direction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to the specific question raised by Deputy Higgins about financial assistance for general practitioners who establish group practices, the new agreement specifically provides for access to health centres, dispensaries and other health board accommodation to approved group practices and partnerships.  My reply to the specific question raised by Deputy Higgins is an indication of our support for group practices.</P>
      <P>On the broader question raised by Deputy Harney, I would agree that ideally from the patients' point of view and an economic point of view, they should be treated at the lowest level of complexity for their particular illness. The number of special items for which a fee will be available will encourage doctors to carry out procedures that perhaps in the past patients were referred to hospital for.  As Deputy Harney rightly pointed out, this would cost the Exchequer less.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the Minister's very disappointing reply, which is quite obvious in regard to a non-commitment of funding for further services, would he not agree that from the point of view of resuscitation in cases of cardiac arrest that a two hours minimum waiting period for ambulance service is totally intolerable, that this is very much the prevalent waiting period within large sections of the existing rural health board areas and that, therefore, from the point of view of treating collapsed patients ECG facilities should be made available at such centres which are inadequately equipped to deal with such emergencies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy was listening to my reply but <Col N="852" /> in relation to the question he asked I pointed out that there are developments in this area.  I should like to point out that as a result of the new general medical service there will be a whole range of benefits available to doctors, including a development fund, to support them in their practice of medicine.</P>
      <P>On the question of the delays in the ambulance service, if there is a specific case the Deputy wants me to raise I will be glad to do so.  I will raise with the health boards the general question of the waiting period for ambulance services. Obviously if a patient needs an ambulance urgently it is important that an ambulance be available.  I have had no complaints that there is a general waiting time which is unacceptable.  If occasionally there is a specific complaint about an individual case I pursue it, and I will be glad to do this for the Deputy if he has a specific case in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give the House an assurance that within the new range of services which he envisages and the new aids and assistance which he proposes providing under the new scheme there will be some element of grant towards the capital costs of extending existing health services?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the general medical service &mdash; I presume this is what the Deputy is referring to &mdash; there is an increased allocation to improve the level of general practice.  At present discussions are ongoing with the Irish Medical Organisation to work out the details of how the level of general practice might be improved from the development fund. There are many issues involved &mdash; the amount of allocation to a particular practice, the size of the practice, etc.  Discussions are ongoing at present with the Irish Medical Organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The general medical services scheme was negotiated with the Irish Medical Organisation under the independent chairmanship of Mr. John Horgan, Chairman of the Labour Court, and, in my view, represents a sound and viable basis for the provision of services to all eligible patients.</P>
      <P>The scale of fees underpinning the capitation method of remunerating participating doctors was drawn up having full regard to the demand placed on the scheme by patient groupings in the past. The new agreement also provides for a review, under an independent chairman after the first 12 months of its operation. I am confident that the review mechanism can deal effectively with any difficulty which may emerge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the scheme does not really recognise that some families do not have the capacity for home support in a time of illness, for example, single parent families, and that this is an acute problem in many city areas?  Does he also accept that higher support rates will be inevitable? Does the Minister not accept that for GPs who have to attend to a population that has a disproportionate number of families in those categories there must be some recognition of that problem under the GMS?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The question refers to recognition by way of increased fee in the particular circumstances outlined by Deputy Bruton.  As I have already said, the new scheme was negotiated with the Irish Medical Organisation and the scale of fees agreed.  The negotiations were under the chairmanship of Mr. John Horgan, Chairman of the Labour Court. Obviously, there was agreement during the negotiations on the scale of fees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, is it not the Minister's responsibility to see that the service provided meets the needs of specific vulnerable groups?  To say that two major sections came together in negotiation and settled on a deal does not give me reassurance that the needs of a particular vulnerable group are necessarily catered for under that agreement. Does the Minister feel that, for example, with a high number of single parents doctors are inevitably going to need to apply higher visiting rates in those areas because there is nobody else to fall back on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue raised in the question is increased fees for doctors participating in inner city areas in particular. As I say, the fees and scale of fees were agreed between the IMO and management &mdash; health boards and the Department of Health.  Deputy Bruton is raising a very fundamental issue of the provision of services.  Certainly, I have responsibility and will discharge that responsibility to ensure that services are available.  There should be no change in the availability of services to any patient who needs it as a result of the change in the method of payment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>To focus on the core issue of the question in relation to GPs in city centre areas, would the Minister accept that in the north side of this city there is inadequate GP cover?  That is one of the strongest reasons for supporting the Temple Street Children's Hospital outpatients' department.  Would he not accept that there are considerable problems in the north side of the city in having GPs on call?  What proposals has the Minister to deal with those problems which now exist?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that for a number of years there have been such problems.  This appears to be a city problem. It does not exist to any large extent outside the city.  There is insufficient cover &mdash; in some areas of the city, I might <Col N="855" /> add.  There are many areas of the city where general practitioners, either on their own or in groups, are providing an excellent level of service 24 hours a day. There are areas where this is not happening and we have taken up the matter with the Eastern Health Board because, principally, it is in Dublin that the problem arises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the <Col N="856" /> Southern Health Board in recent months have been reviewing their range of community care services.  The board have effected economies within their overall community care resources which have facilitated the employment of additional field workers.  My Department approved, on the 8 December last, the recruitment of a number of additional staff including two social workers.</P>
      <P>The adequacy of community care services in each health board area, including the number of social workers employed, is currently being reviewed by the health boards in consultation with my Department, in the light of the Child Care Bill which is before the Dáil.  I will carefully consider the outcome of this assessment when it is completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the Cork region, in particular, there are at the moment a number of children in care who would more suitably have been fostered out to families?  There are a large number of families anxious to have these children fostered with them, but because of the grave shortage of social workers that is not possible.  As a matter of urgency, would the Minister ensure that in the Cork city area, in particular, and in other regions of the country there are sufficient social workers on hand to ensure that children do not have to spend unnecessary time in institutional care?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, I will review the situation.  It is kept under constant review.  To those who would say that there has been a diminution in the level of service in the area of community care, I might point out that in the Southern Health Board area in June 1987 there were 41 posts of social worker and in June 1988 there were 47.  That is an increase of six.  As I have stated in the answer, we approved another two social workers last December.</P>

There are three social workers, for instance, in the city of Waterford.  I am very glad to hear that the Minister is reviewing the situation in the light of the imminent passage of the Child Care Bill.

      <P>The bone marrow transplant unit will be in the new phase of the hospital and it has not yet been started.  As the Deputy is aware, the 450 bed hospital is built and part of it has been opened, including the X-Ray Department.  The out-patients' unit will be opened later on this year, the equipping of the major hospital with 450 beds is taking place and I hope it will be opened early next year.  The bone marrow transplant services are difficult to organise because of their complexity and because of the fact that there are so many different disciplines involved.  For example, St. Luke's are involved in regard to total body irradiation and the Children's Hospital, Crumlin, are also involved.  We are anxious to ensure that everyone in this country can avail of a service but at present there is no total body irradiation for children and we are trying to rectify that position.  Recently a new linear accelerator was installed in St. Luke's Hospital for that purpose.</P>

Is he saying that the marginal cost of treating a patient in Ireland is £25,000 and that the figure is the same for treatment in England?  It is surprising if that is the case.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>In page 21, before line 1, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="949" />&ldquo;30.  Section 112 of the Principal Act (which relates to the administration of benefit) is hereby amended by the insertion in subsection (3) after paragraph (c) of the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(d) notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, or regulations made thereunder, for enabling the increase for a prescribed relative payable under section 50 (11), 51 (2), 81 (3), 86 (3), 91 (3), 95 (2) or 103 (2), subject to such conditions and in such circumstances as may be prescribed to be paid directly to the prescribed relative.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is the amendment to which we agreed this morning and it was prepared during lunchtime.  It relates to the prescribed relative's allowance being paid directly to the prescribed relative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy that the Minister has taken my amendment on board.  It incorporates the principle I had in mind and to which I referred on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I hope we are now opening up a new era for those who look after elderly and incapacitated pensioners.  I also hope we have taken what is only the first step. Now that we have agreed to make the payment direct to the carer &mdash; I am very glad to have been associated with having put down the amendment on Committee Stage &mdash; the next stages must be, first, to broaden the category of those who qualify for the allowance and, second, to ensure that the payment made to the carer is adequate.  I appreciate that there is a cost involved in so far as the Department of Social Welfare are concerned, but if we take overall Government finances into account there could be a net saving.</P>
      <P>If the financial resources were available many people now being cared for in homes, hospitals and geriatric institutions would be cared for at home.  When we take into account the cost of maintaining someone in a hospital, up to £1,000 per week in some instances, it makes economic sense to focus on care in the home rather than in institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="950" /> Now that this principle has been accepted, I will in the future try to ensure that the amount paid to the carer is adequate.  Quite frankly, I do not accept that the sum of £28 per week is adequate. We should aim to bring that figure up to, at the minimum, £42 which is the level of supplementary welfare allowance. However, that is down the line.  I am delighted that the principle which I proposed on Committee Stage this morning has been accepted and it was encouraging that my proposal received support from all sides of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for accepting the approach proposed in the amendment.  In using this practical approach we would be able to deal with the difficulties which may be encountered in taking what we all believe to be an important step, the paying of the prescribed relative's allowance in the future to the relative providing the care under the same conditions which have applied up until now.  Deputies have spoken of the need for a wider scheme and the need to provide more care and assistance for elderly people.  Naturally I am also concerned and at this stage I can only assure Deputies that we will be looking at this matter further to see how we can move forward with this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone fears that once the door has been opened everybody will be looking for all sorts of extensions and improvements. This is an important step we are taking.  It is one we can develop but we will have to develop it within the resources available.  I can assure Deputies that I will give a good deal of attention to this question over the coming months to see if anything further can be done.  It is a very useful mechanism for the provision of support.  Of course it <Col N="951" /> could operate in a different way in that, as some Deputies have said, it could bring people out of other schemes and into this one.  We will have to see how this can be done but it is our intention that the assistance required will be provided following a means test which is the way it operates at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe has also found a solution for one of his other problems.  At present the prescribed relative's allowance is subject to tax, but under this new arrangement where it will be paid to the carer it will not be subject to tax.  I am aware that this could impose a charge on the Exchequer and the Deputy will be pleased that I am introducing it but there is no question of that arising.</P>
    <P>I thank all Deputies who have contributed to the debate, Deputy O'Keeffe in particular, who put down the original amendment which I am very happy to meet in this way.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me intervene at this point to say that there is one other amendment in the course of circulation and I will outline it.  It is an amendment to the Principal Act, section 115 (1) (f) (i) and relates to an amendment which Deputy De Rossa put down on Committee Stage but did not press, amendment No. 27.  That amendment reads:</P>
      <P>14.  Section 115 of the Principal Act is amended by the deletion in subsection (f) (i) of the words &ldquo;shall be disqualified&rdquo; and the substitution of the words &ldquo;may be disqualified&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a person is found guilty of an offence and is found guilty of fraud in respect of unemployment benefit or disability <Col N="952" /> benefit and the court imposes a penalty, an additional penalty is applied with the person concerned because he loses benefit for six months.  In his amendment Deputy De Rossa sought to substitute the words &ldquo;shall be disqualified&rdquo; with the words &ldquo;may be disqualified&rdquo; to provide a degree of discretion in that area.  He said he had come across cases where this penalty was particularly severe.  I appreciate the case Deputy De Rossa has made but there could be difficulties in allowing a degree of discretion in this area because if each deciding officer had a degree of discretion there would be variations.</P>
    <P>In the amendment being circulated, a very simple one, I propose to reduce the period from six months to three months. This is the period which applies in other legislation.  I propose to take that step having listened to the points made by Deputy De Rossa and to take a further look at it later.  It is comparable to provisions contained in other legislation.</P>
    <P>It would simply be a matter of changing the figure &ldquo;6&rdquo; to the figure &ldquo;3&rdquo; in the legislation.  If the House agrees, we can proceed with this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I welcome the Minister's approach to this question.  As I mentioned on Committee Stage, it was quite oppressive in many cases for a person to have a double penalty applied. A case was brought to my attention of a woman who was in receipt of disability benefit and who had quite a traumatic family experience.  Her mother and some of her relations were burned to death in a fire and as a consequence of that her whole life became disoriented.  After a time it was found she had been overpaid disability benefit for a period of months to the tune of £648.67.  When this was discovered she agreed to repay that amount and had it repaid.  When the amount due had reduced to £20 she received a summons to appear in court. She went to court and pleaded her case. The judge acknowledged the position she had found herself in and applied a fairly small fine of £50.  She had reduced the overpayment from £648 down to £20; she <Col N="953" /> was fined £50 and subsequent to that she got a letter in the post from the Department saying she would now no longer be entitled to her disability benefit for six months and there was no appeal against this.  I wrote to the Department about it and asked if this could be reviewed.  I got a very courteous letter in reply saying they regretted there was nothing they could do about it, it was in the legislation, it was mandatory that this penalty would apply; the benefit would be withdrawn for six months and that was the way it had to be.  I wrote again explaining the circumstances and they wrote back again in a very courteous way explaining there was nothing they could do but when the six months was up they would be prepared to consider the question of the balance, which was quite small at that time, being paid at £1 or £2 a week if she had a fresh claim for disability benefit.</P>
      <P>Obviously, the fault is not with the Department of Social Welfare in this matter.  The Act was passed by this House.  Once a person is convicted in the court of, presumably, fraud &mdash; although in this instance I think that is too strong a word to use &mdash; the benefit is lost automatically for six months.  Her husband was in receipt of unemployment benefit, therefore she could not qualify for supplementary welfare allowance as might be the case if she was the sole earner in the home.</P>
      <P>Another case was brought to my attention of a man who was overpaid £2,000, had repaid £400 of it and was fined £100 in the courts.  He had been paying at the rate of £9 a week off his unemployment benefit and was subsequently informed he was going to lose his benefit for six months.  The only thing he could get in place of that benefit was supplementary welfare allowance, which meant a dramatic drop in family income and family circumstances.  That is too draconian an application of the law against the people who by and large are poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no problem in relation to applying the law to people who are well off and can afford to lose a month's money. Indeed.  I am not aware that the law in <Col N="954" /> relation to tax evasion is quite as draconian as this legislation in relation to social welfare.  For that reason I welcome the Minister's response in introducing an amendment which will reduce the obligatory loss of benefit from six months to three months.  I hope he can in the fairly near future introduce a degree of discretion in how this is applied.  Deputies in this House will be aware of cases where the loss for even a few weeks of social welfare income can have devastating effects on a family.  It should not necessarily be at the discretion of the social welfare officers on a local basis.  It is not necessarily the best thing to give discretion to the Minister &mdash; not that the Minister would abuse it in any way but it leads to politicking and TDs being approached and having to write to Ministers and so forth.  However, some form of discretion needs to be introduced so that, depending on the circumstances, the penalty need not be applied.</P>
    <P>I wonder to what extent the district justices, before whom I am sure most of these cases come, are aware when they convict that there is an automatic loss of benefit to the person charged.  It seems, judging by the amounts of fines involved in the two cases I have referred to, they considered, taking everything into account, that they applied a fairly minimal fine.  Maybe they are not aware that there is a further penalty to be applied.  I wonder if it would be possible for the Minister to convey to the President of the District Court or whoever it may be that this is the case and that, while we need to deal with cases on a fair basis, the fact that a penalty of loss of benefit will apply should be borne in mind when conviction is being considered.  Again I thank the Minister.</P>

      <P>Deputy De Rossa has made a good case in relation to this amendment.  I am glad to see the Minister has the good grace to respond to the case made and to move this proposal.  Looking at the situation dispassionately and listening to it as described by Deputy De Rossa, it seems an element of double penalty is involved here which raises the question of constitutionality.  Needless to say, I accept the proposal as now suggested by the Minister as an interim solution. It is a reasonable response at this stage.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the matter should be looked at further.  Generally, as a lawyer, I feel there are great dangers associated with mandatory penalties.  Circumstances in cases can differ so widely.  Deputy De Rossa's point is well made, that in many cases where a district justice is imposing a fine under this section that district justice may not be aware of further penalties attaching to conviction.  I suggest to the Minister that an ultimate solution to the case made might be that a discretion should be included and that discretion should be exercised by the district justice. That would cover the point raised by Deputy De Rossa that district justices may not be aware of this penalty and such would have to be brought to their attention by the prosecuting authorities from the point of view of having the penalty under this subsection fixed.  That might be the best answer, that a discretion would be included under the subsection and the discretion would be exercised by the district justice.  I mention that for consideration for the future.  The interim solution now proposed is fully acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this decision.  We have all come across cases of severe hardship under this heading.  I spoke strongly <Col N="956" /> on Second Stage regarding my concern about the whole penalty issue, the investigating of alleged fraud, the manner in which it is being dealt with and what happens as a consequence.  I was effectively calling for some code of conduct in the manner of investigation and prosecution of cases under this heading.  The opinion is abroad that the investigation are being carried out by officers of the Department who are like a Gestapo brigade. I am not suggesting that this is the case.  Nevertheless there is a feeling that there are spies under every bed to see if people are abusing social welfare.  I was advised during the week about a person committed for a very serious crime who, I understand, was employed in some capacity by the Department for the purpose of spying on people to gather information about alleged social welfare fraud.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify for the information of the general public whether the Department, apart from the officers of the special investigating unit, pay any money to members of the general public for the purpose of gathering information about social welfare recipients. For example, I could write a letter on behalf of my next door neighbour and say that Joe Black is working on a building site, simply because I might have had a row with him.  I had a number of amendments on Committee Stage in relation to this matter but we did not reach them.</P>
      <P>There should be a code of conduct because these people are not members of the Garda Síochána and are not covered by the Department of Justice.  They are employees of the Department of Social Welfare but they are acting as if they had more power than the Garda, even the Special Branch.  They can apparently enter wherever they wish.  They can do what they want and they do not have to caution people or to give any information before an appeal takes place.  A person is guilty until proven innocent, which is a complete contradiction of every democratic law enacted by the Oireachtas.  The Minister should clearly state the manner in which information is collected for the purpose of the prosecution of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is a move in the right <Col N="957" /> direction but people can still effectively be convicted on information against which in many cases they do not have the opportunity of appealing before they go to the civil court.  A deciding officer will make a decision to disqualify a person on information supplied by a member of the special investigating unit.  That information could be gathered from anybody, perhaps from a neighbour who disliked the person concerned.  I was on the appeals panel for 25 years so I know what I am talking about.  I have seen people disqualified from benefit on the basis of information supplied by the special investigating unit, although that information was not supplied to the person charged with fraud or to any person representing him or her.  I have represented people in hundreds of cases and I found it almost impossible to get the relevant information. The Department officials will not give copies of whatever correspondence they have.  This is the only legal transaction where one cannot look at the Book of Evidence or get any information as to how the crime is being prosecuted.  This could probably be dealt with by the Minister without coming before the House.  If something is not done to rectify matters, we will have to bring forward a measure in Private Members' time.</P>
    <P>Judging from the correspondence and telephone calls I receive there is unease in the minds of the public about the manner in which these investigations are conducted.  If there is a suggestion of fraud and benefit is stopped on the decision of the deciding officer, the person concerned should be given full information as to the basis on which the decision was taken.  He or she should be informed as to whether it was taken on the basis of a neighbour's complaint.  In some cases I discovered that relatives were fighting among each other and were giving information out of pure vindictiveness. In many cases deciding officers debar people from benefit on that kind of basis.  I also had a case of mistaken identity where a man with seven children was debarred from benefit on Christmas Eve.</P>
    <P>Another point is that employment <Col N="958" /> exchanges are passing on information to community welfare officers.  They telephone to say that a person is on his way with a letter stating that his case is under appeal but as far as they are concerned they have the evidence that he is guilty. The community welfare officer will then say he cannot pay that person if he is defrauding the Department of Social Welfare.  These people are going from the Department to the health board in a most degrading way.  A fellow who committed murder would not be treated like that; he would be let out on bail.  One would need to commit the most serious of serious crimes before the forces of the law would act in the way they are acting against people whose claims are under investigation.  In saying that I want to put it on record that my party do not condone in any way social welfare fraud.  Such fraud robs money from people who are paying PAYE and people who would be benefiting if more money were available.</P>
    <P>Some of the officials think they have unlimited rights of investigation, which in fact they have.  They can demand whatever information they like from the bank, the post office or credit unions, without any court order.  They can enter any premises on the same basis and demand any information they want, again without a court order.  They can tell a person he is guilty and tell him to prove himself innocent.  I have personal experience of representing people like that and of asking to be shown the evidence on which these people were disqualified.  In many cases they did not make that information available to me.  If the Minister hopes to get public opinion in relation to the investigation of social welfare fraud and abuse with him he will have to produce a code of conduct which will be accepted as reasonable and fair by the public.  That code of conduct will have to be on the basis of a person being innocent until proven guilty.  There is little point in a person being told six months after he or she has been accused of fraud that he or she is innocent of the charge because in the meantime a family may have had to exist on a handout from a community <Col N="959" /> welfare officer, if they are lucky.  I welcome the change introduced by the Minister; it is reasonable and we should review it next year.</P>

      <P>The provision will come into effect at the beginning of April.  The mind of the House is that the retrospective effect should apply straight away and I do not think there will be any difficulty in doing that.  The amendment states:</P>
      <P>In page 21, before line 1, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;31.&mdash;Section 115 (1) (as amended by section 21 of the Act of 1988) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (f) of `3 months' for `6 months'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of questions have been raised in regard to the amendment.  Deputy Bell referred to the conduct of investigations. At the outset I should like to say that allegations are received by the Department from time to time.  Some do not have any substance to them and are not pursued while others are pursued.  From memory I can say that a little more than one third of allegations highlight a problem, that there is defrauding or abuse. This is something that officials of the Department must pursue.  Officials always adopt a careful approach.  The process is slow.  I am often criticised on the basis that the process does not move fast enough but I would not interfere with it.  I allow the procedure to take its course.  I accept that occasionally we may have an oversolicitous investigator and in such instances the chief inspector gets involved.  He is a very experienced official <Col N="960" /> and he adopts a reasonable and balanced approach to these matters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell refered to the activities of the special investigation unit of the Department.  I should like to make it clear that the Department do not under any circumstances make use of paid informers or spies in the course of their work.  It is easy to castigate the good work done by this unit, and other social welfare officers but that, of course, is of little avail.  They have a difficult job to do.  For the record I should like to state that social welfare officers have considerable powers of entry and inquiry.  If premises are being used as a place of employment the social welfare officer has the right of entry and inspection of employment records.  As already indicated these powers are proving to be invaluable in the fight against fraud and abuse.  I do not think the House would have it otherwise. The social welfare officer does not have deciding powers.  That officer cannot cut off any person's social welfare entitlement. When information is received about a person it is investigated and a report of the outcome of that investigation is furnished to a deciding officer. The deciding officer will decide on entitlement on the basis of that report and using the normal procedures adopted by deciding officers.</P>
    <P>Whether it is a report to a deciding officer or a submission for prosecution the social welfare officer within the course of the investigation, puts the allegation fully to the client, asks him or her whatever questions are relevant and invites him or her to make any statements or observations he or she may wish.  Where an offence is suspected the suspect is made aware of the fact, of the nature of the offence and that he or she is not obliged to say anything unless he or she wishes to do so but that anything he or she may say will be taken down and may be tendered in evidence.  The statement is read back to the client before being asked to sign it so that he or she know what they are signing.  These procedures are in accordance with the Judges' Rules and are operated within advice received from time to time from the office of the Chief <Col N="961" /> State Solicitor.  Likewise, appeals officers and deciding officers are required to operate within the rules of natural justice. There are procedures for the handling of appeals and clients are fully informed at their hearing of the case against them.</P>
    <P>On the provision of documents to an appellant before an appeal, if the claimant requests copies of any reports on evidence, including reports of the social welfare officer, those documents would be supplied to him.  Reports in relation to appeals can range from straightforward means assessments carried out by social welfare officers to more sensitive reports relating to, for example, the question of desertion in social assistance, or deserted wife's benefit cases, and medical reports in relation to the question of capacity for work.</P>
    <P>Unemployment benefit, and unemployment assistance cases, which would have had some involvement by an investigating officer and later give rise to appeals usually involve the questions of availability for work, genuinely seeking work and cases where fraudulent claiming has arisen.  Claimants in those cases would also receive on request copies of any documentation in relation to their case.  In any event, in accordance with the principles of natural justice, an appellant is fully informed at a hearing of the case against him and what he has to answer in order to succeed with his appeal.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of supplying all appellants with copies of reports, investigation papers and so on concerning an appeal, I should like to say that the introduction of such a procedure into the present appeals arrangement would involve heavy administrative costs.  There are some 18,000 appeals dealt with each year and up to 40 per cent are dealt with by way of an oral hearing.  In addition, an even higher number of persons appeal initially and then decide not to proceed with the appeal before it is sent to an appeals officer.  However, the procedure suggested could be examined further in the context of the proposals under consideration for the setting up of a separate <Col N="962" /> appeals office.  I trust that the Deputy will recognise that there will be considerable costs and administrative expenses involved.</P>
    <P>My amendment, as Deputy O'Keeffe pointed out, amounts to alleviation.  At a later stage we can look at the wider implications and the relationship with other penalties.  I am happy to accept the suggestion put forward by Deputy De Rossa.  In the first instance there will be a conviction and then a penalty will be imposed by the court.  It is probable, as suggested by Deputy O'Keeffe, that district justices are not familiar with that aspect of social welfare legislation when making decisions.  That could be a difficulty. The penalty imposed is a matter for the court.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare are reimbursed, perhaps over a very long period, but there is a mechanism whereby that is done depending on the income of the person concerned.  In the light of all of those circumstances it is reasonable to reduce this mandatory penalty and to have it examined further, as has been suggested.</P>
    <P>I hope Members will be able to support this amendment.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions.  I have endeavoured to meet the points raised by Deputies in the course of the year on Second Stage and Committee Stage debates.  I thank Deputies for the way they have received this Bill and for their proposals.</P>
      <P>This Bill represents a major step forward in the improvement of our social welfare code generally and provides substantial increases for those at present in receipt of the lowest levels of payment who have been identified by the studies undertaken by the ESRI.  Once its provisions have been implemented and people are benefiting therefrom, I believe they will have a major impact in that they involve substantial increases for those at present in receipt of the lowest payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I must concede that there have been some improvements effected.  I want to take this opportunity to urge the Minister to take on board the many points raised by myself and my colleagues in Opposition in the course of Second and Committee Stage debates.  It is somewhat unfortunate, because of the restrictive rules of this House, that many of the amendments we had hoped to have debated here were technically not in order, not because they constituted a charge on revenue but because they might constitute a potential charge on revenue.  That very severely limits the Opposition from the point of view of tabling amendments accepted as being in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might make a few points to the Minister. Reform of the social welfare system must be on an ongoing basis since it is a system that was devised or built up in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner over many years.  It is incumbent on all of us, the Minister of the day and whoever may be in Opposition, to make continuous constructive efforts towards reasonable reform.  I might reiterate that my approach to reform centres on those aspects of social welfare which act as disincentives to <Col N="964" /> employment.  I am convinced that, with a thoroughly reforming approach, there are jobs to be had.  That must be the priority of all of us in this day and age when there is an unemployment rate of 20 per cent upwards.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to seriously consider the points made in regard to a single means test and pay roll taxes.  I believe they constitute a factor from the point of view of job creation.  The proposals made from the point of view of modulation of the rate for employers' contributions and either exemption or a lower rate in respect of low-paid workers, would act as an incentive to employment. An approach involving either exemption or a lower rate in respect of those on long-term unemployment assistance for a defined period, similarly, would act as an encouragement.</P>
    <P>The other aspect I had not time to argue on the Bill from the point of view of employment was the family income supplement in respect of which I hope there will be a thorough reform because, in many ways, it constitutes support for the low-paid worker with a family.  It was introduced by the last Government but, as has been pointed out, its uptake was never as high as had been anticipated, obviously the system is in need of major reform.  Again, since it constitutes an instrument which aids job creation, all of us have a duty to ensure that that system is improved considerably so that it can have the beneficial effect on job creation we would all desire.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the system in relation to jobs concerns the supplementary welfare and the specific exclusion of low-paid workers by statute from rent supplements.  We must endeavour to build a bridge between those on the dole and those employed.  At present supplementary welfare acts as a major disincentive to those offered relatively low-paid employment which in many cases they cannot take up because they would lose their rent supplement.  We need to devise a graduated system of entitlement so that the poverty trap is eliminated, and the distortions obtaining removed, enabling somebody to move <Col N="965" /> from unemployment into employment without losing out.  That is what is happening at present and will continue unless this type of reform is undertaken.</P>
    <P>I might refer to another amendment I had tabled which we did not reach concerning people's right to privacy.  I had tabled an amendment to provide an obligation that people be afforded a minimum degree of privacy in so far as circumstances permit when discussing their personal business in public offices. I have heard some appalling stories of people who have been subjected to considerable humiliation from that point of view.  God knows, it is bad enough to be poor but, to have humiliation heaped on one's head as a consequence, adds insult to injury.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister he will have the full support of all Members of this House in any real effort he makes to ensure that such humiliation is eliminated. That could be done in two ways: first, from the point of view of providing the necessary facilities, and here I accept that there is a cost involved but, in so far as resources permit, every effort must be made to improve those facilities to the extent that at least people are afforded a minimum degree of privacy.  The second way is to change attitudes, and this costs nothing.  While I join with those who have lavished praise on the staff in the Department and in the social welfare offices &mdash; and those expressions of praise are well justified because there have been very major improvements in recent years &mdash; I suggest that the Minister has a duty to ensure that staff dealing with the general public are obliged to ensure that applicants are treated with full respect and dignity at all times.</P>

      <P>In my concluding remarks on the debate, let me say that I welcome the approach the Minister adopts to the question of social welfare. The Minister was prepared to take on board reasonable amendments to the Bill.  That is a very welcome approach to the many problems in this area.  It is an acknowledgement that many Deputies in the House through their day to day work <Col N="966" /> with their constituents come across anomalies in the system, which to a large extent are technical but nevertheless have serious effects on the lives of individuals who depend on social welfare.</P>
      <P>Having said this, it must be acknowledged that our social welfare system does not adequately protect considerable numbers of people from the worst effects of poverty.  I said before that I do not regard social welfare as the solution to poverty, it is in fact a system which barely keeps people from hunger and from being without clothes.  Nevertheless it is an important fall back and we should try to ensure that it protects people in so far as that is possible.  My view is that at the end of the day we will have to consider seriously the question of a basic income and of harmonising our social welfare and tax system in a way that ensures that nobody in the State falls below a basic level of income.  That is not to say that we should wait until this is achieved as there are various things that can be done in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that a number of points were not touched on, for instance, the questions of the people who are affected by the mixed insurance anomalies.  I know the Minister dealt with a large number of anomalies last year but there are still about 1,000 elderly people who are caught by the averaging rule that applies to their social welfare contributions. These people went in and out of the social insurance scheme for a variety of reasons, either because, in the case of women, they were working at home and thus not making contributions prior to 1974 or as young people, increasingly being employed on a part-time basis and therefore not having the same record of contributions. This will affect them in the future.  It is an anomaly which the Minister should address.  If he is introducing the Social Welfare Bill next year perhaps he will deal with this.  The other way in which the averaging rule affects people quite badly is that those on unemployment benefit who would not have had a fixed number of contributions averaging over the previous seven years get reduced benefit.  In many cases this reduced benefit <Col N="967" /> is below the rate of unemployment assistance which they would get if they had applied for it.  However, so far as I understand, the law precludes them from going on to unemployment assistance, although I know there is a section in the Bill this year which allows some discretion in that regard.  This anomaly needs to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Another serious anomaly which needs to be tackled urgently is the means test for the young unemployed person living at home.  Because one or other of the parents is working, the young person is means tested and is found to be not entitled to unemployment assistance.  It is not a fair system, even though in some cases, although not in all, their parents' income might be quite respectable and they would have a comfortable standard of living.  However, I feel that young people require some money in their pockets and I am aware of a number who have emigrated simply because they could not qualify for unemployment assistance or get a job.</P>

I know the debate was scheduled to go on until 7 p.m. but I know Deputies are probably hoping that it will conclude by 5 p.m.  I have no intention of holding the House beyond that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the amendments brought forward by the Minister this afternoon.  It is good that we can have some effect on the legislation other than just merely talking our way through the various procedures.  I would have liked to think that we could have put <Col N="968" /> down more amendments but I appreciate that many of the changes suggested would have revenue implications and therefore it is not as simple as it might have appeared initially.  The important thing with regard to social welfare matters is that we try to simplify the system, and as I said on Second Stage, the Minister has gone a long way towards that.  I urge him to go further.  This Bill seeks to go somewhat further by rationalising the number of child dependant allowances from 36 to 12.  As I have said before, there is room to go much further.  I firmly maintain there is no justification for more than two rates, one for younger children and one for older children whether it be from the age of ten or 12 years upwards. There should be a differential between the obvious difference in the cost of rearing a child in the two age groups.</P>
      <P>We need to rationalise the number of unemployment allowances of one kind or another.  At present, somebody may be entitled to more money on long-term assistance than on unemployment benefit so the whole question of social insurance and the remuneration one gets having paid social insurance has been further eroded.  I am not necessarily sorry this has happened because, as I said this morning, I firmly believe that social insurance is just another form of tax.  It is the worst form of tax in that it is a tax on employment.  We had a long discussion on this point before lunch but we did not get a chance of putting any of the proposals to a vote.  Whether you argue that social insurance is necessary or not, the present social insurance scheme needs to be radically reformed so that it is more of an incentive to employment or at least removes the disincentive to employment.  Deputy De Rossa made the point that capital and labour should be put on a par.  I would not agree with that because at a time of high unemployment which leads to so much poverty and dependence on the State it is important that we go overboard in trying to encourage employment.  I would like to think that in future proposals we would do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The notification of commencement of earnings procedure which is referred to <Col N="969" /> in this Bill needs to be extended to all sectors.  I have no doubt that that procedure will have huge benefits.  The Minister, in giving figures last week referred to 500 names submitted by employers who had taken on people.  This will be the most effective way of combating fraud.  We should not introduce this procedure, without other procedures being in place, such as an identity card.  I am talking about an identity card not simply for welfare recipients but a national identity card from which there would be huge advantages in terms of not having to use passports going to other European countries, and in terms of tax fraud, welfare fraud, under-age drinking, crime and so on.  Instead of having the fear that big brother is always looking over our shoulder, we should be more mature about these things and recognise that we are amongst the few European countries that do not have this form of identity.</P>
    <P>There would be enormously beneficial effects from having such an identity card. If we could extend the notification or earnings procedure and have ways of verifying who exactly people are, when inspectors call on places of employment, then the kind of procedure I would like to see in place for the unemployed could very easily be put in place.  I do not like the present signing on procedure which is very degrading.  It does not act as a deterrent to people who are working and claiming benefit.  Obviously some people are working and claiming benefits, and it is easy to go and sign on once a week. However, for the vast majority of people who are unemployed, signing on is very degrading, particularly since the facilities, as Deputy O'Keeffe said, are so bad at so many of our exchanges.  People have to queue in the street and many cover their faces with newspapers.  When one approaches an employment exchange, everyone knows that one is unemployed. We do not give the unemployed the kind of dignity they deserve.  If we had an extension of the new notification of commencement of earnings procedure and made employers liable, and followed up this procedure, we could be much more flexible when it comes to signing on.  It <Col N="970" /> would also release a lot of social welfare officers or other employees of the Department of Social Welfare who could be deployed in implementing the welfare system in more useful ways, either giving information or being involved at local level in ensuring that people have access to one stop shops and so on within easy reach of where they reside.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to abolish the distinction between the urban and rural rates.  This was long overdue.  The 1934 distinction came about presumably because rural people tended to have their own fuel, to live on farms and to have their own vegetables and so on.  This distinction was very unrealistic when one saw that in estates in Tallaght, in Shankill and so on, one group of people were considered rural because they lived in houses provided by the council and others were considered urban because they lived in corporation houses.  That was a farcical situation and I am delighted it has been remedied.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the inclusion of deserted husbands and widowers in the social welfare schemes although keeping a distinction between the treatment of men and women in the social welfare code is wrong.  Deputy Mattie Brennan referred to bachelors being entitled to claim the prescribed relative allowance and having a separate allowance under the social welfare code.  The entitlements and needs of people are similar, and therefore the social welfare code should deal with them on the same basis, regardless of sex.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa made a point about unmarried fathers, and I agree with him, although in this country one does not very often meet what are described as unmarried fathers.</P>
    <P>The appeals procedure in relation to social welfare decisions was referred to as was the fact that social welfare recipients tend to be considered guilty before they have been tried.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Bell in this area.  I have mixed views on whether we should discontinue the payment from the time a person is suspected of being involved in a fraud, but people <Col N="971" /> should be entitled to access to information, which is more important.  I wonder about the implications of the data protection Bill for the Department of Social Welfare and whether claimants would be entitled to access to the information kept on file in relation to their cases.  To have any kind of fair welfare system one must have a fair, objective and independent appeal system.  We still do not have that.  The Commission on Social Welfare recommended the introduction of an independent appeals procedure for social welfare cases, and I agree with them.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe and others referred at length to the facilities and I agree with them.  It is important to respect people's privacy.  We should treat people in as humane and as caring a way as possible. In lots of instances that would require the expenditure of money on improving facilities at employment exchanges and social welfare offices generally.  I urge the Government to do that.  In so far as Dublin city is concerned, some of the better advertised facilities tend to be available in very run down places.  What these facilities are like inside would leave a lot to be desired if they are anything like they are on the outside.  We need to put more effort into that whole area.</P>
    <P>I sought to move an amendment in relation to how we deliver payments to persons.  In relation to privacy, I know it is not possible for everybody to have a bank or post office account and that generally speaking social welfare recipients tend not to have accounts of this kind. The Craig Gardner Survey on Consultancy in relation to fraud in the welfare system recommended that we move towards the electronic transfer of funds. I would urge the Minister to move in that direction.  It would help to protect the privacy of claimants, it would encourage people who otherwise do not use facilities like post office accounts to perhaps think in terms of them and it might help them to manage their affairs a bit better, it would have savings implications and from the point of view of fraud in the social welfare code there would be a deterrent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> From time to time major fraud has occurred in transferring money through the post and when money is being transferred <i>en masse</i> to employment exchanges and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pro rata</i> pensions are mentioned in this Bill.  The Minister sought in the miscellaneous sections at the end of the Bill to clarify the regulations that were made last year in relation to this matter.  While the Minister clarified the situation somewhat, his clarification did not meet the difficulties that some people have, particularly in what are called a mixed insurance categories.  I would like to think that this <i>pro rata</i> pension would be what it says &mdash; a <i>pro rata</i> pension, and that if people made contributions they would get some kind of benefit at old age on the basis of the contributions made.</P>
    <P>It is a pity we have only two opportunities in the year to discuss welfare matters.  I take the Minister's point about the need for us to consolidate the Social Welfare Acts again.  I sat on the last committee in 1981 that consolidated the Acts up to then.  It would be no harm to do that again within the next 12 months.  As the Minister said, prior to doing that we would need to further simplify the system to ensure that the anomalies that exist are corrected and to ensure that the kind of distortions that exist as between social insurance contributions and the different rates for people who are on similar earnings do not continue.  That means rationalisation of payments, simplification of the system and opening the system up to those categories of persons such as the prescribed relative, young people and so on who are currently excluded and very unfairly excluded in many cases.</P>

      <P>I will be brief.  We have had a fairly productive three or four days on this Bill.  It is a pity that every Minister does not operate under the same principle as the Minister for Social Welfare, that if members of the Opposition make reasonable points and bring forward <Col N="973" /> reasonable proposals at least such proposals are given sympathetic consideration and are adopted where possible.  I welcome this breath of fresh air in terms of social welfare, which is so complicated.  It requires the all-round experience and expertise of the Members of the House who have to deal with this subject on a daily basis.  We can very quickly and without going into any textbooks highlight the problems that people face.  After all, it is the recipients of social welfare we are talking about.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the fact that we have a minority Government lends itself to this attitude. It may be a recipe for the future &mdash; if we have a minority government all the time the Opposition will be listened to.  I do not say that with any disrespect to the Minister, because I accept that he has been genuine in trying to meet the points we have made.  I do not want it to be recorded that everything is honky-dory as far as social welfare is concerned.  We have a long way to go to reach the broad principles and recommendations in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare. It will take some time obviously to iron out the many problems that remain.</P>
      <P>We will not be voting against the Bill on this occasion but we will certainly push forward, at every available opportunity, proposals to improve the lot of the biggest sector of the community faced with poverty because they do not have enough money to live on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed that we were not able to reach a number of sections because I think we could have succeeded in getting some further changes made in the Bill.  For example, a simple amendment to <i>pro-rata</i> pensions in section 25 would have ironed out the further complications that have arisen as a result of the changes made in the 1988 Act.  <i>Prorata</i> pensions should be paid <i>pro-rata</i>, in other words whatever shortfall there may be in their pension entitlement should be paid <i>pro-rata</i> to the average amount of pension contributions they have paid.  For example, in local authorities, there are outdoor staff who were promoted to supervisory positions and as a result they <Col N="974" /> lost their social welfare entitlement. Those men have worked 40 years in a local authority and at some stage, were promoted to staff, were treated as staff and were not paying the full A1 contributions. They are getting local authority pensions and are actually drawing less than those in receipt of the old age pension.  That seems crazy.  It was the CIE pensioners who highlighted that problem.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to have another look at that.  I do not think it would cost very much.  The figures for this category were 1,000 people and if you take into consideration the numbers brought in under the amendments to the 1988 Act, the number of people nationally under that heading is very small. Sometimes we forget about minority groups simply because they are minority groups.  I do not think the cost would be enormous.  Those men are elderly and one must accept the fact that as they die, the number of people under these headings will diminish.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at it.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister has clarified publicly the fact that information should be made available to those people who are confronted with appeals.  I would ask the Minister to have that information passed on to the various local employment offices.  Many of their offices in small towns are busy but they are not overstaffed and may have difficulty providing the necessary information.  I am talking particularly about the special investigation unit which gathers information.</P>
    <P>Recently I had the experience of representing a very important case of social welfare concerning a number of people, and I was unable to get &mdash; and I am a Member of the Oireachtas &mdash; the information I required.  I had to sit at the appeal hearing and have a four or five page document read out and try to defend the people concerned without having the written documentation in front of me.  I would be glad if the Minister would look at this.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to look at another area which would eliminate a <Col N="975" /> great deal of unnecessary work in the Department of Social Welfare, that is the lump sum payment on disablement benefit.  If the degree of disablement is 19 per cent, a lump sum is accepted by the claimant whereas, if the degree of disablement is in excess of 19 per cent payment is made on a weekly basis.  I believe it should be optional.  I am aware the system is geared to protect the woman and children because if a person draws a large lump sum he may spend it foolishly. At least when it is paid weekly, it is more likely to benefit the family.  I take that point but 19 per cent is too low.  Perhaps that can be increased by regulation because it means people are being paid out small weekly pensions under disablement benefit for perhaps 20, 30 or 40 years.  Obviously it is increasing the work load of the Department and in my view is unnecessary.  While we accept that not everything we would like to have in the Bill is there, nevertheless, we will not be voting against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Deputies for their comments.  This is an historic Bill in several respects.  First, we are doing away with the urban-rural divide which has existed since 1934.  This is an historic development which will be widely welcomed throughout the country and has received a warm welcome in this House.  I thank Deputies for the welcome they have given to that measure.  It is also historic in that we have introduced a widower's and deserted husbands' scheme.  For the first time we will have, as an assistance scheme, a scheme for widowers and deserted husbands on a par with widows and deserted wives.  Indeed, we have introduced three new schemes &mdash; the widowers' scheme, the deserted husbands' scheme and the pre-retirement allowance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also have changed the prescribed relative's allowance scheme, a scheme which has been operating since 1968.  I know Deputies see that as a change in the direction of providing greater support for elderly people who are incapacitated <Col N="976" /> and who rely on us to look after their interests.  This, too, is a major change and a major step forward.</P>
    <P>Something that perhaps was not mentioned as much as it might have been but is of great importance &mdash; and of particular importance to me &mdash; is the increase in flexibility for unemployment payments which is provided for in the Bill.  This will enable me to deal with problems which are brought to my attention by Deputies &mdash; some of the Deputies here have brought particular problems to my attention &mdash; in relation to courses which might be available for people on unemployment assistance.  We have had that flexibility on the unemployment benefit side under the insurance scheme but not for unemployment assistance.  We are now providing for this increased flexibility in the Bill.  It gives an opportunity to make regulations which deal with the problems we are faced with in practice in current circumstances. Deputy Harney referred to this when talking about signing on at particular intervals, irrespective of what happens. Certainly, if there are schemes or involvements, such as educational schemes, which the unemployed can avail of and which will help them to progress &mdash; and particularly if they will help them get back to work &mdash; then, under this arrangement, we will have a flexibility for dealing with that which we did not have previously.  That is another improvement in this Bill.  We have made major improvements in payments &mdash; and those I have emphasised &mdash; and they have been widely welcomed.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents a second major step in implementing the various recommendations of the Report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  On Committee Stage, Deputy Harney raised the question of the self-employed and wondered how it was progressing.  The involvement of the self-employed in the PRSI system, which we introduced last year, is going very well.  The income estimated for last year was £15 million but the outturn was £22 million.  The money received was greater than the best estimates which were available beforehand. It was anticipated in the original figures <Col N="977" /> that we would receive £15 million in 1988, £35 million this year and £50 million next year.  This was the phasing-in procedure and at the end of that period we reviewed the situation.  At this stage we know that we have received £22 million in 1988 and the estimate for 1989 is £39 million.  In my humble opinion &mdash; I say this because these estimates are prepared by people in the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Finance who have a lot of experience and they look at all the factors involved &mdash; I think that in practice it will be more than the £39 million estimated for 1989 but we will have to wait and see what happens.  All these issues are debated and discussed beforehand and a figure is settled on.  The figure settled on now is £39 million as against an earlier anticipated figure of £35 million. We will have to wait and see what it will be next year but it is clear that in any event it will be higher than was estimated at the outset.  That scheme is going very well and there has been wide acceptance of it generally.  The scheme is not yet fully implemented, and we will continue with its implementation.  The smaller contributors are being brought in gradually.</P>
    <P>There is another issue which I should like to refer to briefly.  The question of privacy was mentioned by a number of Deputies, particularly Deputy O'Keeffe. Our approach when we are carrying out any improvements or upgrading in an exchange is to provide greater facilities for privacy.  Where we are building new exchanges &mdash; there are some very fine examples of these in Galway and in the Nutgrove Shopping Centre in Dublin &mdash; there is provision specifically for initial interviews &mdash; discussions and a separate private interview room.  If one wants to have a short chat there is a separate cubicle designed for that purpose and there will also be separate rooms.</P>
    <P>Work on the new Cork labour exchange and social services centre has just begun and I should like to assure the Deputy that this exchange will have all the up-to-date facilities for privacy which we are now providing.  The new Cork exchange will be a major exchange, will cater for both men and women, will be <Col N="978" /> based on the one-stop-shop concept and will have as many facilities and services in the one place as we can provide.  All these facilities will be provided in the one exchange and provision is made for separate interview rooms and other rooms for privacy.  That is the direction we are going in at present and I can assure the Deputy that this is what is happening in the Cork exchange and other exchanges.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House much longer but I should like to refer to Deputy Harney's point about modernising the Department.  If the Deputy met some of the people in the Department they might tell her that it is being modernised at such a pace that it can be difficult to keep up with.  That is what is happening at present in the Department: we are changing many things and we have to look at the practicality of how we get these off the ground and up and running.  In that respect I should like to say that the staff have been tremendous in meeting the requirements of these changes.</P>
    <P>The Deputy brought to my mind a card I have in my pocket which is called a Smart Card.  This card contains a white micro-processor with a secured memory in the top corner in which one can store various information, security information and so on.  These cards can be operated in the same way as pass machine cards and there are means for verifying signatures, etc.  This is the experimental side of what we are doing at present. There is no doubt that modern technology is bringing us very rapidly in this direction.  The only problem is that we have to have everything else in place to fit in with these developments and that is what we are trying to do in all our arrangements.  I happened to have that card in my pocket by accident but I should like to assure the Deputy that we are anxious to use technology.  She urged us to move in this direction as quickly as possible.  I should like to assure her that we are doing that.</P>
    <P>Numerous other questions were raised. Deputy Bell in particular referred to public sector pensions.  As I mentioned, we will be looking at this issue separately. <Col N="979" /> The Deputy is quite right in saying that there should be basic underlying social security for everybody which one would be able to bring with them when they change their jobs.  How that will be done is a matter for negotiation and discussion. The question of introducing this arrangement for the public service will be discussed with the public service unions. The pensions board will have a report on this for us later this year.  This is all being done fairly rapidly and we will be able to look forward to future developments in this area.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Deputies for <Col N="980" /> their support for this Bill, for the way in which they became involved in the discussions and accepted the amendments. I am very happy that this Bill is now being passed.</P>

      <P>The information available to my Department indicates that there are something under 2,000 patients on waiting lists for total hip replacements.  A figure for the average waiting period for such operations nationally is not readily available to my Department.</P>
      <P>I should point out that waiting lists are of themselves very unreliable as a gauge of how well a particular service is operating. Waiting lists for in-patients include: (a) patients presenting for first time treatment and those receiving continuing care; and (b) patients who may be on one, or more than one, consultant's list for the same condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Waiting lists are also distorted by different consultants' policies on whether patients who are unlikely to be operated on, or patients who do not currently but will in the near future, require admission are added to the lists or not.  Waiting lists <Col N="863" /> have been a feature of health services in this and other countries over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 72 together.  I would like to emphasise first of all that the casual units referred to are not hospital wards at all but merely facilities which provide basic overnight accommodation for homeless people.</P>
      <P>Further inquiries have been made with the Mid-Western Health Board about this matter and the position is that the board's discussions with local groups in Thurles have indicated that there is very little demand for a casual unit in the area. Hence the board have no immediate plans to replace the facility.  I have also, as promised, checked the position with the other health boards and where these units are provided they appear to be operating quite well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four health boards have no casual units <Col N="864" /> of any kind.  In the other four health boards there are eight units for casuals now in operation, three of which are locked at night.  These are regularly supervised by hospital staff.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the continued existence of locked casual units.  The relevant health boards are, therefore, being requested to review immediately this aspect of the operation of casual units for the homeless.</P>
    <P>The Housing Act, 1988, puts the onus on local authorities to provide accommodation for the homeless and I am also requesting that the health boards concerned enter into discussions with the relevant local authorities with a view to a gradual phasing out of these casual units attached to hospitals and their replacement by facilities funded by local authorities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The determination of eligibility in individual cases is a matter for the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  In order to assist in determining eligibility and to ensure uniformity of decisions in all areas, income guidelines have been adopted.  While these guidelines are based on gross income they are not binding on the chief executive officers and are simply intended as a broad general guide.  Where income exceeds the guidelines, but due to medical or other circumstances the individual is unable to arrange general practitioner services for himself or his <Col N="865" /> dependants without undue hardship, a medical card is awarded.</P>
    <P>The whole question of co-ordinating arrangements regarding means testing for various State schemes is under examination by an interdepartmental committee and this issue of gross versus net income will, of course, be considered in the context of that committee's work.</P>

      <Col N="871" /> The health boards have also informed me that a number of returned contracts have given rise to the need for some further clarification, mainly in relation to matters of hours of attendance and centres of practice.  In this regard, chief executive officers have written to the doctors concerned indicating their board's acceptance of the contract on the strict understanding that matters requiring clarification will be resolved to the satisfaction of the board and in accordance with the terms and conditions as specified in the new agreement.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 75 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of practical measures have been taken by the Department of Health and by the Eastern Health Board, with the approval of the Department of Health, to assist haemophiliacs infected with the AIDS virus.  These measures are designed to assist haemophiliacs who have contracted the virus, by developing the services provided by the Irish Haemophilia Society, and include an increased grant of £30,000 from the Eastern Health Board to enable the society to recruit a co-ordinator and a counsellor. At a meeting which I had with representatives of the society on 10 February <Col N="876" /> 1989, I offered a further grant of £50,000 from the Department's allocation to assist it in its development work.  Haemophiliacs, of course, also avail themselves of the health services available for the treatment and support of AIDS suffers generally.</P>
    <P>My attention has been drawn to the requests made to the Canadian Government by the Canadian Haemophilia Society and I am aware that two of the 12 EC member states operate payment schemes specifically for haemophiliacs infected with HIV.</P>
    <P>The requests of the Canadian Haemophilia Society are broadly similar to those made to the Irish Government by the Irish Haemophilia Society and relate mainly to the provisions of financial assistance by the Government to those haemophiliacs affected and to their families. In Ireland, the society have asked the Government to establish a trust fund for infected haemophiliacs and their families.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in replies to recent parliamentary questions and during the recent Seanad debate on this question, I have the utmost sympathy for the persons involved but this extends to all persons who suffer from AIDS or HIV.  It is necessary for me, as Minister for Health, to ensure that discrimination in favour of, or against, particular groups does not enter into our AIDS strategy and if one particular group were singled out for special treatment, it could be seen as discriminatory toward other categories of AIDS sufferers.  I am not convinced, therefore, that it is appropriate for me to establish a trust fund for haemophiliacs but to address the problems which all AIDS sufferers have in the most equitable and pragmatic way possible.</P>
    <P>Towards achieving this end, I have established a group under the chairmanship of Deputy Terry Leyden, Minister of State, to inquire urgently into the accessability of services to AIDS sufferers generally.  This group consists of representatives of the Irish Haemophilia Society, the Department of Health, the health boards, the Virus Reference Laboratory, UCD, and the Drugs Treatment <Col N="877" /> and Advisory Centre, Dublin.  The group have commenced their work and will be meeting with relevant organisations and persons to enable them to evaluate any difficulties which might exist in access to services generally for AIDS suffers and to make recommendation to me.</P>
    <P>In view of the urgency involved, I have asked the group to report before the Dáil resumes after the Easter recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987, which came into force in December 1988 places a statutory obligation on doctors to inform patients using drugs which are still in their trial phase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular statutory requirement forms an essential prerequisite to the concept of informed consent on the part of those participating in clinical trials which is a basic and central element of the procedures set out in the Act for protecting the participant.  In summary, the provisions of the Act in this respect require <Col N="878" /> that the participant must be given sufficient information in a comprehensible form in order to enable him to make an informed judgment on whether to participate or not and his consent must be given in writing.</P>
    <P>Under the statutory scheme now in place, a trial may not proceed without the prior approval of the Minister and the ethics committee approval of the trial. One of the general conditions which will be attaching to all ministerial permissions is that the permission holder must ensure that each doctor, including general practitioners, involved in a clinical trial receives sufficient information about the drugs in question to ensure that they can advise their patients on them in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The dispute at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin arose because of the refusal by certain members of the staff to prepare and deliver trollies of tea/coffee and light refreshments to occasional management/research meetings.</P>
      <P>Management decided that the household staff in the kitchem of the hospital, who are already involved as part of their normal work in preparing other trollies with food, should carry out these duties.</P>
      <P>The household staff, members of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, after initially accepting the hospital management's decision subsequently refused to carry out the duties. Following a number of meetings and the conciliation conference the matter was not resolved and strike action commenced 1 March 1989.  The Labour Court invited the parties to the dispute to attend a further conciliation conference on Saturday, 4 March 1989 and as no progress was made at these talks the Labour Court held a full court hearing on Sunday, 5 March 1989.</P>
      <P>The Labour Court recommended <i>inter alia</i> that the union should accept that the preparation and delivery of trollies to management meetings should be accepted as part of the duties of the kitchen household staff.  The court further recommended that a working party composed of representatives of the management, Department of Health, ICTU and the trade union in the hospital should be established with an independent chairman to draw up proposals for the improvement of industrial relations generally in the hospital.  The Labour Court recommendation was accepted by management and was recommended by the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union to their members concerned for acceptance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> Unfortunately, they rejected the recommendation and have continued their strike action.</P>

However, elective admissions in most specialties are now being accepted and admissions to the specialty programmes have not been interrupted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a worrying problem and needs to be dealt with by many sectors of the <Col N="881" /> community.  In recognition of the need to address the many public policy issues surrounding alcohol, the Government have authorised the preparation of a national policy on alcohol.  The lead role in this exercise will be taken by the Department of Health and the policy will be prepared under the aegis of the Advisory Council on Health Promotion.  I expect that it will cover issues such as marketing of alcohol and the general question of access, particularly by young people.  When prepared, this policy document should provide an agreed national viewpoint in relation to alcohol and a general framework within which future policy changes in relation to alcohol can be considered.</P>
    <P>My Department are co-operating with the Department of Education on health issues that relate to schools, and schools have the services of guidance counsellors who in the course of their work frequently deal with problems associated with alcohol abuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 27 February last I wrote to the chief executive officers of health boards conveying my approval to the acceptance of proposals received from medical practitioners for the provision of services under section 58 of the Health Act, 1970 in accordance with the new terms and conditions agreed with representatives of the profession and informing them that such new terms and conditions will be effective as and from 1 March 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> Chief executive officers have written to medical practitioners who returned signed contracts informing them of the board's acceptance.  In some cases these acceptances are subject to the satisfactory clarification of specific issues, before 16 March next.  The number of doctors returning signed contracts is approximately 1,430 out of 1,575 issued by the boards.</P>
    <P>Doctors who did not return contracts retain their existing terms and conditions. For the present, therefore, a second contract will apply to a minority of participating doctors.  I will be reviewing their position after 16 March next.  The Deputy will be aware that the implications of the possible outcome of my review of that position are currently before the High Court.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="884" /> The implementation of policy in relation to health is a matter for the health boards.  They have drawn up plans in accordance with the framework set out in the report in question.  To date they have concentrated on developments in the services for adults.</P>
    <P>The health boards are, however, aware of the need to develop services for children. The Eastern Health Board, in particular, is at present actively pursuing a number of alternatives for autistic children and especially for adolescent and adult autistics who have outgrown the children's facilities.  The parents are participating in these discussions.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has reviewed the policy of his Department regarding the maintenance of canal towpaths which carry a considerable amount of vehicular traffic, many of which are in a dangerous condition and which are causing serious problems for the people living along the banks or these canals; and the plans and proposals he has for carrying out urgent and necessary work on these canal banks.</P>

      <P>The question of the maintenance of those sections of the canal towpaths which, although not designated as public roadways, carry a considerable amount of vehicular traffic, has been discussed by the Commissioners of Public Works with some of the local authorities concerned. I am hopeful that satisfactory arrangements for the future maintenance of such roadways will be made shortly, taking into account the clear guidelines contained in the consultant's report on the Grand and Royal Canals and Barrow Navigation published last year.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that there is no refund of tax due to the taxpayer.  Reviews of the taxpayer's liabilities for the years 1986/87 and 1987/88 carried out on 28 August, 1988 revealed underpayments, arising from the fact that the taxpayer had been granted allowances in excess of his entitlement for those years.  Balancing statements giving full details of the reviews were issued at that time, and the position has been explained to the taxpayer on several occasions since then.</P>

      <P>The rules for the payment of incremental salary to secondary teachers provide that incremental salary may only be paid to (a) registered secondary school teachers or (b) unregistered teachers who hold acceptable teaching qualifications and who are undergoing the year of teaching experience required to become registered, such payment to be for a maximum period of one year.</P>
      <P>The registration requirements prescribed in the regulations made by the registration council provide, <i>inter alia</i>, that an applicant for registration must pass a test of competency in oral Irish.</P>
      <P>The teacher in question was notified of this requirement when she applied for registration on 2 October 1987, having been appointed to a teaching post in St. Paul's secondary school, Oughterard, with effect from 1 August 1987.  My Department arranged an oral Irish test for her on 6 November 1987, which she did not attend.  Further tests were arranged for her on 11 February 1988 and 23 May 1988 both of which she failed. She was not, therefore, eligible for registration when she completed her year of teaching experience on 31 July 1988 and, as an unregistered teacher who had been paid incremental salary for a full year, she was no longer entitled to be paid such salary and she was notified accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the current school year, further oral Irish tests were arranged for her on 3 November 1988 and 9 February 1989 both of which she failed.  Her final opportunity to obtain <Col N="947" /> the oral Irish requirement in the 1988-89 school year will be in May 1989.</P>
    <P>If she passes the oral Irish test she can be registered with effect from the first day of the school year in which the registration requirements were finally met and she can be paid retrospectively in respect of any approved teaching service given subsequent to her registration date. Therefore, if she passes the oral Irish test in May 1989, incremental salary may be paid in respect of her approved teaching service since 1 August 1988.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to his previous question of 28 February 1989 regarding the purchase of special equipment for blind children in local schools.</P>
      <P>However, all aspects of primary education, including the provision for the disabled, are currently being considered by the Primary Education Review Body. Any policy development in relation to the provision for the visually impaired will arise following consideration of the review body's report when it becomes available.</P>

      <P>The allocations of teaching staff in the second level VEC sector are made by my Department on a committee wide basis and not in respect of individual schools.</P>
      <P>Since 14 July 1988 when my Department issued the initial allocation of teaching staff to County Kildare VEC in respect of the current school session (1988/89) the committee's teacher allocation has been revised on a number of occasions and the allocation has been increased by a total of 11.0 wholetime teacher equivalents.</P>
      <P>The deployment of its teaching resources and the organisation of its educational programme are matters to be determined by the committee itself within the parameters of the authorised allocation.</P>
