      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to establish one thing from you, Sir.  Is it the case, and is it the ruling of the Chair, that nothing the Government say outside the House about their legislative intentions may be questioned here?  Is it, therefore, the case that the Government can gaily promise anything they like outside the <Col N="442" /> House without being subject to scrutiny in the House in relation to those promises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has not answered my question.  I put a direct question to the Chair about the ruling of the Chair.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what is in this document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Chair saying that the Government can promise anything they like outside the House and that he will not allow us to take them to task and account for those promises in the House?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to get involved in controversy of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a point of order on behalf of the Government. The position in regard to most of these matters which Deputies, from Fine Gael in particular, are endeavouring to raise on the Order of Business is that they are perfectly suitable and will be fully answered as normal questions.  I suggest to you, Sir, that that is the way Deputies should proceed about any of these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This is promised legislation and we are entitled to know about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want a reply to my normal question.  When one seeks a reply to such a question at Question Time your response is that Question Time is not the time to discuss proposed legislation.  That is a catch 22 and you are not going to have it both ways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We have touched on a most serious issue.  I suggest that it is a matter for you, as Cheann Comhairle, to interpret the relevant Standing Order and it is not a matter for the Taoiseach to give his interpretation and by so doing to limit the rights of Members of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to intimidate the Chair but to get a fair resolution to this problem.  Do you accept that it is your duty, your right and your responsibility as Cheann Comhairle to interpret Standing Orders and what is promised legislation?  Will you accept that it is not correct that the Taoiseach should give his interpretation and that we should all be forced to accept it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Fine Gael Party have allowed me to speak I should like to state that the Chair has answered the question I was about to put.  Deputy Haughey, the Taoiseach, who has been <Col N="444" /> here for many years is entitled to his opinion as to what is a precedent.  If there is a dispute about this issue there is an orderly way to resolve it.  I welcome the fact that the Ceann Comhairle will do that, otherwise we will have a repetition of this kind of mishmash of questions.  I should like the permission of the Chair to raise on the Adjournment the position of a prisoner in the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum who has sought release on medical grounds but who has so far been denied that release.</P>

I beg the indulgence of the Chair in regard to this matter because I placed this question before the Taoiseach through the <Col N="445" /> medium of a parliamentary question but he deflected it, or passed it on to the Minister for Health.  In my view the Minister for Health has no relevance in answering that question because I am referring to undertakings or promises that have been reputedly entered into by the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Title>European Council in Madrid: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, to make a statement, for the information of the House, on the meeting of the European Council in Madrid on 26-27 June where I was accompanied by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds and Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="449" /> Máire Geoghegan-Quinn.  The Presidency Conclusions on the Madrid meeting have, in accordance with established practice, been laid before the House.</P>
      <P>Before the meeting I had useful preparatory discussions, in Dublin, with the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr. Felipe Gonzalez. I am glad to avail of this opportunity to put on record our deep gratitude to the Prime Minister personally for the skilful and untiring efforts he made to ensure a successful summit, his generous hospitality and helpfulness, and to record our appreciation of the commitment, organisation and skills of the Spanish Presidency.</P>
      <P>The European Council in Madrid was an exceptionally important meeting, and may even in historical perspective be regarded as an epoch-making one.  It was the moment the Community began to embark in earnest on the process leading beyond the single market towards economic and monetary union.</P>
      <P>The main subject discussed at Madrid was the Delors Committee Report on Economic and Monetary Union.  This committee had been established at the meeting of the Hanover European Council in June 1988 and included all the Central Bank Governors of the member states as well as a number of distinguished experts.  Their report provides a clear analysis of the stages needed for the establishment of economic and monetary union.</P>
      <P>As was to be expected, our discussions on the report were contentious, to an extent economic and technical in nature, but the question of national sovereignty was very much at the core of the debate. We eventually reached agreement to begin stage one of the process contained in the Delors Report on 1 July 1990 &mdash; the date when the directive on the full liberalisation of capital movements comes into force for eight of the member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This stage is limited in scope and will essentially involve a strengthening of existing procedures within the existing EC treaties framework for the co-ordination of the economic and fiscal policies <Col N="450" /> of the member states.  One of the provisions on the monetary front stipulates that all Community currencies should participate in the EMS exchange rate mechanism.  Given our important trade and economic links with the UK, sterling's participation in this mechanism is of particular importance to this country. On this issue, the British Prime Minister indicated a more positive affirmation of her country's intention to join but, at the same time, indicated a number of prior conditions which would have to be met before joining.</P>
    <P>The second and later stages of EMU will involve fundamental changes, involving amendments to the EC treaties.  For this purpose, we agreed the preparatory work for the organisation of an inter-governmental conference would be started.  The holding of and the timing of this conference turned out to be one of the most contentious issues, with some member states pressing for a definite date to be settled.  However, we eventually agreed on a compromise formula, which stated that the conference would meet once the first stage had begun and would be preceded by full and adequate preparation. Given the timing aspects, an important part of this work is likely to fall into our EC Presidency during the first half of next year.</P>
    <P>In the discussions, I indicated our strong support for the principle of EMU on the phased and balanced basis as outlined in the Delors report.  This will, of course, involve a further pooling of economic and monetary sovereignty, but this will be offset by a corresponding input by member states into economic and monetary policy formulation at Community level.  In today's world member states especially the smaller ones, have only a limited capacity to determine their rate of economic progress because of their susceptibility to changes in international economic and financial developments. A strong integrated Community will be in a much stronger position to decide and control its own economic progress, to a large extent independently of whatever the international circumstances may be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="451" /> Since the foundation of the State all Governments have found it to be in the best interests of this country to have our currency linked to a larger currency area. Originally this was sterling, but in the past ten years we have been linked to the European monetary system, which has been centred on the strength of the Deutsche Mark.  If we can manage our domestic affairs in a disciplined fashion, as we have been doing over the past two years, the advantages are clear.  EMS membership enables us to sustain lower inflation and lower interest rates, keeping speculative movements to a minimum. This, in turn, has helped lay the foundations for strong economic growth and an improvement in employment.  Sound economic management at home linked to a tightly controlled monetary regime in Europe has, therefore, already proved its value to us.  Clearly integration into a strong Europe in a more broadly based economic and monetary union is clearly in our interests, subject to certain necessary safeguards.</P>
    <P>I drew particular attention to the emphasis in the report on the need for a balance between economic and monetary aspects of integration and on the need to promote the development of the Community's less developed regions.  I also made it clear that I could not possibly accept the notion that reliance on the operation of free market forces alone would be sufficient to spread prosperity throughout the Community.  Indeed, it could certainly have precisely the opposite effect.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to report that our concerns have been accepted with the reference in the Presidency Conclusions to the &ldquo;economic and social aspects of cohesion&rdquo;, the acceptance of the parallelism and balance between economic and monetary aspects, and the need to take account of &ldquo;the diversity of specific situations in the member states&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment briefly on the suggestion in the recent ESRI review that the existing Structural Fund programmes under the national development plan might cause excessive demand pressures <Col N="452" /> leading to higher inflation, with the implication that our ability to absorb EC transfers may be limited.  While it is of course entirely legitimate to point to possible dangers from excessive short-term stimulation, it will be the Government's responsibility, working in close consultation with the social partners, to take prompt action to prevent any overheating of the economy should this danger arise. We have a backlog of structural deficiencies that will take us many, many years to clear.  Rapid but controlled progress is needed if we are to succeed in catching up with our more prosperous EC neighbours.  We will need significant EC assistance for many years to come and it is up to us to make the adjustments that may be necessary in order to accommodate it.</P>
    <P>On the harmonisation of indirect taxes, we were also successful in having recorded in the Conclusions that the further work in this area must have regard to the problems involved.  As the Minister for Finance has already underlined in the Community discussions, the new proposals from the Commission do not address the enormous budgetary impact &mdash; equivalent to 3 per cent of our GNP &mdash; that harmonisation would cause for this country.  However, I am satisfied that as a result of recent discussions and contacts there is now a greater understanding of our difficulties and we will be insisting that this will be addressed by the high-level <i>ad hoc</i> group which is to report to the ECOFIN Council in the autumn. Our objective is to negotiate a solution, whereby tax approximation can take place with our full participation, on a basis that causes least disruption to our public finances, to our trade position, and that can be implemented without causing social hardship or adverse social consequences.</P>
    <P>On the social dimension, I fully supported the draft Presidency Conclusions that social aspects should be given equal weight with economic aspects in the Community's programme on the internal market, and that the creation of more jobs &mdash; estimated to be 5 million between <Col N="453" /> 1988 and 1990 &mdash; must be given top priority.  This is necessary, if economic progress is to redound to the benefit of the people of the Community.  Already in 1988, 1.8 million jobs overall were created at Community level, when the Community experienced its highest growth rate for 12 years and its highest level of investment for 21 years.</P>
    <P>I was also able to give full support to the related concept of a Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights &mdash; covering such rights as freedom of movement, equality of opportunity, vocational training etc. &mdash; and to encourage further detailed examination of the preliminary draft Commission text on which the Social Affairs Council had prepared draft conclusions, accepted by 11 member states including this country, at their meeting on 12 June.  Our supportive approach for the social dimension is in keeping with the spirit of co-operation that we have developed in this country between the social partners, which brings us more in line with continental European practice.</P>
    <P>However, it is particularly important that the principle of subsidiarity is respected in the social area and that a proper balance is maintained between what is dealt with in Community legislation, what is for decision by the individual member states in keeping with their different traditions and practices, and what is for negotiation between the social partners.  The House will note that this principle is endorsed in the Presidency Conclusions.</P>
    <P>On the completion of the internal market, the increasing tempo of decision making since the adoption of the qualified majority provisions of the Single European Act has been maintained under the Spanish Presidency with recent decisions in a number of priority areas, such as public contracts, banking and financial services and the approximation of technical standards.  Recent decisions on the liberalisation of banking services will provide a major boost in our development plans for the International Financial Services Centre at the Dublin Custom House Docks and will be particularly <Col N="454" /> helpful in our campaign to attract further US and Japanese companies.</P>
    <P>I raised the slow pace of progress on the liberalisation of air transport.  Indeed the phenomenal growth of traffic on the London-Dublin route, which has seen a doubling of passengers since 1986, was cited as a perfect example of the benefits of liberalisation.  I reiterated our full backing for air transport liberalisation which we strongly supported at European level during the lifetime of the last Government.  We have directly experienced the cost to our tourism of maintaining artificially high fares and of bureaucratic obstruction of new routes.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that the Council also highlighted a number of other areas such as taxation of savings, audio-visual matters, free movement of persons, environment, research and development and a people's Europe.  On these we emphasised the need to sustain and strengthen the momentum for decision making in the relevant Community fora.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House particularly to the proposal to set up a European environmental agency. The agency would essentially be a scientific body, which would assist the Community, member states and participating third countries to implement environmental action programmes as well as carrying out an invaluable monitoring role.  I expressed the view that the new body is a response to the real need for redoubled efforts on environmental matters by the international community.  It is at Community level that we in Ireland will best be able to respond to frightening global problems such as depletion of the ozone layer, the greenhouse effect and the problem of the tropical rain forests, as well as more specifically European problems of marine pollution, carbon emissions and nuclear safety.</P>
    <P>The decision in our joint programme for Government to set up an independent environmental monitoring agency goes in the same direction, and will ensure that we are able to make a full national input into efforts co-ordinated by the European agency to protect and improve the environment. It also anticipates the call by the <Col N="455" /> group of seven leading industrial countries at their meeting in Paris at the weekend, when they urged all countries to give a new impetus to environmental issues.</P>
    <P>At the European Council we also reviewed developments in relations between the Community and its main trading partners, including such issues as the current GATT &mdash; Uruguay &mdash; Round, the negotiations with the ACP States and the problem of indebtedness in Latin American countries.</P>
    <P>In the areas of European political co-operation, the Council issued declarations on China and the Middle East peace process and adopted conclusions on a variety of world issues.</P>
    <P>The Declaration on China condemned the brutal repression in that country, called for a halt to the executions and urged the Chinese authorities to take into account the people's hopes there for freedom and democracy.  As normal relations cannot be maintained in the present circumstances, we announced a series of measures restricting co-operation which are intended to exert pressure for greater respect for human rights.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that the conclusions stressed the priority of arms control and disarmament, and of respect for human rights, in the context of an improvement in East-West relations.  We called for a just solution of the Lebanese problem, appealed for the release of hostages and expressed full support for UNIFIL.  We also expressed concern at the situation in Central America and confirmed the Twelve's support for the regional peace process.</P>
    <P>In the wings of the Madrid meeting, I had a separate meeting with the President of the Commission, Mr. Jacques Delors, when we discussed a number of aspects of the internal market, with particular reference to the Community's policy of economic and social cohesion as well as the EC Structural Funds.  We reviewed progress in the Commission's examination of our <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i> and the development of the increased resources of the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="456" /> I also had a meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, during which we reviewed the successful completion of the three-year review of the workings of the Anglo-Irish Conference. We also exchanged views on current issues in Anglo-Irish relations, in the Community and on world issues such as the situation in China and the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>The conclusions on economic and monetary union represent the most notable success of the Madrid meeting, particularly when seen against the background of what seemed at some stages to be almost irreconcilable differences. While the outcome is not as far-reaching as we would have wished, there is now an unstoppable political momentum towards the Community's further integration and development.  The potential benefits are such, I believe, as to encourage us all to overcome the difficulties and problems involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>At the conclusion of every European Council meeting the Presidency issues a very up-beat statement, the President of the Commission usually makes a somewhat less up-beat statement and occasionally goes as far as chiding the Council for not proceeding quickly enough towards the goals proposed by the Commission.  If Mrs. Thatcher deserves credit for nothing else she deserves some for talking bluntly about the problems remaining unresolved, usually as a result of her obduracy.</P>
      <P>For those who can interpret &ldquo;Euro-speak&rdquo; the document on the Presidency Conclusions sometimes can be revealing. That is certainly the case on this occasion. A close reading of the Presidency Conclusions shows very clearly that, on topic after topic, the European Council has failed to measure up to the clearly expressed and understandable ambitions of the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning the Taoiseach has given us his usual rather glossy presentation of what happened at the Council.  Indeed it might have been even more glossy.  There were reports, just after the Council meeting, to the effect that the Taoiseach had <Col N="457" /> contributed, with the then Greek Prime Minister, to finding a formula of words which got the Council over one of its many sticky patches with Mrs. Thatcher. Subsequently it appears that the gaisce achieved by Mr. Papandreou and the Taoiseach together amounted to no more than a colon; or was it a semicolon? Whatever it was, the fact of the matter is that the Madrid European Council made very little progress indeed.</P>
    <P>The central issue before the Council was the achievement of economic and monetary union as provided for in the Single European Act.  The Presidency Conclusions state:</P>
    <P>The European Council decided that the first stage of the realisation of economic and monetary union would begin on 1 July, 1990.</P>
    <P>In addition the European Council asked the Commission, the Committee of Central Bank Governors, the Monetary Committee, the Finance Ministers and the General Affairs Council to:</P>
    <P>carry out the preparatory work for the organisation of an Intergovernmental Conference to lay down the subsequent stages;</P>
    <P>There is a semicolon there which I gather was the one that the Taoiseach and Mr. Papandreou put in.  To continue the quotation:</P>
    <P>that conference would meet once the first stage had begun and would be preceded by full and adequate preparation.</P>
    <P>That means that the Intergovernmental Conference will not meet until the first stage has begun, that is some time after 1 July, 1990.  No date has been fixed for that conference because Mrs. Thatcher would not have a date.  She made it quite clear that Britain would attend such a conference only because she did not believe in leaving an empty chair.  That hardly augurs well for the atmosphere at that conference whenever it takes place.</P>
    <P>The only thing agreed by the European Council in Madrid was that the first stage of economic and monetary union would <Col N="458" /> begin on 1 July 1990.  Beyond that nothing has been agreed.  That is hardly the notable success to which the Taoiseach referred in the last paragraph of his remarks.</P>
    <P>We come then to look at what is involved in stage one of economic and monetary union.  The best source of information on that is the report of the Delors Committee itself.  I might quote from paragraph 50 of that report which says:</P>
    <P>Stage 1 represents the initiation of the process of creating an economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>No time limit is set for stage 1.  A number of objectives are set but no time limit is attached to any one of them.  To look beyond the completion of stage 1 today would require the talents of a clairvoyant. An appreciation of the outcome of the Madrid Council requires a brief reference to what follows after stage 1. The Delors report itself points out in paragraph 55 that the second stage could begin only when the new treaty had come into force.  Sometime during the course of stage 1 something else has to be done, a new treaty has to be drawn up.</P>
    <P>Further on in the report there is a discussion of what the content of that new treaty might be.  There we find there is as yet no clear view as to whether a new treaty would be needed for each stage, or whether a single treaty would suffice. In practical terms, stage 2, and indeed the treaty which has to be negotiated during stage 1, is totally uncharted territory.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a very substantial agenda for stage 1.  In the economic field there are three main components.  The first is the completion of the internal market, accompanied by a strengthening of Community competition policy. Indeed, very little work has been done so far on the strengthening of competition policy.  The rest is well underway as the Taoiseach has pointed out, but there is not an awful lot on the competition policy side.  Very little has been done in member states and particularly here in relation to that aspect of stage 1.</P>
    <P>The second component is the reform of the Structural Funds and the doubling <Col N="459" /> of their resources, which we are all happy to note is underway.  We expect to see results beginning to come from that during the course of this year.</P>
    <P>The third component is the institution of a new procedure to strengthen economic and fiscal policy co-operation, a revision of the agreement of 1974 that covers the way member states co-ordinate economic and fiscal policies in order to reinforce the effect of national policies and to get the Community growing on the kind of track on which we would like to see it.  That process in itself would provide many opportunities for disagreement among the member states.</P>
    <P>We come then to the monetary side of stage 1 and there we find four principal elements.  The first is the achievement of a single financial area with monetary and financial instruments and financial services being traded freely throughout the area.  We are not at that stage yet.  With her usual delicacy, Mrs. Thatcher pointed out that some of the other partners had a long way to go before they got as far as the UK.  The second component is the inclusion of all Community currencies in the EMS exchange rate mechanism on a uniform basis.  This is part of stage 1 and is something which has to be done in order to get the ground work done.  The third element is the removal of all impediments to the private use of the European currency unit.  The final element is the definition of a new mandate for the Committee of Central Bank Governors.</P>
    <P>In at least two of those areas, it is difficult even now &mdash; only a year before the first stage begins &mdash; to see where we are going.  We have not the slightest idea when sterling might join the EMS, or at what rate.  The Taoiseach and his Ministers must know that the timing itself is going to be important for us and for the rest of the Community.  The rate at which sterling comes into the EMS, if and when it does, is going to be a matter of some considerable concern for us.  Only a year before the beginning of stage 1 we have no clarity, we have no knowledge about <Col N="460" /> what is going to be done about that essential element of stage 1.  I have not detected any great enthusiasm in either the political or the financial establishment in the UK to move in that direction.</P>
    <P>We do not know what feelings are about the definition of this new mandate for the Committee of Central Bank Governors.  They are very exalted people but they have exactly the same difficulties as Ministers in coming to conclusions.  As far as I can judge and as far as I can find out, there is at least as much disagreement between the Central Bank Governors on what that new mandate should be as there is between Ministers. By and large, it seems that the differences between them work out along the same general lines as the differences between Ministers.  I am not quite sure and it has always been something of a mystery to find out whether the Ministers are following the Central Banks or whether the Central Banks are following the Ministers. It seems to be the case that they tend to disagree on the same kinds of things and in broadly the same way.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the Delors Committee itself ran into a number of disagreements among its members on the central banking aspects of stage 1.  A group of the central bankers want to set up a European reserve fund and there is another group who do not want to have anything to do with it.  Again, an essential part of what is involved in stage 1 beginning in July of next year has not been properly tied down and has not been properly mapped out.</P>
    <P>It is clear that even the achievement of stage 1 objectives is some considerable distance down the road.  The real prospect facing us is considerably more daunting and demanding than the view that has been publicly expressed, either by the current Council Presidency or by the Taoiseach.  I do not believe for a moment that there exists in this House, or even less in this country, a clear appreciation either of the difficulties or of the opportunities that face the European Community. There is certainly no clear appreciation in this country.  We have recently missed one opportunity for a <Col N="461" /> vigorous and clear public debate on these issues.  It was missed because the Taoiseach made a gross political misjudgment on 25 May, plunged the country into a general election campaign and thereby drowned out any discussion of these issues in the context of the European election campaign.</P>
    <P>This House is not properly informed about the issues facing us, the Irish public is not properly informed about those issues, and one person above all bears the responsibility for that &mdash; the Taoiseach who conspired, whether it was deliberately or accidentally I am never quite sure, but he certainly brought about a situation where all debate on all of these European issues was drowned out because he decided &mdash; wrongly as it happened &mdash; that it would be in his interest to have a general election on the same day.</P>
    <P>The Madrid Council talked about taxation, including the harmonisation of indirect taxation.  The paragraph dealing with that issue in the Presidency Conclusions is a masterpiece.  I will quote the paragraph as follows:</P>
    <P>The European Council welcomes the fact that detailed discussions had now begun in the field of the approximation of indirect taxation on the basis of the new approaches proposed by the Commission and taking account of the member states' suggestions, and that a procedure for the continuation of those discussions had been laid down.  The European Council emphasised the need to reach agreement on the broad lines of a solution in this area before the end of the year, having regard to all the problems involved, in order to ensure that the internal market came into operation on schedule.</P>
    <P>When that paragraph is translated from Euro-speak into English, it amounts to a cry of despair from the Commission which, having been pushed off its original proposals by a combination of hostility on the part of some member states and active indifference on the part of others, has been reduced to putting forward a set of very woolly and ill-defined aspirations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="462" /> The last Government here failed to measure up to that situation.  The present Coalition Government, if we are to believe the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats programme for Government 1989-1993 &mdash; that document which is disavowed in here every day thrice before the cock crows &mdash; does not seem to offer anything concrete either.  As far as I can seem, there is a grave danger in relation to the indirect taxation area that the Thatcher doctrine will prevail, that the devil will take the hindmost, and there is more than a fair chance that we will be the hindmost.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal for a European Community charter on fundamental social rights.  As far as I can discern, the Madrid Council made no attempt to get conclusive agreement on this charter: it contended itself simply with nothing that draft conclusions had been agreed by 11 delegations at a Council Meeting on Social Affairs on 12 June.  I should like to know who, if anybody, represented the Irish Government at that meeting&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Secretary of the Department of Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and what particular line was taken in relation to the European social charter.  Have there been comprehensive discussions between the Departments most concerned about the content of that charter, for example, the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Labour, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance &mdash; which will have more than a passing interest in it?  Was there a real effort to navigate a way that would be to our benefit into a European social charter? I have not seen any evidence of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of attention has been given to the proposal by the Commission for the creation of a European environment agency and we have all welcomed the fact that the European Council has shown a much keener awareness of the importance of these serious issues of the environment to which the Taoiseach has referred.  I note also that this present Coalition Government, or perhaps the <Col N="463" /> Taoiseach, intend to have a corresponding agency and to give a corresponding job to a Progressive Democrat junior Minister.  Neither intention impresses me.  As far as the European Community is concerned all that has happened is that the Madrid Council called upon the Council of Ministers &ldquo;to examine this proposal at the earliest opportunity&rdquo;.  They have not decided anything.  They have put forward the idea and it is to be examined at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>At national level, this House yesterday passed an Estimate for the Department of the Environment which contains no provision for an agency at national level, indicating that no concrete action can be taken here unless and until a Supplementary Estimate is passed next autumn.  It appears that the prospective junior Minister in question may find herself twiddling her thumbs for quite some time because she will have nothing to do.</P>
    <P>We now come to the traditional reference to the Taoiseach's meeting with Mrs. Thatcher, which gets a six line paragraph in the Taoiseach's speech.  We were told that during the meeting, the Taoiseach and Mrs. Thatcher reviewed the &ldquo;successful completion of the three year review of the workings of the Anglo-Irish Conference&rdquo; and &ldquo;exchanged views on current issues in Anglo-Irish relations, in the Community and on world issues such as the situation in China and the Soviet Union.&rdquo;  It appears that the meeting was relatively brief.  It would also appear from the working agenda that Anglo-Irish issues did not figure very large in that discussion.  I wonder what is meant by the phrase which describes the Anglo-Irish part of this meeting &mdash;&ldquo;during which we reviewed the successful completion of the three year review of the workings of the Anglo-Irish Conference&rdquo;. Did the Taoiseach and Mrs. Thatcher meet to review Anglo-Irish relations, or to review the review of Anglo-Irish relations, or to review the completion of the review of Anglo-Irish relations?  I think the word processor <Col N="464" /> merchants in the Taoiseach's Department could have found a more felicitous phrase than that to express what happened. Let us be quite blunt about it, I found this review of the workings of the Anglo-Irish Agreement carried out some time ago to be the most disappointing non-event.  As far as I could see, that review did nothing more than would have been done at a normal averagely laid back meeting of the inter-governmental conference. It certainly did not give any new impetus to any of the work that needs to be done under the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>I note also that the Taoiseach compliments the Madrid Council on having had a number of discussions about issues such as brutality and repression in China; arms control and disarmament.  That is very valuable and those parts of the work of the European Council have an importance that is often not recognised.  I was very interested yesterday to note that the Foreign Ministers had followed up on some of that work and that our own Minister for Foreign Affairs, in a reference to the Austrian application to join the European Community spoke about Austrian neutrality and Irish neutrality &mdash; he was a member of that last Government that put together this phoney and empty declaration that accompanied the lodgement of our instrument of ratification of the Single European Act, this jingoistic bit of paper that was supposed to be the fig leaf for all the backwoods men in Fianna Fáil who think that any involvement with anybody else anywhere compromises our neutrality or our independence. However, the Minister for Foreign Affairs was moved to say that there was a difference between Austrian neutrality and Irish neutrality, because no Irish Government had ever said that Ireland would always remain neutral in the context of progress towards European Union.</P>

      <P>Not at all.  I could go on for the rest of the day.  We should get away from accepting the bland assurances that come out of the press machine of the European Council and have more direct talking about what goes on at the Council, what the difficulties are and what the confrontations were so that we, at least, can play some part in shaping the course of events at the European Council.  As I have said, the results were very meagre and I regret having to say that because I am a committed advocate of European Union and all that it entails. The Taoiseach's presentation this morning and the Presidency Conclusions do nothing to convince me that we are proceeding at anything more than a snail's pace towards the objectives we should be seeking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on the report given by the Taoiseach this morning arising from the meeting of the European Council in Madrid on 26 and 27 June.  It highlights the difficulties confronting the European Council and also the difficulties of the <Col N="466" /> Members of this House and the members of the Government in getting to grips with the many issues that confront the European Community.  One of the difficulties the report highlights is that there is a very limited opportunity for input into the discussion that takes place at the European Council.  In the light of this, perhaps when the Taoiseach is considering setting up committees of this House he would consider having a committee on foreign affairs, or a committee on European affairs to give Members an opportunity to be constantly briefed and to have an input in to the European Community. In my humble opinion there is a weakness in that respect.</P>
      <P>We should also consider providing a facility so that our Members of the European Parliament would be able to report back to this Parliament, even if it was only on a one day per month basis.  I believe we must have a co-ordinated and highly efficient approach to the European Community, otherwise we will not maximise either our input to the development process of the European Community or the benefits which this country will achieve. I ask the Taoiseach to consider this suggestion when he is setting up committees of this House.  When it comes to reporting back to the House on these issues, I would ask the Taoiseach to establish a procedure whereby the leaders of the other parties could get the content of the statements 24 hours in advance of the report to the Dáil to give us an opportunity to consider in detail the issues that will be raised in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meeting was obviously difficult and I would say there was limited progress, but obviously large wheels turn slowly.  Some progress has been made and credit should be given to all the leaders where progress has been made.  The first major difficulty was the British Prime Minister's attitude to economic and monetary union.  She has taken a very anti-European attitude at home during the past 12 months to two years whereas prior to that she seemed to be encouraging all and sundry to be pro-European. I believe the British Prime Minister is very adept at playing what the market <Col N="467" /> requires at any particular time in domestic politics and is quite capable of doing otherwise on the European stage.</P>
    <P>The fact that she has agreed, despite being enormously reluctant, is progress. We should be grateful for that.  At least the stage is set for developments to take place.  I would be worried about the timing because there is less than 12 months to go before the beginning of stage 1.  The Taoiseach, in the lead up to his Presidency of the European Council, should take the initiative and ensure that the committee which has been agreed as a compromise formula should have a very high profile, with the highest possible input from the Irish Government's point of view.  Obviously it will be a very important committee and it is very important from our point of view that we have the highest possible level of input.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned that he drew particular attention to the emphasis in the Delors report on the need for balance between economic and monetary aspects of integration and the need to promote the development of the Community's less developed regions.  I would like to feel that the Taoiseach made his views known on this in the strongest possible terms because it is obviously of major importance to this country.</P>
    <P>If we do not achieve positive discrimination in favour of the less developed countries, we are literally wasting our time in the European Community. We have to have every assistance available to us to ensure that this country's level of income and development is brought into line with that of other European countries.  We are so far behind in terms of transport facilities and development generally that we must, on a weekly and indeed a daily basis, ensure that there is a balance between the less developed regions and the centre of Europe and that our voice is very strong in relation to this.  I hope the Taoiseach will constantly outline to this House as to what he is doing along those lines.</P>
    <P>Obviously the Treaty of Rome will <Col N="468" /> have to be revised and the Inter-governmental Conference which will meet next year will have to consider the whole question of a single currency and the European Central Bank.  I would like to think that we and other less developed regions will get the assurances we require and which are very necessary in relation to the extra Structural Funds if we are to go along with the single currency and the European Central Bank.  We are very vulnerable in this area.  Despite a lot of publicity about the development of our financial services, I believe we are still very far behind what has been happening in the European financial sectors.  We will need guarantees in relation to what would happen here if the single currency and the European Central Bank are developed as is set out.</P>
    <P>Obviously we must encourage the Taoiseach in his efforts in regard to the social aspects but I would have to express grave disappointment regarding the weakening down of the conclusions as they relate to the charter of fundamental social rights.  We have to look at our own involvement in the Community since 1973 and the history of the development of labour legislation in this country.  We should accept the fact &mdash; I believe the case is well proven &mdash; that we have benefited and that we have been led by Europe in this regard at a pace much faster than would have been the case if we were not a member.  The leaders in the European Council on this occasion accepted the UK position, that is allowing for the dominance of the individual countries in relation to the changes to be made.  I believe what is in this document is a direct code &mdash; the UK code &mdash; for the local states to avoid EC directives. That is the conservative position.  I believe we would be failing and slipping backwards if we did not make provision for EC directives to be implemented because only in that way will we have the progress that we will certainly be looking for in terms of workers' rights and worker participation.  I believe the Conservative Government of Britain has won out on this issue.  Perhaps that was the sacrifice the other leaders had to make to get <Col N="469" /> the British Prime Minister's agreement in relation to economic and monetary union.  It is a matter which we should discuss again in this House and one the Irish Government should come back to because we must accept that we have benefited from the extensive labour legislation which was implemented through EC encouragement and directives from the mid-seventies onwards.</P>
    <P>The proposal for the European Environmental Agency is one which I welcome.  Perhaps at this stage the Government could publicly admit their mistake in abolishing An Foras Forbartha.  I would like to think the present Government will do something positive in this regard.  It has been widely reported that Deputy Harney from the Progressive Democrats will be given responsibility for an environmental protection agency &mdash; on the basis of the document which was published last week, a document which will be implemented by the Government, but one has to question that already.  I would like the House to receive clarification as to where the money will come from and how much money will be provided for an environmental protection agency.  There is little point in appointing a Minister if that Minister is not given the authority and the resources to go about undoing the damage caused by the last Government when they abolished An Foras Forbartha. That was a very serious mistake but one which the Government now have the opportunity of rectifying and they should get on with doing that.  There is little point in continuing to defend the indefensible in a situation like this.</P>
    <P>The discussions in relation to world matters at the European Summit are obviously to be welcomed.  A statement was made there on China.  I would like to know if the Irish Government considered calling in the Chinese Ambassador to this country to make known to him the strong views of the people on what has happened in China and which has set that country back decades.  I wonder if the Government should take stronger action in this regard.  I understand there are restrictions and restraints in relation to working <Col N="470" /> with our European partners but on matters like this we should have no hesitation in making the strong views of this country known to the resident Ambassador in this country.</P>
    <P>The meeting which took place with Jacques Delors is obviously to be welcomed but I would like the Taoiseach to be more forthcoming in relation to the review that has taken place at that meeting of the Commission's examination of our national development plan which was submitted to Brussels some months ago. I would like to think that the plan can be supported in Brussels because obviously it will be of major importance to us in the coming decade and right to the end of this century.  I have to admit reluctantly that my impression is that Brussels was not enormously impressed with the manner in which the plan was submitted and with the attempt by Ministers to go&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I will not comment on the position in relation to the Anglo-Irish Agreement as the matter is down for Question Time today and I believe it will be more appropriately dealt with at that time.  The meeting was obviously a very brief one.  In regard to Deputy Collins' statement in Brussels on Monday in relation to neutrality, all I can do is quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> in which Deputy Collins is quoted as saying &mdash; as far as I can see he has not made any attempt to <Col N="471" /> state otherwise since the question has been raised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I wish him well in his new portfolio.  I welcome that statement from him but I feel that instead of an <i>ad lib</i> reply to my request for clarification in the House, what is warranted is a full statement from the Minister.  He will appreciate that there will be a major discussion in relation to Austria's participation in the European Community, and perhaps in due course that of the Swedes who are somewhat reluctant to get involved in full membership.  It is very important that we outline in detail the fundamental principle of Irish neutrality. When one is misquoted in a reasonable paper like <i>The Irish Times</i>, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has a responsibility to clarify the Government's position on our neutrality.  I would be very reluctant to conclude that what is not stated is that Ireland will move with European political union, which is the obvious conclusion that the writer intended but whether the Minister for Foreign Affairs intended that is another question.  I would ask the Minister to issue a statement at the earliest opportunity.</P>

A <Col N="472" /> great deal of progress and work has to be achieved in relation to the social charter. I hope the Taoiseach will give some cognisance to my remarks in relation to providing a facility in this House whereby through a committee system or some other method the Members of this House are in a position to have an input and be better informed in relation to European affairs.  We have to accept that our future is intertwined with developments at European level and we should be doing everything possible to ensure that our contribution is positive and meaningful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome broadly the Taoiseach's statement and the communiqué from the Madrid meeting of the European Council.  The Madrid meeting seems to have been one of the more positive European Council summits of recent years.  In particular, The Workers' Party welcome the clear commitment given in paragraph 2.2. of the communiqué that social cohesion as well as the completion of the internal market and economic integration were the priority objectives of this new chapter in the history of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without social cohesion there can be no real community of interest.  We must not, under any circumstances, allow progress on economic integration and the free market, without simultaneous progress on social issues for all citizens.  It will require more than statements of intent to ensure that this happens.  It will require positive steps by the Community at all levels, and by our own Government. Already organisations in this country, like the FUE, have made it clear that they believe that the proposed social reforms, which would, for instance, stop the sweatshop exploitation of workers and which must be an integral part of the 1992 process, should not be fully implemented in this country.  Let me say here that I am a little concerned that the Taoiseach appears to be calling on the principle of &ldquo;subsidiarity&rdquo; to allow a loophole here for the FUE to pursue this approach.  It is clear that while the FUE want to enjoy the commercial benefits of 1992, they do not want to meet the obligations to their <Col N="473" /> employees that go with the completion of the internal market.</P>
    <P>We intend to ensure in as far as we can that the FUE are not allowed to veto measures to extend to Irish workers the sort of protective legislation that protects their colleagues in most other EC countries. The FUE's thinking is totally in line with that of Mrs. Thatcher.  They want economic benefits for big business, but no social benefit for workers.  To allow the completion of economic integration without parallel progress on social issues will simply give us a capitalist free market which will further benefit the already privileged and drive ever increasing numbers into poverty.</P>
    <P>There is a major agenda for action facing the Community, and especially this country, to ensure common social standards in such areas as social security, protection for women, the right to consultation and participation by workers in enterprises, the right to proper protective legislation and freedom to join trade unions, as well as proper health and safety standards.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party reject any concept of a &ldquo;two speed&rdquo; approach to European integration, with rapid progress being made in the economic and monetary areas, while social matters are put on the long finger.  It is inevitable that moves towards complete free trade by 1992 will cause major difficulties for people in the peripheral economies such as Ireland and there must be definite progress in the social area to compensate for this.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, no specific proposals in the social area were agreed at the Madrid meeting and until they are the commitment to make social cohesion a priority will simply remain a pious aspiration. Everyone is aware of the hostility of the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, to initiatives for social progress but she must not be allowed to hold back the development of the Community in this area.</P>
    <P>I note from page 5 of the communiqué that detailed discussions have now begun on the approximation of indirect taxation. I would ask the Taoiseach to clarify what steps are being taken to protect the <Col N="474" /> interests of the PAYE sector and the lower income groups in this area.  We have persistently warned of the dangers of tax harmonisation for Irish workers and their families.  The Taoiseach should say quite clearly if his Government are going to accept VAT on food, if he is going to accept a tax régime which will result in reduced taxes on expensive cars but greatly increased taxes on many essential items which people have to buy on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>I welcome the emphasis given by the heads of Government to environmental issues and the commitment to take steps on a range of areas.  I hope that consideration of the proposed European environment agency will be rapidly concluded and the agency made a reality. Throughout Ireland and the rest of Europe people are becoming more and more aware of the need for a clean environment, not only for recreation but also to safeguard our health and our resources.  The names of Sellafield, Chernobyl, the Brazilian rain forests, and the ozone layer have become part of our daily conversation as tragic symbols of the destruction of our living environment.</P>
    <P>People are understanding that the seas and rivers, the air and the land are not a bottomless pit into which an endless amount of waste can be dumped.  They recognise also that the environment is an economic issue.  Pollution costs jobs as well as lives.  The converse is also true &mdash; an enlightened approach to environmental protection can create jobs and protect lives.  Indeed the only Community institution which is based in this country, the European Foundation for the improvement of Living and Working Conditions, should be upgraded to play an extended role in the environmental area, and the question of having it expanded to become the proposed European environment agency should be urgently examined by Government.</P>

      <P>The Workers' Party welcome the principle of European monetary union, and there must be a <Col N="475" /> major role for a European Central Bank which could control and direct currency and capital movements within the Community. Such a bank would, however, need to be structured democratically, with representatives from the European Parliament, national governments and trade unions, as its powers would be too important to be left in the hands of private interests.  It would be intolerable for EC states to lose the controls they now exercise through their Central Banks unless these controls are established at Community level in a democratic form.</P>
      <P>There appears to have been a fairly comprehensive discussion at Madrid on international affairs and we welcome the positive tone of the declaration on such areas as southern Africa and the Middle East.  Like most people, I deplore the recent developments in China, and urge the Chinese Government to radically rethink the course they have embarked upon recently.  I deplore in particular the loss of life in China whether through military action or through execution.</P>
      <P>The most significant development to have taken place since Madrid has been the official application for membership of the Community by Austria.  I note and welcome the positive tone of the comments made by the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gerard Collins. However, I think the Irish Government should go further and become enthusiastic proponents of Austrian membership of the EC.  The admission of another neutral country to membership would afford additional protection to Irish neutrality. If the Community is to be truly European, then it must be open to all democratic European countries.  The attitude of the Belgian Government, which is threatening to block the Austrian application and which seems to see the EC simply as a political wing of NATO must be challenged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of this country should be a Europe which is militarily non-aligned, a Europe in which all weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated.  We do not accept that it is in the interests of Europe or of world peace that military <Col N="476" /> matters should be part of the EC's remit. The aim of all those who want to see a genuinely peaceful world must be to secure the dismantling of military blocs such as NATO and the Warsaw Pact.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £46,478,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1989, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education, for certain services administered by that office, and for payment of certain grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>It is with pleasure that I am asking Dáil Éireann today to approve the four Votes, Nos. 26 to 29 which make up the group of Votes for which I am responsible as Minister for Education.  The total gross provision in the four Votes sought for Education for the current year is £1,260.526 million which corresponds to almost 6.4 per cent of GNP.  Appropriations-in-Aid will amount to £88.349 million.  The net Exchequer provision is thus £1,172.177 million, corresponding to 18.4 per cent of net Exchequer expenditure. The net amount is approximately £58 million more than the provisional 1988 outturn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last two decades we have seen some significant developments in the education system in Ireland.  For example, participation in second level education has doubled.  The increase in the rate of participation in third level education has also been spectacular &mdash; from some 22,000 to 59,000.  We have <Col N="477" /> one of the highest rates of participation by young people in full-time education of the industrialised OECD countries.</P>
    <P>However, while acknowledging the achievements of the past, we must now turn our attention to the many problems and challenges which face us today and to the corresponding opportunities which are open to us.  There is already a general awareness and acceptance of these problems and challenges.</P>
    <P>Pupil numbers at primary level have already started to fall.  Numbers at second level will begin to fall by the middle of the next decade.  The number of students seeking third level places will continue to increase for some time to come.  We must continue to improve the quality, the relevance, the availability and the effectiveness of the programmes we offer.  We must identify, and alleviate or remove, the disincentives which prevent some from benefiting as they should.  Our education system must acknowledge and provide for students of different capacities from different backgrounds with different needs and aspirations.  It must identify and meet the needs of our young people in a quickly changing world.  It must take account of the continuing and accelerating developments in technology which now affect all our lives.  It must take account of the social and economic changes that are taking place around us. All this must be done in a cost effective way.</P>
    <P>My Department have already made considerable progress in addressing these problems.  Action has already been taken on some fronts.  On other fronts, a number of wide ranging reviews are currently under way with the active participation of the many interests involved in education.  Many decisions will have to be taken before long which will have long lasting implications for the quality of education in Ireland well into the next century.</P>
    <P>Although fertility rates have been falling from the beginning of the seventies, the largest number of births ever recorded since the State was founded occurred in 1980 when 74,000 children were born.  In 1988, this number had <Col N="478" /> fallen by approximately 20,000.  The present projection is that the population in the age range 5-19, which covers most of primary and second level education, could fall from 1,032,000 in 1986 to 837,000 in 2001 &mdash; a fall of almost 200,000.</P>
    <P>In the absence of major structural changes, enrolments in the compulsory school ages are almost entirely determined by demographic considerations and these considerations also influence enrolments in the post compulsory period.  Significant changes in levels and patterns of enrolments are expected between now and the end of the century. Enrolment projections which are prepared annually in my Department suggest that, taking demographic and other factors into account, the peak of enrolments in primary education is already past and that enrolments will fall by about 20-25 per cent by the end of the century. We are already well into the planning process for these changes.</P>
    <P>In the case of post-primary education, we believe that the levels of enrolments in the mid-nineties will be fairly close to current levels, though there will be short-term changes in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Enrolments at third level are affected by a large number of factors, some of which can be influenced by policy and some not.  I expect that within the next ten years there will be a different type of student and many more mature people seeking access to third level education. As in other countries, there will be changes in the nature and type of person wishing to enter third level.</P>
    <P>Careful planning and rationalisation will be needed to ensure that the best use is made of resources and that falling numbers in individual schools do not create avoidable difficulties.  Clearly, this will require the co-ordinated efforts of all of the partners in education and I intend to continue to ensure that a proper forum is provided for the necessary consultation and discussion.</P>
    <P>Despite the very serious economic problems and financial difficulties which this country faces and the limited <Col N="479" /> resources available for education services, I have been able, by having my Department adopt careful management strategies, to introduce a number of important initiatives.  These initiatives have been taken to ensure that the Irish education system, which has served this country so well in the past, will continue to meet the needs of our young people and to prepare them to participate as active members of society well into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>The potential of the information technologies to achieve greater administrative efficiency in the public sector and to provide improved services in the field of education is very great.  I have arranged for additional funds to be available in 1989 to initiate the computerisation of the examination process in the examinations branch of my Department in Athlone.</P>
    <P>In June 1989 I launched the first phase of the computerisation process.  In the present year over 120,000 examination candidates will benefit from this initiative. The advantages accuring from this phase will include the production by computer of provisional statements of results for each candidate, certificates for candidates, computer readable data for external agencies and examination statistics.</P>
    <P>Two significant reviews into primary education are currently under way.  The Primary Curriculum Review Body are undertaking a comprehensive review of the curriculum, the first review since the &ldquo;new curriculum&rdquo; was introduced in 1971, they are examining the aims and objectives of the present curriculum and the extent to which they are being achieved.  Specific attention is being given to the last two years of the primary school and their alignment to the post-primary curriculum.  Consideration will be given to structures to ensure that the objectives of the curriculum can be evaluated as students progress through school.  The review body have all existing relevant research data available to them.  The second review, under the chairmanship of Dr. Thomas Murphy, former President <Col N="480" /> of University College, Dublin, is taking a broader look at the primary education system.  I expect to have the findings of both reviews before the end of the year.  These will be presented to Government and their implementation will be a matter for decision.</P>
    <P>There has been an increasing awareness over the past number of years of the need to take special measures to counteract the disadvantages experienced by pupils from certain socio-economic backgrounds. Particular reference to this was made in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and in the present Government's programme, which states:</P>
    <P>The new Government will consider in consultation with the Central Review Committee ways to recognise and assist the needs of pupils in disadvantaged areas, by providing extra teacher allocations including additional remedial teachers and the establishment of pilot projects for a schools psychological service for primary schools.</P>
    <P>These measures will commence in September 1989.  There are already a number of different schemes in place which are aimed at giving practical assistance to pupils attending schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Funds are made available each year to schools to assist necessitous pupils with the purchase of school books.  I am happy to say that the grant for 1989 has been increased by 18 per cent at primary level and 20 per cent at post-primary level.</P>
    <P>A special fund was set up in 1984 to finance a series of special measures and this fund is being continued in 1989.  So far, a total of £2.75 million has been provided, assisting nearly 50,000 pupils in 170 schools.  I will be considering this entire area when the review of this whole matter has been completed.  Extra measures for the disadvantaged in accordance with this Government's programme will be introduced and will take effect from September 1989.</P>
    <P>The education of travellers' children is an area for which seperate provision has been made for some time.  Last year, I had a survey carried out which showed <Col N="481" /> that 4,000 travellers' children were being catered for in 375 national schools.  One-third of these children are fully integrated into the schools they attend, one-third are partially integrated and receive special assistance and the remaining one-third is catered for in special classes.  In addition, 41 pre-schools are now operating. At second level, there are 12 junior training centres for 12 to 15 year olds run by local management committees with the vocational education committees providing teachers and a grant towards overheads and class materials.  There are 24 senior training centres for the 16 to 25 age group which are operated in association with FÁS and which qualify for ESF aid. Vocational education committees provide teachers and funding for these centres also.</P>
    <P>Despite budgetary pressures, the special remedial teaching posts are being maintained.  There are over 850 such posts in national schools.  A special ex-quota provision for remedial teachers exists at second level.  Guidelines aimed at changing the emphasis of the remedial programme from remediation to prevention have been issued to schools.  Discussions have been arranged throughout the country on the aims and objectives of the guidelines.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, and myself jointly launched a new programme for early school leavers.  This Youthreach programme is the first major initiative undertaken for the estimated 10 per cent of school leavers who, each year, drop out of school without gaining formal certification.</P>
    <P>The programme has been launched in 11 VEC areas around the country which have been identified as having a relatively high number of early school leavers.  It will give those young people who have dropped out of school for at least six months the opportunity of special education and training for up to two years. One thousand places have been made available and participants will receive a weekly allowance of between £20 and £25.</P>
    <P>General studies, vocational studies and <Col N="482" /> work experience will be three distinct elements of the scheme, which will essentially involve an integrated response by education, training, and community interests to the problems which motivate this group to drop out of school.</P>
    <P>The adult literacy and community scheme was a response to the problem of illiteracy which is a major factor in inhibiting people from reaching their full potential.</P>
    <P>The IVEA and my Department have looked at this with a view to further initiatives and a report will be presented to me within a number of weeks.  In the meantime, I am very pleased to be able to increase this year's allocation to the scheme from £400,000 to £500,000, an increase of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>The educational opportunities scheme about which we have heard much of late and which is being run by my Department in conjunction with the Minister for Social Welfare was originally set up in Limerick and Tallaght.  I am planning to extend this scheme to a further ten centres from this autumn.</P>
    <P>Over a one year period, depending on their ability, participants follow a leaving certificate course in different subjects. During this time their social welfare benefits are discontinued, with equivalent payments being made from allowances paid through the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>In the Tallaght scheme, there were 12 participants in 1986-87; 17 in 1987-88 and 17 in 1988-89.  There have been no dropouts. It is an indication of the efficacy of the scheme that the people who went on it had such high motivation that they wanted to be in full-time education and at the same time be in receipt of their unemployment allowance.  All those who have completed the course have achieved some measure of academic success varying with their abilities.  None of the participants in the first year went back on the live register.</P>
    <P>In the Limerick scheme, there were 37 participants in 1986-87; 35 in 1987-88 and 40 in 1988-89.  There was only one dropout and only one of the participants went back on the live register.  This proves, if <Col N="483" /> proof were needed, that the longer one stays in the education system the better are one's chances in later life.  I am glad to say that starting in September we will have 11 more centres for the equal opportunities scheme.  Then, beginning in January with the application we have put into Europe for funding for those centres, we would be in a position within 12 months of being able to extend the scheme countrywide.</P>
    <P>No consideration of the Irish education system would be complete without reference to the OECD report published in 1966.  Officials from the OECD who were in Ireland some time ago have come back and are studying the whole Irish education scene.  We expect their report some time later in the year.</P>
    <P>The new junior certificate will mark the commencement of a phased programme of curricular development.  The new curricula have been designed by a combination of the representatives of the teacher unions, the relevant subject associations, school management and the inspectorate and represents the best thinking available from the representative bodies at second level education. All are conducted under the NCCA.</P>
    <P>The new junior certificate will replace the group and intermediate certificate examinations.  Seven new syllabi will be introduced in the schools next September and examinations based on these new syllabi will commence in 1992.</P>
    <P>A new subject, technology, will be added.  This subject will be phased in gradually, starting with a cross section of second level schools in the coming school year.  Some 62 schools will offer the programme from September 1989.</P>
    <P>A substantial programme has been designed to prepare school managers and teachers for introduction of the new syllabi. In Autumn 1988, each second level school received copies of the seven new syllabi, an information brochure outlining the key issues involved in the junior certificate and a video illustrating the central developments in the new syllabi.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="484" /> Representative inservice committees were established to outline a broad three-year plan for inservice provision, to identify the particular initiatives required for 1989 to prepare for the first-year section of the new syllabi.</P>
    <P>Following two preparatory weekend seminars, over 140 teachers assisted the Department inspectorate in providing one-day courses for 14,000 teachers during last February and March.  A further series of inservice courses is being planned for the next academic year.</P>
    <P>In addition guidelines for teachers on the new syllabi are being issued to all post-primary schools as part of a programme of support for all teachers.</P>
    <P>Full consultation with all interested groups has been a feature of the development of this programme to date and I will continue this consultative process.  I personally have had a series of meetings with the various interests involved in this initiative &mdash; school authorities, teacher interests and parents &mdash; and I want to record my appreciation to all concerned for their commitment and for the welcome given to this great new development.</P>

The generosity and openness, with which the unions approached this task is proof once again, if proof were needed, that the teachers here are interested in reform, in curriculum development.  I, for my part, would hope to meet their openness and generosity in a like manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the subject of modern continental languages we have the Lingua programme which again is reinforced in the new programme for Government.  One hundred extra schools are taking a language other than French in combination with those who have already done it and the percentage increase in the number <Col N="485" /> of schools now offering two European languages linked with the European initiative beginning in January will mean that more and more schools will have teachers to teach a second European language.</P>
    <P>In my Department I have been active in the area of gender equality.  If I appear to gloss over this it is because my time is running out.  I am happy to inform the House that not alone have I continued what the former Deputy Hussey commenced &mdash; I pay tribute to her for what she did in that regard &mdash; but I have been able to build on it particularly in relation to the mature students' grant <i>vis-á-vis</i> women.</P>
    <P>We have increased the primary school capitation grant by 11 per cent and in the programme for Government efforts will be made to keep primary and post-primary grants in line with inflation.</P>
    <P>There has been a number of substantial reviews commenced and carried out in the third level area.  I know that Deputy Bruton when he was Minister for Finance was interested in that area in his last year in office.  Some of these projects were mooted in the previous Government's time and formally set up in our programme. A number of them have been listed here and all of them have many components which are for the general good of students.  We hope the net result will be that more students will be participating in third level education, particularly more students from disadvantaged areas.  We have been very fortunate in our European funding, and in September many more courses will be funded at VEC and RTC level so that 90 per cent of students, regardless of background, will be in receipt of full payment of fees and the maintenance grant.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom i dtús báire comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire ar a athcheapadh.  Is é an rud is mó is cás liom sa díospóireacht seo ná an 6,000 mac léinn a fhágann ár scoileanna gan aon cháilíocht fhoirmiúil, agus go leor acu ag teacht as teaghlaigh in a bhfuil na tuismitheoirí dífhostaithe.</P>
      <P>The main worry about education at the moment is that 6,000 people leave our schools without qualifications each year. Many of those come from homes where the parents are unemployed and many come from homes in which people have been unemployed for more than a year. The motivation to further education is obviously depressed by the fact that parents are seen to have gained very little from the educational system or from society.  We have a cycle of deprivation within a family and frequently within a geographical neighbourhood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spent quite an amount of time outlining some of the measures she proposes to take to deal with this problem, and that is commendable, but I regard the measures as quite inadequate. The Minister referred to the fact that 1,000 places are being made available in 11 VEC areas for a special training scheme for those who leave school early. That only represents a provision for one-sixth of those who leave our schools without any qualifications and it is a very inadequate response even in numerical <Col N="487" /> terms.  This intervention is coming far too late.  Giving people training in a school setting when the school system has been a complete turn-off for them probably since the age of eight or nine is intervening too late.  In some instances it might be intervening too early as it would be better to leave the person at work or at least out of the system for a couple of years before bringing them back into the educational system, from the point of view of maturity.  However, the fact is that the measures proposed are not adequate.</P>
    <P>We should try to identify the point in their school careers when most early school leavers switched off from the educational system.  Articles on educational research suggest that for the first two to four years even those who will become early school leavers more or less keep up with their school fellows but at some critical point about half way through national school, they start to fall back.  It would be sensible to introduce a system of testing pupils in the system so that children who are showing signs of falling behind will be identified well before leaving the national school, perhaps at the age of ten.</P>
    <P>I know that the INTO have a justified fear of any form of external testing because of the memories of the primary certificate, cramming and all of that, but I propose this testing solely in order to identify children who might subsequently become early school leavers so that remedial teaching could be provided for them.  This also involves providing data upon which intelligent choices of priority can be made in education.  With falling school numbers the Minister can choose whether she can use the extra teachers being made available to make a generalised reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio to benefit all children equally or she can choose to make a lesser improvement in the general pupil-teacher ratio and provide more teachers for remedial teaching and to provide relief for teachers so that they can undertake in-service education, especially for teachers who work in schools in disadvantaged areas.  They <Col N="488" /> need more relief, an opportunity to leave the school for six months or a year to undertake educational renewal.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that teaching in a school where there is endemic disadvantage is much more psychologically wearing for a teacher than teaching in a school where there is the natural reward of dealing with at least a substantial proportion of children who respond very quickly to the teacher.  Some of the money that could be used to improve the general pupil-teacher ratio should be diverted to that sort of activity and to improving contact by teachers with the homes of children who are seen to be falling behind.  It has been identified in educational research that lack of interest in education by parents is at least as critical a factor in children doing badly at school, as the lack of teachers in the schools.  If teachers can do anything to make greater contact with parents it would be very beneficial.</P>
    <P>When I was parliamentary secretary to the Minister for Education in the seventies I was responsible for the Rutland Street project which was testing all these theses which I am putting forward.  I would be very interested to see a report from the Minister on how effective home school contact was and, if there are lessons there, they should be applied across the board in dealing with children who are likely to become early school leavers and thus become long-term unemployed, a perpetual deprived class in our society.</P>
    <P>Having deliberated on this radical suggestion, I suggest that the Minister for Education should be made responsible for FÁS.  It is stupid that we have a separate system of training, with a very loose system of academic discipline with qualifications which are not really accepted as being qualifications, while we have an extremely rigid disciplined system of education.  The disciplined system of education excludes many people who cannot accommodate themselves to it and the training system is so loose that it does not have the recognition from employers the education system has.  If we could weld together the two disciplines, or perhaps have a straight <Col N="489" /> compromise between the two approaches, the overall system might be more effective.  The FÁS approach is much more flexible and they are much better prepared to use outside contractors for particular educational tasks. That is something our schools should be doing.  Why should our schools not buy in expertise from outside if they need it for a particular purpose rather than having everything provided by the staff? I would like to see some of the flexibility in the FÁS system introduced into education.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see some of the discipline and rigour which applies in the Department of Education applied to the activities of FÁS.  After all, what is the difference between education and training? Quite frankly, I do not understand the difference.  It seems to me they are the same thing.  Why call them different things and why have we separate Ministers dealing with them?  I suggest, to be complete about the thought, that FÁS and the training aspects of the Department of Labour should be transferred to the Minister for Education and the remaining industrial relations functions of the Department of Labour should be transferred to the Department of Industry and Commerce and we could do away with the Department of Labour entirely.</P>

      <P>That would be very beneficial because it is the Department of Labour who have the most immediate direct contact with the consequences of educational failure.  It is the Department of Labour who have to deal with the long-term unemployed.  They are the people who have to provide training for the long-term unemployed.  If the knowledge obtained by the Department of Labour <Col N="490" /> in dealing with the consequences of educational failure could be imported into the ethos of the Department of Education, we would have a much better Department of Education and a much better organised system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about that.  I would also like to say, and I have advocated this before, that those long-term unemployed who reach the age of 25 years or over and who have left school without any educational qualifications should be offered an educational voucher to the value of, say, £2,000 to £3,000. This could be used to buy training or education from any educational institution which was prepared to compete and provide it for them.  That would introduce two merits which do not exist in the present system.  One, it would avoid centralised planning where bureaucrats decide what unemployed people need in terms of education.  The unemployed person would have some say in choosing what training or education would benefit him.  Equally, because educational institutions would be competing for his custom, they would have to look much more than they do at present, at the needs of the long-term unemployed in providing the sort of courses that would help them.</P>
      <P>I want to make three very quick points. First, it is wrong that only 10 per cent of the marks in language certificate examinations go for oral and aural skills.  If we are serious about teaching languages, the minimum should be 40 per cent.  The Minister should also look at the Canadian system where teachers assess pupils' progress; this, rather than public examinations, is the measure of achievement of pupils leaving school.  Why can we not introduce the Canadian system here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next question I would like to put is why do we need an extra five or six regional technical colleges for what is a temporary bulge that will only last until the end of the century?  Why not instead <Col N="491" /> make our higher educational institutions work all the year round?  Why should these expensive facilities be closed during the summer?  Why not hire more teachers and use the existing facilities more fully and have three semesters rather than two?</P>
    <P>Why is promotion in primary and secondary schools solely on the basis of seniority?  Surely we should have a system where promotion is on the basis of competition. We could get rid of some of the rigidities, boredom and frustration which exists among our teaching profession in doing so because they are waiting for somebody to die or retire before they can get recognition.  If they could compete for posts elsewhere in the system without this stupid seniority rule we would have a much more highly motivated educational force and it would not cost a penny.  I am not saying we should not spend more money on education but this is something we could do which would not cost anything.</P>
    <P>Let me make one final point.  Last year I supplied to the Minister the results of an educational opinion poll I carried out in my constituency.  Three hundred parents in Meath were asked what did they want more emphasis on in schools and 45 per cent of them, the overwhelmingly largest figure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Forty-five per cent said <Col N="492" /> they would like to see more continental languages taught.  In reply to the question what would they like to see less emphasis on, 70 per cent said there should be less emphasis on Irish.  Among the continental languages, German came out on top.  Eighty-two per cent of parents favoured the introduction of continental languages in national schools.  Eighty-six per cent wanted inspectors' reports on schools made available to parents to help them in choosing between schools and 78 per cent favoured a nationally reorganised test in reading, writing and arithmetic at the age of ten which I have already referred to.  Those findings are interesting and I would like the Minister's comments thereon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I will come back to some of the other points the Minister made in her speech in a few moments but in the short time available to me I would like to list a few points which I think are important in evaluating the Minister's speech.  The test I have always brought to the Minister's speeches on education is a fundamental one.  I always say to myself, and have in this Dáil &mdash; the record shows this &mdash;&ldquo;what has the Minister done or what will <Col N="493" /> the Minister do that will change education in terms of the three criteria of access, control and curriculum?&rdquo;  It is this test that I bring to her speech today. What is in this speech which will improve the quality of participation at primary level, secondary level and at third level where the most glaring discrepancies exist and which is forced by the externals in the educational environment to be simply a reproduction system for the professional classes.  What I mean by the question of control is even more interesting and has been advanced during the past year when it transpired there was no legal basis for the Minister's administrative actions, the absence of a basic Act which could justify procedures within her Department.  When she is replying to Deputy Bruton's survey on public attitudes in, perhaps, County Meath&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Meath, no perhaps about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought they indicated a certain local flavour.  When replying I hope she will be able to tell us when she will publish the opinion delivered to her officials.  While the legal basis is there under the Ministers and Secretaries Act of the twenties for there to be an office of Minister for Education and an incumbent to occupy it, in terms of the old Commissioners for Education who were never abolished when the State was taken over and who died away, meeting as they did up to the end until there were not enough of them to form a quorum, does the Minister propose to re-establish this office and go back to some integrated system or does she propose to bring in some correct legal basis for the administrative ministerial actions of the Department in her period in office?  I wish her well in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of a basic education Act will undoubtedly surface because it is needed and no casuistry from the entrails of the Department of Education that some vague concept of principles of continuity will act as an adequate alternative to education and educational powers will hide that fact.  The OECD report argues <Col N="494" /> from principles of continuity.  Translated into lay language, however, this means that because no one has challenged it legally we will continue in the same way and the principles of continuity will be used as a substitute.</P>
    <P>I said my third point is in relation to the curriculum.  What have been the achievements this year?  The review body have reported in this connection and there is a need for a discussion on the curriculum.  Having listened to the speeches of the Minister and Deputy Bruton I can see a greater need than ever before for discussion because the question about the debate of the curriculum is one of the fundamental issues in education.  As I listened this morning I could see that people are responding to the immediacy of the external environment of education.  In County Meath an overwhelming number of people want their children taught German and they are upset about the amount of time spent on Irish.  The Minister spoke about other things in her speech but, to her credit, not in the same utilitarian vein.  Having said that, I should like to take up in a positive way the remarks of Deputy Bruton.  Is our educational system to be the consequence of fashion or of opinions expressed at one time in one county? The point about it is that despite all the reports the curriculum has not been adequately debated here.</P>
    <P>The Minister's preparations are ready in regard to political and social studies on the curriculum.  This work took two years and the report was placed on her desk. She had only to say yes but she decided to say no.  Of course the advice to her was that there was too much emphasis on rights and not enough on duties.  That is why the subject is not taught at second level, reflecting once again an external of the educational environment, the authoritarianism of our society and the absence of desire to create effective citizenship by participation in our institutions. This side of the House is perfectly entitled to make a case for the teaching of any subject and I see the arguments in the wider context of the more general <Col N="495" /> exclusions of society.  In terms of access I do not see any positive proposals.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the idea of allowing the long-term unemployed to return to education by means of a voucher system.  This is not new and there was a much better proposal about ten years ago which was much more interesting in many ways because it saw a certain amount of educational rights accruing to the citizen which you acquired from being born in the country and you could use at any time of your life to level the disability of access.  It had the advantage that you could go back into the educational system and form the core of your educational experience rather than purchasing educational bits and pieces here and there in the marketplace.  While there are many good teachers in that area there is a fair component of chancers who are selling dubious skills to those who are forced to purchase them.  In this regard the conditions are far from a true market.</P>
    <P>Those of us who speak about education must be concerned about its core.  Everyone seems to know what people in the street feel about the education of their children.  I have been dealing with parents for a long time and I know there is enormous support for a good general education. When all the fashionable demands are made, again and again parents will come back and say that they are concerned about basic education and they want the core of education made secure for their children.  That is a terribly important point.</P>
    <P>There is a distressing emphasis in the Minister's speech in regard to educational policy &mdash; where I can find it &mdash; which seems to be entirely congruent with some notions of demographic change.  Of all criteria in assessing the demands for education, demographic trends are selected and given primacy.  The Minister cannot say she is structuring her educational proposals on the basis of a particular age group at any one time.  That could be done in terms of volumes of teaching allocation in many ways but the way to include it in a speech is to outline the aims in regard to what it is proposed <Col N="496" /> to protect in education and then expand. It could then be said, in so far as these demands are indicated by the pressure of numbers, that they will be catered for.  It is a most serious misplacement of emphasis to take the demographic trends and make them the primary criterion by which we are to judge the adequacy of educational provision over the years to come.</P>
    <P>Transport, the Gaeltacht, the Irish language and teaching through Irish have disappeared. There is no reference to them in the Minister's speech.  It is perfectly clear that there will be a crisis before the end of this year in relation to the school transport system.  I raised this matter with the Minister when she proposed the privatisation of school transport on a pilot basis, to be later extended.  I welcomed it but she decided to postpone the proposal. The money allocated is totally inadequate for the contractor &mdash; Bus Éireann &mdash; to supply a proper service.  The other way to provide the money is to increase the charge to parents for access to the transport service.  If the service is privatised, what are the knock-on effects for Bus Éireann?</P>
    <P>Parents are sick to death of being excluded from involvement in education. The public and parents want to know what will happen in relation to Carysfort. They want an end to the quasi-legal, nonparliamentary arrangements that have evolved in the Department of Education ranging from the deed of trust of different schools and so forth from which parliamentarians are excluded from examining.</P>
    <P>Where is there a reference in the Minister's speech to the implementation on a trial basis of a psychological service?  That could be done using the resources adequately&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Good.  There has been chaois in regard to the textbook provision in the new junior curriculum.  The Minister said she was favourably examining the question of the State taking on the responsibility for providing a library system in schools which, in deprived areas, would remove from children living in poorer areas the burden of buying an endless number of school books.  That should have been done because we know that before the Dáil resumes the children will have returned to school but some will have to wait a further six weeks because of the cost of books.  What has happened to that proposal?  Why was the syllabus for the junior cycle not available in Irish for those who wanted to teach Irish? What is happening about text books? There was no reference to them in the Minister's speech.</P>
      <P>Parents say to us all that we should make the educational system strong within core educational principles and then adapt to the environmental need in terms of demography.  Parents are sick to their bellies about the notion of free education because there is nothing free about it.  The absence of adequate public provision for education is creating intolerable difficulties for poor families.  It is also affecting the question of access.</P>
      <P>I welcome the reference in the Minister's speech to the decision to increase the provision for mature women students and I would like to hear details of how that scheme will be implemented.  I was delighted to hear the reference to gender and to the question of gender equality. There is no better place to begin that than in the Minister's Department.  She should look at the Department's pyramid in terms of who is in charge of senior positions, from senior inspector up. Where are the women?  The fact is that there is no more notoriously sexist Department in terms of the large number of women national teachers at the bottom and their exclusion from decision making at the top.  The Department is authoritarian, jaded, old, sexist and patriarchal. I will have other opportunities of drawing comparisons with that Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="498" /> There were some interesting points mentioned in the speech by Deputy Bruton in relation to trades.  I should like the Minister to tell the House the consequences of the confusion that has arisen in relation to sponsored apprenticeships, of the amount of money removed from poor families because many of the so-called sponsorships, for example in the area of mechanics, are not real and are not proceeded with, with the result that the European Community do not give any money towards them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the anger that came through in Deputy Higgin's speech.  I do not know about other Members but during the recent election campaign it was my experience that the education issue was at least on a par with the health cuts as the major issues.  I accept that the media took on the health cuts as the major issue and that it was difficult to get through with any other issue.  Certainly, I pointed out to the newspaper correspondents I met the seriousness of the education issue as we were encountering it on the doorsteps and I am sure other candidates highlighted that issue, too.  In the centres of growing population the education issue was on a higher plain than the anger over the health cuts.  The lack of proper education for children, the condition of local schools and the amount of money parents have to pay to keep schools running were raised on every doorstep and proved to be major issues in the campaign. I am disappointed that those complaints were not taken on board by the Minister.  The health cutbacks were taken on board by the Taoiseach and, presumably, by the Minister for Health, but there has not been any hint in the speech by the Minister for Education of a change in her attitude.  We have the same Minister as we had in the last two years but it appears that she is intent on pursuing the same policy.  We have not had any <Col N="499" /> indication of new thinking in that Department. Her speech was most disappointing. Obviously, her past is her present as far as her thinking is concerned. She has been put into a groove by the same officials in the Department that Deputy Higgins referred to.  Many of the ideas that have been pushed on the Minister have been in the Department for years.  I should like to ask her to have another look at the advice being given to her.</P>
      <P>The Minister had the gall to refer to disadvantaged areas.  I thought she would have avoided that issue because the programme for Government states that the Government recognise the importance of the education systen in the promotion of equity in our society and that they will ensure, in implementing whatever adjustments are necessary in that sector because of financial considerations &mdash; in other words the cutbacks &mdash; that the burden of adjustment does not fall on the disadvantaged.  The programme does not say that the burden will not fall as heavily on the disadvantaged but that it will not fall on them.  In fact, the reverse has happened in that the great burden of the cutbacks has fallen on disadvantaged areas and on pupils attending schools in those areas.  Remedial teaching is out. No new remedial teachers have been appointed in the last three years.  The school psychological service has been wiped out, forgotten about while the pupil/teacher ratio has increased.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us that funds have been made available each year to schools to assist necessitous pupils in the purchase of schoolbooks but that amounts to £1.50 per pupil.  The Minister should recognise that in Northern Ireland, what is called the unfree part of our country, the allowance for schoolbooks ranges from £26.60 Stg. to £43.25 Stg.  That is between 20 and 30 times higher than the allowance for schoolbooks here.  The system of payment for schoolbooks is the most outrageous in our so-called free education system.  The new certificate will mean that a whole range of new books will have to be purchased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> Of course, we should remember that parents have to pay for more than school books in our so-called free primary education system.  A survey undertaken two years ago by <i>The Irish People</i>, the newspaper of The Workers' Party, showed that an average family with three schoolgoing children faced an annual bill of £330 for school clothing, books and materials.  It was pointed out that parents have to pay what is called a voluntary contribution on a regular basis.  Weekly, certainly monthly, children are given a note for their parents requesting an extra £5 or £10 and when the children return to school they are asked during class time if they have brought in the money.  That amounts to blackmail.  Parents are being forced to find the money in order to save their children embarrassment in front of their class.  I have no doubt that the figure of £330 has risen to £400 since the survey was carried out.</P>
    <P>Parents, for the sake of their children, will find the money but they will do so by depriving themselves or by resorting to borrowing from a credit union or a moneylender.  Parents will do the best for their children and the best thing they can give them is a good education.  They will do everything possible to give that to them.  Parents who are in receipt of £90 per week in social welfare benefits must deprive themselves of certain things if they are to pay the voluntary subscriptions to the schools.  By doing so they are covering up the real nature of the cutbacks in our schools.  If the schools had not got this assistance from the parents there would be no heating in the classrooms, the buildings would be run down and there would be no caretakers to look after the schools.  This is in addition to the provision of books, classroom materials, clothing for school children, etc.  Schools in disadvantaged areas have suffered the major element of the cutbacks.  So far as education is concerned the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has been an absolute disaster, a total hypocritical statement from beginning to end with regard to primary, second level and third level education. There are only three paragraphs in the <Col N="501" /> programme dealing with education but very specific statements are made in them, all of which have turned out to be lies and have not been adhered to by the Government.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> states:</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to encourage and foster the participation of the disadvantaged at all levels of education.  A particular area of focus will be to encourage more second-level pupils to complete the senior cycle.  It is considered that this will be a key factor in encouraging more working class children to advance to third-level education.</P>
    <P>Everybody who have looked at the situation recognise that we have gone backwards. The Clancy report must surely be an indication to the Minister of what is happening in this area.  Not alone have pupils not been able to get third level education but second level education has been run down because schools are not being built.  Many schools are without adequate accommodation and pupils spend most of their time travelling to and from schools in other areas.  Schools are not being built yet we are told that the Government propose to &ldquo;foster the participation of the disadvantaged at all levels of education&rdquo; and to &ldquo;encourage more second level pupils to complete the senior cycle&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the review of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the teacher unions should show up the lack of effect of the decisions made in that programme and ensure that there will be a complete change of policy in the education area by the Department of Education and the Minister in any future programme, if there is one.</P>
    <P>I must say with regard to the unions that the only union who have consistently fought on behalf of the parents and children in their areas are the Teachers Union of Ireland who have spent their money in advertising campaigns about what is happening.  Thomas Davis said,&ldquo;educate that you may be free&rdquo;.  Of course, the reverse is to keep people uneducated so that you can keep them enslaved.  A very <Col N="502" /> interesting poster campaign which was run a year or 18 months ago referred to &ldquo;the politics of ignorance&rdquo;.  Many people may not have understood the importance and meaning of that slogan but I believe it is a policy which has been carried out consistently by Government after Government here.  They do not want the working class people to be educated in case they become free.  The working class are beginning to understand the true meaning of freedom and what education can do for them and their children.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with primary education and the lack of remedial teaching psychological services, the upkeep of schools, the number of teachers and so on.  I should have mentioned a specific issue because I have been repeatedly in touch with the Minister about it.  This relates to St. Peter the Apostle junior school in Neilstown, Clondalkin.  This is a new area and the number of pupils there will increase each year over the next number of years.  However, because of the numbers in the school last year the Minister decided that two teaching posts would be cut from September next.  This school is in a major disadvantaged area, yet in September the number of pupils at the school will have increased.</P>
    <P>I will use the few minutes I have left to refer to vocational education.  The VEC system has come under particular attack from the Minister.  It has come under attack from the Department of Education who had already begun that attack under the previous Minister and who had a policy laid down before the Minister came into office &mdash; a policy to dismantle the VEC system.  This began by increasing the pupil-teacher ratio in VEC schools to the same level as that in secondary fee-paying schools.  I had a major disagreement with the Secretary of the ASTI, Kieran Mulvey, who was then a member of The Workers' Party, on the question of attempting to equate the pupil-teacher ratio in VEC schools with that in private fee-paying schools.  The VEC schools are non-selective: they take in anybody and give them an education. They do not select the best pupils. Because they teach practical subjects <Col N="503" /> they need more remedial teachers and should have fewer pupils per teacher in practical classes.  There was no basis for the policy pursued by the Minister yet she pushed it through and has run down the VEC system.  I would ask the Minister to look again at the policy being devised by her Department and, in particular, to have regard to the VEC system and the whole remedial system in primary schools.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, on her reappointment as Minister for Education. I should like to pay tribute to her for the very fine job she did as Minister for Education over the past two and a half years.  I must say that it was an exhilarating experience to have had her as a boss.  I have seen at first hand the very <Col N="504" /> fine work she has done for Irish education in that very difficult period of financial cutbacks.  I look forward with much anticipation to a great era for education in the next number of years under the Minister's stewardship.  Hopefully we will not have to apply the same level of financial constraints as have applied up to now.</P>
      <P>I want to outline some of the areas where her innovation led to significant progress over the past two and a half years, areas where the Minister asked me to undertake some objectives for her. One of those was in the area of the Irish language.</P>
      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom a rá nach n-aontaím leis an méid a dúirt an Teachta Higgins faoin iarracht atá á déanamh sa Roinn Oideachais chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn. Tá an-iarracht á déanamh agus, ar ndóigh, tá dul chun cinn maith déanta, maidir leis an Ghaeilge sa Roinn, go háirithe i leith an teanga a chur chun cinn.  Tá sé sóiléir anois trí na scoileanna ar gach léibheál go bhfuil gach iarracht á déanamh chun labhairt na teanga a spreagadh.  Chomh maith leis sin tá dul chun cinn mór déanta trín siollabus nua feabhas a chur ar staid na Gaeilge i gcaoi is go mbeimid in ann gach ábhar a mhúineadh trí Ghaeilge.  Glacaim go bhfuil deacrachtaí againn san aidhm sin, go háirithe i léith téachsleabhair a chur ar fáil, ach táimid ag déanamh ár ndícheall leigheas a fháil air sin.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with the question of school transport, particularly with the more pressing problem of the special schools transport which has been probably the greatest area of difficulty we have had to encounter in the Department over the past two years.  We accept that there have been major problems for the parents of special school children because of the diverse nature of their locations in regard to the schools they attend.  Often grave difficulties were encountered as they are still, by the parents of special school children because of the long distances that had to be travelled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the request of the Minister I initiated an in-depth review of the operation and financing of the present school transport arrangements in so far as they <Col N="505" /> affect mentally and physically handicapped students.  This review will be completed by the commencement of the coming academic year.  I hope the recommendations for the improvement of the service &mdash; greater co-operation and flexibility between the various bodies involved in providing this service &mdash; will be taken on board.  As I have outlined, the key problem in regard to that service is that students attending special school centres do not live in just the area.  In co-operation with some of the schools involved, with CIE and the voluntary agencies we have attempted to devise a new system under which there would be greater flexibility and involvement all round to ensure that as many as possible special students can be picked up at their homes in the morning and returned there in the evening.  It is a difficult problem which could be easily resolved if one were to throw money at it, which is something we do not have.  We are most anxious to continue to make progress in this regard, as we have endeavoured to do to date.</P>
    <P>The Minister herself will deal with the overall question of school transport.  Now that I am no longer Minister of State at the Department of Education &mdash; being, as it were, in limbo&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a personal comment about the school transport issue.  I suppose it must be the bane of every politician's life.  Before I became involved in the Department of Education, like every other public representative, I wondered what in the name of goodness were they doing in that Department about school transport?  Since I have become involved intimately with the problem I have seen and understood the complexity of the issue.  I make a personal statement when I say there is no doubt in my mind that the privatisation, to some degree, of the schools transport system will make for a more efficient, much better and cheaper school transport system.  I hope that one of the initiatives the Minister will revive will be the pilot project for such privatisation.  It simply <Col N="506" /> does not make economic sense, no more than it makes any kind of common sense, to have buses being driven into a school centre in the morning, being driven back to drivers' homes, returning in the evening while, at the same time, school principles must hire private buses to take school teams to matches and so on.  It does not make sense that such school buses should remain idle from 4 o'clock in the afternoon until the following morning while there are community needs remaining to be served.  Having dealt with this problem for two and a half years there is no doubt in my mind that the pilot project on privatisation of school transport should go ahead.  We could then ascertain whether many people's views on the issue are correct.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to CIE, particularly the CIE unions, to become involved in this process.  There is no reason drivers and CIE buses cannot be involved in this pilot project.  There is no doubt in my mind that if that were the case we would have then a better transport system, with those buses being used during the school day for the curricular purposes of the schools and used again for the benefit of the community in after-school hours.</P>
      <P>I want to turn now to the other two areas in respect of which I had special responsibility during the past two years, youth and sport.  I am very pleased at the progress made in the Department in regard to the development of both.  I should like to draw the attention of the House first to the next phase of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> where, very clearly and for the first time ever in Government policy, there is a clear commitment to major expenditure on the promotion of sport, where it is said that Fianna Fáil will create a national sports centre at a minimum cost to the Exchequer of £35 million, will spend £11.6 million on six regional centres around the country and a further £5.3 million on further local sports facilities around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard, the Government have already made progress on the acquisition of a 12-acre site adjacent to the new <Col N="507" /> Financial Services Centre on the Custom House Docks site.  The site acquisition is well underway.  Approximately £1 million has been spent on the acquisition of the land in 1988.  An amount of £87,000 has already been spent this year and terms have been agreed for the expenditure of an additional £1.4 million on the acquisition of this land.  The steering committee appointed by the Minister to oversee the project have now finalised their recommendation on the method and basis on which tenders should be invited for the design and construction of the centre which will be submitted to the Government shortly.</P>
    <P>This building is of a scale and complexity that, even in international terms, places it at the frontier of development in so far as indoor sports facilities are concerned.  The necessity for careful preplanning in the case of a project of this type unfortunately results in slower than desired progress at the early stages.  Notwithstanding that, with Government approval, actual construction of the centre could be under way next year.  I should emphasise that the time spent will be more than adequately justified when the actual announcement with regard to procedure is made.  It will amount to one of the most exciting enterprises ever entered into in this country, involving both public and private sectors.  We will have a facility of which we will be proud, one which will be economically viable, the most important consideration.</P>
    <P>In regard to the regional centres, again delays have occurred.  I stand over those delays fully because, at the end of the day, we must construct sport centres that are economically viable, that will not be white elephants but utilised to the full.  I have undertaken a much longer period of preparation and planning to ensure that those facilities match the requirements of our people and will not constitute a drain on the Exchequer on completion.</P>
    <P>There are at present sports centres around the country costing the taxpayer a fortune.  For example, there are two swimming pools in Cork which to maintain open last year cost Cork Corporation <Col N="508" /> £180,000 in one case and £120,000 in the other.  There is a pool in Cobh, whose reopening I recently initiated, which was open for two months of the year only &mdash; it is eight years only in existence &mdash; and that at a cost of £22,000 to Cork Corporation and Cobh UDC.  We cannot continue that kind of management and planning.</P>
    <P>There is a clear commitment in the document I have quoted to the expenditure of money on those centres.  The time taken in their planning and preparation will ensure that when they are built we get them right.  I want to challenge Fine Gael especially to tell me whether it is still their policy to take away £30 million from the national lottery for that purpose and, if it is, whether they will accept that that means scrubbing completely the policy and programme for the creation of sports facilities, national, regional and local.  If they take away the amount of money from the national lottery they promised to do in the course of the general election they must realise they will be taking away the £11.6 million, the £5.3 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This will enable us to continue with the wonderful work being done with regard to disadvantaged young people.  More than 50 per cent of the money spent in the past few years has gone specifically to the most deprived and underprivileged young people in our community.  We have initiated new projects &mdash; new programmes with people like Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy, Peter McVerry and many others.  For the first time we have a major programme which involves five different Departments operated under an interdepartmental committee tackling once and for all the problems of disadvantaged young people from their perspective, rather than from that of any one Department or agency.  It has been a major success and I am very proud and privileged to be involved with that.</P>
      <P>Let me say again that if the proposal to switch money from the lottery into health were to be put in place, all that work would be brought to an end.

This Government are committed to the continuation of this programme in youth affairs, and I am proud to say so.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that Deputy Fahey cannot wait to hear my reply to what he said here, which was grossly unfair.  The impression given this morning was that all is well in education but, unfortunately, that is not the case, as the Minister well knows.  At the moment she is concerned more with reviews than with the real problems which exist in education.  She has announced seven reviews today.  As a result of her term in office we have now an unacceptably high number of larger classes, loss of subjects for students, shortening of the school week, lack of materials for essential subjects, such as woodwork and metal work, lack of remedial and guidance services because staff are being forced back into the classroom, etc.  Students have been denied the services of remedial teachers and counselling because these people are now being deployed in other areas.  That is the scenario and there is no way we can deny that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education in many fields, especially with regard to the disadvantaged, is being threatened.  Those involved in education &mdash; and I am a member of a vocational <Col N="512" /> education committee &mdash; are totally disillusioned, frustrated and disenchanted with what has happened.  At meeting after meeting we are faced with further problems, such as caretakers not being replaced, teachers not being replaced and so forth.  In times of financial stringency I agree that one must make cuts somewhere, but it is the concern of my party and myself that these cuts do not fall on the disadvantaged, on the people to whom we referred this morning, which seems to be happening.  I shall refer first to the cuts in primary, secondary and third level school building.  There has been a cut of 18 per cent in primary school building, 21 per cent in secondary school building and a cut of 29 per cent at third level in the provision of grants for regional colleges.  The outcome is that children will continue to have to attend school in inadequate, dilapidated accommodation. The Minister knows that well. Because of the increase in the pupil-teacher ratio, there are larger class sizes. Classes have to be taken in cloakrooms and in the school halls.  That is totally unacceptable to pupils, parents and teachers.</P>
    <P>The Government in their 1987 programme for office gave a commitment in Thurles, Castlebar, Dún Laoghaire and other centres around the country &mdash; and I would probably disagree with Deputy Bruton in this &mdash; to provide regional colleges. It is my opinion that regional colleges are essential, not alone in providing education but they could become the centres of regions especially as we approach Europe and the whole aspect of regionalisation. The colleges could become centres for the regions both for education and other usage.</P>
    <P>The staffing budget for RTCs has been cut by 5 per cent this year.  It will be very difficult if not impossible to increase the throughput of these colleges if there are fewer staff.  I would also like to refer to the provision for the school transport service which has been reduced by £5.7 million.  The Minister made no reference to how she will provide a school transport system having regard to that cut.  How does she propose to run a service with <Col N="513" /> £5.7 million less than was available before?</P>
    <P>As I said, it is unfortunate that Deputy Fahey is not present to hear what I have to say.  Over the last two weeks the North-South exchange programme has been discontinued. This was funded by the Department of Education and it fostered community relations between North and South.  The discontinuance of this programme is very unfortunate and is a retrograde step in North-South relations.  I would like you, Minister, to reply to that point.  Also, funding for political education officers has been scrapped &mdash; and your own party, Minister, will be affected.</P>

      <P>With regard to projects for the disadvantaged, Deputy Fahey made a great song and dance about this here today.  They have been guaranteed only for the September-December <Col N="514" /> period.  The people involved have been given to commitment whatsoever in regard to what is going to happen next year.  The fear among the youth at the moment is that some of these projects will be discontinued altogether.  Could the Minister reply to that point?</P>
      <P>In the Fianna Fáil election manifesto it was announced that funding for the youth movement this year would be £8 million.  That was the first indication that the youth movement received that funding was being reduced from £10 million to £8 million.  What programmes will suffer as a result of the shortfall of £2 million?  The wish of all the people involved in the youth movement is that the core funding for the youth services should be put back into Exchequer funding and not the national lottery.  They want the core funding which had previously been provided, which was £3.5 million, to be put back into Exchequer funding.</P>
      <P>They are a few points to which I would like the Minister to reply if she gets an opportunity.  Has the Minister got agreement with the unions regarding the operation of the new junior certificate?  In the rationalisation of VECs, does the Minister intend to have local education authorities as announced in the <i>Programme for Action in Education</i>?  Will the RTCs be inside or outside the VEC system? Finally, and I do not want to be too parochial, the Minister may remember that I was on a deputation to her regarding the Listowel vocational school and we accepted a scaled down version of the original plans.  Perhaps she could expedite the provision of money for that school.</P>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on being reappointed to the Department of Education.</P>

      <P>May I mention briefly to the Minister in the two minutes I have &mdash; this is unfortunate because I will not praise her but I will not bury her either &mdash; the step she took in relation to the public-teacher ratio in primary education which was the worst since 1831?  I have heard all the discussions and I have heard experts on education.  There are several things that we can do in education but we cannot expect teachers to teach an uncontrollable number.  Once the number of pupils exceeds 30 one is fighting a losing battle.  There is no doubt that with a maximum of 39 pupils in a class, the Minister is asking the impossible.  I am not worried about the intelligent children. They will survive; some would say they will survive in spite of teachers.  I am talking about the weaker children who need to be helped.  Many of our problems would be sorted out early in life if we had a reasonable number in our classrooms. That is something I will be referring to at a later date.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to two or three other items.  I hope the Minister will help the younger skilled teachers who are so skilled and protect their salaries and conditions. I cannot understand how the temporary teachers at second level who are to be paid in October are expected to do the impossible once more, to live on fresh air, because the Department of Social Welfare will not agree with the Minister. I hope the Minister looks at this issue too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of problems with third level grants.  It is a cause of major controversy that some people outside the <Col N="516" /> PAYE system are able to devise a scheme where they can get grants.  I hope the Minister will deal with this.  In fairness to my colleague who must have 30 seconds left, I will deal with education in detail at greater length on another occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly worth my while standing up, but there are a few points I wanted to mention even though they may have been already covered.  Like Deputy Browne I was involved in the delivery of the education service for a number of years and I am well aware of some of the drawbacks we are facing in that system at present.  It has been mentioned many times, and it must be reiterated, that the remedial service in our schools is completely inadequate.  Some 10 per cent of our students are in the remedial classification. The Minister is making provision for these students in areas of severe disadvantage but, of course, these students are not to be found solely in those areas.  In many smaller schools in rural Ireland there is no professional service available for these students.  I suggest that the Minister should try to group schools, whether on a county basis or on a sub-county basis.  In a school with, for example, 100 students, it is likely that ten could be classified as remedial.  It is impossible for one teacher, taking fourth, fifth and sixth classes and trying to provide basic control, to provide assistance for these students at the same time.  That disadvantage is then carried into post-primary school where the study of any discipline at that stage implies that a student must be able to read.  Students who cannot read obviously cannot benefit from that kind of set up.  When they approach examinations, all the questions are literary and they are unable to handle them, and so they are at a desperate and very serious disadvantage.  The Minister will have to take cognisance of the fact that students all over rural Ireland are suffering severe disadvantage in this area.  Indeed, one would have to say that equality of opportunity is much more an <Col N="517" /> aspiration today than it has been heretofore. That is one example of what has happened.  Larger classes hurt everybody.</P>
      <P>The new junior cycle programme is welcome.  Most teachers were demanding it for years but they are not too happy that it is in the offing in September.</P>

      <P>They are not too happy and the Minister knows that because there was furore last Easter.  The provision which the Minister made for inservice training was inadequate.  Teachers had an opportunity of getting together for one day, but it was no good.  Proper induction is necessary.  Everybody agrees the programme is required, but the induction of teachers is absolutely inadequate and it would be a shame&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the last speaker I would have been willing to allow him to continue for the remaining minutes particularly as he was making his maiden speech but, of course, I must be subservient to the Chair's wise decision. I have three minutes left.  Quite simply it would be impossible to reply to six pages of comments in three minutes.</P>
      <P>First, I thank all the participants for the various points which they made. Deputy J. Bruton, representing the Fine Gael Party, spoke about the early drop outs and the need to recognise them about middle way throughout the primary system and the need for external testing.  Much of what he said struck a chord with me.  We will await the curriculum review in November.  He also referred to the reduction in the pupilteacher ratio, parental interaction and home/school contact.  He wanted the Minister for Education to be responsible for training programmes, especially those coming within the ambit of the FÁS agency, and spoke about the idea of education vouchers, the need for greater oral components in language teaching, the Canadian system of teacher assessment throughout a child's period in school and the use of existing facilities rather than building costly third level facilities when existing facilities could be used throughout the year.  Last year he Kindly sent me a survey which I read with great interest at the time.  Please, accept that I am not patronising Deputy Bruton but I find his ideas excellent.  I have always read and listened to what he said on educational matters.  Quite obviously he has not just an informed but a very deep interest in the whole subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy M. Higgins, representing the Labour Party, talked about the need for <Col N="519" /> an education Act &mdash; we will know if that is recommended in the autumn &mdash; the need for political and social studies, the need for a genuine curriculum debate and the wish &mdash; which came through to him from parents &mdash; that there would be a basic core of good general education for children.  I could not agree with him more on that.  He found fault with my deliberations on the demographic changes.  It seems rather odd; if I do not plan for changes I am criticised and if I do I am criticised.  I cannot win.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to parental involvement.  I am glad to inform him that the psychological services were referred to in my speech but perhaps he did not note them because I had to hurry through certain sections.  Beginning in September we will have the setting up of the long awaited &mdash; 15 years &mdash; pilot projects, spanning many Governments in the schools psychological service.  It remains for the two areas to be chosen. There will be a three year pilot project, which will be evaluated and monitored along the way.  He welcomed the mature women's student grant.  I take issue with him, and like Lady Galahad, I rise to support my Department.  They are not jaded, chauvinistic, sexist and authoritarian.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla said that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was lies &mdash; that was the word he used.  Let me put on the record that it certainly is not lies and I decry the use of the word.  Often debates of this kind are fora for hyperbole in one shape or another.  His regard for the VEC system is well known and I share it.  Beginning in September 90 per cent of students in third level colleges will be in receipt of full funding which we have been able to arrange between our Department and Europe.  Whatever dispute is between The Workers' Party and the general secretary of one of the teachers unions is not a matter for debate here, but is a matter between themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan took issue with Deputy Frank Fahey.  May I explain that Deputy Fahey had an appointment, which I knew about earlier, and had to leave.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> Deputy Deenihan talked about school building.  The method by which I have gone about the school building programme has been very costly but we have managed to build a number of them. There was no need for what was going on at primary schools.  We are building more schools now than when we had double the budget because we provide slimmed down versions &mdash; decent classrooms, decent toilets and decent yards.  That is what is required.  I provided 60 last year, 60 this year and I hope to provide 60 next year.  Before I finish in the Department I hope to have wiped out the primary school building problem.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there remains a problem at second level and I have to tackle it.  I do not have the information on the North-South exchange programmes but I will get the information for the Deputy.  I checked the funding of political parties following the media reports at the weekend.  The youth development officers &mdash; or whatever their title &mdash; were brought into the Department and asked to give an account of what they are doing with the money.  It is as simple as that. Surely one can ask for an account of where the money is going and what it is achieving.  We want to see if the title &ldquo;education officer&rdquo; in the various political parties is being adhered to.  We are asking these officers to account for their movements and the money they are getting. The Deputy suggested that the £3.5 million should go back into the ordinary budgetary allocation.  I do not hold out much hope of that happening.  We are very glad to have the increased allocation from the national lottery.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Browne, an old friend of mine from Seanad days, referred to the pupil-teacher ratio, and said he will be watching developments.  So will we, and we have given a commitment to that end. We have set up a forum for the temporary teachers in the primary schools and in the post-primary schools and the problem is almost solved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cotter referred to remedial teachers and that too will engage my attention.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to ascertain from the Taoiseach whether there is any intention to have a full meeting with the British Prime Minister &mdash; I am not referring to these ten minute jobs on the margin of the European Council.  My recollection is that the present Taoiseach has not had such a meeting with the UK Prime Minister in either London or Dublin since 1982.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the Taoiseach taking office early in 1987 there was a standard arrangement whereby his predecessor and the UK Prime Minister met regularly either in London or Dublin.  It was my understanding that it was the intention of the present Taoiseach to continue that arrangement but that has not been done.  I would like to know why it has not been done, whether there is any intention to re-establish that arrangement and, if not, is it because the Taoiseach has nothing to say in relation to Anglo-Irish affairs or the problems in Northern Ireland?  Is he putting the relationship between the UK and Ireland, in particular in so far as it affects Northern Ireland, into a deep freeze?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no particular arrangement that has been set aside or that is not being adhered to.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has said that he would hold such a meeting if he felt it were either necessary or beneficial. I understand from that that it is the Taoiseach's view at the moment that such a meeting would be neither necessary nor beneficial.  If that is the case, why is he of that view?  Why would it not be beneficial or necessary to meet Mrs. Thatcher at this point?</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows as well as I do that having meetings just for the sake of it can be unhelpful.  Meetings of that kind, if they are scheduled and stated to be of a major nature, would arouse expectations and perhaps subsequently disappointment.  Unless there was a specific reason for a major meeting, I do not think there is any pressure for <Col N="526" /> holding such a meeting.  As I said, the six monthly meetings afford us an opportunity of dealing with anything of importance that arises.  Certainly if there was a need for a major meeting it would arise during the course of those Council meetings. Many of the matters that might normally have been dealt with in previous years at meetings between Prime Ministers are now the subject of these on-going discussions within the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>

My question was in relation to having a joint Oireachtas committee because it is imperative that both Houses of the Oireachtas be involved in foreign affairs and have the advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs on this very important item.  The Taoiseach should be aware that the Seanad has already passed a resolution requesting the Government to set up such a committee. Different views have been expressed by Fine Gael people and the Taoiseach's own party in and out of Government in the other House on this very subject.  It is imperative that we know the Taoiseach's views about when the Government will agree to set this up either in consultation with the party leaders as he has suggested or in association with the Whips of this House or whatever procedure.

I suggest that he should look very carefully at the arrangements he makes this time.  I can tell him quite emphatically that the arrangement last time did not work.  I am quite sure that he regards the issues of women's rights as central and I would ask him to consider this point.  Many women's organisations did not believe the last arrangement worked.  I would ask the Taoiseach to consider the Fine Gael proposal prior to the election to make the Government responsive in the area of women's affairs. It might be appropriate to give responsibility to the Minister for Labour.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>Article 4 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement states that both the Irish and the British Governments recognise that devolution can be achieved only with the co-operation of constitutional representatives within Northern Ireland of both traditions there.  The Review of the Working of the Conference carried out by both Governments and published last May, states:</P>
      <P>It continues to be the British Government's policy, supported by the Irish Government, to encourage progress towards the devolution of responsibility for certain powers to elected representatives in Northern Ireland as set out in Article 4 of the Agreement.  Both sides recognise that the achievement of devolution depends on the co-operation of constitutional representatives of both traditions within Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's <Col N="538" /> reply, his position has changed in a significant way from the statement he made to this House some months ago when he said that he had no particular interest in devolution in Northern Ireland.  Why does the programme for Government published last Thursday by the two parties in Government make no specific reference to devolution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said what the Deputy now quotes me as having said.  I have been at great pains in the House on a number of occasions to explain my attitude and policy in regard to devolution. I have just given the House an outline of the exact factual position with regard to devolution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach indicate whether the programme for Government agreed between his party and the Progressive Democrats includes intensive work in relation to devolved Government?  The programme indicates that intensive work will continue in areas of fundamental importance to the people of Northern Ireland, including the administration of justice and relations with the security forces.  Does this intensive work include assisting parties in Northern Ireland to reach a position where they can form a devolved Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is governed by the Anglo-Irish Agreement and more recently by the review.  In all our documents support for and determination to work the processes of the Anglo-Irish Agreement figure quite prominently.  That is the position.  We are committed to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, Article 4 of which sets out very clearly the position in regard to devolution.</P>

      <P>While I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, I will get the reference for his statement in this House that he had no particular interest in devolution in Northern Ireland.

      <P>I cannot do any more than repeat what I said in my reply.  Article 4 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement states that both the Irish and the British Governments recognise that devolution can be achieved only with the co-operation of constitutional representatives within Northern Ireland of both traditions there.  The recent review states:</P>
      <P>It continues to be the British Government's policy, supported by the Irish Government, to encourage progress towards the devolution of responsibility for certain powers to elected representatives in Northern Ireland as set out in Article 4 of the Agreement.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no change in my position in that regard.  I have given the factual legal position, the Anglo-Irish Agreement position, time and again in this House.  With regard to encouraging people in Northern Ireland as to what they should or should not do, I think that is something that any political leader down here should be very careful about. Sometimes efforts which one might feel inclined to make in regard to any matter in Northern Ireland can be counterproductive because of the very fact that it emanates from here or from somebody down here.  So these are matters which have to be handled very carefully and very sensitively.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to finish my reply, if I may.  In this area, I would very much like to be able to have discussions without preconditions with all the <Col N="541" /> representatives of the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland.  That still remains my position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the Official Unionist Party, the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland and the Social Democratic and Labour Party in Northern Ireland have all published their own views as to what form systems of devolved government should take?  I think the Taoiseach and I would be at one in being somewhat baffled about what the position of the DUP might be, but certainly those other three parties have made it clear that they have particular views on what the shape of devolved government would be.  Would the Taoiseach not think it might be useful if the British and Irish Governments, either together or separately but in concert, were to enter into that discussion in order to encourage those three parties to bring their views of devolved government closer together than they are now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy's analysis.  First of all, I do not agree that there is anything like a major move in the political parties in Northern Ireland towards devolution at present. That is not the sort of report I get on that matter.  Secondly, I would not necessarily agree that some intervention by the Irish Government or even the British Government into the situation would necessarily be beneficial at any particular point in time.  I do not think that necessarily follows. One could advance the argument, and I am sure a number of the representatives of the parties in Northern Ireland would suggest it, that it would be better that the parties there be allowed talk to each other without any outside intervention&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will outline what is meant by the phrase in the new Government's programme &ldquo;to build social consensus into a permanent way of managing our affairs&rdquo;, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The success of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> between the Government and the social partners &mdash; trade unions, employers and farmers' organisations &mdash; and the contribution it has made to economic and social progress since 1987 demonstrates clearly the value of such a consensus approach to managing our affairs.</P>
      <P>The agreed programme for government together with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>National Development Plan</i>, on which the social partners were consulted, will form the basis of Government policy over the next four years.  The Government will fully honour all the commitments entered into with the social partners in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
      <P>The Government are convinced that the consensus approach to managing our affairs is by far the best way to achieve worthwhile progress and will begin discussions with the social partners in the near future to seek a new agreement to succeed the current <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which terminates at the end of 1990.  The Government fully intend, therefore, that this consensus approach should become a permanent way of managing our affairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach is genuinely interested in social consensus, is it his intention to pursue a set of policies in this Government which will be unlike the divisive set of policies pursued in the last Government which, in relation to health, education, housing and social welfare <Col N="543" /> resulted in a two-tier society?  If the Taoiseach is genuinely interested in social consensus, will he pursue different policies in the course of this Government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy understands what happened during the past two and a quarter years and I really wish he would consult more with his colleagues and friends in the trade union movement who have frequently expressed their satisfaction with the level of consensus achieved in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the mechanisms established under that programme.  Quite recently I have had further confirmation of their wish that the mechanisms that are put in place for those consultations should be retained and used to the best advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach does not need reminding that two weeks ago at the annual conference of Congress in Bundoran a resolution was passed by Congress for the setting up of a special conference in six months' time to review the programme which they agreed two years ago with the Taoiseach.  I would assume it would be a natural follow-on from that that further discussions will have to take place.  If the Taoiseach is genuinely interested in a social consensus which cares for all of the people both unemployed and employed, has he any proposals to bring forward whereby this would be put on a statutory basis or is there to be any new Department in his Government to manage this consensus which he is talking about?  We must accept that the progress made in relation to the agreement, the results of which we are all very familiar with in terms of unemployment and emigration, are not going to solve the problems in this country.  If the Taoiseach is talking about social consensus he must try to bring in the people who are now being alienated and are part of our two-tier society.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the biggest threat to social consensus being built into some kind of permanent way of managing our affairs is the unemployment situation and that while that situation continues where more jobs are lost during the term of the programme so far than have been created, this poses a major threat to the possibility of the agreement continuing, not to mention new agreements being renewed?  Does the Taoiseach accept that behind the recent decision of the Congress of trade unions in Bundoran was the concern about unemployment and that it was this concern, above all, that motivated the decision for a special conference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that in my view, and in the view of most impartial observers, and indeed in the view of many of the people who participated on all <Col N="545" /> sides in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> it represented a unique step forward in management of our affairs in that it secured the agreement of the different sides of the economy, farmers, employers, trade unions and Government to agree objectives and work for the achievement of those objectives.  I really think it is very unhelpful to be suggesting that that was not a major improvement in the management of our affairs and that it was not a headline which we should seek to establish in the future, improve on if possible, elaborate on it in any way possible but at least it represents a central principle which did nothing but good for the economy of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will no doubt be aware that I put down similar questions to all other Departments because if one has regard to the vast amount of paper which this House and the various Government Departments generate it surely must be now a feasible project to consider recycling paper within the confines of our own operation for everyday regular use and so set the kind of headline in environmental matters of which the Taoiseach gave fulsome description earlier today when he talked about the Madrid summit and the <Col N="546" /> espousal of environmental protection measures.</P>

This proposal relates to the replacement of customs documentation as the source of statistics of intra-EC movements of goods.  Technical discussions are still in progress between the Commission and the member states on the proposal which involves direct surveys of traders involved in intra-EC trade.  The proposal has been sent to Council by the Commission but it has yet to be considered by a Council working group.</entry>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Cullenswood House Association applied to his Department in March 1988 for funding from the national lottery in order to enable them to undertake the restoration of Cullenswood House, Dublin 6; when a decision will be made on this application; when the moneys will be made available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cullenswood House Association made initial inquiries to the National Heritage Council in February 1989 about assistance towards the restoration of Cullenswood House, Ranelagh, Dublin 6.  The association submitted a formal application to the council in May 1989 for a grant of £230,000.</P>
      <P>I understand that the council, which has complete independence in its assessment of projects, has now notified the association that they are unable to aid this project from the funds available.  The council's assessment of any application is based on the intrinsic, in this case archirectural merit of the project.  They judge this building to be low on any list of priorities of buildings of architectural importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Taoiseach's reply and would point to an inaccurracy in the question in that the date should read May 1989 instead of March 1988.  Having regard not just to the architectural associations and merits of this building but also to its cultural connections in relation to the birth of the first allIrish language school in modern times, is the Taoiseach saying to the House that there will be no State funding for the restoration of Cullenswood House, notwithstanding its Irish language cultural connections?</P>

      <P>Faoi alt a 9 den Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979, is féidir, chun forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn ó thaobh teanga, cultúir, sóisialachta, gnéithiúlachta agus geilleagair, cumhachtaí breise a thabhairt don Údarás le hordú ón Rialtas.  Níl gá leis an Acht a leasú.  Sula bhféadfaí iarratas ar aon chumhacht bhreise ar leith a chur faoi bhráid an Rialtais, bheadh sé riachtanach don Údarás cás iomlán a leagan amach &mdash;na lochtanna sa chóras, na bealaí chun iad a leigheas, an costas a bheadh i gceist agus mar sin de.

      <P>Tá mé buíoch den Taoiseach as ucht an eolais atá tughta aige don Teach.  Tá sé ráite ag ball den Údarás a bhaineann lena pháirtí féin go bhfuil cás curtha ar aghaidh acu chuig an Aire ag iarraidh cumhachtaí breise. Glacann an Taoiseach leis gur fiú iniúchadh a dhéanamh faoin gcaoi ina bhfuil an tÚdarás ag oibriú amach.  Faoi alt a 9 den Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979, a luaigh sé, tá sé ar chumas baill den Údarás cás a chur ar aghaidh go dtí an tAire.  Anois, is féidir chomh maith, faoi alt eile, cumhachtaí a thabhairt don Údarás agus is féidir leis an Aire na cumh-achtaí breise a thabhairt.  Séard a bhí i gceist agam, os rud é nach bhfuil tith-íocht, nó bóithre, a luamar cheana, á gcur ar fáil ag na húdaráis áitiúla, go mba chóir go mbeadh siadsan taobh istigh de chumhachtaí agus feidhmeanna an Udar-áis. Nach bhfuil meamram curtha go dtí an Roinn ag iarraidh na gcumhachtaí sin?</P>

      <P>Ceist réasúnta mór atá againn anseo.  Maidir le tithe, is dócha gur cheart deighilt a bheith ann idir an Údarás agus na comhairlí contae maidir leis na rudaí sin.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,545,920,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1989, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, for certain services administered by that Office, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund, and for sundry grants.</P>
      <P>This Estimate for my Department for £1,545,920,000 is the amount which the Exchequer provides for social insurance and assistance services.  The Exchequer meets the full cost of social assistance and part of the cost of social insurance.  The bulk of social insurance expenditure is met by employer and employee contributions. When these are taken into account the total expenditure of my Department is over £2.6 billion or £50 million a week.  Of this amount 30 per cent represents payments to the elderly and 26 per cent to the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures taken by the Government to extend social insurance coverage to the self-employed have brought about a significant increase in contributions and consequently reduced the overall demand on the Exchequer.  The net cost of social welfare services would have been £39 million higher but for the extra PRSI income received from the self-employed this year.  Significant savings have also resulted from increased employment leading to an increase in PRSI income and a fall in the cost of unemployment payments.  The measures we have taken to improve the management of the social welfare system and to control abuse and fraud have also resulted in significant savings to the taxpayer. This Estimate includes provision <Col N="590" /> for a further saving of £27.5 million through specific control and antifraud measures.  These measures have improved significantly the financing of the social welfare system and have enabled me to preserve all our social welfare services and to provide for major improvements and new initiatives.</P>
    <P>The full year cost of this year's budget increase is £156 million of which £50 million is for special increases.  We will continue the policy of providing special increases for the long-term unemployed as resources permit.</P>
    <P>Regarding improvements in payments over the past two years we not only maintained the value of all social welfare payments but also provided significant additional resources for special increases to those in greatest need.  Our approach shows our practical commitment to improving the position of all who rely on social welfare.  We focused mainly on families, specifically families of the long-term unemployed and families or workers on low pay.  Last year we provided an increase of 11 per cent in the personal rate for the long-term unemployed and recipients of supplementary welfare allowance.  A further special increase of 12 per cent for the long-term unemployed was provided this year and comes into effect today.</P>
    <P>Taken together with the increases given last year, these payments have risen by almost 25 per cent since then.  In practical terms, the weekly payment to a family with five children on unemployment assistance has been increased over the past two years from £106.10 to £127, an increase of £20.90 per week.</P>
    <P>In addition to these special increases, the real value of all other payments has been maintained. This year a general increase of 3 per cent applies from this month.  The higher rates of pension (old age, invalidity and widows), of disability and injury benefit, maternity allowance and of supplementary welfare allowance will be payable from next week.  From today the personal rate of long term unemployment assistance increased from £42 to £47 per week.  The rate for a family <Col N="591" /> with three children increased by £8.20 to £107.</P>
    <P>The Estimate also provides for the cost of abolishing the lower rural rate of unemployment assistance with effect from today.  Since 1934 when the unemployment assistance scheme was introduced a lower rate of assistance has applied to claimants living in rural areas. The Government considered that such a differential is outmoded.  People in rural Ireland face essentially the same cost of living as urban dwellers.  Furthermore the present situation has led to serious anomalies in that many areas now accepted as urban are outside the urban classification. Claimants of unemployment assistance in parts of Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Clondalkin, Dún Laoghaire and Lucan were paid at the rural rate until today.  Similar difficulties arise in other areas such as Cork, Limerick, Dundalk, Drogheda, Ballina and many other towns.</P>
    <P>The Government agreed with my recommendation that the only logical step was to abolish the lower rural rate. From today all recipients of unemployment assistance will be paid at the higher rate.  This is a very significant additional improvement for claimants in those areas formerly regarded as rural. It includes small farm households who have been recognised by the Government as a group in need of special assistance.</P>
    <P>The supplementary welfare rate of payment, which was the same as the short-term rural rate, irrespective of where the claimant lived, will now also be increased to the higher rate.  This is a very significant improvement for a group of people in urban and rural areas who are on the lowest level of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>The Estimate includes provision for other significant improvements in the levels of social welfare payments.  The number of different child dependant payments has been reduced over two years from 36 to 12; a minimum child dependant allowance of £10 per week will take effect from today; child dependant allowances payable to long-term social welfare recipients have been extended from <Col N="592" /> today to age 19 where the child continues in full-time education&mdash;this is an important improvement for families whose children want to continue in full-time education.  The higher rate of child benefit is being extended to the fifth child from October next and new social assistance schemes are being introduced for widowers and deserted husbands who are bringing up children on their own.</P>
    <P>The introduction of these new schemes means that the payments being made to a widower on supplementary welfare allowance with five children will increase from £80.80 per week to £115.30.  This represents a very substantial increase of £34.50 per week.  Some £1.4 million has been provided in this year's Estimate for these schemes which is equivalent to a full year expenditure of £5.7 million. These new schemes will come into effect from October next.</P>
    <P>The Government have also this year directed additional resources towards low paid workers in two ways, first, by increasing the tax exemptions for low paid workers and, secondly, by making improvements in the family income supplement scheme and undertaking a major promotion of that scheme.</P>
    <P>On the income tax side we increased the tax exemption limit to £6,000 for a married couple and brought in a new special tax exemption of £200 for each dependent child.  This means that a couple with five children who have income of up to £7,000 a year will not now be liable for income tax. In addition, marginal relief is being applied where the couple's income does not greatly exceed the exemption limit.</P>
    <P>Major improvements in the family income supplement scheme will take effect from next week.  Overall expenditure on this scheme is being increased by 20 per cent to £6.1 million this year. The improvements include:</P>
    <P>increases ranging from £2 to £21 a week in the maximum payments;</P>
    <P>additional payments to families with six, seven and eight children;</P>
    <P>an increase in the rate of supplement <Col N="593" /> from 50 per cent to 60 per cent of the difference between family income and the relevant income limit;</P>
    <P>the weekly income limits for receipt of payment will be increased by amounts ranging from £4 to £38 depending on family size; and</P>
    <P>a reduction from 24 to 20 in the minimum hours of work required each week to benefit under the scheme.  In the case of a two earner family, their hours worked now may be summed for eligibility.</P>
    <P>In practical terms, the effect of these changes means that a family with five children who have a weekly income of £120 will qualify for a payment of £50 per week.</P>
    <P>In addition to a new drive to promote FIS through information packs, fact sheets and community and other information services, we have also undertaken a major advertising campaign.  The first indications of the success of this campaign, which Deputies will have noticed on the radio and in newspapers, are very positive.  The average weekly claim intake has almost doubled. Telephone inquiries to my Department, following an initial peak, are now running at about twice their former daily average. It is too soon to fully assess the results of this campaign.  Our information approach is aimed at maximising public awareness of our schemes and services.  The response to the FIS advertising is gathering momentum as the message is repeated on radio and in the newspapers. I am confident that this response will be reflected in an increased take-up of the scheme.  I want to pay tribute to the trade unions who have circulated their members with the information we have provided.</P>
    <P>The FIS scheme has an important part to play in helping families of workers on low pay and will be kept under review. The scheme at present is designed for workers in full-time paid employment. I am examining the extent to which similar arrangements could be applied to other people on low earnings.  Overall these <Col N="594" /> initiatives show the determination of the Government to tackle the problem of low incomes, both for those at work and those who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>Much of the pressure on the allocation of resources to social welfare has been eased by the introduction of more effective management and control.  This ensures that resources are directed to those most in need and those genuinely entitled to support.  Substantial savings have been achieved as a result of the measures I have taken over the past two years to combat fraud and abuses of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>These savings have helped me to devote additional resources to achieving greater equity within the social welfare system and to improving the position of those on the lowest payment levels. These savings are continuing and underlie the Estimate, resulting in a more cost effective and better directed service.</P>
    <P>One measure I would like to mention in particular is the requirement I introduced for employers in certain industries&mdash;construction, cleaning, forestry and security &mdash; to notify me of all new employees taken on since 1 January 1989.  For the first half of this year new employees notified in these sectors have totalled 7,850. These notifications are checked against an individual employee's social insurance and claims record to ensure that their social welfare record is in order.  In about 250 cases some element of apparent fraud or abuse of the social welfare system was found and these cases are currently under investigation.  A further 2,500 cases require further clarification though it is expected that most of these cases will in the event be found to be in order.  This proves the effectiveness of this step as a control measure and as an important part of my fight against the abuse of social welfare.  In the Social Welfare Act, 1989, I took powers to extend this arrangement to provide for notification where contractors or sub-contractors are engaged by employers in designated industries. The necessary regulations to implement this further step are in the course of preparation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> As I mentioned earlier, I will be bringing in new social assistance schemes for widowers and deserted husbands in October.  The introduction of these new schemes represents a major step in bringing about equality of treatment between men and women in this area.  Traditionally, the main responsibility for caring for children was assumed by mothers and the family was mainly supported by the income earned by the father.  With the introduction of these new schemes, the Government have given recognition to the fact that widowers and deserted fathers may also be in this position.  This Estimate provides for this major development, involving a substantial increase in income for those concerned.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of these new schemes there will now be six separate social assistance schemes providing income support to lone parents.  I am examining the possibility of replacing these schemes by one lone parent allowance scheme which would apply to parents, whether male or female, who are bringing up children on their own. Complex legislative changes will be required to provide for such a scheme but I hope to be in a position to bring forward proposals in this matter later in the year.</P>
    <P>In line with the commitment given in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, a detailed examination of the appeals system has been carried out.  We are determined to ensure that this vital adjudication feature of the social welfare system is seen to be fair and independent by all our clients.  We are committed to setting up a separate social welfare appeals office which will retain the best features of the present system in relation to accessibility, impartiality and efficiency.  New procedures for processing appeals will be introduced and improved information will be given to clients.</P>
    <P>Last year the number of new claims across all schemes requiring a formal decision was about 1.3 million.  The number of appeals which were made <Col N="596" /> amounted to only 17,000, less than 1.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The independence of appeals officers in the exercise of their functions is a vital part of the process.  The courts have upheld that independence and clearly supported it.  The main criticisms of the appeals system over the years have related to inadequate information about decisions, to the appeals procedures, to the right to an oral hearing and to the perception that appeals officers are too closely associated with the day-to-day operations of my Department.  I will be addressing these issues over the coming months.</P>
    <P>One of my priorities as Minister for Social Welfare will be to standardise means tests and introduce self assessment where practicable.  I am examining how these assessments can be used to establish entitlement to schemes administered by my Department or other statutory agencies.  This would simplify the process of claiming entitlements, reduce administrative costs and streamline the delivery of the services.  I introduced a limited form of self assessment in unemployment assistance through desk top interviews. These have proved very successful.  I am now examining the question of extending self assessment to other schemes.  I hope to be in a position to announce details of the extension of self assessment and further standardisation of means tests later this year.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 1989, in this House, I announced that the Government had decided on a fundamental review of the concept of the household for social welfare purposes. This examination, which is already under way, is being carried out by a review group under the chairmanship of Mr. John Curry who was formerly chairman of the Commission on Social Welfare. The function of the group is to identify ways in which the social assistance schemes could be adapted so as to ensure that the various household situations are treated in a consistent and equitable way. In the light of the outcome of this review, which is to be completed by November <Col N="597" /> next, the Government will consider whatever changes are required in the system and these will be brought forward in time for next year's budget.  The Oireachts will then have an opportunity to consider the various issues involved in the context of the associated Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of my particular interest in making the social welfare system as flexible and as responsive as possible to the needs of the unemployed. I have taken a number of initiatives in this regard.  The long-term unemployed from today have an option to receive either unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance, whichever is the more favourable to the individual claimant. This will remove any disincentive for the long-term unemployed in taking up short duration employment.  Otherwise they could find that their rate of payment was reduced if they became unemployed again.</P>
    <P>The part-time job incentive scheme provides the long-term unemployed with the opportunity to avail of the increase in part-time working which has been a notable feature of the labour market in recent years.  Participants may work up to 24 hours and receive a weekly allowance of £30 for a single person or £50 for a married person with dependent spouse.</P>
    <P>The educational opportunities scheme provides a second chance of education for older long-term unemployed persons who left school early.  It is proposed to extend this scheme to a number of new centres in the autumn.</P>
    <P>The part-time education initiative allows the unemployed to participate in part-time education courses without affecting their entitlement to unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>The voluntary work option scheme is intended to encourage unemployed persons to get involved in voluntary work and to encourage voluntary organisations to involve the unemployed in their activities.</P>
    <P>This year's Social Welfare Act enables me to make regulations deeming a person in certain circumstances to be available for work or to be exempted from the requirement to be available for work.  I <Col N="598" /> propose to make regulations under these provisions shortly providing that participation in certain educational courses will not affect entitlement to unemployment payments.  I expect that this facility will be available to long-term unemployed persons in time for those who want to enroll in courses beginning in September.  This latest initiative will complement the educational opportunities scheme and the facilities to undertake part-time education.  Together they make the pursuit of educational qualifications a very real option for the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives include a facility to allow unemployed persons to take up to two weeks holidays or to represent Ireland at international events while in both cases retaining their entitlement to unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>In May last I announced new proposals for legislation to regulate occupational pension schemes.  The necessary legislation is currently being drafted and I intend to introduce a pensions Bill before the House in the next session.  This new legislation will be designed to protect the interests of members of occupational pension schemes.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the substantial progress that has been made in improving the quality and the speed of the service we provide to the public.  Our success in meeting changing and increasing demands on our social welfare system has been achieved through large scale computerisation, new management systems, revised working procedures, reorganisation of functions and the commitment on the part of the staff of my Department.  I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge and pay tribute to their contribution.</P>
    <P>Further progress now depends on the extent to which we can localise our services. This means providing a more comprehensive, more integrated, more streamlined and more secure service at local level.  A key element in the localisation strategy is our continuing development of technology and the extension of our computer network.  The new localised service means that the role of the local <Col N="599" /> offices around the country will be expanded.  All social welfare clients, not just the unemployed, will be able to claim or obtain information on their entitlements at local level.  These local offices will give the public access to a more comprehensive and co-ordinated service. Closer working relationships will be established at local level with FAS, the health boards, the Revenue Commissioners and other State agencies.</P>
    <P>A major development in our localisation plan and a radical departure for the provision of services to our clients took place yesterday with the opening of the new social welfare pensions office in Sligo.  One hundred and fifty staff, formerly based in Dublin, were transferred to special purpose-built offices in Sligo as part of the Government's decentralisation programme.  The transfer took place over last weekend with minimal disruption to clients.  All old age pensions will now be serviced from Sligo.  A further 150 staff covering survivors' and family benefits and allowances will transfer to Sligo before the end of the year.  Special computer network facilities will allow for complete access from Sligo to all the data held centrally in Dublin.  In addition special arrangements will allow for'phoning the Sligo officers at reduced rates which in most cases will be the cost of a local call.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that information on social welfare is available to all when the need arises.  I have taken a number of measures to develop our information service, for example, through closer co-operation with voluntary groups in providing information, through a new approach in advertising aimed at maximising public awareness of our schemes and services, through a policy of providing information stands at public events such as the Spring Show and by improving the content and design of our publications and information leaflets.</P>
    <P>Our network of information offices in Dublin and around the country deals directly with inquiries from the public and distributes our booklets and information leaflets on all schemes and services.  I am <Col N="600" /> examining all options to ensure the best possible information service for our social welfare clients and the public at large.</P>
    <P>The scheme of grants to voluntary organisations administered by my Department offers real support to voluntary organisations.  Seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds was provided initially this year for grants to voluntary bodies engaged in providing services for deprived or disadvantaged persons in the following groups &mdash; children, young people, the elderly, families, single and abandoned parents, the disabled, the physically or mentally handicapped and other persons needing social services.  So far, grants have been allocated to 100 organisations.  In addition, a further sum of £100,000 has been provided for the loan guarantee fund to help those who need assistance to escape from the grip of moneylenders.</P>
    <P>I launched a new grant scheme for voluntary bodies last July.  In 1989, £50,000 has been made available for grants to voluntary bodies for schemes involving unemployed people in community and social services activities.  This new grant scheme complements the voluntary work option.</P>
    <P>A further £600,000 has been allocated to two other voluntary bodies&mdash;£500,000 to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and £100,000 to the Samaritans.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul will undertake, in consultation with me the expansion of their employment projects scheme, continue their programme of home management courses and develop their network of good as new shops.  The special once-off grant to the Samaritans will enable them to develop their drop-in facilities and expand their outreach programme.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery &mdash; The Next Phase</i> and <i>the Programme for Government 1989 &mdash; 1993</i> highlight the priorities in relation to social welfare for the next four years.  I am particularly pleased that they endorse and continue the policies of protecting the less well off in our community and improving the levels of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> My Department provide very important services for a vast number of people. We are the largest spending Department in the State.  Numerous issues arise trying to meet all the needs of such a large number of people.  In the short time available to me today, it has been possible to touch on only a few of these issues.  I look forward to the contributions from Deputies to this debate.  I commend the Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House will agree with me that the way in which we deal with social welfare issues in this House is totally ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mrs. Barnes) Acting Chairman (Mrs. Barnes)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mrs. Barnes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to remind the Deputy that he has 15 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just going to focus on that point.  When one is talking about such a vast Estimate it is impossible to do anything other than touch on various parts in 15 minutes; it is not possible to make a full and comprehensive contribution.  I am not a masochist and would not suggest that we should spend hours in this depressing chamber, but if we look at the overall position, there are only two debates on social welfare each year &mdash; the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, which gives effect to legislative changes in the budget, and a short debate on the Estimates.  When we are dealing with the expenditure of £2,600 million a year&mdash; as the Minister said in his speech, £50 million per week&mdash;it is not just the enormity of the money which concerns me but also the number of people who are affected by the decisions we make. We are talking about over 750,000 social welfare recipients, with approximately 150,000 adult dependants, almost a million people.  In that context the kind of decisions we make in this area require detailed analysis and adequate debate in this House.  I want to strongly make the point that this is a change which must be made in the procedures of this House in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my major disappointments when examining the joint programme for <Col N="602" /> Government by the new coalition is that there is no evidence of any serious commitment to making an assault on poverty. This makes me wonder whether there is an acceptance of the extent of poverty in our country.  We are all aware of the ESRI report, which was carried out for the Combat Poverty Agency, which stated very clearly and specifically that at least one in three of our population is living in financial poverty.  My view on the attitude of this Government was reinforced by the remarks of the Taoiseach at the conclusion of the last Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis when he said he found it difficult to accept the percentage of our people found by the ESRI to be living on the poverty line.  If there is no acceptance of the nature and extent of the problem, it is not surprising that there is so little emphasis being placed on the elimination of poverty in the programme for Government.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is an enormous problem of poverty in this country.  Furthermore, I accept that it is difficult to find answers to the problems of poverty during a period of financial stringency, but therein lies a challenge.  We cannot allow the cancer of poverty of fester without having both the commitment and the policies to tackle it head on.  The Minister outlined a series of changes which he has made over the past couple of years.  I compliment him, but let me remind him that in the context of the size of the problem these changes, commendable as they are, are minor in relation to the type of fundamental reform which is needed to make some headway in the attack on poverty.</P>
    <P>I want to make some proposals.  First, I genuinely believe that a serious debate in this House would be helpful.  It is absolutely ridiculous that the report of the Commission on Social Welfare which was produced three years ago has never been fully debated in this House.  At a very minimum, we should resolve that there should be a serious debate in this House on the extent of the problem of poverty in our society and the kinds of reforms which are necessary to produce solutions.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I am convinced that a major <Col N="603" /> cause of poverty is unemployment.  I am further convinced that the social welfare system contributes to unemployment. There are aspects of that system which are a serious disincentive to employment and job creation.  If we accept that, then there is a duty on us all to try to root out those disincentives in the social welfare system to ensure that it is all systems go so far as job creation is concerned.  We can only do this if we accept the fundamental point that unemployment is a major cause of poverty.  I strongly believe this is so and for that reason I urge that not just the social welfare system but all systems of State should be trawled so as to eliminate those aspects which contribute to unemployment.  It would be helpful from that point of view if an all party committee of this House were set up to examine fully the social welfare system and to suggest solutions along the lines I propose.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, a major change needed is the establishment of a single eligibility test based on net income to measure entitlement on a graduated basis to all State means tested benefits.  I will ignore the point made during the election campaign &mdash;I suppose it was a political point&mdash; that this was a return to the poor law. This was a deliberate misrepresentation of the proposal we had made.  I am talking about means tested benefits and a single test which would allow entitlement on a graduated basis.  This would ease the transition from the dole queue to employment. It would mean that there would be no automatic loss of medical cards and other benefits by somebody leaving the dole queue and taking up a job which might not be very well paid.  At present there are 11 different means tests within the social welfare system, there are other means tests under the health board system for DPMA, medical cards, etc., there is a further test within the local authority system in regard to differential rents, there are means tests within the Department of Education for education grants and there are means tests for legal aid.  There are a whole plethora of means tests but they make no sense whatsoever <Col N="604" /> in the context of the waste of administrative resources and the pain and suffering caused to people who have to go through such a multiplicity of means tests.</P>
    <P>During the last year for which figures are available, in the social welfare system alone over 250,000 means tests were carried out by 235 social welfare officers. This must be changed.  The defects in the Government's programme are, first, that it is confined to social welfare and, secondly, that it does not provide that means tests will be changed to net income.  This is the vital link between somebody on the dole and somebody who is taking up a job which may be poorly paid.  What that person is concerned about is the amount of money that is going to be in his pocket. If he is assessed for his medical card on his gross pay, which he will not be getting into his pocket, and loses his medical card, there is no incentive for him to take up such a job.  Accordingly, the Government proposal in this regard is utterly inadequate and I would very strongly urge the Minister to adopt the Fine Gael proposal.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, the family income supplement scheme has great potential but, unfortunately, that potential is not being fully exploited by the Minister.  There was a review of that scheme undertaken by an eminent university person who recommended changes.  But what he has not highlighted at all is the fact that the consultant, John Blackwell, recommended a total change in the system.  He recommended that we introduce here a system similar to that obtaining in the United Kingdom and, as far as I know, in every other country where there is a family income supplement, that is a change based on family credit, based on net income.  Therefore the emphasis placed by the Minister on the changes announced, of an improvement, with an extra £1 million out of £2,600 million for the scheme is all wrong and unfounded. In so far as money is available this scheme should be recast.  If there are choices to be made this should be a priority for any additional funding available.</P>
    <P>At this stage I contend there must be <Col N="605" /> substantial changes effected in payroll taxes.  The Fine Gael Party proposed to abolish employee PRSI and health and training levies and to replace them by a 5 per cent employee levy.  We must tackle this problem.  The OECD have reported that, of all their member countries, our tax and welfare system is most biased against labour.  If we are seriously interested in tackling unemployment, if we accept that the huge amount of unemployment here is a major cause of poverty, surely we must change this system which is inhibiting job creation.</P>
    <P>Of all the measures by way of social welfare to help people there must be a continuing effort to help the long-term unemployed.  I am not talking merely about special increases.  I am talking about incentives to the long-term unemployed, if possible, to leave the dole queues.  That is why I produced a number of proposals to encourage the employment of long-term unemployed.  New, innovative measures are necessary if we are to achieve this goal.  We must reform the supplementary welfare system to include low-paid workers.  We must devise new proposals along the lines of exemption from the payment of payroll taxes for a limited period for a long-term unemployed person coming off the dole queue.  We must think of an extension of the early retirement scheme down to age 55.  We must talk about the exclusion of benefit deemed to arise from living at home for those aged over 25 and talk about the improvement of the position of those taking up temporary or part-time employment.  The proposal we have made of appointing an official in labour exchanges to seek out provisions in that area for the long-term unemployed is useful.  The responsibility given such an official to ensure a restoration of benefits and allowances after such jobs cease is also very important.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that there be a concerted effort to remove the obvious anomalies obtaining within this system because, clearly, it is an unfair system as long as these are allowed to continue.  Just to give the House an example, the 10 per cent artificial assessment against old age <Col N="606" /> pensioners when in fact they may be receiving 3 per cent only from the bank after the imposition of deposit interest retention tax constitutes one such anomaly which must be abolished.</P>
    <P>There must be much greater emphasis on support for children.  Here the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare are very much to the point.  I proposed the introduction of a &ldquo;back to school&rdquo; payment.  The amount involved would not be enormous but, in the context of priorities, I urge the Minister to consider it when such proposals are being considered by the Cabinet in the future.</P>
    <P>I want to see also an extension of the prescribed relative allowance.  In this respect the Minister accepted my amendment to the last Social Welfare Bill.  I want to see the category of persons to whom the prescribed relative allowance is available extended.  Obviously that makes sense from an economic and social point of view.  I want to see the establishment of the right to privacy for applicants for social welfare benefits and for people attending at other public offices, too.  There is a whole series of other changes that time will not allow me debate now.</P>
    <P>The joint programme for government is a major disappointment because it does not even acknowledge the existence of the extent of poverty in this country. There is no evidence that the new Government accept the extent of this problem.  There is no evidence of a willingness to respond to it.  Neither is there any evidence of a serious commitment to reform our system.  On that basis I will be opposing this Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his reappointment and wish him well for the duration of his reign.</P>
      <P>I might first refer to the following statement of the Minister in his introductory remarks:</P>
      <P>Over the past two years we maintained the value of all payments and also provided significant additional resources for special increases to those in greatest need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="607" /> That is a small part only of one's consideration of an Estimate.  Any consideration of a Social Welfare Estimate must be prefaced by an examination of the overall record of the Minister introducing that Estimate.  The most salient fact to point out in relation to Fianna Fáil's social welfare record is that it is one of cuts by stealth.  Nobody can claim that Fianna Fáil have cut social welfare rates but that constitutes half the story only.  What they have done is systematically cut the provision for social welfare by rendering social welfare entitlements progressively more difficult to obtain and by ensuring that fewer people have the entitlements they had heretofore.  In the process they have engaged in a thorough attack on the rights of working people.</P>
    <P>They have never admitted what they are doing.  The process in which they have engaged, instead, is called &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo; or &ldquo;simplification&rdquo; but, to those at the receiving end, the meaning of those terms is daily becoming clearer. For that reason workers especially will view with alarm any commitment in the new programme for government to continue this process of what is described as &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to spell out in detail what the Fianna Fáil record on social welfare really represents.  For instance, a family in receipt of child benefit will have received no increase in their rate of benefit since 1987.  This represents a cut in real terms of 12 per cent in child benefit, affecting every family in the State.  If a mature person has a claim for long-term disability benefit he or she will now need 260 paid contributions, that is five years constant employment, compared with 156 paid contributions a little over two years ago.  Effectively that provision has deprived many claimants of benefit to which they had been entitled heretofore, particularly younger claimants who cannot get the kind of long-term employment that would give them the equivalent of five years paid contributions.  Of course, if one has a claim to unemployment, maternity or disability benefit, <Col N="608" /> the number of paid or credited contributions to render one eligible has been increased from 26 to 39.  In the case of a widow, deserted wife, single parent, or prisoner's wife, they will no longer be entitled to claim the half rate payment of disability benefit, maternity allowance or unemployment supplement that obtained as of right up to January 1988.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the case of the dental and optical treatment scheme, now a claimant must have 207 paid or credited contributions as against 156 in January 1987 and 39 contributions in the claim year as against 26 in January 1987.  This has deprived many people of their just entitlement.  Recently I had a case of an insured person who had over ten years paid up stamps who went to the US on an extended holiday for six months&mdash;he got six months leave of absence from his employment&mdash;and came back.  After a few months he claimed dental benefit and even though there was never any previous claim the claim was disallowed on the basis that he had less than 39 contributions in the governing year.  That is fraud on the part of the Department and the Government who think up those cut backs which deprive people who have an excellent record of insurance contributions. This is one of the many examples of the results of these cuts which I come across daily.  Thousands of people have had their social welfare entitlements taken from them by this Government.</P>
    <P>Another example of the policy of this Government relates to the social employment scheme.  The allowance payable to a single person was reduced by £10 per week, from £70 to £60, and the allowance under the Teamwork scheme was also reduced by the Fianna Fáil Government from £70 to £60.  Pay-related, unemployment, disability and maternity benefit entitlements have been cut in half. The rates of 25 per cent and 20 per cent have been reduced to 12 per cent.  The floor for pay-related benefit has been raised to £68 per week which means that the maximum pay-related benefit has been reduced again.  Entitlement to private rent payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme <Col N="609" /> has been cut by £1.50 per week.  The number of free fuel vouchers has been reduced by four, which costs the recipient £20.  A number of different categories of people have been excluded altogether from the scheme.  The discretion that used to be available to community welfare officers to deal with cases of hardship has been removed.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the unfortunate predicament of those who are permanently disabled, one of the most disadvantaged categories in our society. They must now have five years insurable employment in order to qualify for an invalidity pension whereas in the past it was three years.  I think this fraudulently deprives young workers in particular who through no fault of their own are permanently disabled either following a serious illness or accident.  Unless they are lucky enough to have had almost five continuous years of paid insurable employment they will never be able to qualify for invalidity pension as a result of a decision by the Fianna Fáil Government during the past two years.  I call for a review of some of these cutbacks which have been made because they are depriving people who are genuinely in need and genuinely entitled to these benefits.  This is particularly the case with the young people because they would not have had the opportunity to chalk up five years continuous work.</P>
    <P>One of the meanest cuts of all was in relation to the allowance which was known as the breadwinner's allowance whereby the widow of a recently deceased social welfare recipient was entitled to claim his social welfare benefit for a period of six weeks after his death. That has been abolished if the surviving person has a pension or a social welfare entitlement in their own right.  This was something which even the Minister was totally against in the context of the equality legislation.  He and his colleagues are on the record of this House as being totally against talking benefits from people as a result of the EC directive. The Minister immediately hid behind this directive in order to justify this action. The payment for six weeks following the <Col N="610" /> death of a social welfare recipient was of great benefit to the widow.  I cannot recall what Minister or what Government introduced it but it was a far-reaching measure and it did not cost very much because it was deducted from the widow's pension subsequently.  I compliment whoever brought it in because it was an enlightened piece of social legislation and a sympathetic one.</P>
    <P>In relation to the transfer of the pension section to Sligo, I hope this will not result in any delay in returning pension books to the surviving dependant.  Where the pensioner dies and the book has to be sent back to the Department in order to have the name changed &mdash; which process may take a week &mdash; I suggest that the necessary power be given to the local social welfare officer to carry out that function.  I do not think any risks would be taken if the family of the deceased could approach a local social welfare officer and arrange for the change to be made there and then because it is in the days immediately following the death of someone in receipt of social welfare that the money is needed.  It does not arise if the person is in receipt of unemployment assistance or benefit because the local employment exchange can arrange it quickly.  Perhaps the Minister will have a look at this matter because he referred to arrangements being made locally in his brief here today.  It is a very simple matter.  It could be arranged without too much trouble and it would be of immense benefit to those affected.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention a few other matters in relation to the Minister's address to the House.  I note that he is making provision whereby people can opt either for unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit depending on which is higher.  I would have preferred if the Minister increased all benefits so that there would not be the anomaly which we have at present.  The anomaly will be more obvious because of the increases in unemployment assistance but the Minister overcomes this problem &mdash; if I understand his statement correctly &mdash; by simply giving the claimant freedom to choose whatever rate suits.  This, of <Col N="611" /> course, relieves the Minister of the obligation to equalise the rates upwards as he has done in the famous Hyland case where he rushed legislation through in this House reducing all the rates in order to comply with the court decision.  If he was really concerned about fair treatment he would have increased all rates.</P>
    <P>The case for making provision in the family income supplement scheme for the self-employed is getting stronger every day because there are many redundant workers trying to eke out a living and who are lucky to clear £50 or £60 per week.  They are doing their best to try to avoid claiming unemployment assistance or benefit.  Those with families would far prefer to continue working at what they are doing if they could get a supplement to their resources.  I ask the Minister to examine this suggestion in the context of expanding the family income supplement scheme as there is a very great need for such a change.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that the Minister has not mentioned the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  We do not know the mind of the Minister on this because he has not mentioned it during the course of his address to the House this evening.  There is significance in that but I hope the Minister has not consigned the report to the wastepaper basket.</P>

      <P>The Workers' Party will be opposing the Estimate today because we consider the amount allocated to be inadequate, given the appalling levels of poverty that exist in this country.  However, that is in no way to deny the advances the Minister has made <Col N="612" /> and as other Deputies have done I welcome the Minister's reappointment to the Department of Social Welfare.  There is no doubt that he has rationalised and made certain improvements in the system.  Nevertheless it is still totally inadequate and does not seriously address the problem of poverty in our society.</P>
      <P>Social Welfare cannot be seen as a solution to poverty but it should act as a safety net to protect those in need from the worst effects of the poverty that our society permits so many people to live in.  This Estimate is inadequate in that respect.  Saying that the moneys allocated will ensure that most people on social welfare will not be any worse off than in previous years or that they will be even slightly better off is not good enough. a major initiative is needed urgently to tackle the problem of poverty.  Despite the fact that more than one million people are directly affected by poverty it was clear from the recent general election that poverty does not feature to any serious extent on the agenda of all of the right wing parties.  In fact the level of poverty is now worse than has been the case at any time since the fifties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have pointed out repeatedly over the past two and a half years and as research shows, using a cut-off line of £48 per week, which is 60 per cent of average disposable income, means that 34 per cent of the people are living in poverty. That has been borne out by the ESRI report on poverty.  That report reflects one of the most comprehensive studies ever undertaken in this area.  We are talking about a level of income that condemns men, women and children to grinding misery and life in a twilight world in which none would wish to live and in which I am sure none would wish that anyone else would have to live in either.  That report found that the low paid households headed by an unemployed person, households with several children and farming households stood out as the three main groups vulnerable to poverty.  The report points to the increasing impact of unemployment and <Col N="613" /> to the fact that 33 per cent of all households with less than 50 per cent of the average disposable income are headed by unemployed persons.  This level of poverty is the dark side of Fianna Fáil's self-proclaimed economic miracle.  Our exports of goods and services and indeed people have boomed but the promised increase of employment, the <i>quid pro quo</i> for years of wage moderation, has not materialised.  Yet we are told that cuts in social spending and not just cuts in pay are the key to jobs and prosperity.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party do not accept that poverty is inevitable or that the poor should always be with us.  Poverty is not some kind of natural disaster, it is a man made phenomenon.  There is nothing inevitable about it.  It is caused by deliberate choices being made regarding economic and social policies.  These economic and social policies derive from political ideologies.  Poverty can be ended by making different policy choices.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not a poor little country that will always need help.  We have considerable wealth and important resources, with considerable potential deriving from that wealth and resources. What is lacking is the political will to use them in a socially responsible and equitable manner for the benefit of all the people rather than for a tiny elite who continue to live comfortable and luxurious lives.  The advent of 1992 presents both challenges and opportunities for this country and The Workers' Party want to ensure that 1992 will mean more than the removal of customs barriers and obstacles to trade, that it must also mean harmony between economic and social objectives and policies, harmonisation of tax and social welfare systems and harmonisation of living standards at the best European levels.  It must mean that people in Ireland have incomes they can live on in comfort and dignity.</P>
    <P>During the last election The Workers' Party produced a policy document on poverty in which we pointed out the various steps that need to be taken to combat poverty in the short term.  We sought the immediate introduction of a positive anti-poverty programme which would make <Col N="614" /> real inroads into the problems of poverty and inequality before 1992.  We want Ireland to enter the single market in a state of balanced economic and social development and not with bitter divisions or wide extremes of wealth and poverty or seething social problems and a begging bowl in each hand for our European partners to keep filling.  In our document we have set out a basic programme for dealing with poverty and we are determined that the issue will not be ignored particularly by other parties in this House.  I urge other parties to spell out their policies on how the problem of poverty should be dealt with.  Are we to assume that they have nothing to say to the poor and the disadvantaged except that they must wait for better times?</P>
    <P>Among the immediate steps we want to see taken in the social welfare area is a minimum social welfare payment of £50 per week this year rising to £63 per week in 1991.  That would be the updated equivalent of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  We want to see payment of the full personal rate of social welfare to all persons who are part of the labour force, those who are normally employed or who want to be employed, irrespective of their sex, family of marital status.  We want to see 70 per cent of the relevant rate of social welfare for adults who are dependent on other adults and who do not wish to take up employment paid directly to the adult concerned unless they decide otherwise. We want to see the replacement of existing payments in respect of dependent children by a tiered system which would provide 40 per cent of the adult dependant rate for those under 15; 55 per cent for those between 15 and 18 with 70 per cent for those over 18 years of age who live at home.  The removal of all remaining sex discrimination and victimisation on the basis of marital or family status is also another requirement.  However, primarily and as a basis for the changes we are proposing, it is essential that the Government we now have introduce minimum wage legislation to end the exploitation of women, young workers and other vulnerable groups.  There is <Col N="615" /> also urgent need to introduce legislation to protect part time workers, most of whom are women and young workers.</P>
    <P>I note from the programme which was agreed by the current Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats administration that they will try by way of the social welfare system, specifically through the FIS scheme, to improve the lot of those on low pay.  While that is laudable, it is not a solution to the problem of exploitation which many employers engage in. It is in many cases simply a subsidy for bad employers who refuse to provide the kind of protection which their employees are entitled to.  If we are talking seriously about the question of a social partnership in this State, a social partnership which will help to prepare this country to take its place in the European Community, then legislation must be implemented to protect those who are least able to protect themselves.  It is not good enough to say, as some people have said, that it is a matter for each individual country to provide this protection.  We have seen, and we know that employers in their own right or of their own volition will not provide the protection part time workers need.  Therefore, it is essential that the Government introduce the kind of legal protection the people I am referring to need urgently.  I am sure the Minister will say this is a matter for the Department of Labour and I acknowledge that but nevertheless his remit in relation to social welfare automatically covers the people to whom I am referring.  It is in his interests to press at the Cabinet table for the kind of protection I am talking about for part time workers and for women workers in particular who make up most of the part-time workforce in this country, a growing workforce.</P>
    <P>It is essential to do this from the point of view of our integration with the European Community.  Other members of the European Community have talked about the problem of social dumping as it is called, this Euro-speak to which Deputy Dukes refered earlier, which simply means that big employers, multinationals in particular, will locate their <Col N="616" /> enterprises, factories and businesses in those countries in the European Community which provides the least protection for workers.  They will drift willy nilly towards Ireland because we are one of those countries which provides least protection.  I urge the Minister strongly to take on board the points I am making.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to address himself to a number of issues, but not necessarily today because he may not have time.  The Combat Poverty Agency have under their control a number of projects around the country which have been running for just three years and their funding will end shortly.  It is essential that the people engaged in these projects know soon whether the funding will be extended, particularly as many of them are engaged in long-term planning. I would ask the Minister to address himself to that particular point.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to an amendment of mine with regard to disability benefit which the Minister accepted during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, 1989.  He acknowledged the point I made that in many cases people are charged with abusing the social welfare system, they are fined and subsequently their disability benefit is withdrawn.  This means there is a double penalty involved. The Minister agreed to reduce the penalty from six months' loss of benefit to three months' loss of benefit.  I found out since then that unfortunately this applies only to disability benefit and does not apply to unemployment benefit.  This means that in trying to deal with one anomaly we have created a second one. Those on disability benefit can lose their benefit for three months as a result of a charge in court while those on unemployment benefit can lose it for six months.  I would ask the Minister to look at that as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I want to raise the question of the appeals system, particularly in relation to disability benefit appeals.  Some people produce medical evidence from some of the best medical practitioners in the State, consultants of one kind or other, certifying that because of illness they are unfit for work, but the appeals system <Col N="617" /> finds them fit for work.  I do not understand how this can be, nor do the people who suffer as a result of these decisions. I cannot understand how a person, who in most cases is not a medical practitioner, can dispute the expertise of a medical practitioner &mdash; a consultant who specialises in the particular ailment and is giving his views on that ailment &mdash; and decide against the evidence that the person is fit for work.  I would ask the Minister to look at the basis on which these decisions are made because a lot of hardship is being caused as a result of these decisions.  The time is short and I appreciate the Minister's patience listening to so many cribs and groans, but it is important that he is aware of what is being said outside this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallance Mr. D. Wallance">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallance</NameTxt>
      <P>This system provides for a large increase in the resources devoted to the less well off in our society at a time of economic difficulty.  The Government have provided an extra £256 million over the last two years to those on social welfare.  For a family of five children on long-term unemployment assistance this means an increase of £29.10 in a weekly income over two years.  This is more than three times the amount provided by the Coalition Government &mdash; an increase of £9.20 &mdash; in their last two budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a lot from the Opposition parties about the needs of the people on social welfare.  When two of those parties had an opportunity in Government to do something positive about it they were unable or unwilling to do so.  Fianna Fáil policy represents a practical commitment to low income families with children.  The Minister has directed resources to those families in greatest need.  The cost of the extra provision for children in this year's social welfare package is £42 million per annum.  This includes the increases for children dependent on social welfare and for those whose parents are at work and on low pay.  This action in the last two budgets is designed to tackle poverty as a priority.  Unfortunately, the pressure groups and interest groups are unwilling <Col N="618" /> to acknowledge that major progress has been made.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to convey the impression that everything has been achieved.  Far from it; we have a long way to go.  We must continue to improve the income position of the long-term unemployed.  In doing so, however, we will also have to provide them with every opportunity to become part of the labour force again.  I made this point forcibly in the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, 1989.  As a result, the Minister introduced an amendment to enable him to exempt persons from the requirement of having to be available for work in certain controlled circumstances to qualify for unemployment assistance.  I welcomed that initiative at the time.  It was of particular interest to a group of long-term unemployed people in my constituency who formed the Knocknaheeny support group.  This voluntary self-help group established a co-operative society to encourage the long-term unemployed to take up employment with the co-op.  Their intention was that people with skills who are out of work for a number of years should be given an extra incentive to get back to work.  For people who have not experienced the depressing effect of long-term unemployment, it is not possible to understand the difficulties experienced by those people trying to get back to work.</P>
    <P>The idea is that people would agree to work for the co-op for up to one year. They would continue to draw their unemployment payments and receive an additional sum, preferably through the extension or development of the family income supplement, to meet expenses incurred.  I am disappointed that this scheme has not yet been approved.  The support group are ready to proceed.  They have a range of projects on hand and they want to deal with them.  All they need now is clearance to take on unemployed people.  This is in the best interests firstly of the unemployed, secondly of the people of the area and, finally, of society as a whole.  If the Minister is having difficulty meeting the legal requirements, I would ask him to consider approving this <Col N="619" /> group as a pilot project, pending finalisation of a detailed countrywide arrangement.</P>
    <P>The people of Cork deserve this opportunity to fulfil their potential.  They have developed this idea to help themselves.  I support them fully and I note the Minister does also.  It is now time for action.  Perhaps the Minister will consider visiting this support group in the near future. Their approach on the question of flexibility in the unemployment payment system is similar to the Minister's.  They have made constructive suggestions and are looking for a speedy, favourable response.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a number of areas of concern in the social welfare system.  Certainly they are of major concern to me and many other Deputies in this House and I mention them in a constructive manner for urgent attention by the Minister.  Deputy De Rossa mentioned the medical referee system.  The first area of widespread concern is the operation of that system.  There is a clear need for control on claims for disability benefit.  The effectiveness of the Minister's approach can be gauged from the significant reduction of some 13,000 in the numbers on disability benefit since he took office in March 1987.  This has not been achieved without creating difficulties on the ground for the recipients. Many people complain of the cursory examination to which they are subjected when called before a medical referee.  I understand the Minister has taken action here but I wonder to what effect?</P>
    <P>A more important issue is the extent to which medical referees appear to ignore reports submitted by consultants.  I call on the Minister to undertake a radical overhaul of this system and engage his own consultants to examine difficult and contentious cases.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the disbelief experienced by disability benefit recipients and many public representatives like myself at some of the decisions reached.  It is no longer sufficient to say the Department have qualified doctors carrying out this function. The Minister as a matter of urgency <Col N="620" /> must engage consultants to examine the difficult and contentious cases.  This would ease people's concerns and make the system be seen to be fair and impartial.</P>
    <P>Many people called before medical referees find themselves in a &ldquo;Catch 22&rdquo; situation.  I can give the Minister several instances and I know other public representatives in the House whom I have spoken to speak in a similar vein about people called before the medical referee being cut off from disability benefit. Some of those people have been hospitalised a week or two later and have operations, receiving disability benefit while they were in hospital.  When they come back out they are cut off again unless they have another medical examination. This is an unsatisfactory position for a lay person to find himself in because of divisions or whatever in the medical profession.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to social welfare staff.  The Minister has committed himself to improving the quality and delivery of social welfare services.  He has taken a number of initiatives.  A number of constituents have complained about the lack of courtesy and fairness from a small number of social welfare staff, and I emphasise a small number.  This arises particularly in means testing and applies even in the case of old age pensioners. Some staff members employed in permanent, pensionable jobs seem insensitive to the position of people making claims for social welfare payments.  I ask the Minister to look into that area.</P>
    <P>One example I give is the free electricity scheme.  The recent crackdown on abuse of the free electricity scheme has caused considerable difficulties for many old age pensioners.  Many were granted the allowance some years ago since when they have grown older and some of them have taken in a member of their family, in some cases a single member on unemployment assistance.  In the absence of any apparent controls or checks by the Department in so many years these people have been receiving allowances for some time when according to the strict letter of the law they may not have been <Col N="621" /> so entitled.  I ask the Minister to review the hardship imposed particularly on some of these elderly people and grant them some form of exemption.  I am not suggesting there should be widespread abuse of the system but there are areas where people must be more humane in their approach, and this is not the case with some people carrying out investigations into these matters.</P>
    <P>The general increase of 3 per cent for social welfare payments will maintain the position of all claimants.  The special increase of 12 per cent for the long-term unemployed and 8 per cent for people on supplementary welfare allowance gives those on the lowest payments a further substantial rise this year.  These increases show the Government's continued concern to improve the position of those dependent on social welfare.  They more than meet the commitments of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which was agreed with the social partners.</P>
    <P>A major development is the abolition of the low rural rate of unemployment assistance by increasing this rate, and consequently the rate of supplementary welfare allowance, to the higher urban rate.  From today the higher urban rate will apply throughout the country and this is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>This year the Government again approved a further special package aimed at the less well off.  Fianna Fáil appreciate the special difficulties faced by the long-term unemployed and I am pleased the Minister has increased the long-term personal rate of unemployment assistance by a further £5 a week.  The person on long-term rate of unemployment assistance will now receive £47 per week.  A married couple bringing up three children on long-term unemployment assistance will get £8.20 extra per week, bringing their total to £107.  A family with five children will get an extra £11.40 per week, bringing them to £127 per week.  They will all get an increase in child benefit.  Taken together with the increases given last year, these payments have risen by almost 25 per cent since last July.  They represent a considerable improvement <Col N="622" /> for those dependent on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>I welcome the other important initiatives the Minister has taken to improve social welfare which are provided for in this Estimate.  These are new social assistance schemes for widowers and deserted husbands.  Coming into effect in October, they will mean a real increase for people in that situation.  The Minister earlier this year imposed a liability on deserting husbands or wives to maintain the deserted wife or husband, as the case may be, and the children.  I ask the Minister what progress has been made in this area.  Will there be any benefit to the taxpayer from this provision this year?</P>
    <P>The Minister has radically streamlined and restructured social welfare payments. I ask him to continue this progress and introduce a single social assistance payment.  Could he also streamline the wide range of PRSI contribution classes? There are a number of such classes which appear to cover a small number of employees.  The number of rates adds to the complexity of the system.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with the decision to allow pensioners to carry over unused units of electricity from one billing period to the next and improvements in the free fuel scheme.  These positive improvements are very beneficial to the people. I may sound somewhat critical of the Minister, but I compliment him in that it is very clear since he came into office two and a half years ago that Deputy Woods has shown his commitment, his concern and his knowledge of the problems on the ground.  I look forward to the next three to four years to seeing him revolutionise and modernise the system and eliminate many of the anomalies in social welfare.  If he makes changes and improvements similar to those of the past two and a half years, then this time two and a half years hence I am sure we will have a much better system for all the community.</P>

      <P>I would like to make a brief contribution on this debate.  My contribution will probably be a repetition of some of the points made already by speakers.  However, I would like to start by congratulating the Minister on his reappointment.  I trust that in the next four years he will mount an aggressive assault on the levels of poverty and deprivation in our society.  I know that is not what his Department are all about, that they are involved in other areas of payments, but I think we all agree this is the area of priority.</P>
      <P>Social welfare payments are not, of course, the answer to poverty and the difficulties many people suffer.  While unemployment is so high&mdash;there are vast areas where the unemployment rate is 19 or 20 per cent&mdash;substantial and worthwhile payments are essential. There is a welfare culture building up in which whole families have to use their time, initiative and resources to find out how they can get as many payments as possible since nobody in the family is working.  Nobody would want to be in receipt of welfare payments instead of working, and we must ensure that our efforts towards creating full employment are as strenous as possible.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister on his approach to his brief and on some of his achievements in wrenching the payment of benefits and assistance from the image of poor law times and attempting to bring the operations of his Department into the 20th century.  I refer to simple changes in recent years, such as the provision of information literature, telephone access to specific areas of the Department, television and radio advertisements and especially the family income supplement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been paying more than usual attention to the Official Report, catching up on details of debates in this House during the past two years, and I was interested to see a number of initiatives. I am particularly pleased with the <Col N="624" /> changes in the prescribed relative allowances, which came about following amendments put down by the Opposition and accepted by the Minister.  This allowance which was a bone of contention for so long can now be paid directly to the carer instead of to the person receiving the care.  It is an essential move in what I hope will be fundamental changes ensuring meaningful community care away from institutions, whether for old age pensioners, those rehabilitating or the handicapped.  Many of the 2,000 people affected by this allowance will welcome the fact that it will be paid to them as a right.  I hope the objective will be to expand the numbers receiving this allowance and to increase payments.  I concur with the suggestion that the recommendation by the Commission on Social Welfare should be examined so that the payment would be commensurate with unemployment assistance. The Minister mentioned this in his speech.</P>
    <P>Although there have been changes for the better, we have a long way to go to ensure that nobody falls through the net in areas where they are entitled to benefit or are in need.  Our system should not cause humiliation or embarrassment to those seeking help.  I wonder if there are many cases like that of a man in his eighties living with his daughter in a middle class Dublin south area.  I came across this case in my constituency by accident.  The daughter has a pleasant house and her husband is working.  She also has four children, with all the costs that involves.  Her father has absolutely no income.  He never accumulated enough payments to give him a contributory old age pension.  He moved from one of his children to another but has been living with this daughter for the past ten years.  He has a small nest egg which is probably enough to bury him.  He thinks he is not entitled to a non-contributory pension and is a very proud man who is afraid to be seen to look for something to which he is not entitled.  I persuaded him to apply for the non-contributory old age pension and I have <Col N="625" /> no doubt that he will qualify when his circumstances are realised.</P>
    <P>There is also an anomaly in the disabled person's allowance.  The case to which I will refer was published in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 10 July.  I had written previously to the health board about this constituent.  I will give the case in outline and the Minister might say whether there is an anomaly.  It concerns a 19 year old man who is mentally handicapped and gets no disability benefit.  All he receives is £3.50 per week.  He attends a sheltered training workshop quite a distance from his home and has to pay £8.80 for bus fares and lunches each week.  He has been assessed by the National Rehabilitation Board as likely to require supervision in any work situation.  It has been made known to the health board that he is not fit for work but he has been refused disability or maintenance benefit.  This is putting a great strain on his family who have three children at home and one other who is handicapped by a severe mental problem.  I would ask the Minister to see whether there is an anomaly which might be affecting other people in this category and to consider the matter compassionately.</P>
    <P>An issue of considerable concern is the dental scheme for spouses of insured workers.  When the Taoiseach was pressed at Question Time today on measures affecting women introduced by the previous Government he was obviously too embarrassed to mention that the dental scheme was one of the initiatives taken in the past two years. Perhaps he had good reason not to mention this scheme since it is not working. It is a good idea and I was one of those who welcomed it.  In my entire constituency there are only two dentists in the scheme for approximately 68,000 people, although I do not know how many qualifying spouses would be included in that number.  The Minister must see what can be done because responsibility lies with him.  At the end of the day matter will have to be resolved.  Why not sooner rather than later?</P>
    <P>I would seek clarification regarding the <Col N="626" /> payment of unemployment assistance to a man who is living apart from his wife and children.  In the past a disproportionate amount was paid to the wife and children which was inadequate and was not seen as fair.  There is a proposed change and I should like some information from the Minister whether it is discretionary.  It is important that the requirements of the wife and children should be dealt with reasonably.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the allowance payable to deserted husbands.  The fact that there was not an allowance comparable to the deserted wife's allowance caused a great deal of hardship in many homes.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department has become computerised.  I saw the system in the RDS and was hugely impressed. This will be a great asset to the Department. Would it not be a good idea since the Department have all the names concerned and details of benefit etc. to provide for everybody in the system a printout telling them what their entitlements are and which they could keep safely, thus avoiding confusion, misinformation and whatever?</P>
    <P>I am pleased at the changes and initiatives that have been taken but we still have a long way to go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Fennell for giving me the opportunity of making a contribution.</P>
      <P>First I would like to congratulate the Minister on his reappointment.  I am disappointed with the last Government's attitude to the rural population with regard to entitlements&mdash;whether it be small farmers' assistance, old age pension or widows' allowances&mdash;where those concerned have small holdings.  That is the main thrust of what I want to say in regard to the Minister's presentation which, on the face of it, seems to be very presentable. However, there is no change in attitude towards the section of the community to which I refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to improve the facilities where the unemployed queue up to collect benefit.  It is sad that they have to queue up on perhaps a main street at <Col N="627" /> a little cubby hole or some such shabby office regardless of what the weather is like.  Those people are being humiliated. Is this approach an effort to try to drive them off the queue?  They are entitled to their dignity like everybody else.  I would like the Minister to make a particular effort to ensure that proper facilities are provided for people queuing for the dole.</P>
    <P>Harassment of the long-term unemployed is unnecessary.  Employers are now liable to report the names of people they employ.  This is by way of ensuring that those employed are not receiving unemployment benefit.  However, I have heard of numerous cases of people being investigated, had their unemployment assistance withdrawn and, as a result, having to turn to the health board for supplementary help.  In 90 per cent of such cases the payments are authorised to be recommenced.  My complaint is that while these payments are backdated there is a period during which these people are sent to another area to get the means to support their families.  There should be a better system of investigation.</P>
    <P>My main point is in relation to the small farmers allowance, the old age pension and the widows' allowance for people who have small farms.  The way these people are being treated is nothing short of a national disgrace.  The assessments on these small holdings are ridiculous. I have brought this matter to the Minister's attention time and again, the Minister having asked me to forward him the information.  I have here a typical example which came to hand just last night.  It is the case of a widow with 27 acres on which she had one cow and three other cattle.  The mighty masters of agriculture who came to assess this woman's income assessed it at £38.97 per week on the basis of her holding which is described as land of poor quality.  If farmers could generate that sort of income from 27 acres there would be no national debt.  These assessments are not relevant.  It would be impossible to make £40 a week on a holding like that.  This unfortunate woman was allowed £19.70 <Col N="628" /> per week.  Even 27 good acres will managed would not give anything like that sort of income.  This woman's late husband was handicapped.  Before his death she had £143 per week income.  She is now down to £19.70 a week and this caring Department of Social Welfare say she should be able to get by on that.  In fact the stock she had on the farm were sold off to pay funeral expenses.  This sort of thing is happening across the board.  I do not want to be deemed negative in my approach.  There are many improvements outlined in this document but there is still the problem of the harassment of people on small holdings in rural areas who are not getting their due entitlements.  I would ask the Minister, for God's sake, to have a fresh look at this and give those people what they are entitled to, the allowances that will give them dignity to rear their families and have the same comforts as people in the urban areas have.  It is mentioned that urban and rural rates have been equalised.  That is not the case.</P>

      <P>That equalisation will not come about as long as the Department have people such as the present assessors making the assessments.  What sort of qualifications have they got?  They have absolutely no knowledge of the matters they are investigating.  I would like to give those people 27 acres of land and ask them to live on it for a period of six months.  I am sure they would reach starvation before the end of such time.  This is just one example.  I am sure other Deputies could cite many more.</P>
      <P>I would like to have gone into more detail on other items but because my time was so brief I could not.  I am sure the Minister has got the message.  I know him to be a caring man who will take on board the problem I am highlighting.</P>

      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on his reappointment to the Department of Social Welfare and I look forward to his continuing with the streamlining and improvement of the various schemes and services delivered by that Department.  I wish him well in his efforts.</P>
      <P>I would like to welcome also the improvements which the Minister outlined today in the various schemes administered by his Department.  I would particularly like to welcome the drop of 30,000 which has taken place since he took office in the number of those unemployed.</P>
      <P>This Department are one of the most important Departments in the State not just because of the vast sums they administer, amounting to £2.6 billion, but also because it is the Department of Government with which almost every member of the public comes in contact at some stage.  Perhaps because of that the public are more aware of its workings, the shortcomings and the plusses, too.  That Department, therefore, come in for more criticism than any of the other Departments of State.</P>
      <P>I, too, have some criticisms to offer.  I hope the Minister will find these constructive and helpful.  They are not intended to be negative or vindictive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wide range of the Department's activities makes it impossible to give anything approaching comprehensive cover in the short time available so I will confine myself to making a few points which I think are important.  These concern areas that are in great need of reform and to which I would ask the Minister to particularly direct his attention and energies so that he might improve on the matters <Col N="630" /> concerned in this his second term in the Department.</P>
    <P>Before criticising, it is only fair to say that the vast majority of cases dealt with by the Department are dealt with speedily, efficiently and humanely.  The problems seem to be confined largely to three specific schemes, the unemployment assistance scheme, the disability benefit scheme and the straightforward claims which would belong in the category of the 80 per cent to which I referred but in the case of which something has gone wrong with the processing because some query has been raised or some certificate has not been submitted or some form has not been properly completed.  Such claims get into difficulty and it seems to take an inordinate amount of time to correct the problems and get the processing of the claim back on course so that the applicant can receive his entitlement within a reasonable time.  It should take only a matter of days, if not hours, to remedy such cases, not weeks as it takes at present often keeping a client waiting in great need and in great distress.</P>
    <P>The problems relating to the unemployment assistance and disability benefit schemes stem from the delays and the means testing system which applies.  The means testing system is totally unsatisfactory, as has already been referred to by many speakers.  It is particularly unsatisfactory where it applies to the small farming community and people with meagre means.  I welcome the abolition of the differential between the urban and rural rates of assistance.  It should be possible to bring a greater degree of standardisation to the means testing system and to devise a system that can be clearly understood by the applicants so that they can establish their means for social welfare purposes.  Until the system is reformed means testing will remain an irritant in the system and members of the public will feel they are being harshly treated by social welfare officers and that they are not getting their entitlements.</P>
    <P>About 95 to 99 per cent of social welfare officers administering the scheme deal with applicants in a very humane fashion and are as efficient as the system <Col N="631" /> allows but unfortunately the public find some individuals more difficult to deal with. There should be some effort in the Department to implement a training scheme for social welfare officers who will deal with members of the public. People from a city background are often sent out to rural areas.  They do not fully understand rural economic activity and there is a certain antipathy on the part of these officers even at the commencement of their investigations.</P>
    <P>Delays in processing applications can in part be accounted for by the general cutbacks in public expenditure but that is not the full story.  Many of the delays are unacceptable and should be significantly reduced or eliminated.  I have a particular sympathy for young people in third level education who when home for the summer apply for unemployment assistance when they cannot get a summer job.  There are inordinate delays in having these claims processed and in many cases in assessing means the social welfare officer grossly overvalues means because the young people are living with parents. We need a reform here urgently.  It is pathetic to see young people having waited two or three months to have claims processed being awarded a sum of 70p or a few pounds a week.</P>
    <P>With regard to disability benefit it is not just the delays which are an irritant but the frequency with which some people are recalled for medical examination. In some cases where the claimant is visibly disabled this frequent recalling for medical examination amounts to harassment. There should not be a need for a medical examination two or three times a year in those cases.  Even in more borderline cases and up-to-date certificate from the family medical consultant should be acceptable.</P>
    <P>I would not want the Minister to think I wish to facilitate abuse of the system or that I would condone such abuse.  Those guilty of abuse should be weeded out so that the £2,600 million available for distribution can be distributed to those who actually need it.  Because of the huge numbers seeking assistance the money <Col N="632" /> available for distribution amounts to a very meagre weekly allowance for applicants. That is all that the economy can afford at the moment and it underlines why people abusing the system should be weeded out so that every effort can be made to ensure that all the money available goes to those who are entitled to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>No person genuinely entitled to benefit should be harassed or deprived of benefit.  I do not condone the use of mere technicalities by the Department to disqualify someone from benefit. I am referring to cases where an application form will not arrive on time or a certificate will not arrive on time.  We all know of the vagaries of the post especially at certain times of the year.  The failure of a document to arrive is not a sufficient justification to disqualify a person from benefit or assistance.</P>
      <P>The sum available for distribution is a huge sum of money and there must be meticulous book-keeping in order to account for it.  However, my contention is that the Department should have a heart as well as a head and where there are deficiencies in this area I look to the Minister to put them right.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a contribution, even if it will only last three minutes.  Let me take up some of my precious time in congratulating the Minister on his reappointment. I hope he will continue to strive to achieve the kind of social welfare system people feel they deserve and is worth subscribing to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me put a number of questions to the Minister.  If the Minister does not have time to answer them the might take a note of them.  Like other Deputies, I will commence by saying that what we <Col N="633" /> should aim for is a minimum income for all.  Let us hope this day is not too far away and that this aim is not seen as Utopian.  I welcome the flexibility being introduced into the social welfare system. There must be flexibility when dealing with the particular difficulties faced by part time and shift workers, particularly those who are waiting tables and here mostly women are affected.  Some weeks these people work a sufficient number of hours to enable them to claim benefit but there are other weeks when they do not qualify for benefit.  The difficulty arises because they do not work a sufficient number of hours each week to claim benefit and therefore they lose out altogether. I ask the Minister to tell us if the number of hours worked could be accumulated to enable them to claim benefit. As more and more people are taking up part time and shift work, we will have to give thought to introducing flexibility into the system.  If we fail to do so, as has been pointed out, people will feel they cannot take up such employment and will continue to claim social welfare rather than looking for a job.</P>
    <P>I welcome, as I am sure every other Deputy in the House does, the establishment of the commission headed by Mr. John Curry.  I hope in considering the question of household income they will included relatives looking after elderly or sick persons at home.  They tend to be marginalised and are not seen as part of the household.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the extraordinary pressure on people to borrow from moneylenders and of the suffering imposed upon them when they fall behind in their repayments.  If the economy is improving, this should benefit everybody. If the figure of £100,000 is seen to be inadequate and only going so far, I ask the Minister to consider increasing it. I am aware of the extent of poverty and the sense of desperation being felt by these people in our society and I am telling the Minister that this figure may not be adequate.  I would like to think there will be flexibility in this area.  We are aware from the annual report of the Combat Poverty Agency that that agency <Col N="634" /> never had an adequate number of staff or resources.  If we talk about an increase in staff numbers, we should first increase the number of staff in the agencies which deal with the poor and the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Finally, going back to a point made by Deputy De Rossa, I ask the Minister to make sure that at all European meetings, particularly of the Council of Ministers, the harmonisation of social welfare payments and the need for a minimum wage be accorded priority.  It will not be to the advantage of any country in Europe if there is an attempt to shift cheap labour from one country to another.  What we should be striving for is harmonisation upwards not downwards.</P>

      <P>Let me mention very briefly in reply to that question that such people are not included at present.  I would like to have included them but the cost would have been far too great.  We can go into this matter another time.  However, I am keeping the matter under review because to some extent what we can do will depend on the income that is available to the system.  This is due to be reviewed at the end of three years and will give us an opportunity to look at all those arrangements. Obviously those around 55 years of age are doing extremely well already, as are those in the 40 to 45 year age groups.  If we were to include those over 55 years of age it would be far too expensive. That is the difficulty that arose.</P>

      <P>Because of the cost involved this was not considered feasible. However, that question can be looked at in the review.  I am very conscious of this problem.</P>
      <P>A large number of matters have been referred to and I have very little time to respond.  I am aware that it is the duty of the Opposition to oppose and I notice that on this occasion the Opposition are planning to oppose.  I thank all who congratulated me on my reappointment as Minister for Social Welfare.  I am very pleased to be back at the Department of Social Welfare for the simple reason that many of my efforts are coming to fruition. I am very anxious to see this work completed. I am sure that if someone else was appointed they too would be anxious to see it completed.</P>
      <P>During the year we passed many measures.  Some were referred to indirectly here this afternoon.  Deputy Wallace called for some measures to benefit people in Knocknaheeny.  It was only prior to the election that we passed the Bill.  The next thing we need to do is to make regulations which are quite complicated. Some aspects are straightforward but others are complicated.  I am trying to get these regulations made as quickly as possible so as to introduce the flexibility Deputy Wallace seeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proud of my own record as Minister during the previous Administration. Some Deputies referred to this in one way or another.  Some were in favour but others were against.  I am proud of that record because during a difficult period we managed to put forward a large number of initiatives and brought about substantial improvements and increases in the social welfare area.  I could refer to the different rates and tell the House that the long-term unemployed personal rate was increased in 1986 by £1.75 per week; last year it was increased by £4.20 per week, and this year it was increased by £5 per week.  We are trying to meet the Commission on Social Welfare's recommendation.  Deputy De Rossa said that we need to increase that figure to £50 per cent&mdash;at present the figure stands at £47 per week.  To achieve this <Col N="636" /> figure, a considerable amount of money would be needed.  This is a major problem but I can assure the House that the Government are committed to tackling it.  We want to continue this process and each of the programmes mentioned makes it quite clear that we intend to continue this process.  However, there are difficulties and if I had more time I could deal with this matter in more detail.</P>
    <P>We now have reached the position where the people who are being caught up with may have to move a little.  The DPMA, the disabled person's maintenance allowance, will also need to be considered.  This is reflected in what was said by Deputies in the House today.  Let me emphasise that we achieved a great deal under the last Administration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fennell expressed concern about the dental scheme.  At present this scheme is working very successfully.  Previously it was not possible to get it off the ground.  However, I am very glad to say that in recent days another dentist has joined the scheme; since the election two dentists have joined.  We now have 195 dentists participating and to date 45,000 women have been treated, which is not bad.  If we take into account other benefits, about 103,000 have been treated. In Dublin, 53 dentists are participating in the scheme.  However only two dentists in Deputy Fennell's constituency are participating. I could suggest reasons for this but I will not do so at this stage.  I would like to assure her that the scheme is going well and I will do everything I can to expand it.  I appreciate her interest.</P>
    <P>Various cases were referred to.  Deputy Fennell referred to the case of a man in his eighties.  I am sure that man will get a non-contributory pension.  I have no doubt about this.  She also referred to an application for a disabled person's maintenance allowance.  These are not dealt with by my Department, but rather by the health board.  Again, I believe that person should qualify and I think she will have some success with this case if she pursues it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wallace also raised the question of medical referees and was concerned at some practices.  He asked if <Col N="637" /> we might consider engaging consultants under certain circumstances.  I have noted his view and will consider that matter.  With computerisation it has been possible to call people up in relation to particular illnesses during the duration of such illness.  That is why those recalls come up then.  Having had some experience there it certainly would be worth looking at the medical input to see if the timing is appropriate or if it is too frequent.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned the ERSI report.  I would like everybody to realise that that report is based mainly on 1986 circumstances.  In social welfare we have given substantial increases above the odds to the people identified in that report since it was published.  The data were taken in the latter part of 1986 and the first couple of months of 1987.  The report was not published until considerably later.  We have taken very important steps to alleviate the difficulties mentioned and shall continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa also mentioned the report and the same point is relevant. While welcoming the various measures, he will oppose us at this stage saying that we are just not doing enough.  That criticism is always possible of social welfare. I accept that that is what the Opposition will do here.  I should like to thank <Col N="638" /> those who recognised the measures that have been taken over the past two years and assure them it is my intention not only to continue the pace and work input but to accelerate it as far as I am concerned. That is the only commitment I can give.  Many of the issue arise in a budgetary context and must be taken into consideration in that context.  I shall listen to what is said by Members of the House; I have done that over the past two years and will continue to do it.  I will continue to improve the system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wallace believes that the system had been revolutionised, or is in the process of being revolutionised.  An independent observer from outside would recognise that almost a revolution has been taking place in the past two years, particularly with regard to acceleration in the improvement of the services. I intend to keep that up until we have a first-class service.  There is a price tag and that cost affects the renewal of many of the offices around the country mentioned by Deputy Boylan and improvement of the services all round. The localisation that I mentioned is crucial. We see that as providing a totally new kind of service, very much related to the needs in the local areas.  That is the direction in which we are going.</P>

    <Title>Vote 32: Agriculture and Food (Revised Estimate).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £154,323,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1989, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, including certain services administered by that Office, and of the Irish Land Commission, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The record achievement of the agriculture and food sector over the past two years is the best testimony of the success of overall Government policy.  The sector has a unique and pivotal role in the economy and its performance has contributed enormously to the overall economic renewal in the country.  The benefit of this success is not confined to the farming community; it has impacted in a dynamic and visible manner on the community generally.</P>
      <P>The major building programme in the food sector, the farm development programmes in rural Ireland, the increased spending power in our towns and cities, the increased employment in our meat, dairy and horticultural enterprises, the huge boost to the haulage and transport services, the expansion of the range of quality Irish food products in our retail outlets, all testify to the positive spin-off across the economy of the renewed vigour in this primary production sector in our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate is as relevant to each of these sectors as it is to the farming sector and it is the Government's firm intention to expand even further the opportunities that will arise in the European internal market.  While the prolonged spell of dry weather is less than ideal for our agricultural pattern of production, the indications are already clear that this year <Col N="642" /> will see a further major improvement in farm incomes, in agri-food exports and in employment in this key sector.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Taoiseach over two years ago to adopt a new integrated policy for the agriculture and food sectors under my Department has been a key factor in this success.  The direct responsibility of the IDA and SFADCo to my Department in the food sector has ensured that our production practices are geared directly to the marketplace and has enabled us in conjunction with CBF, Córas Tráchtála and Bord Bainne to capture very profitable and expanding markets throughout the world.  I would like to pay a special tribute to these organisations and to the Department of Industry and Commerce for their co-operation and understanding with my own Department in this very successful transition.</P>
    <P>I will now make some more general remarks before dealing in some detail with the main areas of agricultural production and with some of the precise elements in the Estimate.  The Estimate is for a gross amount of over £310 million. This represents only a minor part of my Department's spending as some £950 million funded by the European Community is being paid by my Department to farmers and agri-business in 1989 and a further £120 million funded from borrowings will be spent on the purchase of products into intervention.  Overall, therefore, between domestic and EC funds my Department are involved in disbursing almost £1,400 million.</P>
    <P>The 1989 budget Estimates were framed in an overall economic environment which has provided significant benefits to Irish farmers.  Inflation in 1988 at 2.1 per cent was at its lowest level for almost 30 years.  Irish interest rates had fallen by 6 per cent over a two-year period and had withstood a significant increase in UK interest rates during 1988.  The latest Teagasc report indicates an increase of 27 per cent in farm incomes in 1988 over 1987.  This increase, on top of the previous year's very positive 31 per cent increase, consolidates the strength of family farm income levels and confirms <Col N="643" /> that there has been a full recovery from the deep depression of 1985 and 1986.</P>
    <P>The year 1988 also saw a significant growth in our exports of food, beverages and live animals which topped the £3 billion mark for the first time.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the European Community has been adopting a restrictive approach to agricultural expenditure over the past five years or so. In particular, support prices have been frozen or reduced and other measures of varying types have been introduced both to control production and to stabilise budgetary costs.  The Commission's proposals for prices and related measures for 1989-90 represented a continuation of this restrictive approach.  However, overall, the financial impact of the pricedecisions was a favourable one for this country.  Adjustments in the agrimonetary and milk sectors will be worth some £50 million to the farm sector in a full year, with a balance of payments gain of about £42 million.</P>
    <P>The year 1988 proved to be exceptional for the dairy sector.  The benefits of the improvement in the market were reflected, in particular, by the increase in milk prices paid to producers during 1988 as well as the record profit levels achieved by Irish dairy processors.  The dairy sector provided some of the highlights of our export performance in 1988, a year in which world prices for the major dairy commodities rose dramatically and helped to create a favourable climate for investment.  I have been heartened by the eagerness of the milk industry to undertake investment and to diversify away from the basic commodity products. Within the past two years alone butter production has fallen by 19 per cent while cheese production has increased by about 30 per cent.  The advent of the Single European Market in 1992, of course, makes this process even more urgent and significant.  Government action ensuring the availability of IDA and FEOGA grants for such investment has greatly helped the sector in undertaking this fundamental restructuring of output.</P>
    <P>The advent of the Single Market also <Col N="644" /> puts into focus the need for structural rationalisation of the dairy sector so that it can compete successfully with larger processing units in the rest of the Community. In the final analysis, only the industry itself can carry through the kind of reorganisation needed in a rational and sensible way, and the necessary planning at both producer and processor level has to be undertaken now.</P>
    <P>On the actual operation of the milk quota system, my main concern is the particular difficulties faced by small-scale producers.  I have constantly been seeking to introduce some flexibility into the system in order to make greater provision for such special category producers.  The introduction of the milk quota restructuring scheme which I negotiated in 1987, as well as the scheme for the temporary leasing of quotas, have for the first time enabled quotas to be made available to these producers without the additional expense of purchasing or leasing land.</P>
    <P>The main development in the quota system at Community level during the course of the year has, of course, been the resolution of the problem arising from the European Court decision in favour of the Mulder producers.  The final date for the receipt of applications was 29 June and the quotas are to be provisionally allocated to eligible producers by 29 August.  The House will be aware of my statement to the effect that I welcomed the fact that the Commission had responded to my request, and that of the French, at the price negotiations to introduce special proposals for a national reserve for small producers and young entrants into agriculture.  I hope effect will be given to those proposals very soon.</P>
    <P>The year 1988 was the time when the fall in cattle numbers throughout the EC, following the introduction of the milk super-levy in 1984, was finally reflected in market prices for cattle and beef.  Factory prices throughout most of the year were about 10 per cent higher than in 1987.  I am glad to report that, exceptionally in Ireland, the decline in the national cattle herd came to an end.  The decline in slaughterings at meat export plants of <Col N="645" /> about 120,000 head was due entirely to the strong movement towards stock rebuilding which manifested itself during the year.  This movement was confirmed by the substantial increases in beef cows and heifers-in-calf recorded at the December 1988 livestock enumeration, which more than offset the decline in dairy cow numbers.  As a result, the total breeding herd increased by practically 100,000 head.  This was the first increase in the total breeding herd since 1984.  It was also a striking expression of confidence by our producers in the future of the beef industry.</P>
    <P>Certainly the climate is right for further expansion.  All the favourable factors to which farmers responded in 1988 are still in evidence and have been supplemented since 3 April by an increase in the suckler cow premium from £38 to £51.  There has also been an improvement in the relative profitability of once-calved heifer systems following the abolition of the UK variable premium which applied only to steers and maiden heifers.  As a further encouragement to expansion my Department are this year offering grants of £20 per cow to selected farmers who use modern calf twinning technology.</P>
    <P>There were significant developments during the last year in the EC beef regime.  The EC Commission submitted proposals which would have involved very severe changes in beef market support. The negotiations on these proposals were crucial from the Irish viewpoint.  In the event I was very pleased with the considerable improvements which we managed to negotiate before the matter was concluded last January.  A very significant achievement was an assurance from the EC Commission that in its operation of the various support mechanisms it would have regard to the great importance of the beef industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>During late January and February it emerged that our winter feeders were encountering problems with cattle prices. I pressed the EC Commission to take urgent action and, as a consequence of my representations, intervention for carcases was introduced for a two-week period in March 1989.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="646" /> I also obtained the agreement of the EC Commission to my proposal that a study be made of the whole question of the impact of seasonality on the industry. I am very pleased that the Commission will now regard seasonality as a priority issue.  This is all the more significant in the context of the Commission's other assurance in recognising the great importance of beef in the Irish economy. I have also been giving attention to domestic aspects of the meat industry.  The Abattoirs Act provides for a major reorganisation of the control and inspection arrangements for meat destined for the home market.  The main provisions of the Act will come into operation on 1 September next.</P>
    <P>Sheep production continues to be one of the most attractive farm activities.  Last year alone the national flock rose by 16 per cent and some 5,000 new entrants came into sheep farming.  There is a bright future for the sector provided we can supply lamb of the right quality at the right times.  Since I launched the sheepmeat code of practice nearly two years ago considerable progress has been realised.  However, there can be no letup in the move to better quality.  The European Commission has clearly signalled its unwillingness to continue with open-ended support for the sheepmeat regime.  Producers themselves will be expected to take more resonsibility for guaranteeing their return by marketing a better quality product.  In this sector as in many others the message I want to convey is one of achievement to date and confidence for the future.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to developments in the pigmeat industry and, in particular, to the Government's major five year modernisation plan, which I announced in 1987.  The plan calls for the establishment of up to eight central slaughtering and processing plants of the highest standard and effectiveness, supplemented by a number of downstream specialised processing facilities.  The development programme is well under way.  A number of plants are already onstream and others are in the process of construction or at an advanced planning <Col N="647" /> stage.  In the past two years, my Department have approved investment projects in pig slaughtering and processing facilities involving a total capital input of about £80 million.</P>
    <P>The plan also envisages an increase in pig output to three million pigs per year by 1992.  The significant improvement in the pig prices in recent months should be a major stimulus to this expansion.  Also, a number of pigmeat plants have already introduced incentive packages for producers aimed at encouraging the necessary expansion.  I am confident that as these new developments bring about higher profitability, more farmers will be attracted back into pig production.  Further contributions to the strengthening of our pigment sector will be made by the CBF marketing strategy and quality scheme which I launched recently and by the Community pig grading scheme which I introduced in this country last January.</P>
    <P>The poultry meat sector continued to expand in 1988 with a further increase in the processing of oven-ready birds and an expansion in the added-value products sector, and significant export growth. While Irish egg consumption declined during 1988, in line with the international trend, the market share held by domesticproducers continued at a significant level. Home producers now account for 85 per cent of the supplies to the Irish market as compared with 55 per cent some years earlier.  The impact of salmonella enteritidis in late 1988 resulted in a significant decline in home consumption of both poultry meat and eggs.  However, consumption has now improved again in response to the implementation by the industry of the voluntary code of practice which I announced last December and the operation of the Department's monitoring programme.</P>
    <P>As regards cereals, Irish production in this sector increased only marginally in 1988.  As community production, at 162.5 million tonnes, exceeded the maximum guaranteed quality by less than 3 per cent, a partial refund of levies amounting to <Col N="648" /> £2.09 per tonne of the additional coresponsibility levy was made to Irish cereal producers.  Prices to producers should hold good for the 1989 harvest. The Commission has also agreed to tackle the problem of imports of cereal substitutes in the current GATT negotiations. Many Irish producers have turned to malting barley for which there is a ready and remunerative market for quality product.  Milling wheat is another area to which cereal producers should look to improve their returns.  Given reasonably favourable weather, better cereals management practices can also make a significant contribution to growers' incomes.</P>
    <P>Turning now to some of the principal provisions in the Estimates, the allocation for the disease eradication schemes provided under Subhead C2 this year is almost £35.6 million.  Funding for the TB and brucellosis schemes is guaranteed by the Government for the four years of the ERAD programme, a unique commitment and one which I consider vital to the success of the schemes.  The board of ERAD recently announced increased compensation for reactor animals payable with effect from 1 February 1989. The total cost of these increases is estimated at £4 million in 1989.  This expenditure will be met from savings of approximately £3 million by ERAD during 1988, with the balance being funded jointly by the Exchequer and by an increase in bovine disease levies.  The ministerial orders giving effect to the increased levies are now being put in place.</P>
    <P>For the record I want to indicate that these orders are being brought before the House on the basis of total agreement by the farm organisations and the board of ERAD.  I want to indicate my appreciation to the spokesmen and leaders of the Opposition parties who have agreed to take this matter by way of Dáil motion without debate tommorrow.  I would understand, of course, if they made comments, suggestions or even criticisms during the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> The board have developed a comprehensive eradication strategy.  To achieve the target set for ERAD of halving the existing bovine TB levels over four years, a more intensive and sharply focused programme has been implemented.  This involves a full round of testing of the whole national herd, together with a component strategically focused on the 15,000 herds which pose the greatest disease risk.  Particular attention will be given to areas with concentration of these high risk herds.  I am satisfied that the establishment of ERAD has proved to be a successful initiative bringing together not just farmers but all interested parties to provide a clear and coherent approach to the disease eradication schemes.</P>
    <P>A wide variety of schemes operate under the FEOGA Guidance Section but I will confine my remarks to the main areas where Community support is particularly important to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead L.3 the sum of £57.2 million is provided for payment of livestock grants in the disadvantaged areas in 1989.  Of this sum, £45.2 million relates to cattle payments and £12 million to sheep payments.  This allocation will enable payments under the sheep headage, cattle headage and beef cow schemes to be maintained at their 1988 levels.  The payment of headage grants on beef cows in diary herds which I introduced for the first time in 1988 into the two cattle schemes I have just mentioned is being continued this year.  Continuation of these grants is an important incentive for further expansion of the national cow herd.</P>
    <P>Payments on mares registered with the Connemara Pony Breeders' Society and in the Irish Horse Register are being extended this year from the more severely handicapped areas to the less severely handicapped areas for the first time.  The payments are also being increased substantially from £32 to £70 and from £28 to £66 and the operational rules will be changed to facilitate maximum uptake by mare owners.  For the first time also this year, headage payments will be made on goats, at the same <Col N="650" /> rates as on sheep.  This should help to encourage alternative farm enterprises and to establish a solid breeding base for the Irish goat herd.  Looking to the future, I would hope that I can negotiate an increase in our recoupment rate with the EC and that it will be possible then to increase the rates of headage payments and extend and reclassify some disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The availability of additional EC funds is, of course, the key issue here.  It is too early at this stage to say exactly how much land can be included either for extension or reclassification, as the survey, on which the case made to the EC will be based, is not yet completed. Where the survey results justify the extension or reclassification of any particular area I shall put the case to the EC Commission and pursue it with vigour and determination, though I would warn Deputies that the negotiations with the Commission and indeed the Council can be expected to be difficult.</P>
    <P>The agri-food industry in Ireland is of course one of the most important sectors of the national economy.  The value of gross agricultural output, at £5.5 billion, is about one-third of our total manufacturing output.  Employment in food processing represents nearly 25 per cent of all those employed in manufacturing industry.  The industry has great potential for further development and expansion and with the advent of the Single European Market in 1992 there will be challenging opportunities for Irish exporters in an open market of 320 million customers. The Government are therefore devoting special attention under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to the expansion of the food and drink industry.</P>
    <P>The five year strategy for the food and drink industry published in December 1987 is well under way and accelerated development programmes involving investment of £0.6 billion have been agreed across the various sectors of the food industry.  This investment will lead to the establishment of internationally competitive food companies in Ireland and will leave the industry well placed to <Col N="651" /> take advantage of opportunities in the Single Market.</P>
    <P>In view of the time constraint I will have to leave the remainder of my prepared script.  However, I should like to make special reference to An Board Glas who have had a major success record.  I should like to make that point in the presence of my colleague, Deputy Kirk, who was responsible for horticulture in the 25th Dáil.  In the course of further developments in this area no doubt he and other colleagues will deal with that matter.</P>
    <P>It is clear that Government policy places particular emphasis on farm efficency, product quality, environmental protection, rural development and improved support for disadvantaged areas.  In doing so it highlights the principal areas where further progress needs to be made in the Government's endeavours for the agricultural sector.  I am glad to be able to point out that each and every one of these problems is already being tackled.  Obviously, they will not be cleared up from one day to the next, demanding, as they do, persistent and patient work as well as, in many cases, constructive co-operation from the EC Commission and Council, but once they are successfully solved, as solved they will be, we will have laid the basis for a world-class performance by Irish agriculture and food processing.  We will have offered the opportunity to our farmers and processors to move ahead into a new dimension of efficiency and prosperity, to build an agriculture and rural society second to none and to face the future with pride and confidence.</P>
    <P>As is customary on these occasions I have endeavoured to sketch out for the House the current state of our agriculture and food sector with special reference to recent developments.  I must stress that the time constraint on us is a very serious one in view of the huge range of activities I could not possibly describe within 20 minutes.</P>
    <P>I am determined to avail of every possible opportunity to build up the ability of our agriculture and food sectors to play <Col N="652" /> a dynamic role in our economy and to achieve no less than a dominant position in the Single European Market of the future.  Those are aims which this House, and the nation as a whole, can support. I am very confident that we can realise them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>May I begin by congratulating the Minister on his reappointment as Minister for Agriculture and Food.  Without sounding begrudging, it is fair to comment that many involved in the industry would not have been totally upset had the Minister moved on to fresh fields and pastures new.  However, I sincerely wish the Minister every success during his present term of office.  Having said as much, may I say I am totally alarmed at the smug approach of the Minister, as evidenced in the course of his remarks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which amounts to a self-eulogy.  May I say very bluntly that there is no scope at all for such a self-congratulatory approach in circumstances in which two-thirds of our farmers have incomes of less than £100 per week?  More importantly, the Minister has totally overlooked the fact that we are now entering one of the most critical periods since the foundation of this State so far as agriculture is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no hint of even an acknowledgement by the Minister of the storm clouds lying ahead or of any planning being undertaken to cope with the difficulties that certainly lie on the horizon. It would appear there is not even an understanding of the problem, without which there can be no steps taken to provide a solution.  Here I am speaking about the two major items on the international landscape &mdash; the effect of the past-1922 free trade on Irish agriculture and of the GATT negotiation, neither of which was mentioned in the course of the Minister's remarks.  The position in regard to 1992 is that&mdash;&mdash;<Col N="653" /></P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate the time constraint on me.  I will deal with those matters when replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but I have read the Minister's prepared speech in full.  I am gravely concerned at the lack of appreciation of the problems that will arise in relation to 1992.  Being an island nation we do suffer disadvantages but one major advantage is our high health status.  The Commission's proposals in this regard are of major concern to this country.  As I understand the position, the onus will be placed on exporting countries and frontier controls will cease other than for spot checks.</P>
      <P>I had thought there was virtual agreement in this House that we should aim to make Ireland the food capital of Europe &mdash; certainly that is my view &mdash; with consumers paying premium prices for our produce of the highest purity and quality. The problem there would be that, if our health status is affected, that approach will be subject to major threat.  I am very concerned that not alone has the Minister not mentioned it but, as I understand the position, he has made no impact whatsoever in his approaches to the Commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be interested to hear the Minister reply to that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second major concern is the position in regard to GATT.  At this stage it is very clear that agriculture is at the centre of the Uruguay Round.  There has been no reference to the effects of the mid-term agreement in Geneva last April which I had understood led to an agreement on a freeze on existing supports for two years with a further agreement on a progressive reduction thereafter.  What <Col N="654" /> will be the effect of that on this country? What will be the long-term effect on the export refund system?  Its implications for Ireland are of major concern in circumstances in which we must export 75 per cent of our agricultural produce.  I believe that agriculture in Europe will be exposed more and more to world trade and that as a consequence we will lose more, in proportionate terms, than any other EC country.</P>
    <P>There is also the United States proposal floating around in relation to import levies, to freeze them at a certain figure rather than have a variable rate.  All of these proposals may be of major significance to this country, a country that now, as the Minister says, has over £3,000 million in exports of food, drink and animals.  This clearly shows there must be an understanding of all of those implications on the part of the Minister.  Likewise there must be a teasing out of all of the implications of these proposals.  I seriously urge the Minister now to produce a White Paper setting out the implications of these major changes for this country, particularly those in regard to 1992 and the changes proposed within the GATT.</P>
    <P>The situation on the home front also gives cause for concern.  In the Fianna Fáil election manifesto there was reference to the fact that the first priority, <i>inter alia</i>, must be to maintain a low inflation, low interest rate economic environment.  Of course, that is of major consequence for our farmers.  Already there is evidence that the Government are failing to hold the line on both those fronts, in relation to inflation and interest rates.  There are worrying trends developing in relation to both.  I see no steps being undertaken to counter these trends.</P>
    <P>If those trends continue they will have a very serious impact on both farmers and the food industry.  Without getting into any political argument, the 1982-87 Coalition Government made remarkable progress in relation to interest rates and inflation.  They made enormous progress in regard to inflation, bringing it down from over 20 per cent to 3 per cent.  I <Col N="655" /> admit that that substantial progress was continued by the last Government but the hard won gains of the last six or seven years, on both the inflation and interest rate fronts, must be protected.  I see no evidence of any action being taken by this Government to counter these present worrying trends which were highlighted again this morning by the Davy report.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the joint programme for Government to inspire any confidence on the part of the farmers or of the food industry.  In particular, there is no reference in that programme to the crisis facing our cereal producers and neither is there any reference in the Minister's speech to this crisis.  When the new cereal regime was being negotiated I favoured a national quota, that was not to be, it was there for milk and for sugar though perhaps we would have been as well off without it, but in the sector where we really needed it the Minister was unable to negotiate it.  We now have a European wide stabiliser regime with the 116 million tonne threshold.  We are very small in European terms competing with the huge producers in the Po Valley, in East Anglia and in the Paris Basin.  They, of course, are able to sustain a low price policy until the small producers are squeezed out.  We are first in the firing line.  Obviously there is need for a new policy.  We have about 15,000 cereal producers in this country of which about 3,000 are full time specialists.  If the present policy continues they will be pauperised.  We need a new system of supply management with reasonable quotas and, of course, head on will have to be tackled the question of imported cereal substitutes.  It is ridiculous that there should be pressure on EC and Irish producers in a situation where cereal substitutes can be produced <i>ad lib</i> on American farms and imported into the Community.</P>
    <P>There has been no serious attempt to tackle the major problem in the beef industry.  In fairness, the Minister referred to it in his speech but, apparently, he has failed to convince the EC of the need for change, merely saying <Col N="656" /> that the matter is being looked at and that a report will be produced that will not solve the problem for the winter fattener. Where is the report?  When will we get it?  What action will follow?  It is clear that the profitability in that area has been reduced to zero.  Let us not just talk about a report at this stage.  We need to know what urgent action will be taken to deal with the problem of seasonality.  That is not only a problem for the farmers, it is also a problem in the meat plants.  If you want a food industry you need continuity of supply.  The scale of seasonality is such that it is clear that this question must be addressed much more forcibly at this stage.</P>
    <P>Talking about the meat plants raises another issue to which I would like to refer briefly.  I want to know what steps are being taken to deal with the various complaints of irregularities in relation to beef intervention, to APS and export refunds.  We have made it very clear that not alone must justice be done but it must be seen to be done.  We have made a proposal for the establishment of an independent agency under the Department of Agriculture to take responsibility for the enforcement of law.  The establishment of an executive office might be the way to do it but clearly, there is an onus on the Government to ensure that there is equality before the law.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the dairy industry.  There was, of course, great interest in his announcement concerning the 1 per cent increase in quota to cater for special categories.  There was no emphasis in the announcement of the fact that the 1 per cent came from a permanent reduction in part of the quota which is temporarily suspended.  As I see it that is a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul.  Has the Minister done anything to reactivate the protocol achieved by his predecessor, Deputy Deasy, to ensure that Ireland would get preferential treatment in the allocation of any additional Community quota.</P>
    <P>A few short words are necessary also in relation to the extension of the disadvantaged areas.  I do not have time to go into it in detail.  After two-and-a-half <Col N="657" /> years surely some positive statement could be made at this stage.  We have had promises and, admittedly, we have a survey underway but at this stage patience is running out.  The question is whether there is any real commitment to taking the necessary steps to extend the disadvantaged areas and to pay the headage in those areas.  I believe there is major scope for a very substantial increase in the severly handicapped areas without putting any extra burden on the Exchequer.  This is because of the 75 per cent recoupment which may now be obtained.  There is also a case to be made for classifying the balance of the country as less severly handicapped.</P>
    <P>Pollution is another area which needs to be touched on even in the short time available to us.  I think that the Minister, at this stage, is contributing to pollution because he has handled the question of increased grants in a hamfisted way. There is a proposal announced by the Minister to seek approval for increased grants outside the disadvantaged areas but this has not yet been negotiated.  We are now in the position where anybody outside the disadvantaged areas would be mad to go ahead with anti-pollution measures pending the finalisation of the increased grants.  There is a very simple solution.  The Minister should clearly state that any increased grants that will be obtained will be available as and from now and let the work proceed.  We can proceed with the work in this fine weather whereas it might not be easy to do so in winter.</P>
    <P>In relation to animal disease I gather that a number of problems have arisen in relation to the scientific basis for measuring disease.  I would have liked if the Minister had told us something about the new sampling system and where the problems have arisen in connection with that. The Minister should also refer to the continuing conflict between his own Department and the Forest and Wildlife Service in regard to badgers.  I know this is an emotive and thorny issue and that it is a difficult one but that is no reason to evade it.  In the UK they had the Dunnet report and they came up with a clear policy on <Col N="658" /> this problem.  Here the Minister and the Government will have to face this issue and lay down and establish a clear policy.</P>
    <P>In regard to brucellosis the Minister might also have told us about the present problems.  I understand that 90 herds are now infected with brucellosis.  What is the Minister's policy in that regard?  Is he considering a change over to a vaccination policy?  They are the issues he should have referred to.  In regard to the new regulations, I take it from the Minister that they would have been fully approved by the farm organisations and on that basis there is certainly a case, in the light of the urgency, to allow the new regulation through.  May I mention a few other points, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in the few minutes remaining.</P>

      <P>I am not happy with the references to Teagasc referred to in the Fianna Fáil manifesto which merely say that this body was set up.  It is very clear that morale is low in Teagasc and also that there is a deficit looming for 1989.  It is clear, too, that the problems there have not been sorted out.  I would have thought that the Minister would have given us an indication of a serious commitment to the development of Teagasc now that it has been cut down to its present size.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about the progress made by Bord Glas.  That is a total charade. We are two-and-a-half years down the road since the initial announcement was made and after all the trumpeting nothing has been achieved.  Legislation has not been produced, the board's effectiveness has been minimal.  Therefore, the Minister should review the position in regard to Borad Glas and come up with a more coherent policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final point I should like to raise relates to CBF.  In referring to the figures in the Estimate I have not, as you will appreciate a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, been pressing for additional expenditure, but within the Estimate surely it would have been possible to maintain the grant <Col N="659" /> to CBF.  If our future is in marketing, in selling our goods abroad surely it is a very shortsighted policy to cut by half the grant to CBF.  Obviously, there is a major gap between the rhetoric and the real commitment to marketing.  I urge the Minister to reconsider that approach the amount involved is not great but the returns to the country could be very great.  Taking all those circumstances into account I find it impossible to agree this Estimate and so must oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with others in welcoming the Minister back.  I wish him well for his new term in office.</P>
      <P>In the Estimate the Minister has presented to the House, I regret that he has not indicated any change of heart from the policies he was implementing in the previous administration.  That augurs badly for the future of agriculture.  It is common practice for Opposition spokespersons to oppose.  That is easy to understand when the Minister brings in this kind of Estimate but the sum total of socialism cannot be expressed in persistent opposition to conservative Government Ministers.</P>
      <P>We accept the new Government's aspiration to last the full term of four years.  I wish to state at the outset that it is not my intention to spend this term opposing what the Minister does or does not do.  Socialists cannot expect much of a hearing if they simply use Parliament as a forum for mere opposition.  Admittedly, our parliamentary institutions force Opposition parties, especially socialist parties, into this mould.  It is not a forum where conflicting proposals are brought forward and debated.  Instead, the Government propose and the Opposition oppose.  Socialists in Parliament must find a way out of this particular trap. This will be a challenge for socialists in this House over the next four years.  Not alone must we oppose conservative and right wing proposals and legislation, but we must avail of this forum to put forward a positive socialist alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimates the Minister brought forward have a certain logic.  After the <Col N="660" /> emasculation of the badly needed and essential research services, after excluding thousands of smallholders and poor farmers from the advisory services, after abandoning any form of land policy despite the previous sound Fianna Fáil policy in that regard, after encouraging monopoly interests to gobble up our food processing industries and ignoring the overwhelming demand of farmers and PAYE workers for a fair system of farm taxation and after refusing to face up to the deterioration in the quality of our food products, these Estimates have a certain twisted obscene logic.  They represent two and a half years of ignoring the massive structural defects in our food production and processing industries.</P>
    <P>I am not experienced in Cabinet infighting over departmental funding, but by any comparison the Minister for Agriculture and Food has lost our very heavily. The following will clearly demonstrate the point I make.  The Department of Agriculture and Food's Estimate has been slashed by over 18 per cent in real terms over the past two years, whereas overall Government expenditure has been reduced by 8.8 per cent in real terms.  Agriculture has been cut by twice as much as overall Government expenditure.  Education and advisory services have been hit hardest; Teagasc, AFT and ACOTs budgets have been cut by 23.9 per cent in real terms over two years and this was overseen by the Minister. Family and working farmers have been the main victims of these policies while ranchers and the agri-combines flourish.  How far have we come from the old Fianna Fáil policy of breaking up or stripping the ranches, or from their 1981 White Paper on land policy?  Of course, the Minister will point out the financial situation in which we find ourselves and will point to the so-called rationalisation that has taken place, the spending increases in production aids, etc.  He may also point to the calf twinning experiment or to anything he wants, but the fact remains that under this Government, and during his period in office, agriculture has suffered more than any other Department. The fact remains that for a sector <Col N="661" /> which is in desperate need of investment and restructuring at both the farm gate and in the processing sector, this Government have seen agriculture as a prime area for cutbacks.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will be opposing these Estimates not only because of the expenditure reduction but because the Estimates represent the logical conclusion of the Government policy to which I have referred.  I would like our opposition to be clear.  Our opposition represents an alternative programme for agriculture for working family farmers, for the food processing industry and industrial workers and for the consumer, but most of all, our opposition is part of the alternative politics that are now emerging and which people got a taste of in the last election.  Where the left ran candidates more than 20 per cent of the people voted for the socialist option.  This figure will continue to grow as the left grows as a national force.  The agricultural and farming sector will become a key part of that socialist option.  Socialism is an open conspiracy which invites everyone to join and does not hide its intentions from its enemies.</P>
    <P>I am a practical and pragmatic politician. I am not suggesting that a socialist society, for which I strive, is on the current political agenda.  I find that regrettable, but what is on the agenda is a popular alliance of working men and women from all sectors of society&mdash;from factories, offices, homes, towns and country and essentially the farms throughout the land.</P>
    <P>I believe that an alliance led by socialists and with a progressive programme of work, democracy and equality, is on the agenda.  Within this alliance working and family farmers have an important, indeed, a vital role to play.  Their demands are moderate: land, an opportunity to produce wealth, a decent standard of living and security for themselves and their families which are the same as those of workers in any other sector.  The day is soon coming that to be a farmer and a socialist will be a natural part of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government have shown in these <Col N="662" /> Estimates and by their actions over the past two years that they have nothing to offer working farmers but poverty. emigration and under development.  That working farmers have a vital role to play in this new progressive alliance makes it incumbent on socialists to bury for ever their anti-farmer reactions.  These attitudes play into the hands of the most reactionary elements of society who do not want to see working men and women unite behind progressive politics.  It is for this reason, to create a united socialist approach to the issue of agriculture, that I invite spokespersons and representatives of The Workers' Party and other socialist parliamentary representatives to discuss these issues so that we can construct a common approach and together create a new progressive movement which will give a proper role to working farmers.  Of course, there are other politicians in this House who will pose as the alternative to the policies of this Government.  We have already heard Fine Gael talk about the just society, social democracy, in an attempt to win back their lost working class vote.  For this base electoral advantage, I believe they will say anything to anybody.  They will attempt to be all things to all people.  They will turn left and turn right and will look straight down the middle from their full colour posters. They are the most reactionary political party in Ireland today.  I say that without any doubt or fear of contradiction.  They are firmly rooted in the most anti-democratic movement this country has ever known.  They are hypocrites and are very dangerous.  No matter which way they turn they will not fool anybody.</P>

      <P>They are now without a political reason for their existence since their place has been taken by others. Their place is now occupied by what was previously populist Fianna Fáil with their new alliance with the right wing Progressive Democrats.  Time and time again working men and women in the cities, towns and rural areas have rejected their <Col N="663" /> reactionary policies and they will continue to do so.  Their real constituency is the powerful, the privileged and the reactionary interests.  Their pseudosocial democracy and false high moral tones are a sham, and nothing more or less than a sham.  The more the Fine Gael Party continue to attack us, the more we will grow until we overthrow the entrenched, the privileged and the reactionary interests they represent.</P>
      <P>In conclusion. the Labour Party are opposing these Estimates.  But this opposition is already preparing the ground for new politics, politics that will include all wrokers, wherever they work or wherever they create wealth for their country or their fellow workers.  The new politics is socialist politics and they will eventually win the day with farmers as with others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the foundation of the State agricultural policy has been preoccupied with maximising the incomes received by farmers.  This is understandable but it also reflects a tendency to see agriculture as an industry in its own right rather than simply the first stage of an integrated sequence combined with processing and marketing. The primary objective of Government policy should be to establish the productive practices among farmers which are most conducive to effective processing and marketing.  For example, the Irish dairy industry is currently characterised by a massive glut of milk during the summer months and this requires a high level of processing capacity with the result that much of the plant is lying idle for the rest of the year.  This imposes heavy costs on the processing sector. Lack of continuity of supply during the year also means that the processing sector cannot diversify into any other consumer products with short shelf life, such as soft cheeses.  Similarly, Irish farmers seem unable to grasp the importance of properly graded and presented produce which is essential if reliable and dependable long-term market outlets are to be secured. <Col N="664" /> People may ask what is the point of expanding agricultural output when the EC Common Agricultural Policy is being dismantled, quotas are being imposed and agricultural prices are dropping. This, of course, is a defeatist attitude which should be rejected as Ireland has the natural advantage to produce competitively priced agricultural products provided the industry is properly managed. The required transformation of Irish agriculture would involve direct State intervention of a kind not seen before and more selective use of public money.  Over the years hundreds of millions of pounds in grants have been given to farmers without ever asking them to justify these grants.  In other words, targets do not have to be reached before the money is paid out, unlike the position with regard to the manufacturing industry where the IDA pay out grants on a phased basis according as agreed targets are reached.</P>
      <P>What is required is an integrated and comprehensive development plan for agricultural production, processing and marketing, whose central objective would be to maximise the overall contribution of the sector to the Irish economy in terms of income generated and employment created.  The immediate aim should be a policy designed to maximise usable output from our natural land resource in order to provide the materials for an expanded processing sector.  In the case of small farms, this requires a programme of consolidation of holdings in order to create new farm units capable of providing a family with a reasonable standard of living by working these units alone.  It should be noted that research has shown that medium sized units of this kind tend to be the most efficient farms in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we believe is needed is the establishment of a farm and food development authority to formulate and implement a comprehensive and integrated development plan covering agricultural production, marketing and processing.  The authority would achieve this by including all relevant organisations, agencies and groups within its planning ambit.  It <Col N="665" /> should be a statutory agency on the lines of the IDA, located outside the central Civil Service structure.  The authority would be an executive agency answerable to a board comprising the main agricultural interest groups, such as the IFA, the ICMSA, the co-ops, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions' representatives and the relevant Government Departments as well as representatives of consumer groups and environmental interests.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out by the Telesis consultancy group's review of Irish industrial policy, Ireland has significant natural advantages in terms of certain forms of agricultrual production.  However, poor links between production, processing and marketing have prevented us from exploiting these advantages to anything like the full extent.  These deficiencies are not likely to come right of their own accord and hence the need for an energetic State intervention in the overall national interest.  The agricultural sector has accounted for a large share of State expenditure in the form of grants and subsidies over many decades.  This gives the State a strong lever with which to influence investment in the sector.  In addition, of course, there are a number of State companies which are directly involved in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Over the years many State schemes and agencies have been established to promote agriculture in one form or other. These have developed in a largely uncoordinated fashion and in some instances have been mutually contradictory.  Now is the time for a complete overhaul and reappraisal of our national approach to agricultural development.  Rationalisation and co-ordination of existing agencies and schemes in the context of the formulation of an overall long term plan involving the establishment of a farm and food development authority is an urgent necessity if the country's greatest natural resource is to begin to make a contribution to tackling the problems of poverty and unemployment, of which it is capable.</P>
    <P>Change is coming whether we like it or <Col N="666" /> not.  The days of the Common Agricultural Policy are numbered.  The Common Agricultural Policy benefits only a few anyway, as was pointed out in the Combat Poverty Agency report last year.  That report highlighted the widespread poverty still being experienced by many farming families.  In addition, the Common Agricultural Policy adds hugely to consumer bills, by as much as £16 to £18 per week.  That amount of money is being added to the consumer bill of a family of three or four, the same people who pay the taxes which subsidise the Common Agricultural Policy.  A small percentage of the cash is going to farmers but the wealthiest people, 25 per cent, receive 75 per cent of the benefits from the Common Agricultural Policy.  That is a scandal in a country where the standard of living is so low for so many people.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the disadvantaged areas scheme, and I support that coming from an area which fits the criteria of a disadvantaged area.  If that area was included it would mean that many people could hold on to their family farms.  There is no alternative employment for people who are forced to leave the land.  Consequently no effort should be spared to include, as quickly as possible, those areas which qualify as disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>Quite recently I heard an announcement that the bacon industry in my area was to receive substantial grant aid but underlying that was the fact that no extra jobs would be created.  We are concentrating too much on technology and making bigger profits.  It is about time we provided for job creation in the agricultural area rather than rationalisation as is the case at present.  Irish agriculture is at a crossroads.  Crucial decisions must be made as to whether Irish agriculture will remain under-developed or if it can make a real contribution to the development of our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to make a few points on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Food.  First, I <Col N="667" /> congratulate the Minister on his reappointment. All sides of the House recognise the effort he has made during the last two years not alone here but in the Council Chambers in Brussels and we welcome that greatly.  I pay tribute to the work he and his Ministers of State have done.</P>
      <P>After 16 years in politics I can say that anyone keeping a close eye on the agricultural scene over the last two years will have seen the many demands from the farming organisations to discuss a wide variety of problems, as they saw them, which beset the agricultural community. Never was there less need to discuss this than since the last election.  We had payment for off-farm workers, the beef cow scheme, grants for anti-pollution measures brought forward under the western package and increase in payment for ERAD which the Minister achieved so quickly and efficiently when he saw the need was there.  In practically all those areas the response was there and the inclination was to meet the problems and solve them.  Irrespective of what other speakers say, that was a very positive approach to one of our most important areas to which we will be looking in the years ahead for job creation and to secure additional revenue through exports.</P>
      <P>None of the areas mentioned by the Minister is more important than the diary industry which has been beset by problems, takeovers and so on.  We have been talking here for years about the need to move from butter production into other product areas and this year alone we have seen a 19 per cent reduction in butter production but there was an increase in other areas.  For example, cheese manufacture increased by 30 per cent.  At a by-election about ten years ago in one of the prime dairy areas of Europe in Country Cork, a number of times I asked for cheese when we were taking our tea.  We could not produce cheese there, yet we were trying to sell it abroad.  That product change is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Welcome too is the movement away <Col N="668" /> from intervention.  We have to agree with hindsight that intervention did serious damage in many areas.  While it was necessary, it was over-played.  I worked in a co-operative for a number of years. The co-operative were inclined to churn the milk, make butter and move it into intervention.  They got a quick return from An Bord Bainne for their product and did not have to take a chance in going out to the market.  The reduction in intervention of milk and meat gave an incentive to the manufacturers to go out and sell in the market place and they have done it very effectively in the milk area.</P>
    <P>One matter which gives cause for concern is the quota system which has had such a serious effect in small farming areas.  In the eighties, people who were only moving into milk production were caught with very small quotas.  I know the Minister is very anxious to ensure that our young farmers who have hopelessly small quotas, and some who have none at all, will have a future in dairying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Another matter that must be welcomed is the Minister's approach to deal with seasonality in beef production which is a cause of serious concern.  A continuation of reduced prices in winter or spring for beef would mean a glut at the end of the grazing season.  Not alone would it have serious consequences for our processors in meeting their market for fresh meat for export, but it would mean very poor prices in the glut period.  Many of us hoped that the calf beef scheme under the western package would have dealt partially at least with seasonality in beef. Efforts have been made down the years to have a contractual production system between the producers and the processors, but seemingly it has come to nought.  I welcome the Minister's decision to make an all out effort to ensure that the seasonality element is reduced as much as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing that has been brought home to us in the last couple of years is the <Col N="670" /> importance of the breeding stock, be it cattle, pigs, sheep or poultry.  Anyone who visits meat plants and watches the slaughter of animals and the Department officials grading and stamping the carcases will very soon realise the importance of carcase conformity, etc.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's words regarding the pig industry where it is hoped output will be increased to three million pigs over a number of years.  In the last few months there has been a substantial increase in pig prices.  A serious effort has been made by a number of processors and a large processor is my constituency has set up one of the finest and most hygienic plants in Europe for pigmeat production.  During the past few months there has been continuing discussion on the need to produce the best quality sheep.</P>
    <P>Poultry producers have also been talking about the importance of breeding and hygiene.  The Minister mentioned egg production.  Unfortunately at the end of last year we had the salmonella scare which was more fiction than fact.  To an extent it was played up.  We must be very satisfied by the Department's approach in the voluntary code of practice.  They will be monitoring egg production on a continuing basis.  There were very serious effects on up 100 producers in my constituency. It is worth pointing out that home producers now command 85 per cent of the market while only a few years ago we were asking Ministers to ensure a reduction in imports because of the effects of such imports on home producers. I have no doubt that the proportion of the market commanded by home producers will have increased substantially by this time next year.</P>
    <P>Money from the Structural Funds gives us an opportunity to re-examine the rural structure and consider the development of alternative farm enterprises.  Many areas of development have been mentioned but they need to be examined closely.  Anomalies and problems have arisen, especially in regard to rabbit production and the production of goat's milk.  The mare premium introduced by the Minister is to be welcomed and this <Col N="671" /> seems to be one of the more positive areas of alternative farm enterprise.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister announced the rural tourism scheme.  This is an ideal opportunity to generate extra money on small farms which do not yield a family income.  The tourism measures in the western package are welcome and I hope this will be one of the key areas for development.</P>
    <P>Regarding the reclassification of disadvantaged areas, I hope special emphasis will be put on the remaining areas of Connacht-Ulster so that they will get what is due to them.</P>
    <P>The former Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Séamus Kirk, must be satisfied with the results of his efforts during the past few years.  Nowhere is the success of these efforts more visible than in mushroom production in my constituency. This success is due to efficiency, proper hygiene and attention to detail.  There is no room in mushroom production for the careless man who half does a job, but the person who acts responsible gets a reasonably good return.  Well in excess of 1,000 jobs have resulted from such enterprises.  Ireland has a very good image in areas where the product is distributed. I regularly meet people coming from England who admire the quality of the Irish mushroom.  The system of distribution is second to none and one firm now commands 8 per cent of the market.  The Minister must be satisfied at the success in this area in recent years.</P>
    <P>I always felt that the withholding of grants from milk producers was a serious anomaly.  If a producer exceeded his quota in any year the grant was withheld. The Minister has changed this system and, quietly and effectively, has eliminated the anomaly so that people can obtain their grants.</P>
    <P>There is serious concern regarding the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis.  The Minister spoke about 15,000 herds being affected.  There has been a serious breakdown recently in my immediate area.  There have been discussions about badgers and so on but it <Col N="672" /> is not possible for a vet or a Department official to identify the source of the problem.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his reappointment and wish him every success.  Perhaps I could also extend good wishes to his former Ministers of State who I hope will be reinstated.  I might be tempted to reply to the outbrust from the Labour spokesman but I do not think it would serve the interests of agriculture or the agri-food industry.  For that reason I do not propose to respond.  The constructive approach of Deputy Sherlock was probably the real reason for the tirade.</P>
      <P>During his term of office I hope the Minister and his Department will respond somewhat more quickly to situations as they arise.  Before I continue I would like, if I may, to share my time with Deputy Paul Connaughton who wants five minutes.</P>

      <P>In regard to Teagasc we entered the financial year with a particular set of circumstances but as the year progressed we found that Teagasc was sadly deficient in funding and staffing which had been redeployed in all directions because of financial constraints.  I have all the sympathy in the world for the Chairman.  When he was acting in another capacity he was very outspoken as to what should be done to solve the problems in agriculture.  Now that he is on the other side of the fence I wonder about the frustration he must suffer as a result of being unable to do the things that he knows are necessary.  The Minister has departed from the House but I am sure the points we are raising will be taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer also to the food industry and the proposals for job creation.  I am at last justified in some of the things I have said over the past year or year and a half as a result of the IDA review of its proposals in relation to the food industry <Col N="673" /> and its job creation plans, particularly the Goodman expansion programme.  I remember asking parliamentary questions here and being reassured by the Minister for Agriculture and Food that everything was on target.  It has taken until now for people to realise that what we on this side of the House were saying was correct, that despite all the media hype, despite all the promises, no jobs were created and nothing worthwhile has happened in regard to this project which was to give 6,500 jobs over a four-year period.  There is no possible chance of achieving that.  As a matter of fact, there have been job losses in practically every area where there were proposals for expansion in respect of the food industry.</P>
    <P>In the short time available to me I would like to refer also to the question of disease eradication and its importance from the point of view of the food industry and food exports.  This country has established a very high reputation with regard to hygiene, the purity of its products and its disease-free status over a long number of years.  That prestige is based on a slaughtering policy whereby whenever disease was detected the response was to slaughter and contain the epidemic. In the past couple of years there have been a number of new, highly contagious and dangerous diseases in cattle, sheep and pigs.  This is highly threatening from the point of view of the future of our exports in the agricultural area.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed at the response of the Minister and the Department in regard to how they should deal with those issues.  The simple answer is isolation, containment, slaughter and compensation. Without that recipe the problem cannot be dealt with.  People will not respond and admit they have a problem in their farm or holding unless there is some incentive to do so.  The only way to deal with an epidemic is by quick action, to isolate, contain, slaughter and compensate. There is no other way.  In some pensate of the country there were outbreaks which should have been contained promptly but which were allowed to go on for months or weeks.  The former Minister of State knows the areas I have in mind &mdash;<Col N="674" /> I do not wish to be more specific than that &mdash; but it is not satisfactory that the whole matter should have been allowed to drag on.  It should have been cleared up within a week.  If we want to preserve the good name of our agricultural industry abroad we must deal with these problems. It all depends on what we are capable of doing ourselves.</P>
    <P>I asked a number of questions in the last Dáil as to whether the Minister intended to introduce regulations governing the food industry with particular reference to 1992 and to mergers and takeovers and the numbers that might take place in the run-up to 1992.  I was always reassured that there was no necessity to worry about this, that it was a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He may not be so quick to devolve responsibility in that area now.  Certainly in the previous Dáil that was the usual answer.  This came up again in the last couple of days.  In the past couple of days the Minister has suddenly conceded that in the new programme for government there is a proposal to introduce into domestic law provisions similar to articles 85 and 86.  It is amazing what a few weeks and an election campaign can do.</P>
    <P>Those are just a couple of things I wanted to mention.  There are others like, for instance, the need for the introduction of a national milk agency.  The Minister has procrastinated long enough, turned it around, shuffled and boxed the cards several times but still has not played them.  Let him, for Heaven's sake, deal out the deck and let us see it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to get this opportunity to say a few words on this Estimate.  As the House is well aware, agriculture is very important to our economy and it is a pity we do not have longer to debate the Estimates. However, that is the way these things are done and there will be other opportunities to deal at greater length with the various aspects of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short time at my disposal this evening there are two important aspects of the Estimate I want to refer to.  The first is to pick up on where Deputy <Col N="675" /> Durkan left off in regard to the food sector.  In the last Fianna Fáil Government there was a great ballyhoo about what they were going to do in relation to the food industry.  The Minister of State, Deputy Walsh, created a great impression at the beginning of the two years.  One could not pick up a single magazine but there was the Deputy smiling out at one.  I have no doubt at all that the man had great ideas but there was no money to finance them and nobody thought out where exactly the money. would be spent, who would spend it and what the eventual result would be.  The Department of Food is not just a headline; it has to be backed up by direct funding and all the things that go with such a Department.  It has not been successful expect in one or two areas that I will come back to later.</P>
    <P>The lynchpin in that programme was when the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and some other Ministers got hold of Larry Goodman &mdash; or he got hold of them &mdash; and the greatest operation ever in the meat sector was launched.  There was talk about this wonderful expansion, that Ireland would never be the same again because of this huge expansion by the Goodman International organisation.  I want to make it clear that I like to see huge expansion by anybody as long as the farmer gets a better price for his product and people are put to work but, as Deputy Durkan rightly pointed out, we did not get a single job out of that whole thing.  Part of that package was the Government's way of compensating the people of Tuam for the loss of the sugar factory.  Since then a lot of water has flowed under the bridge and a factory five times the size of the factory in Thurles has been closed by the outgoing administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of sugar has melted since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving all that aside, this was the way that Tuam would get a replacement factory.  We were told by several Ministers at the time and since <Col N="676" /> and by the Goodman organisation that the first new factory to be built would be built in Tuam.  Five days ago, out of the blue, the managing director of the IDA announced that there was to be an internal review of the future of that investment by the IDA and the Goodman International group.  I am long enough around to know that when a review is announced it will be a review downwards. Will the Minister for Agriculture and Food clarify if the rumours circulating are correct, that Goodman are not coming to Tuam?  In fairness, the people of Tuam and of the west generally are entitled to know whether the Government and or Goodman are going to renege on that promise.  It is important that the Minister when replying will let us know what is happening.</P>
      <P>There was a lot of hype about the fact that the planning permission ran into trouble, but now all that has been settled and An Bord Pleanála have come down in favour of the Goodman group.  If the Goodman group were as interested in building meat factories as they are in acquiring creameries, the factory at Tuam would have been built two years ago.  It looks as if it is creameries and not meat factories that they want.</P>
      <P>I thank the Chair for his forebearance and I hope the Minister will be able to say whether Goodman are actually coming to Tuam.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy Tom Foxe.  I congratulate the Minister and the Government on their decision to grant cattle headage payments to all farmers in disadvantaged areas.  This was a major breakthrough.  For years we have been lobbying for these grants for part time farmers in the west.  Small farmers who happened to work in forestry or in the <Col N="677" /> county council did not qualify for headage grants and that was a shame.  I am glad that as and from 1 January 1990 all farmers will qualify for cattle headage payments.  I congratulate the men whose wives were working, which meant that they were not entitled to headage payments although they were full time farmers, on winning their case in the High Court so as to qualify for headage payments. I am delighted the Minister has honoured that decision.</P>
      <P>Small farmers who in 1983 were only sending small amounts of milk to dairies cannot now get an extra quota.  I am not talking about farmers with up to 30,000 gallons quota but about farmers with 2,000 and 3,000 gallons quota.  The big and medium-size dairy farmers have quite a good living from sending milk to creameries or co-ops.  I hope the Minister will try to facilitate the smaller farmers in getting extra milk quotas so that they can raise their standard of living.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the agri-tourism grant as that sector is big and will grow.  Agri-tourism will bring money into the economy and, therefore, it is a good thing if farmers can get grants to build extra rooms in their houses and so on.  A man in my constituency is involved in agri-tourism.  People, mostly Germans, come to him on holidays in a package deal which includes bed and breakfast, a packed lunch, evening meal, and the use of a horse for the day.  From that business this man is earning approximately £300 a week.  That is extra money coming into the country while giving value to tourists.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that there are approximately 6,000 hectares of land still to be divided by the Land Commission by the end of this year.  I hope this land will be divided fairly among small farmers who are entitled to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. Foxe Mr. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, on his reappointment to the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the document presented to us we see that the family farm income in 1987 has increased by 31 per cent since 1986 and that it increased by a further 27 per <Col N="678" /> cent in 1988 over 1987.  We should look at those figures soberly.  The base year being used was 1986 but the income in that year had been down by approximately 28 per cent on 1984.  If incomes increased in 1987 and 1988 the increase was badly needed after the bad years prior to that.</P>
    <P>I see that an incentive of £20 per cow will be paid to farmers who participate in twinning technology.  That is desirable but £20 per cow is meagre enough since this business is really only in its experimental stage.  However, the increase in the premium for horses is welcome and very badly needed.</P>
    <P>In the meat and by-product processing sector, a sector with tremendous potential for the future, it is desirable that all animals be processed and that we have no live exports.  However, the one sobering thing about live exports is that it keeps tabs on the factories so that they have to compete and give the right price for the animals.  It was shown in the past that if we had no live export trade the factories could have a monopoly and the price to the farmers would be drastically reduced, consequently reducing their incomes.  It is good to see the EC carrying out a study on the seasonality of production in this country.  Traditionally, this is the way it has been done and I can see no change in the foreseeable future.  It is not on from a farmer's point of view to have more even production throughout the year.  This can be done but it would not be feasible given the extra work, the cost involved and the remuneration they would receive at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>We have now reached the stage where most of our hides are exported to England and tanned into leather, which we then buy back.  Back in the sixties we had 26 tanneries but now we have only one minor one.</P>
    <P>In relation to disease eradication, there is an increase of £4 million this year over last year, which may appear generous to those unfamiliar with the farming scene. However, a farmer who loses seven or eight cattle, worth in the region of £6,000 to a factory could lose up to £2,000 on the deal because of their unfinished state. <Col N="679" /> Therefore, this figure is not the most generous the Minister could provide.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that the agri-food business is one of the biggest employment creating sectors.  It is a £5.5 billion industry and employs almost one-quarter of the total employed in the manufacturing sector.  Therefore, when we support agriculture and farming let us not forget that we are not only supporting farmers, we are also supporting industry which is very badly needed.  Since it uses native raw material we should do everything possible to support that industry and to create as many jobs as possible in processing the product.</P>
    <P>In relation to agri-tourism, there is a future for us.  Unfortunately, people involved in this sector, in particular farm guest house owners, during the past two years have seen their incomes reduced to nil because of the rod licence dispute, which I hope will be resolved shortly.  It is possible it will not be resolved before the end of the season and this will mean that two seasons will have passed by without people who spent money on doing up their houses receiving any income.  As well as this, some bad feeling has built up.  I hope very shortly this dispute will be resolved.</P>
    <P>The Government's programme lays special emphasis on farm efficiency, product quality, environmental protection, rural development and support for disadvantaged areas.  All of these are very worthy aims but the fact of the matter is that the body who provided the most up-to-date information on modern technology to the farming community has had its staff decimated in recent years.  I am referring of course to ACOT, now Teagasc.  Further reductions are taking place at present.  I do not see how we can achieve farm efficiency without first of all providing farmers with the necessary knowledge.  Instead of reducing the numbers further I suggest that the number of staff in Teagasc should be increased.</P>
    <P>We are now moving into a new era in agriculture, as we are in all sectors of the economy.  By 1992 many changes will have taken place.  We should place more <Col N="680" /> emphasis on supporting home-based industries &mdash; let us place hope in the foreign industries also&mdash;which use native raw material.  This is certainly true in the case of the agricultural industry and every support going should be given to that industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is agreed, I hope to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Ryan.  He probably wants three or four minutes.  I understand the Minister is due to reply at 7.55 p.m.</P>
      <P>In discussing this Estimate for £154 million for the Department of Agriculture and Food I, too, would like to congratulate the Minister on his reappointment and to point out to him that agriculture is above politics and it is my role and that of the Labour Party to ensure that we keep him on his toes. We want to ensure that he realises when dealing with socialists in Europe, which he does quite often, that they are a constructive group of politicians.  The chairman of Teagasc should also be aware of this as he also deals with socialists although in Ireland and apparently, he does not like them.</P>
      <P>In this debate the role played by the former Ministers of State, Deputies Kirk and Walsh, has been recognised and I, too, would like to express my appreciation for the excellent work they have done in this Department, particularly in the area of legislation.  When I was a Member of the Seanad I dealt with them on a regular basis.  I hope they will be reappointed as they took a refreshing look at most of the problems facing agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of these problems stem from the milk quota régime.  An agreed socialist programme in regard to this matter states that where production controls have been set up account must be taken of the importance of milk production in the economy of the various countries.  Where is it more important than in Ireland to have regard for milk <Col N="681" /> production?  We can produce milk more efficiently and cheaply than any other country in Europe, yet we are strangled by the milk quota system.  Despite the Minister's efforts, which he has outlined today, young farmers have little hope of getting into milk production.  Who would have thought the day would come in Ireland when a small farmer supplying milk to a creamery in December would be told that he would not receive his milk cheque, until the following April or May?  What will happen this year, given the drought, I do not know but certainly at present young farmers are unable to get into milk production under the present milk quota régime which also acts as a disincentive for farmers in milk production to increase their production through improved farming methods.</P>
    <P>Teagasc stated there has been a 27 per cent increase in farm incomes.  It is impossible to identify the source of this information.  As my comrade Deputy Stagg said, Teagasc are only dealing with the higher echelons in the farming organisations and with the highest income earners. There is no data on the incomes of small farmers.  Teagasc are not being approached by small farmers as they cannot afford their services any more. Therefore, these figures are not in keeping with what is perceived to be the position in rural Ireland where there is much poverty.  The most recent figures indicate that many farmers have incomes below the average social welfare income.</P>
    <P>That leads to the question of how we can support incomes in rural Ireland where people want to stay on the land and do not want to go into the villages and towns looking for work which is not there.  It should be the policy of the new Government to extend and reclassify the disadvantaged areas and to make some progress in that regard.  Certainly, the Minister attended public meetings before this and the last election at which he promised a dynamic approach to reclassification of the disadvantaged areas, reclassifying the existing areas and bringing in new areas.  In spite of the promises made, with farmers being told that <Col N="682" /> increased grants would flow into their coffers last October, no new applications have been completed.  We understand from the Minister that he has made application but I am concerned because apart from the outline regulations laid down by the Community for disadvantaged areas this Government and the previous one brought in rules of their own which made it impossible for some people to qualify for these grants.  They have reduced the off-farm income allowed from over £6,000 to just over £5,000 while the comparable income in Germany is £25,000.  Why should our part-time farmers be at a disadvantage compared with our collegues in Germany as part of the Community?  It was this Government who laid down that regulation and not the Community.</P>
    <P>Likewise, they laid down restrictions about the level of population in areas so, in theory, they could redesignate the whole of Ireland and bring in regulations that would preclude people from within those designated areas from benefiting from this type of improvement for disadvantaged areas.  I regret that retrograde step.  I also regret that this Government and the previous one have not addressed the problem of land tax which is a major issue.  If it is not approached properly, it will still act as a disincentive.</P>
    <P>In the area of disease eradication, I endeavoured to raise the matter of a particular disease this morning on the Order of Business.  I have been involved since Father Hayes introduced a pilot scheme for disease eradication in Bansha, back in the fifties, before there was any Department of Agriculture interest in such a scheme.  He stimulated that interest through the concept of Muintir na Tíire. At that time farmers were compensated by replacement of the reactors.  Nowadays they are at a total loss as a result of this scheme.  The Department have not applied the proper plans for epidemiology to ensure that the disease can be specifically traced.  Farmers are not prepared to put any funds into a scheme because they have been at a net loss as a result of the present scheme from the day <Col N="683" /> of its inception.  I hope the Minister's recent announcement in the areas of epidemiology will produce figures that will justify farmers participating as they did, voluntarily or otherwise, in the scheme up to now.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy O'Keeffe, I am concerned about the continuing outbreak of brucellosis.  Something more will have to be done in that area.  With regard to sheep disease in particular and the animal diseases Act of 1966, I suggested this morning on the Order of Business and by way of Adjournment debate that the Minister should designate a particular new disease of sheep &mdash; new in this country at least &mdash; which is jaasikite. This is a very serious sheep disease which causes extreme losses, with lung cancer lesions leading to emaciation and death among sheep flocks.  Two flocks numbering 570 sheep, in Donegal and Wicklow have been destroyed already.  It would cost at the moment approximately £1,500 to compensate for the losses if it was designated as a notifiable disease but, apart from compensation, the sheep industry is so important that there must be an obligation on those in veterinary practices and the flock owners to notify the Department of an outbreak of this disease.</P>

I shall not have another opportunity to speak on this matter before the House adjourns for the summer recess and it is important that the Minister apply himself with a little courage to this problem before irreparable damage is done to the sheep industry.  I had many other things <Col N="684" /> to say but I may say them in private in our constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I want to take this brief opportunity to make a plea for a group in my own constituency, the horticulaturalists in north County Dublin and particularly the tomato growers.  We have a great potential there and we appreciate the work done by the former Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, throughout the year. However, the whole tomato industry in north County Dublin comprising 60 acres under tomatoes and with potential for the employment of 6,000 people is at risk.</P>
      <P>The important topic is a return for the growers but at the moment the efforts they have made have not resulted in a satisfactory return.  It is not good enough that the price of tomatoes should be determined in auction in Holland.  The Dutch growers have a vested interest in this; there is not the slightest doubt about that.  If they are successful in knocking out our tomato industry over the next couple of years, they will have the market all to themselves.  It is a scandal that at a time when Irish growers are being told there is a glut and that they should not bring any more tomatoes to market, at 5 o'clock one morning last week in the market I saw Dutch tomatoes coming in. Last week the growers took action and dumped tomatoes, but I am not saying for one moment that I am at one with them in that respect.  It was felt to be the only action that could be taken to try to bring back some sort of sanity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish consumer will take a good quality Irish product.  Very great efforts have been made throughout the years to improve the quality of our tomatoes and other products of the horticultural industry. We must give the growers the encouragement they need.  They have invested <Col N="685" /> much, particularly with regard to the use of natural gas and we must see that they get a reasonable return.  I recognise the efforts of the former Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, over the years, but enough has not been done.  We must change the attitude of the Irish consumer and get the distributors and growers to have a national outlook.  This industry has great potential.  I hope the Minister can bring together the different strands to ensure that there is a future for this industry, not only in north County Dublin but in the country as a whole.  It is in these areas that there is potential for employment.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to thank all who have contributed to the debate, but particularly those who made their maiden speeches on agriculture in this House. Deputy Ferris, my fellow Tipperary man although not of the same constituency, Deputy Ryan and Deputy Foxe.  I regret that time constraints do not allow me to reply to some of the very interesting points made by them.</P>
      <P>I hope the House will understand I have to take two or three themes from what has emerged during the very interesting response on a very important Estimate.

Instead of keeping the 4.5 per cent as a national reserve for the needy and those who have a special right and entitlement &mdash; the small and young farmers &mdash; they gave a 4.5 per cent global increase to every quota holder so that someone with 100,000 gallons got an extra 4,500 gallons, the person who had 200,000 gallons got an extra 9,000 gallons, and the person with 10,000 gallons got an extra 450 gallons.</P>

I am glad to acknowledge that my French colleague is a socialist and we have a very warm, easy and effective relationship. We predicted that the Commission would bring forward proposals to establish a <Col N="687" /> national reserve which would give each of us a right to look after those who were so shamefully neglected by the previous Government.

      <P>The facts speak for themselves.  I understand that it is the nature of Opposition politics to ignore what has been done.  Has Deputy O'Keeffe a complaint regarding the proclamation of our success?  Indeed, the most constant criticism levelled at me over the past couple of years is that I have not effectively got across what I have achieved.  However, I intend from now on to proclaim my successes from the rooftops.  After all a Teagasc report has shown that there has been a 51 per cent increase in farm incomes generally, which is a big reversal of the position obtaining during the deep depression when the Coalition were in office.</P>

      <P>Members of the Labour Party, The Workers' Party and Deputy Foxe have referred to the vital role agriculture plays in our economy. No other country in Europe and perhaps in the world &mdash; with the possible exception of New Zealand &mdash; has a pivotal agricultural role at the centre of its economy. We have seen the effect of this <Col N="688" /> renewed confidence in the whole balance of payments, the impact in 1988 being the same as that for manufacturing industry. If that is not success I do not know what it can be termed.  I want to tell the House, particularly Fine Gael and Deputy O'Keeffe, that we will see more of this success and they can call it failure if they wish.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe made an important point in regard to the 1992 internal market and the impact it will have on our disease-free status.  He implied that we made no progress in this area.  The reality is very much the opposite.  The discussions have been conducted at professional and technical level up to this point and I have given a very broad political statement to the Council.  The results will prove me right.  I have said that the internal market will not allow for free transmission of disease from one member state to another.  Let me assure the House &mdash; and our discussions have guaranteed this &mdash; that no amount of pressure from any other source will divert me from that single purpose.  We want to see an internal market which will be of the highest standard in disease control, whether in animals or plant.  Lower standards than ours would undermine this vitally important economy.  I am glad that the discussions today show that, even though we have to convince 11 other states.  I hope this major debate will be developed later and I look forward to continuing it with my colleagues over the next four or five years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £115,860,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1989, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Marine, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The main thrust of Government policy is the restoration and improvement of confidence in our economy, both at home and abroad.  The <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i> is a planned approach to the challenges ahead and to the opportunities presented by the doubling of the Structural Funds.  The new and improved regime of EC Structural Funds provides us with the opportunity to reduce some of the economic and other disadvantages we suffer from as an island state.</P>
      <P>The national plan recognises the importance of marine activities to the State.  The plan embraces all the major economic responsibilities of my Department. It covers aspects of the sea fishing industry, in particular fish processing and marketing, and fishery harbours and also contains a major programme of development for commercial ports and shipping. Under the tourism aspect, there will be every opportunity for the development of viable angling and marine recreational projects.</P>
      <P>Before going any further I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to my predecessor and the first Minister for the Marine, Deputy Brendan Day, whose energetic work led to the successful establishment of the new Department. Progress has been recorded right across the sphere of marine activities with the introduction of a comprehensive package of measures to encourage shipping; significant planning in relation to Irish ports; unprecedented growth and development in aquaculture and the development of a strategy for the seafish industry.  This list of achievements in which he was ably aided by the Minister of State, Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher is its own tribute and I appreciate the sound foundation provided and on which I intend to build.</P>
      <P>The sea fishing industry has grown strongly over the last 25 years and in recent years we have seen the emergence of a rapidly growing aquaculture sector. These sectors contribute significantly to employment and incomes in areas where there are few alternative sources of employment.  Inadequate infrastructure particularly at fishery harbours and structural weaknesses in the fleet and in the processing and marketing sectors are significant obstacles to future growth.  The development strategy for the fishing industry adopted by the Government in 1988 sets a target for the creation of 4,400 new and part-time jobs in the seafish, aquaculture, processing and ancillary industries by 1991.</P>
      <P>The protection and enhancement of fish stocks as well as the discovery and exploitation of new stocks is critical to the future wellbeing of the sea fishing industry.  Resource management is a major concern now for all member states. Since 1980 in the Community total stocks of major importance have dwindled, often substantially.  It is the Government's firm policy to properly enforce conservation measures and to ensure that they are also equally enforced elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="693" /> A large part of the reason for overfishing is of course the existence in the Community of substantial overcapacity in the fishing fleets.  In relation to the quotas available to us, we share that overcapacity in certain segments of our fleet, as our quotas are insufficient to keep some parts of the fleet, particularly the pelagic fleet, fully occupied.  However, there are always new applicants keen to enter the industry.  Entry into the industry has to be closely regulated in the interests of the applicants themselves as well as of those already in the industry, taking into account social, regional and employment considerations as well as the economic aspects.  At the same time many of the boats in the fleet are too old and out of date.  The fleet needs to be renewed, modernised and directed towards underexploited species and new species to maximise long-term economic gains for the whole industry.</P>
    <P>The provision of funds from the Community is critical to the renewal and modernisation of our fleet.  The Community at the moment, however, in furtherance of its objectives of reducing fleet capacity is, in effect, linking the availability of funds to the achievement of reductions in the fleets in the individual member states.</P>
    <P>In recent years the Community has been reluctant to aid new constructions in those member states which the Commission considers to have the greatest excess capacity problem.  This is a difficult and complex problem.  We are determined to ensure that our fleet can develop so as to economically exploit the new opportunities which are becoming available.</P>
    <P>At the same time without Community aid, the scope for expansion is limited. This matter is the subject of on-going discussion at Community level.  We are taking all the practical steps open to us to meet our EC obligations.  Restrictive licensing policies are in operation.  We are at an advanced stage of preparations <Col N="694" /> for a new fleet register in conformity with EC legislation.</P>
    <P>Within these constraints, BIM, together with the other State agencies concerned, are pursuing a vigorous development strategy on all fronts.  I should like to highlight today just three of the elements of that strategy; these are exploratory fishing, quality standards and the ice plant programme.</P>
    <P>A key element of the Government's strategy for economic growth in the fishing industry is the expanded programme of sustained exploratory fishing for non-quota and other under-utilised species such as argentines and blue whiting.  The programme also involves the assessment of stocks of shellfish around the coast.</P>
    <P>Exploratory fishing activity is aimed at assessing the potential for extending the range of species and fishing activities for both the fleet and fish processors.  In 1988 a BIM/EC exploratory fishing programme on argentine and blue whiting was undertaken and resulted in the landing of almost 10,000 tonnes of non-quota species. The development work is commercially biased and is undertaken by working fishing vessels.  Effectiveness is measured in terms of increased catches, or catches of better quality fish.</P>
    <P>Development activity at sea also includes fishing gear trials aimed at introducing more cost effective catching methods measured in terms of catch rates and fuel consumption.  BIM expect to spend £510,000 on exploratory fishing in 1989 &mdash; £230,000 of this would be of a capital nature.  This expenditure affords the Irish fishing industry access to EC grant aid for this activity.</P>
    <P>Quality in fish products is essential for both producer and consumer.  For the producer it means better prices: for the consumer it means fresher, more nutritional and safer products.  The Department of the Marine's campaign to improve substantially the image and status of Irish fish and fishery products, both nationally and internationally, was launched in 1987.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> In 1989 it is planned to build further upon and consolidate the considerable progress and gains made to date with the aim of achieving the highest possible standards of operational and structural hygiene throughout the fishing industry. This will involve changes in the Departments auction halls, ensuring that all boats handle and maintain their catch in a fresh and hygienic fashion, and the maintenance and improvement, where necessary, of both operational and structural hygiene in processing premises.  Furthermore, product sampling will be intensified to ensure product safety and to enhance the image and status of Irish fish.</P>
    <P>The quality programme is designed to put the Irish sea fish industry in a strong competitive position for the nineties.  As part of these plans BIM have been funded to accelerate the expansion of ice production at BIM plants.  The BIM ice plant network will be operated on a commercial basis.  In general, BIM will retain direct control of larger plants but with local involvement through leasing of smaller plants to fishermen groups/cooperatives etc.  This will guarantee continuity of ice supply and availability to all users.  Total investment planned for 1989 will amount to £900,000.  Support is being sought from EC funds to underpin this programme and to allow for a better and more extensive coverage than would otherwise be possible.</P>
    <P>As Minister responsible for the regulation and development of aquaculture in the State, my objective is to maximise the industry's contribution to the economy in a way commensurate with the preservation of a clean environment.  The year, 1989 will see further development of our strategies on both these fronts.  The statistics on farmed salmon, for example, speak for themselves: in 1983 we produced 250 tonnes of farmed salmon.  In 1989 the estimated output will be 7,300 tonnes, the bulk of which will be exported at an estimated value of £35 million.  Our achievable target for 1991 is an output <Col N="696" /> level of over 14,000 tonnes worth in excess of £71 million and, with it, the jobs and exports which will represent the sector's most significant contribution to economic development.</P>
    <P>I must stress again, however, that the rapid growth in intensive production of the priority species &mdash; salmon, trout, oysters and mussels &mdash; in our coastal waters and on freshwater sites must take place in a way compatible with the maintenance of clean waters and the safeguarding of public health and amenities. In response to the continued, and may I say largely ill founded, criticism of the industry, let me reiterate my determination to use the legislative and regulatory powers at my disposal to achieve the development of aquaculture consistent with environmental excellence. To this end I intend to ensure public consultation in relation to licence applications. In addition, I will continue to vet each application thoroughly from the points of view of navigational safety, environmental impact and compatibility with other water users.</P>
    <P>The principal measures which I am putting in place in order to achieve our policy objectives includes the provision of a sound legal framework for the controlled development of the industry through the designation of areas for aquaculture; co-ordination, under the aegis of my Department, of the activities of the two principal State agencies Údarás na Gaeltachta and BIM in order to maximise the impact of State aid to the sector; liaison with the EC Commission in order to optimise the development of aquaculture; and the continued deployment, within the constraints on public finances, of the necessary scientific and diagnostic resources to ensure the monitoring and control of aquaculture operations to the highest safety and quality standards.</P>
    <P>To conclude on aquaculture, I must express my satisfaction at the use of public resources in this area.  Use of money from my Department's Vote through An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, has <Col N="697" /> successfully primed an industry which has now developed a momentum of its own. Údarás na Gaeltachta have worked closely with BIM and this Department in co-ordinating the development of the industry.</P>
    <P>Now that the salmon industry, in particular, has reached such a level of development, my Department will be looking closely at the processing and marketing strategy which will be necessary to sustain existing and projected levels of output.  What I would like to see happen is that our industry should move as far as possible from the concept of producing a commodity &mdash; which would have to accept the world price &mdash; towards the production of a premium quality product.</P>
    <P>Fish stock research projects are designed to assess scientifically annual trends in the main commercial resources exploited by the Irish fleet and which are subject to quota regulation namely mackerel, herring, cod, whiting, haddock, plaice, sole and prawns.</P>
    <P>Most of these stocks are scientifically assessed every year by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea and by the European Commission's Scientific and Technical Committee on Fisheries.  Their joint recommendations &mdash; in the formulation of which my Department's scientists play a full and active part &mdash; form the basis for the total allowable catches &mdash; and ultimately national quotas &mdash; agreed subsequently by the Fisheries Council of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>I have allocated an extra £20,000 towards a mackerel egg survey, part of the triennial international survey designed to update the assessment of the mackerel stock which, at 40 per cent, is the biggest single component of our marine fisheries.</P>
    <P>In order to match the Department's research input to the growing importance of &ldquo;non-quota&rdquo; stocks such as argentine, blue whiting and horse mackerel, such manpower as was still available within <Col N="698" /> the Fisheries Research Centre was reallocated last year to increase the research effort on these stocks, which will support the expansion of Irish marine fisheries.  I place a high priority on research on such non-quota stocks, and on expanding it wherever possible.  It must still be stressed, however, that the current level of research expenditure comes to no more than about 1 per cent of the first sale value of the marine landings. I will be seeking to increase this level of investment.</P>
    <P>In furtherance of this Government's fisheries development policy, I am determined to put the scientific services of my Department on a sound footing so that the Irish fishing industry is not denied the benefit of a research effort comparable to those enjoyed by the other maritime States of the Community.</P>
    <P>One of the most outstanding problems facing fish and shellfish farmers is the disruption to trade and the mortalities of stock resulting from exceptional blooms of microscopic marine plants &mdash; the phenomenon known as red tides.  In 1988 one such outbreak caused the closure of mussel production in the south-west for 23 weeks, from July to October.  In earlier years marine fish farmers have had their stock severely depleted by a particular type of red tide which suffocated large numbers of salmon and sea trout in the sea cages.  Therefore, I have increased the 1989 budget for research in this area by £50,000 to buy new equipment for the Fisheries Research Centre.</P>
    <P>Another aquaculture subject of primary importance which is being addressed by my Department is the ouster disease &ldquo;Bonamia&rdquo; which, although believed harmless to the human consumer, is capable of wiping out whole stocks of the native oyster.  In order to tackle the speedy diagnosis of this disease, I have allocated an extra £15,000 to the Fish Pathology Unit in my Department's Fisheries Research Centre to purchase newly developed equipment from France.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> Inland fisheries is a sensitive subject and I do not intend for the moment to go beyond what has been included in the <i>Programme for Government 1989-1993.</i> The rod licence problem is part of a wider issue involving the funding of the development of our inland fisheries as an important national resource.</P>
    <P>A major effort will be undertaken at the highest level to resolve the current dispute in full consultation with fisheries boards, angling clubs and tourist boards keeping in mind the financing and development of inland fisheries.  I have already issued a statement to this effect and I have indicated my willingness to meet the anti-rod licence group for exploratory talks.  I should like to assure the House that I will do everything possible to find a reasonable and equitable solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>The State harbours have taken over responsibility from the Office of Public Works for the harbours at Howth, Dunmore East and Dún Laoghaire.  Both Howth and Dunmore East are designated fishery harbour centres and will operate in this context once the necessary legislative changes are in place.  As the House is aware the Department of the Marine is running the Dún Laoghaire harbour since 1 January and we have to put legislation in place with regard to it.</P>
    <P>The Marine Institute is very important as the House has been made aware already.  The Government have approved in principle the establishment of an institute the aim of which is to undertake, co-ordinate, promote and assist marine research and to provide related services.  From the truncated version of my speech the House will know how important that is.</P>
    <P>With regard to shipping policy, I have already mentioned that it was part of my predcessor's achievement that grants of 25 per cent towards the purchase of new or secondhand ships up to seven years old are now available; a corporation profit tax rate of 10 per cent, the business <Col N="700" /> expansion scheme and NADCORP are also there to build up the fleet.</P>
    <P>In relation to marine safety, as the House is aware, the most significant development was the decision by the previous Government at the end of last May to position a Dauphin helicopter at Shannon from September 1989 &mdash; this helicopter to be available on a 24-hour response basis throughout the year.  The rescue earlier this year of 11 men of the crew of the fishing vessel <i>Big Cat</i> at Valentia indicates the importance of the coast life saving service.  I am glad to inform the House that six new stations at areas of major fishing activity are to be set up at Burtonport, Killybegs, Killala Bay, Achill, Castletownbere and Howth. I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that the west coast is well served now, better served than it had been before.</P>
    <P>This year my Department will make a contribution of £100,000 to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.  This contribution is in recognition of the sterling work carried out on a voluntary basis by the institution in Ireland.  I would like to take this opportunity to welcome again the decision of the RNLI to establish, on a trail basis, a new main station at Ballyglass, County Mayo, and to encourage the general public to give generously to the RNLI.  I would like to record my appreciation and that of the Government for the noble men and women of the rescue agencies who risk their lives to save others.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I <Col N="701" /> should explain that the provision in respect of this Estimate was different from others where there was a time allocation of two hours.  The time in the case of this Estimate is one hour with suitable adjustments, which requires each following speaker to limit himself or herself to ten minutes.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Wilson, on his new appointment to the Department of the Marine.  This appointment is particularly significant given that his previous portfolio was in the Department of Tourism.  I hope that the knowledge he brings to this Department from the Department of Tourism will help him to resolve the immediate and major problem, which is within his Department, namely, the rod licence dispute which has existed for the past one and a half years.</P>
      <P>In the course of his speech the Minister said that he would like to assure the House that he would do everything possible to find a reasonable and equitable solution to this problem.  Many areas have been gone through in the past year and a half in relation to this problem and it is my view that the major stumbling block in preventing a solution to the rod licence dispute is within his Cabinet and is in fact, the Taoiseach.  The Minister will have to convince him that it is time to realise what the problem is. Sacking Ministers and using them as scapegoats is no cover for his own incompetence.  Neither are pious aspirations by him on the 1 o'clock radio interview on Sunday &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; or in <i>Programme for Government</i> documents any consolation to the people who are badly affected, throughout the country, as a result of this dispute which has continued for so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach will realise that there is a solution to this problem.  I am sure the Minister is aware that there is a solution which was put together by Fine Gael some months ago.  I was amazed today to hear what the Minister for <Col N="702" /> Energy, Deputy Mollony, had to say on this issue.  On the RTE 1 o'clock news programme today the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy stated:</P>
    <P> It is not possible at this time of the year, mid July, to repeal the rod licence legislation because of the Oireachtas situation.  There is no Seanad, it has completed its term and there is now a new election taking place.  The Dáil is only meeting this week, and then it goes into summer recess.  Legislatively it is not possible to introduce legislation on the rod licence.  We could not insist on action in that area now. </P>
    <P>This is despicable behaviour from the Minister.  There is a Seanad and it can meet at any time.  There is a Dáil and again it can meet at any time.  I assure the Minister for the Marine that Fine Gael will accommodate him either tomorrow night, or on Friday or next week if he is prepared to bring legislation before this House to resolve this problem.  There is still time at the end of July and August when fishing can take place.  We are prepared to accommodate the Minister in resolving it if he so wishes.  I disagree very strongly with what the Minister, Deputy Molloy, had to say today.  He stated as follows:</P>
    <P> Secondly it was not possible for any Government to give a commitment to suspend the operation of the rod licence pending the introduction of legislation, and we accepted that, having consulted our own lawyers, that route was not open to us either.  I am satisfied with the discussions we have had that a very positive attempt will now be made to find a satisfactory solution to the rod licence dispute, and I expect that John Wilson will be very successful in this area. </P>
    <P>I would like to put it to the House that the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, is more than aware that there is a solution to this problem and that prior to the <Col N="703" /> election he and his party agreed a solution with Fine Gael in the Fine Gael-PD pact. I am astounded that the Minister when he had an opportunity last week in his negotiations with Fianna Fáil did not use it to ensure an end to the rod licence dispute.  He was in a position last week to argue very forcibly with the Taoiseach on this issue and to secure a deal and have the matter resolved within a matter of days.  Instead of that he let the issue slip and secured two Cabinet seats in the Government.  The result is that the angling community and the tourist interests throughout the country who had hoped that this matter would be resolved have been let down by the Minister for Energy.  That is extremely unfortunate and I am amazed by his behaviour.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be in a position within the next few days to bring legislation before this House to resolve the problem.  The Department of the Marine is an extremely important Department. It is in operation for only the past two-odd years.  It has responsibility for a variety of areas.  The fishing area is one of the most important areas because it includes both inland and sea fisheries.  The previous Government have been extremely unsuccessful in the manner in which they have operated in Europe particularly in relation to the negotiation of quotas for both mackerel and herring.  An unfortunate situation has developed because of our reduced quotas.  There is a danger that many people will lose jobs in the fishing industry and, particularly, in the processing area.  This is particularly true of Donegal.  Because of the last agreement which was made in relation to fishing east of the 4º line many fish were landed outside this country and the result is that the processing industry has been severely damaged by that decision.</P>
    <P>Another situation which is farcical is the agreement by the previous Government to allow the fishing fleet to be reduced from 66,000 GRT to 44,000 GRT.  In the Estimate today we see that the spending <Col N="704" /> in this area has also been substantially reduced.  This is extremely unfortunate. However, what is far more serious is that this year Irish people cannot avail of FEOGA grants to purchase fishing vessels. This is extremely serious for the young people who want to get into the industry and purchase their own boats and now they cannot get any assistance or grant aid.  These are just some areas which are seriously affected at present.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a far more vigorous marketing programme by BIM.  There are enormous opportunities for a strong marketing campaign right across Europe and in other countries to ensure greater sales of Irish abroad.</P>
    <P>The inland fisheries have been in utter chaos for the past year and a half and have been very badly affected by the rod licence dispute.  We are all aware of what is involved but unfortunately we see that the Estimate proposes a reduction of 10 per cent on the 1988 figure in that area. This is extremely unfortunate.  The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats statement on this issue is totally unacceptable. Since this issue has been around for quite some time and the parties are already familiar with it, there is an onus on them to do something immediately to settle the matter.</P>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed with the amount of money available in the Estimate for the development of commercial and State ports.  We, an island country, will be the only country without direct land access to Europe in 1992.  Therefore we need to be in a position where goods can be transported as quickly, efficiently and cost effectively from Ireland as from mainland Europe to European countries. Unless we have very efficient ports with good handling and berthage facilities we will not be in a position to compete economically. This could cost this country jobs.  The new Minister, Deputy Wilson, should give major priority to this area. There is an onus on the Minister to make substantial progress in the overall development of transport from Ireland to <Col N="705" /> mainland Europe.  This is a major priority and must be seen as such by the Department. The amount of money allocated for investment in harbours is not adequate.</P>
    <P>The shipping investment grants have been reduced in the Estimates by 50 per cent on the 1988 figure.  This is extremely unfortunate.  We need to upgrade the fleet in order to be in a position to transport our goods.  However, there has been a reduction in the allocation for grants. Shipping is extremely important and there is great potential for development in this area.  I suggest that the Minister increase the qualifying ceiling under the business expansion scheme to £6 million because the present ceiling is not adequate and there would be scope for development if that were done.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas I would like to cover and I will deal briefly with them.  I am concerned that the Minister has just repeated that there is agreement in principle to set up a Marine Institute. That decision was taken two years ago but we have nothing concrete on the ground.  We have been told that the institute would be set up in Galway but nothing has happened.  Minister keep repeating this but nothing happens.  I had hoped that the Minister would be in a position to ensure that there is a proper marine research institute and not just something in name to keep an election promise.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the west coast search and rescue service.  While I welcome the fact that the Government have decided to locate a Dauphin helicopter in Shannon, I would like to tell the Minister that a Dauphin helicopter does not have the capacity or the range to cover the area.  If we are to have an effective rescue service what is needed is a more powerful helicopter based in Shannon.  I know we do not have that type of helicopter in the Department of Defence, but the Government should consider leasing a private helicopter for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The amount of money allocated for <Col N="706" /> radio stations has also been reduced.  If we are to have proper communications facilities to deal with difficulties around the coast we need radio facilities.  For all of the above reasons I find it very difficult to support this Estimate and I have no option but to oppose it because I believe it does not deal with matters in a positive and constructive way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in his new Ministry, which is a difficult one.  I will begin by expressing some thoughts on the Ministry for the Marine.</P>
      <P>Shortly after I started in politics in 1975, I recall making a speech in Seanad Éireann in which I suggested the establishment of a Department of the Marine to bring together all the aspects dealing with the sea and inland waters, replacing the old Department of Fisheries.  In 1981-82 I recall asking the then Taoiseach &mdash; the present Taoiseach &mdash; in this House when he would establish a Department of the Marine.  Looking at its evolution since 1982, I must confess a considerable sense of disappointment.</P>
      <P>On the occasion of the establishment of the new Department, the first statement made was that it would draw together all aspects of Government activity in relation to the sea and inland waters.  Of course, this did not happen.  As you make your way through the Minister's speech, the following questions would occur to a lay person, the person whom we represent in our constituencies.  Is it easier now to prepare and enter for a career in the fisheries industry?  Is it easier now to begin to aspire towards making a living in aquaculture?  Is it easier now to make a living in any aspect associated with the marine?  The answer is, of course, that it is hardly less confusing than it was before the Department of the Marine was established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no evidence that the jealousies between the different agencies of State have entirely disappeared.  There is no evidence that there is a clear and coherent plan in place for the development of <Col N="707" /> marine activities.  Certainly, there is an absence of integration between one kind of activity and another.</P>
    <P>When I think back I recall the basics. Under the old régime to which the Department's establishment was addressed, if you wanted to put out a raft to get involved in mussels culture, you had to apply to eight different Government agencies or Departments &mdash; the local authority were interested in what colour you painted it; the Department of Transport and Power were interested in the ropes; the Department of Health were interested in the water quality and it went on like that.  If you had the energy to survive all that bureaucracy, you would think perhaps that mussels were not worth it after all.  That was the situation we were faced with.  Has that entirely disappeared?  I do not think it has.  There is, therefore, no clear commitment within the Department's activities, as either described or projected by the Minister, that gives this quality of integration between all the agencies and activities that so many of us had hoped for from the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <P>In the limited time available, I will only touch on a number of other aspects. Where is there a reference in the Minister's speech to the importance of education and training?  In the marine policy of all our European partners and of the other European countries, roughly three or four principles are stressed.  These countries begin with a programme for education and training.  They then move on to the whole question of the purchasing, maintenance and expansion of the fleet and necessary infrastructure and finally they look at the question of capitalisation. With regard to the question of the fleet, the notion of buying secondhand vessels with the 25 per cent grant is something that simply is not working in Ireland.  I know very few successful applicants. Many obstacles have been put in their way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> The question of education has been a farce for most of this century.  Let us be clear about that.  People are sent to the northern parts of the country and when they ask what they will do when they finish their course and how they will set about getting a boat and so on, you can never answer them.</P>
    <P>The question of marketing, conservation and processing is also very important.  There are three jobs on land for every one at sea.  We have known that for the 20 years I have been in politics and it was known for several decades before that.  What is the point in talking unless we do something about it?  We have discovered horse mackerel, blue whiting and other types of fish.  I am sorry to say that the Norwegian research vessels made all those findings in the early seventies.  Is there any reference in this document to, for instance, a research vessel to identify stocks?  Of course there is not.  That would be too practical.  The Norwegians are practical and that is why they have four research ships off our coasts.  It was they who discovered the stocks off the Porcupine and documented them.  As an act of charity a few years ago, they allowed an Irish research scientist spend two or three days on board one of their ships.  These are the realities. This is a Department full of disappointments for anyone who takes matters seriously in relation to the marine.</P>
    <P>In the very limited time I have I want to put two questions directly to the Minister. There is a glorious passage in his speech.  One thing we may expect of the new Minister is that the language will be good.  It is accurate.  In that context I have admired him for many years but I wonder who wrote this passage about the question of the balanced development of fisheries, taking all the environmental considerations into account, the thorough research and so on.  Would the Minister please explain how he proposes to justify the granting of a licence under the 1959 legislation to a British owned fish farming activity in the Ballyvaughan <Col N="709" /> area when local people, including those involved in different kinds of shellfish cultivation, have been waiting for the procedures of the 1980 Act to be exhausted. They thought that the 1980 Act meant something but suddenly the 1959 Act is implemented.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the rod licence issue.  My party opposed its introduction and sought to amend the legislation. I am trying to be constructive when I say to the Minister that no action has caused as much damage to the west of Ireland communities as has the introduction of the rod licence.  I would appeal to him, and I say this in a non-acrimonious way, that if he is serious about resolving the dispute, he should with, as the Taoiseach said, one mighty effort at the highest level &mdash; touches of Fionn Mac Cumhaill, as it were&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Would your Cuchulainn, the Taoiseach, not think of saying, as a gesture of goodwill towards the communities that have been damaged, that the legislation will be put into abeyance until the talks have been concluded?  That would enable people who have been very badly affected by this legislation to make some progress and to set up an atmosphere of goodwill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to use that one minute to say that the dispute is not about money; it is about something that is very relevant to most of the serious pieces of the Minister's speech, that is, the ecologically responsible development of tourism where it affects fisheries.  There is a report available in the Minister's office in <Col N="710" /> relation to aquaculture and the development of a new industry.  That report was published a few weeks ago and it points out the dangers regarding land-based hatcheries and other installations.  Those who want the responsible development of the Corrib and of our lakes and inland waters are simply saying: &ldquo;Let us not have an artificial development of a put and take type fishery and that type of tourism but let us take into account the way in which wild fish have developed.&rdquo; The communities who have been associated with the possibilities of lakes and wild fish have responded to the possibilities and have said: &ldquo;Let us be involved; we will pay for it; it is not about money.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with the previous speakers in congratulating the Minister on his appointment and in wishing him well in his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a number of areas I would like to deal with specifically in the relatively short period available to me.  First, there is the question of the rod licence dispute. The Minister is quite correct when he says that the rod licence dispute has to be seen in the wider context of the funding for inland fisheries.  The whole issue and the whole dispute about the rod licence has disguised the fact that for the past several years there have been very serious cutbacks in the allocation of funds to the regional fishery boards and for the development of inland fisheries.  The present rod licence is a direct product of a cutback.  There was a grand plan which involved a £1 million cut in the grants <Col N="711" /> available for inland fisheries and that £1 million was to be recouped, half of it from the rod licence and the other half from the other side of the grand plan scheme &mdash; the abolition of the regional fisheries boards.  Both aspects of that scheme were draft and should now be abandoned.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the rod licence is dead.  The Minister and the Government must realise that.  The legislation should be abandoned.  There is no point in producing some ham-fisted compromise which would perhaps involve a further payment through the clubs putting them in a difficult position and perhaps causing difficulties for people involved in fishing.</P>
    <P>The funds and the resources should be restored to the regional fishery boards to enable them to do their job.  The boards have been subjected to constant cutbacks since 1983.  The staff in these boards are down 40 per cent on their 1983 level and the budget for the regional fishery boards is only about two-thirds of what it was in 1983.  When the whole controversy about the rod licence is over there should be a greater emphasis on the development of inland fisheries so that the potential of the lakes of this country can be fully realised for tourism and for the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed that there was no reference in the Minister's speech to Irish Shipping, particularly since the largest single item in the Estimate refers to £90 million which is largely due to the Irish Shipping debacle.  In March 1987 the Minister undertook to bring a report before the Dáil which would provide some relief for the former employees of Irish Shipping, many of whom are still without wages which they were owed from before the time Irish Shipping went into liquidation.  The matter has been handled by three different Ministers and all the replies refer to how complex a legal issue the whole Irish Shipping position is.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> Surely it is possible for the Government and the Dáil to bring forward legislation which would provide for those loyal servants who gave many years of their lives serving this State in Irish Shipping. I notice in the Official Report of 4 May 1989, column 1337, Volume 389, that Deputy Desmond O'Malley raised a question as to why the then Government had failed to honour their party promise to the former employees of Irish Shipping. I was surprised, therefore, to find no reference to the former employees of Irish Shipping in the programme for government which was put before us, and I hope the Minister who gave the former employees of Irish Shipping a very specific promise in March 1987 will without delay provide some relief for those people.  It is a shame.  I know of at least one case where a former employee has died before this matter has been resolved and a number of other former employees are seriously ill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment in the programme for government to a review in respect of the common fisheries policy before 1989.  It reminds us that we were sold out in 1980 and 1981 when the size of our fleet and quotas were severely restricted, largely as a result of Government incompetence at that time.  We now have a very comprehensive development strategy for the sea fishing industry which has been published by Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Indeed I was surprised that again there was no mention of that specifically in the programme for government. However, we have to be worried that that strategy will be frustrated unless something is done about the size of the fleet. In particular, I would like to comment on the failure of the Government to secure EC funding for the development of the white fish fleet as evidenced by the lack of money from the EC in the spring of this year.  The Irish Fishermen's Organisation have also commented and raised a worry about the possible loss of jobs in the fishing industry as a result of restrictions in the fishing fleet.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> I am concerned at the two paragraphs in the Minister's speech concerning Dún Laoghaire harbour.  The speech makes no reference at all to the fact that the report was produced last November by a planning review group established by the Minister's predecessor who produced a very comprehensive report dealing with Dún Laoghaire harbour.  The Minister talked about his Department examining proposals for the harbour.  It is as if the planning review group had never met and we are back to pre-spring 1988 where the Department were examining proposals many of which are totally unacceptable to the people of the area.</P>
    <P>The controversy over the proposed marina at Dún Laoghaire harbour was seriously misrepresented as something engineered by very unreasonable people, and the Minister's predecessor had some very unflattering things to say about the people involved in that campaign.  I remind the Minister that there is a considerable consensus in the Dún Laoghaire area concerning the type of development which should take place.  There is a consensus that there should be a representative harbour authority.  Indeed, the Minister's party colleague, Deputy Andrews, during the general election campaign announced that an interim harbour authority had already been established. I am surprised that there is no reference to this in the Minister's statement. I would like him to clarify if an interim harbour authority has been established, if it is going to be established, who its members will be and what their terms of reference will be.</P>
    <P>There is a consensus in the area that the car ferry should be retained which will mean car ferry terminal facilities will have to be improved.  Sealink have put forward a very interesting proposal for the development and improvement of passenger facilities at the harbour.  The Minister in his statement referred to the fact that following the building of the Channel Tunnel Ireland will be the only totally sea-locked member of the EC.  It <Col N="714" /> is surprising that the Government have not applied for EC funding for the development of passenger facilities at Dún Laoghaire and for support of the Sealink proposal which would contribute to the transport situation between this country an the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>Under no circumstances should the Minister allow a marina to be built within the Coal Harbour area of the harbour. That part of the harbour is used by the majority of the people in the Dún Laoghaire area.  It is used by bodies like Dún Laoghaire VEC who are doing important work in training young people, many of whom are from disadvantaged homes, in water skills and water sport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  I am greatly concerned now about the laid back attitude of the Government concerning this matter and that more is not being done to solve the rod licence issue. As previous speakers said, it is the one single piece of legislation that has created havoc in the Corrib-Mask region of west Galway, a region I represent.  Yesterday I put down a question to the new Minister for the Marine asking in view of the grave damage caused by the rod licence dispute if he would abolish mandatory licences for freshwater trout and coarse fishing and if he would amend the legislation before more grave damage is caused to the communities in the west and to our tourist industry.  The Minister for the Marine in a written reply said that the angling licence system was introduced with a view to making funds available for the protection and development of inland fisheries and he proposed to meet the parties concerned in the dispute soon on an exploratory basis.  I am not satisfied with that.  Something more positive should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated in the Seanad on 18 December 1987 that this rod licence would be resisted in the Corrib-Mask region, that we were promoting the Corrib-Mask as the greatest free fishing trout lake in Europe and it would be damaged as a result.  I warned of the grave damage which would be caused when this Bill was suddenly brought before the Seanad on 18 December 1987.  I am now in the Dáil for the first time.  I have asked the Minister a question and I am not entirely satisfied with the reply I got.  At the time I received his reply, I believe on the &ldquo;News at One&rdquo; programme a new Minister in the Government from my own west Galway constituency told the people of west Galway and other places not to <Col N="716" /> worry, the rod licence issue would soon be fixed.  I do not know if he ever heard of the agreement with the Archbishop.  I heard the Archbishop of Tuam saying at one time the rod licence matter would be fixed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister understands better how the Fianna Fáil front bench work than did the Archbishop. I ask the new Minister from my constituency, Deputy Molloy, whether during the tough negotiations which preceded the formation of this Government he used more of his energies in regard to Cabinet appointments than in an effort to solving the rod licence problem.  I acknowledge that when he was in Opposition he was strongly in favour of amending the rod licence legislation.  Like Deputy Taylor-Quinn, I cannot understand why we have to wait until the end of the year.  Is it a case of live horse and get grass?  This should not be the case in such a serious matter.</P>
      <P>The best way to measure an Estimate for any Department is to compare it with Estimates for previous years and to consider what proportion of the money was spent on the running of the Department. Financial allocations to the Department have declined in real terms since 1985.  I will quickly run through the budget since that year.  The important factor is the decreasing amount spent on non-pay elements each year.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister, my constituency colleague, on his appointment to this Department.  It is <Col N="717" /> interesting to note that he has come from the tourism sector.  Fisheries and tourism are interconnected in my constituency in that they impinge very closely on one another.  We have a number of lakes in Cavan-Monaghan which are essential to the development of tourism in the two counties.  I have to report that the present condition of the said lakes is quite poor from the point of view of access and availability to the visiting angler.  It is essential that we take immediate steps to improve these matters.  That will obviously have to be done mainly by the inland fisheries.  The difficulty is that funding for the inland fisheries has been cut and is very small.  We are completely impotent in regard to lake development.</P>
      <P>I want to make a suggestion for the Minister's consideration.  I am aware that community and interest groups are quite often willing to carry out work such as the provision of car parks and fishing stands and the provision of proper access to lakes.  They may be able to put together the financial resources but when the work has been carried out they cannot afford the cost of public liability insurance. Once they take responsibility for improving waterways they must also ensure the safety of anglers who will use the improved facilities in the future.  If the inland fisheries carried out that function they would automatically carry responsibility for that insurance.  It would be tremendous if the inland fisheries would supervise such work while it was going on and see that it was carried out to proper standards.  Then they would be in a position to offer insurance.  This would make it possible for community groups to carry out the necessary works and improve our tourism product.  Perhaps I could speak to the Minister on this matter later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank contributors to this truncated debate on the Estimate for the Department of the Marine.  Deputies did not have adequate time to make their <Col N="718" /> contributions and I hope we will have an opportunity for a fuller debate.  Judging by the contributions made, it would be to the advantage of the Department if we had time for a full discussion on the salient aspects of the Estimate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor-Quinn mentioned harbours. A very substantial effort has been made with regard to harbours.  If the Deputy will look at the subhead she will see that £4,209,000 has been provided for harbours, divided between commercial harbours at Drogheda, Dundalk and Fenit, for works at Inishbofin and Inis-turk estimated to cost £1,109,000 and the fishery harbours where the provision has gone up from £1,309,000 in 1988 to £3,100,000 in 1989, providing for development works at Killybegs, Green-castle, Rossaveal, Dingle and other fishery harbours.  An effort is being made and we should not brush it aside.</P>
      <P>Quotas are based on scientific research on the availability of fish.  The livelihood of fishermen and their industry is being protected very often by quota.  The example usually given is the absence of herring in the Celtic Sea at the end of the seventies which was remedied by the co-operation between this Department, the fishermen and the processors.  Increased herring quotas were available to the fishermen last December.</P>
      <P>With regard to the marine institute, I did not have time to read the details into the record of the House.  The Deputy will see that it has advanced further than talk. All good Christian homes should have a copy of my speech.</P>

    <P>I appreciate what Deputy Michael Higgins and Deputy Gilmore said about the problem of the rod licence.  I appreciate their goodwill towards me in my efforts to solve it and, as Deputy Gilmore said, <Col N="719" /> to try to realise the full potential of inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Dún Laoghaire, we took over on 1 January 1989 and we have drawn up a programme of improvements. Deputy Gilmore was canvassing and campaigning and he may not have had time to see it.  The programme includes improvements at the ferry terminal, provision for recreational activity and development and for the environment of the harbour.  I have the list here which includes fire safety, weighbridge, baggage handling, mother's room, painting at the Carlisle Pier, electronic information, the sign for queuing cars, etc.  I will be able to give the list to the Deputy later.</P>
    <P>In my former portfolio I was fully conscious of the effect of the Channel Tunnel and of the necessity to provide good roads to the ports and to develop the ports, and a very substantial claim for Structural Funds has been lodged under the National Development Plan for the development of the ports.  That has to be backed up by the development of the roads and railways on the other side of the Irish Sea.  Some development is taking place in north Wales, but there is an area in south Wales which will need development to assist us to break down the competitive disadvantage we are at because of being so far from the central markets.  I gather that the transport input into the total costing is 11 per cent before we put something on the European market.  I see from this week's <i>Economist</i> that it is 25 per cent in the United States where they have wonderful freeways, air transport and so on because everything is getting cluttered up there.  That is no consolation to us; we have to try to minimise the competitive disadvantage under which we labour.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCormack spoke on the same theme as Deputies Michael D. Higgins and Gilmore.  I appreciate what he said about the importance of inland fishing for tourism and for our own citizens <Col N="720" /> whom we should not forget either.  I do not understand why he was dissatisfied with what I said because I am making arrangements to meet all the people who are involved in that dispute next week. Perhaps he has some explanation for it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the contribution by Deputy Bill Cotter and I welcome him to the House.  He is from my constituency and I endorse his remarks about the lakes.  I listened to him because he made an effort to develop a tourist committee in County Monaghan last year and to help the development of tourism in the area. There has been considerable investment in that area from which we have reaped the benefits.  We need more investment particularly in access roads, stands and so on.  We have had no trouble whatsoever either in the game angling or coarse fishing areas with regard to the licence.  Perhaps this is natural because both counties are Border counties.  Over the Border licences are paid and that kind of thing can be contagious.  However, I appreciate what Deputy Cotter said.  In so far as it is a pitch for further development of inland fisheries in that area, I am grateful to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Minister for Justice and Communications to the very serious delays which exist in the Land Registry in issuing Land Registry maps and the processing of applications for registration of title.  All the legal firms in my constituency of Cork South-West have made numerous applications which have been delayed for up to six, nine and 12 months. It is not unknown for there to be delays of up to one and a half years to two years. This is a shocking state of affairs and should not be allowed to continue.  I am not blaming the new Minister for Justice and Communications for this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Burke on his appointment as Minister in both Departments.  I hope he will meet my demands tonight.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that this is a very serious problem and merits his immediate attention.  Some of the cases involve applications from young farmers for registration of land titles.  Their farm installation grant payments are held up for months, sometimes years, pending the issuing of the necessary documents by the Land Registry.  This should not be allowed.  Proof that applications on their behalf have been lodged with the Land Registry should be sufficient evidence for the Department of Agriculture and Food to proceed with the payment of farm installation grants in the same way that the Department of Social Welfare accept similar evidence in applications for old age pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I would like to point out to the Minister that serious delays occur in respect of applications for Land Registry maps, sometimes up to six months. This is unreasonable and a drastic remedy is called for.  If the Minister is serious about tackling this problem he should provide sufficient staff in the Land Registry. If his Department have not got the <Col N="725" /> financial resources to do so, he should seriously consider privatising the Land Registry as it would be a self-financing viable private concern, or maybe bringing it under the control of a semi-State body would be the answer.</P>
    <P>Another reason for the serious delays is the vast upsurge in the conveyance of title applications which have increased dramatically during the past 12 months. During the first six months of this year the number of applications increased by 16 per cent.  I would suggest that the only solution is to lift the embargo on employment or to give the Land Registry semi-State status.  We are all aware that there is a major demand for the division of commonages&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a major demand for the division of commonages.  The Land Registry have been inundated with applications from farmers for the division of land commonages.  The Minister should realise that any delays in the division of those commonages could have a serious effect on the health of our cattle. The mingling of cattle in commonages is not a very good way to combat disease in animals.  I call on the Minister to do everything possible to alleviate this problem. My efforts have been frustrated on several occasions.  I have in front of me <Col N="726" /> letters from solicitors from all over the Cork South-West constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to join with my colleague, Deputy Sheehan, in congratulating the new Minister on his appointment.  I know that despite the joviality for which Deputy Sheehan is known the Minister would not trivialise this problem.  He must know from his own constituency work and from the Department of Industry and Commerce that there are serious delays connected with the Land Registry.  This has led on some occasions to loss of industry.  I have <Col N="727" /> also seen the converse, where industrialists came into this country because they were able to establish their rights to land, get the title deeds into order and have everything straightened out within six months.  Unfortunately, the land under discussion belonged to Westhrop's, who had the particular property on their site for the last 400 or 500 years.</P>
      <P>There are great difficulties in the Land Registry because while revenue of £8 million comes into the Department every year, there has been a rundown in staff from 510 to 390 in recent years.  Added to this is the problem that for the past six months, even since last November, there has not been a registrar of titles.  This has caused serious difficulties, not alone in the Land Registry but for solicitors, for the building industry, for new home owners, for industry trying to set up. There is an urgent necessity for the Minister to tackle this problem.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sheehan said quite properly that this area is self-financing.  There is no reason the Minister cannot be pragmatic and set up a semi-State industry here.  He knows that the registration of land must go through the Department of Justice and then on to Finance, with all the ensuing difficulties of talking through third parties. The abolition of the Land Commission has added to the difficulties.  There has also been a rundown in the number of surveyors employed by the Department of Agriculture and Food to process applications for vesting orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the further dilemma that in the Land Registry morale has sunk to an all-time low.  Because the Minister is a new Minister and is anxious to succeed, to establish himself in another Department, he must grasp this opportunity to lift the morale of the Land Registry staff and accede to Deputy Sheehan's request. This would help farmers with installation grants, builders in connection with the transfer of property, solicitors in processing documents, make life easier for people and create employment.  This is a <Col N="728" /> serious subject and I know the Minister will treat it as such.  I urge on him to get together with the Land Registry and the Law Society to work out a system that will succeed, because the frustration out there is terrible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the previous speakers in wishing the Minister every success in the Departments of Justice and Communications.</P>
      <P>I support both previous speakers.  I have had communications with the Land Registry for over 20 years and in all that time I have found the staff most courteous and helpful.  At present, however, because of understaffing and the difficult conditions under which they are working, there is great dissatisfaction among the staff.  Up to now one could go and talk to the staff in the Land Registry but that is no longer allowed.  They are not prepared to talk because there is such a backlog with regard to titles.</P>
      <P>There are two areas involved.  The first is with regard to applications for first registration and the second with regard to division of titles.  Deputy Carey outlined the situation with regard to building, the division of sites and the building boom in different areas.  Unless titles can be sorted out efficiently, there will be major problems.  There are already difficulties but the situation will get worse.  If the long delays continue there will be a breakdown in the conveyancing of titles and that would be very serious.  I am saying that in earnestness, I am not scaremongering.  There could be a breakdown in the transfer of titles and of properties and that would lead to major litigation against the Land Registry. This work is self-financing and the problem of understaffing must be tackled to avoid the difficulties that will otherwise ensue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan and others and the Law Society have mentioned privatisation of the Land Registry.  That is a kind of ambulance solution to an urgent problem.  I would express caution. <Col N="729" /> People's titles to land is a very private, personal matter.  A person's title to his house or farm is a matter of major importance, the largest investment for most people and they like a State guarantee attached to such a title, the seal of the State.  Rather than privatisation being brought in in two years' time, now is the time to act.  The Minister's Department is a huge one with many problems but with immediate action &mdash; provision of staff and improvements in working conditions &mdash; the difficulties would be overcome. The staff are working under atrocious conditions.  I shall be honest with the Minister &mdash; I would not work under such conditions; I would resort to picketing.  I ask the Minister to visit the Land Registry and see at first hand the conditions.  The staff are very good to put up with them.</P>
    <P>The ball is in the Minister's court and I ask him to act urgently.  This is a most serious matter which affects everybody throughout the length and breadth of Ireland.  Firms of builders are trying to organise titles and are being held up; if a farmer wants to get subdivision of a farm in favour of his son there is delay in getting the title to the new land.  The people concerned are on bridging loans and have a limited period of time allowed to them.  Then penalty clauses are invoked because of failure to lodge the title in the correct time.  This happens despite the fact that there are solicitors' letters of undertaking.  A family start off with perhaps £1,500 extra of a bridging loan.  They blame the solicitors and everybody else but much of the problem arises in the Land Registry.  It can be sorted out.</P>
    <P>The fault does not lie entirely with the Land Registry.  Perhaps incorrect titles are prepared by architects and solicitors are often to blame for failure to lodge titles, reply to queries and requisitions. Many people are involved.  The Minister has the opportunity to resolve a problem which has been ongoing for a number of years and I wish him well and success in <Col N="730" /> tackling it.  If he is successful, he will be very popular.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, first let me thank the Deputies who have contributed to this debate for their expressions of good wishes on my recent appointment.  I share their concern.  I am fully conscious of the delays in the Land Registry and realise that the services being provided there are essential to the public interest.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, there has been a recent upsurge in conveyancing which, in turn, has resulted in a significant increase in lodgments of dealings and other transactions in the registry over the past 12 months.  The Deputies who raised the matter tonight were not present in the House yesterday, but I make no point of that.  In the Estimate speech which I made yesterday in proposing the Estimate for the Department of Justice, I made specific reference to the problems in the Land Registry and the commitment which I have already undertaken to have a full review of the operations of the registry with a view to improving the services being provided to the public, including the issue of land certificates, a matter that was mentioned here.</P>
      <P>As an interim measure a number of clerical staff are being assigned immediately to the Land Registry to try to improve the situation.  My Department are having discussions with the Department of Finance concerning the urgent provision of further additional staff for the Land Registry.  A computerisation programme is in operation there and it is intended that further progress will be made in this area in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is too early to anticipate the full outcome of the review &mdash; the Deputies will appreciate that I have been in office for less than a week &mdash; the House can rest assured that I will spare no effort to secure an improvement in the services provided to the public by the Land Registry. It is a vital cog in our commercial life affecting the agricultural, industrial, <Col N="731" /> building and other sectors of society.  It is essential to clear this four to six months' backlog.  Everything possible will be done to achieve this.  I look forward to coming to the House soon to report progress.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22,25, <Col N="570" /> 27,29,31,32,33,34,35 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>In December 1988, following the review of Defence Forces' remuneration by the interdepartmental committee set up in June 1988, the Government approved increases in pay and a wide range of allowances.</P>
      <P>Payment of the increases in basic pay were phased in accordance with the provisions of the public service pay agreement and the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> as follows: First Phase, 40% of increase has been paid from 1 July 1989; Second Phase, 30% from 1 April 1990; Third (and Final) Phase, 30% from 1 October 1990.  The revised rates of allowances are being paid in full.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the decision of the Government the committee which was set up in June 1988 has been retained and has been augmented by the addition of two former members of the Permanent Defence Force.  The two members involved were nominated by the military authorities.  I do not wish at this stage to try to anticipate future recommendations of the committee.  Any necessary funding in that respect would, of course, be provided in the normal way.  In their deliberations the committee will, no doubt, take full account of all relevant factors, including the rates payable to other public service groups.  In the long term it is the objective that Army pay should be restructured with a greater emphasis on basic pay.  It is not intended that such restructuring would result in any reduction in the rates of allowances payable.</P>

      <P>The Statute of the Hague Conference on Private International Law which entered into force on 15 July 1955 created an international organisation.

The purpose of the conference, which is financed by the contributions of the member states, is to achieve the progressive harmonisation of the rules of private international law.</P>
      <P>There are now 31 multilateral conventions which have been drawn up under the auspices of the Hague Conference. Of these 31 only 19 have entered into force.</P>
      <P>The issues covered by the various conventions include the following topics: civil procedures, sales of goods, transfer of title to property, national law <i>versus</i> law of domicile, recognition of companies, maintenance of children, protection of minors, legalisation, adoption, service of documents abroad, choice of court in bi-lateral disputes, enforcement of judgments, jurisdiction, form of testamentary dispositions, divorce, traffic accidents, taking of evidence, administration of estates, products liability, matrimonial property, marriage, agency, child abduction, access to justice, trusts, sales contracts, successions &mdash; applicable law.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a party to the Convention on the Conflicts of Laws relating to the form of testamentary dispositions.

There is a long delay in dealing with such cases in the Land Registry.  This delay is partly due to the complex legal issues involved and the pressure of work generally.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, of course, appreciate that it would not be possible to give favourable treatment to any particular application except at the expense of other applications.  I am informed, however, that as a matter of policy the Land Registry will expedite cases in which the applicants or their solicitors bring to its attention the fact that special circumstances of urgency exist.  Accordingly, a request for expedition in this case will be considered if details of the reasons for urgency are submitted to the Land Registry.</P>

Details were requested as to legal titles etc., so that the necessary papers could be drawn up.</P>
      <P>A draft deed of charge was drawn up by the Chief State Solicitor's office but protracted discussions ensued regarding certain aspects of the draft and the delineation of accompanying maps of the land owned by the Sisters.  The document presented to the college authorities to secure repayment of funds advanced by the then Minister was not formally executed prior to notification of the college closure.  At that stage the terms of the draft deed as envisaged would not have been appropriate to the revised circumstances and the matter was not pursued pending clarification of the future plans for the premises.</P>
      <P>The Department are at present examining the situation in the light of the recent decision by the Sisters to sell the premises.</P>
