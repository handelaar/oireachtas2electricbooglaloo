      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I served notice yesterday of my intention to move a motion under Standing Order 30.  The motion is as follows:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann notes with great concern the imminent collapse of the services provided by the Southern Health Board as a result of the extreme financial crisis being suffered by the board.  Dáil Éireann believes that in the absence of immediate action by the Minister for Health there is a major risk to life and health.  Dáil Éireann, therefore, instructs the Minister for Health to arrange for an emergency transfer of cash to the Southern Health board.</P>
      <P>I ask, Sir, that that matter be considered by you this morning.</P>

    <Title>Harbours (Shannon Estuary Development Corporation) Bill, 1988: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion this Bill was brought before the House I was about to conclude and was outlining the reasons the Bill could not be supported by Fine Gael.  Basically it <Col N="594" /> imposes another layer of bureaucracy in the mid-west area which already has quite enough bureaucratic organisations. There is a duplication of purpose in that the Bill seeks to give the proposed corporation authority to deal with industrial development, marine development, recreational development and various amenity developments in the region.  These matters are already being monitored and developed by SFADCo who have responsibility for industrial and tourism development.</P>
      <P>The Irish Ports Authority have very clearly outlined their concern about the content of this Bill, particularly because it is believed it is to be used as a formula for other ports authorities around the country.  This is totally unsatisfactory, especially in the light of developments in the EC, the creation of the single market in 1992 and the essential requirement of quick and efficient transportation from an island country such as ours.  Sea transport and port facilities are of vital significance to our economic future.  This Bill does not have the necessary clout nor does it have the single purpose of port development.  It is essential to have a single structure to develop the ports and ensure long-term economic development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the present harbour authorities in the area are totally dissatisfied and reject the proposed legislation.  I refer to the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, the Foynes Harbour Commissioners and the Kilrush Harbour Commissioners.  It is unfortunate that the Minister, who comes from the region, has not seen fit to recognise the concerns expressed by those organisations and at least to make some attempt in the Bill to deal with the problems they have outlined.  I have already dealt with the objections of the respective authorities.  In 1986 the Minister, then Fianna Fáil spokesperson for the Marine, spoke about his home territory in Kilrush and said it was very disappointing for members of the Kilrush Harbour Authority to find that after all their years of work a new authority was being established on which they would not have any direct representation.  It is curious, now <Col N="595" /> that he has responsibility for this area, that he has not seen fit to give this authority representation.  Neither have the Limerick Harbour Commissioners been given representation.  I have already dealt with the situation in relation to Foynes.</P>
    <P>There is no mention of the pilots on the Shannon and the traditional skills they have developed over the years. Their future and that of their families is not adequately dealt with.  Neither is the overall situation of the employees of the respective authorities, be they temporary or permanent.  The Bill may attempt to provide in some way for the permanent employees, but the Minister has not outlined how the temporary employees of Foynes in particular will be provided for.</P>
    <P>The Bill is full of loopholes and is totally unco-ordinated.  It is unfortunate that the Government have seen fit to bring it forward at this time, particularly in the light of the fact that the Department of Industry and Commerce recently asked SFADCo to do a study of the entire Shannon Estuary.  That report is to be presented to the Government by June. They would have been extremely wise to consider its contents before proceeding.</P>
    <P>The Bill is badly flawed and leaves a lot to be desired.  It is not in the interests of port development and is a flawed formula for the setting up of future ports' authorities.  It does not seek to provide a structure for the most efficient and capable type of transport to the mainland of Europe.  The Bill does not in any way strive to do that.  For that reason we oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill as laid out in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum is to establish a new body to be known as the Shannon Estuary Development Corporation.  This new corporation is to have a mandate to promote, co-ordinate and develop investment in marine-related industrial, tourist, recreational and amenity facilities and to encourage activities likely to contribute to the realisation of the marine potential of the Shannon Estuary.  The <Col N="596" /> promotion of industrial, tourist, recreational and amenity faciities seems to be the main purpose of the Bill.</P>
      <P>These facilities, particularly the tourism and recreational facilities, have already been vested by the present Government in the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, as well as the remit for developing heavy industry in the immediate area.  This has recently been consolidated by the inclusion of the constituency of Kerry North into the mid-west region.  SFADCo now have an enlarged territory within their responsibility, embracing both sides of the Shannon Estuary, for which they continue to exercise their original function of the promotion of small industries.  In addition SFADCo now take over from the IDA the responsibility for the promotion of heavy industry in the mid-west and they take over from Bord Fáilte responsibility for the promotion of tourism in the same area.  It is difficult, therefore, to understand why a Bill should now be brought before the House by the Government which has as its main thrust the establishment of a company to carry out specific functions in a specific area, which they have only recently vested in SFADCo.</P>
      <P>In the light of these recent Government decisions, and the introduction of this Bill by the Minister for the Marine, which was circulated in April of last year, it is difficult to comprehend the Government's decision to permit the IDA to dispose of the best deep water development site at Ballylongford in north Kerry, especially when the Ballylongford site now falls within the jurisdiction of SFADCo, and the proposed Shannon Estuary Development Corporation, and notwithstanding the fact that this site was acquired under a most expensive procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already outlined, the main stated thrust of this Bill is to promote and co-ordinate and develop investment in marine-related industrial, tourist, recreational and amenity facilities.  This Bill has as a secondary provision, almost as an afterthought, the taking over, management and operation of the existing <Col N="597" /> harbours of Limerick, Foynes and Kilrush, giving the new corporation jurisdiction over the waters of the Shannon Estuary from Sarsfield Bridge in Limerick to the sea at Kerry Head-Loop Head.</P>
    <P>This is ambiguous as the question of jurisdiction over the Shannon Estuary has been very contentious.  Limerick Harbour maintain that they have jurisdiction over the Shannon Estuary except for Foynes and Cappagh Harbours and the other small piers on both the South and the North Banks.  It is felt that in the proposed legislation provision should be made to take over the small piers such as Kilteely, Glin, Tarbert and Saleen on the South Bank, and Kilbaha, Querrin, Carrigaholt, Knock, Labasheeda and Kildysart on the North Bank.  All of these existing small piers were constructed on the waters of the Shannon Estuary.  Some are presently under the control of the county council and the balance are under the control of the Commissioners of Public Works.  Therefore, by taking over these piers now we may avoid future legal complications as some of these piers have been used in the past by commercial traffic and commercial interests.  It is the opinion that, if this is not done now, it may cause jurisdictional problems in the future.  Some of these piers could also be developed successfully for recreational and amenity services.  It is worth nothing that Clarecastle had its own harbour authority until recent years and under the previous proposed legislation it was the intention to include Clarecastle in a single ports authority.</P>
    <P>I would now like to ask the Minister if any agreements, leases or exclusivities have been given to any private interests over the past number of years in relation to the piers at Clarecastle and Kildysart, because these were public piers and would now appear to be used solely for private purposes.  The only worthwhile assets which seem to have eluded this new corporation are the coal handling operation and power station at Money-point and the oil operated power station at Tarbert.</P>
    <P>When one considers the wide sweeping <Col N="598" /> commercial and controlling powers that are proposed in the Harbours (Shannon Estuary Development Corporation) Bill now before the House, it is apparent that if this Bill goes through the Government will have to look again at the ESB Bill which came before the House last year and gave to the ESB the power to import and distribute coal commercially as distinct from their requirements for power generation.  Or is this to be a Bill which will control the movement and shipping of all commodities except coal and then only when the ESB are the importers?</P>
    <P>We will then have a position where ports such as Foynes will be under the jurisdiction of bureaucratic structures where existing coal importers will be exposed to operating conditions and charges in the estuary, where State competitors in the same estuary with the same products have a free autonomous hand.  If anybody in this House doubts this assertion, one has only to look at the explanatory memorandum to the Bill which states that no additional Exchequer costs will be incurred as a result of this Bill.  If no additional Exchequer costs are to be incurred for the proposed developments in marine related industries, tourism and amenity facilities, it must be assumed that these development activites can only be funded from the existing commerical enterprise which the new corporation will take over.</P>
    <P>This view has been echoed by the Irish Ports Authority Association who said, and I quote from the minutes of their meeting of 5 May 1988:</P>
    <P>The content of the Bill, especially in regard to functions and membership, was far removed from any recognised concept of commercial port operation. The danger inherent in the Bill that revenues from commercial port users could be allocated to a diversity of noncommercial activites unrelated to port operations was stressed.</P>
    <P>This statement comes from the people with the commercial experience of operating Irish ports who see that their commercial base is now under real threat.</P>
    <P>It is felt that the proposed functions of <Col N="599" /> the new corporation are inconsistent with the functions of harbours under the Harbours Acts, 1946 to 1947 and conflict with the statutory functions of Bord Fáilte and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  The main function of the new authority will be to promote, co-ordinate and develop, in conjunction with other statutory authorities, marine-related industrial, tourist, recreational and amenity facilities.  Surely this will be a costly duplication of services and will not lead to the better deployment of financial resources.  The functions of the harbours at present are mainly to attract port related industries and to develop, maintain and operate the harbours efficiently. Industries such as Aughinish Alumina Limited and the ESB power station at Moneypoint proceeded without a single harbour or authority.</P>
    <P>Many industries were attracted to Foynes over the past 15 years mainly because it was efficient and there was a body in operation there which could make fast decisions.  When this proposed legislation was circulated in April 1988 there were strong rumours that the IDA were about to sell their land bank west of Tarbert. One of the main criteria for port industrial development is the availablity of land adjacent to deep water.  We would like to know now what is the latest policy in relation to the acquisition of land in the vicinity of ports and deep water.</P>
    <P>The more worrying aspect of this Bill is the statement that it is to serve as a prototype or model for future legislation affecting other major port areas such as Dublin, Cork and Waterford.  The proposed legislation can only weaken the operation and running costs of Irish ports and clearly does not recognise the vital role of the ports in the Irish economy. The dependence of Ireland on external trade was never more pronounced and with the provision of the Channel tunnel Ireland will be the only country within the EC entirely dependent on ports for trade purposes.  For this reason, therefore, ports should be allowed to develop and expand in order to give a cost efficient <Col N="600" /> service in the loading, unloading, warehousing and servicing facts of exporting and importing.</P>
    <P>Two major ports in the Shannon Estuary whose takeover is proposed in this Bill, namely, Limerick and Foynes harbours, have unrivalled records in the development of trade and port facilities. To downgrade their position and importance as this Bill sets out to do makes a mockery of the Government's stated commitment to regional autonomy and local initiative and involvement.  Surely it is the Government's responsibility to help ports that need investment and development so that they can be profitable, self-sustaining, and offer a service of international quality.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister propose?  His proposal is to back Foynes, Limerick and Kilrush into a corporation which was hastily conceived in an effort to suit individuals rather than the common good.  If the development of ports and harbours is the aim of this Bill it is unusual, to say the least, that the ports least in need of development are included, but those ports which are most in need and could benefit from a development corporation are specifically excluded.</P>
    <P>The proposed Bill provides for the dissolution of the Foynes Harbour Trustees, Limerick Harbour Commissioners and Kilrush.  However, the Bill makes no provision for the dissolution of the Clarecastle Harbour Trustees, nor does it make any provision for the inclusion and control of the following piers; Kilbaha, Querrin, Carrigaholt, Knock, Labasheeda and Kildysart on the North Bank, and Killteerly, Glin, Tarbert and Saleen on the South Bank.  Many of the above mentioned piers which are either under the control of local authorities or the Commissioners of Public Works would be ideal vehicles for the tourist, amenity and recreational facilities which are mooted in this Bill.  However, their exclusion only serves to highlight this Bill for the inadequate piece of legislation that it is.</P>
    <P>The Harbours (Shannon Estuary Development Corporation) Bill would have some credibility if the excluded piers <Col N="601" /> were included and assigned roles in the development of tourism and recreational amenities.  However, in controlling the entire Estuary from Sarsfield Bridge to Kerry Head and Loop Head in Clare, the Minister for the Marine has made two kinds of exceptions in the Bill.  One relates to the semi-State companies which are under the control of a Government Minister and where the Minister for the Marine has had to keep his hands off.  The second exception relates to the smaller piers and jetties which have development potential but would cost money to develop and, since there is no financial provision in the Bill, the Minister does not want to include them.</P>
    <P>This left the Minister with the plums of the estuary, the ports with developed infrastructures, business and profits.  This was where he could source the cash for his grand plan which lacked funding. These ports are now to pay the price for local initiative, business acumen and sound management.</P>
    <P>It is a sad state of affairs when individual representation has been denied to the harbour boards by the Department of the Marine in the preparation of the regional integrated plans.  It calls into question the whole basis of these plans and shows little regard for the commercial development of the Shannon area.  It now appears that the regional plans &mdash; when I wrote this script this was a fear I had but it is now a reality &mdash; will be welded together by the Department of Finance.  However, there is no guarantee that the basis on which the moneys were applied for in Europe will be the basis for redistribution.</P>
    <P>The port of Foynes in particular has constantly sought exclusion from the Shannon Ports Authority Bill taking the view that it had succeeded under the direction of Foynes Harbour Trustees admirably in the past 25 years by sound management and flexibility in its services to shipping and all its ancillary activities. Foynes has developed more rapidly than any other public harbour in this country in the past 25 years, with a current asset valuation in excess of £25 million which <Col N="602" /> contains a Government grant element of less than £0.5 million or only 2 per cent of its asset value.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his speech, gave the impression that he had prolonged and detailed discussions with the various interests in the region.  He also led people to understand that there was a consensus among the interested parties in favour of a single harbour authority but of course this is not true.  Since the Minister was appointed in 1987 he had only two discussions with Foynes Harbour Trustees, the first of which took place in May 1987 when he stated that it was his intention to proceed with legislation for a single port authority which would include Foynes.  It was indicated to the Minister on that occasion that Foynes was opposed to its inclusion in the single harbour authority. The decision of the trustees was consistent with decisions made by previous boards of Foynes Harbour.  They had no objection to the Minister proceeding with the Shannon Ports Authority, which would exclude Foynes.  The Minister has proposed to continue with the legislation and exclude other piers specifically.</P>
    <P>On the second occasion the trustees met the Minister, 4 May 1988, a detailed written submission was made to him on the Harbours Bill, 1988, and the Minister indicated that he would consult further with Foynes prior to the legislation being brought forward.  Nothing further has been heard since that date from the Minister's office on the proposed legislation or the submissions which the trustees made. The Minister would not want to give the impression to the other Members of this House that the existing harbour authorities, namely, Limerick and Foynes, are in favour of this legislation as both harbours are strongly opposed to it.  It would appear that this position would want to be rectified publicly.</P>
    <P>The Foynes Harbour Trustees in their press release have unanimously expressed very strong opposition to the proposals contained in the Bill for many reasons.  However, the most important reason is that the free market which has existed heretofore enabled Foynes to be <Col N="603" /> competitive and flexible.  There is no recognition in the Bill for the major investment by port users and no provision for the continuity of competitive harbour dues, charges and services.  There are no hidden tonnages in the Foynes record and tonnage handled has increased in 20 years from 40,000 tonnes to 800,000 tonnes, employing 320 people in a full time capacity plus 200 casuals on a seasonal basis.  This is a record of progress and development with little State help and is unparalleled anywhere else in the country.  This growth has been achieved by reinvestment of surplus generated by the harbour authority, private investment and excellent labour relations.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill was published, of all the interested parties including statutory bodies, local authorities, port users, unions and commercial organisations, not one of them has been able to support this proposed legislation.  Indeed, when the previous Government proposed a similar Bill, Fianna Fáil opposed it tooth and nail for exactly the same reasons as I am opposing it now.  For what reason they have seen fit to introduce it now is best known only to themselves and in seeking to get local support some hastily thought-out provisions have been inserted which really seek to highlight the ill-conceived tenor of this SEDCO Bill.</P>
    <P>Ireland's dependency on trade is exceeded within the EC only by the Benelux countries, which share land boundaries with other member states. European Community transport policies regarding intra-community trade, take little or no account of sea transport as an island country's only lifeline.  The opening of the channel tunnel in 1993 will have a major impact on Ireland which will then be the only member state without direct road or rail links to the rest of the Community. It is obvious, therefore, that Ireland will be totally dependent on port facilities in stark contrast to its Community partners.</P>
    <P>What we need therefore is a ports development policy unencumbered with marinas, amenities or tourism.  Ninety-nine per cent of Ireland's trade is by <Col N="604" /> sea and the British National Union of Seamen's strike in 1988, which caused havoc even in this country, should be a salutory warning for those who would seek for unknown reasons to downgrade the importance of port operation and management.  Successive Governments have been slow to grasp the essential of port facility development which has been much more recognised and advanced in member states.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that 20 per cent of the utilised trade of the Republic of Ireland was induced to move through Northern Ireland because of lower cost.  Positive action is required to enable port authorities in the Republic of Ireland to compete on equal terms with Northern Ireland ports and thereby service the nation's trade.  Any proposed ports legislation should not contain elements which would detract from a port's ability or responsibility to meet its primary duties and its future national obligations post 1992.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Daly, on his appointment and his record in the Department of the Marine.  I am very glad to have the opportunity within the lifetime of this Dáil to do so.  His record has been a proud one.  He has been involved in some controversy which, in my opinion, was not of his own making but his achievements have been recognised and supported by the vast majority of the people and that will continue to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened to Deputy McCoy and I read the earlier contribution of Deputy Taylor-Quinn, both of whom referred to the economic facts such as that Ireland is a small open economy and that the size of the internal market is limited, as if those facts were not known to the Government.  We on this side of the House are as aware as the people on that side of the economic background to this legislation.  Reference has been made to the challenges with which this country will be faced after 1992 when the trade barriers throughout the European Community come down.  There will also be <Col N="605" /> tremendous opportunities, and that is what this Bill is all about.</P>
    <P>The Government, and all of us on this side of the House, recognise that in order to fully avail of the opportunities which 1992 will present, the ports of this country will have to be managed, equipped and operated in such a way as to ensure the most efficient and effective transport of goods.  We are aware of that and we are also aware that it will be of even greater significance after 1993 when the opening of the Channel tunnel will mean that Ireland will be the only truly island nation in the Community.  I am happy, however, that this legislation does recognise the importance of ports to the economy and the central role that ports will play in the economy of the future.  Contrary to the fears being expressed by Foynes Harbour Commissioners, Limerick Harbour Commissioners and Opposition Deputies I am satisfied that there will be no downgrading of port management functions and that this Bill does not involve any such downgrading.  The objective of the Bill is to create a new estuarial authority which would have additional functions and which would, I hope, complement the port management functions.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with the main provisions of the Bill I want to advert to the fact that the predecessor to this legislation was interrupted by the last general election. That Bill which was introduced by the Coalition was debated in the Seanad in 1986.  During that debate reference was made to the record and activities of Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  In that debate Senator Howard said and I quote from the Official Report, Volume 113, column 900:</P>
    <P>I referred to certain frustrations that private enterprise in the northern bank has encountered from the Limerick Harbour Authority.  They have experienced a dog in the manager type attitude. CW Shipping at Fountain Cross, Ennis, County Clare, are an Irish company. They recently purchased tugs for use on the Shannon in anticipation of the movement of coal from the Money-point station.  They employed fully <Col N="606" /> qualified staff.  In fact, their vessel captain has the highest qualifications of any similar officer operating in the Shannon Estuary.  They applied to the Limerick Harbour Authority for permission to operate on the River Shannon. They were led on a merry-go-round which brought them nowhere. The Limerick Harbour Authority claim to have the authority to issue an exclusive licence for tuggage or towage on the Shannon Estuary.  That is given to a company called Shannon Marine. When one tries to establish what Shannon Marine is, one is led into a maze of associate companies &mdash; Marine Transport Services in Cork, Clyde Shipping, Irish Marine Holding.  It is almost impossible to discern which company is which, with overlapping shareholding interests and so on.</P>
    <P>I am not here today to represent Limerick Harbour Commissioners in any way but in making a statement like that one is abusing the privilege of the Upper House and abusing the privilege of the Oireachtas.  The record of Limerick Harbour Commissioners&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a convention in this House that we do not comment on or criticise the actions of Members of the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wanted to refer to that statement and my views on it are now a matter of record.  I will not elaborate on them.  I would like to refer to the record of Limerick Harbour Commissioners as it is relevant to do so in the context of this Bill.  During the last 25 years Limerick Harbour Commissioners have succeeded in increasing the volume of trade through the port of Limerick and the Shannon Estuary by 1,400 per cent, from 400,000 tonnes to 5.6 million tonnes in imports and exports.  No other Irish port and indeed no European port has rivalled this achievement over an equivalent period. During the last 25 years ship sizes coming into the Shannon Estuary have increased from 10,000 tonnes to 150,000 tonnes, a 15-fold increase.  The volume of goods <Col N="607" /> loaded and discharged has increased from a level of 400,000 tonnes to 5.6 million tonnes, a 14-fold increase.  Investment in maritime related industrial plants adjacent to the waters controlled by Limerick Harbour Commissioners has achieved a level of almost £2 billion.  That is a tremendous achievement.</P>
      <P>Limerick Harbour Commissioners are to be congratulated also on their initiative in developing the deep water navigation channel and for providing vastly improved services which have been widely acknowledged and appreciated not only in the region itself but throughout the European Community.  The development of the deep-water navigational channel entailed intensive hydrographic surveying, up-dating of navigation charts, the installing of modern and sophisticated navigational lighting and other aids as well as extending the existing port control and radio communication system.  The type of vessel now coming into the estuary is so valuable that it demands a very high level of expert assistance in coming in and out. Limerick Harbour Commissioners are now the largest navigational lighting authority in the State with the exception of the Commissioners for Irish Lights who have responsibility for the entire coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tremendous improvements to port services have also been made by Limerick Harbour Commissioners on their own initiative.  These services include the training and equipping of pilots, oil pollution controls, fire fighting and other emergency services.  In addition to all of this, Limerick Harbour Commissioners constructed the oil jetty at Shannon in 1973 which had the initial effect of attracting Aeroflot to Shannon and it generated a massive spin-off in revenue throughout the mid-western region.  Limerick Harbour Commissioners have also been responsible for carrying out extensive hydrological studies which have proved that the estuary could be adapted at minimal cost to cater for vessels over 400,000 tonnes.  They have introduced a dock labour rationalisation system which <Col N="608" /> has brought efficiency and peace to the Limerick docks.  In current money terms, the cost of these services to the country today would be somewhere in the region of £4 million if all were to be undertaken together.</P>
    <P>Limerick Harbour Commissioners carried out these functions and provided these services and improvements largely from their own funds.  This record of achievement in service to the area illustrates how ill-informed, negative and unfair the criticism of Limerick Harbour Commissioners has been.  Their record of achievement stands on its own and would stand up to scrutiny.  In saying this I am in no way denigrating the achievements of Foynes Harbour Commissioners but they have not been subjected to this unfair, negative and irresponsible criticism.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the main provisions of the Bill.  The main objection to the Bill seems to be that functions other than port management functions are given priority. Deputy Taylor-Quinn referred to that matter.  For the information of Deputies participating in this debate a document issued by Limerick Harbour Commissioners also referred to it as did a document issued by the Irish Port Authorities Association.  The document issued by Limerick Harbour Commissioners stated in referring to the economic background against which this legislation was introduced that the downgrading of the most important port management functions in section 4 of the Bill in favour of marine related, industrial, tourism, recreational and amenity facilities is a matter of great concern for port authorities generally, particularly as these areas of activity would appear to be adequately catered for by other agencies.  A similar statement is made in the document issued by the Irish Port Authorities Association and this morning, too, the same kind of statement was made by Deputy McCoy. Deputy Taylor-Quinn likewise made a similar statement.</P>
    <P>When one looks for the evidence on which these assertions are based it is not putting it too lightly to say that it is extremely hard to find.  A number of <Col N="609" /> arguments have been advanced by the Irish Port Authorities Association, Limerick Harbour Commissioners and by Deputies on the other side.</P>
    <P>We have been told that the short title of the Bill indicates that port management must now take a secondary place to the other activities, such as recreational facilities.  The short title of the Bill is the Harbours (Shannon Estuary Development Corporation) Bill, 1988, and there is nothing there which indicates the priority of the various functions with which the new estuarial authority are to be charged.  We are also told we must look at the long title of the Bill which states that it is an Act to provide for the establishment of a body to be known as the Shannon Estuary Development Corporation, to define its functions, to provide for the dissolution of certain harbour authorities, for those purposes to amend and extend the Harbours Acts, 1946 to 1976, and to provide for other connected matters.  There is nothing about priority or that indicates that any one function of the new estuarial authority will have priority over any other function.  The fact that this sort of meaningless argument is resorted to makes me suspicious that some people, particularly bodies outside this House, are so anxious that this legislation will not pass they are prepared to say anything to confuse and hinder its passage.</P>
    <P>The next argument advanced in favour of some sort of priority being given to non-port management functions referred to the order in which the various functions of the new estuarial authority are laid out in section 4 (1) (a) which provides that the function of the corporation shall be to promote, co-ordinate and develop investment in marine related industrial, tourist, recreational and amenity facilities.  In relation to the functions of the corporation, paragraph (b) states that they should promote, assist and develop the use of their functional area by commercial and trading enterprises for such activities as are likely to increase the use of that area for activities of a marine related nature.  Paragraphs <Col N="610" /> (c) and (d) relate specifically to port management and development functions of the corporation.  Paragraph (c) gives the new authority the power to manage, maintain, operate and develop the existing harbours.  Paragraph (d) provides that the new estuarial authority will have power to provide, maintain, operate and improve such harbour services and facilities as the corporation consider necessary or desirable in its functional area.</P>
    <P>Are the Irish Port Authorities Association, the Limerick Harbour Commissioners and Opposition Deputies seriously advancing the argument that if paragraphs (a) and (b) in section 4 appeared in paragraphs (c) and (d) and that if paragraphs (c) and (d) appeared at (a) and (b) the whole ethos and <i>modus operandi</i> would change?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of change all round is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is their argument they should read the section and think again because it is taken illogically to its ultimate conclusion.  The Minister indicated he is prepared to change the order of priority within the section, but I do not think it will make any difference in practice.</P>
      <P>On the Second Stage debate in this House on 28 February 1989, referring to the various divisions in the section, Deputy Taylor-Quinn stated that the effect of putting paragraphs (a) and (b) into the Bill in the first place would be to divert the attention of the management of the new estuarial authority from the port management function.  It is not too difficult to discover where that argument came from because there is a similar statement on page 3 of the document circulated by the Limerick Harbour Commissioners and on page 10 of the document circulated by the Irish Port Authorities' Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The answer to that argument lies in the wording of section 4 (4) which makes it very clear that far from having some sort of secondary or ancillary role, the port management is the primary function of the new estuarial authority and that the <Col N="611" /> other activities referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) are merely, ancillary or complementary functions of port management. If that is not correct, why does section 4 (4) specifically provide that the corporation cannot, when carrying out the functions in paragraphs (a) and (b) spend any money &mdash; not even their own &mdash; without getting the prior consent of the Department of the Marine?  If they have to borrow, they cannot borrow more than £200,000, which is a partly sum nowadays, without getting the prior consent not only of the Department of the Marine but also of the Department of Finance, which are not noted for their wild economic liberalism or their spendthrift nature.</P>
    <P>There is no such restriction on the powers and functions of the new estuarial authority in relation to paragraphs (c) and (d) which refer to the port management functions.  Yet we are asked to accept an argument by Deputy Taylor-Quinn, Deputy McCoy and the two outside bodies who are interested in the Bill now being passed, that the functions which the two authorities can carry out, untrammelled by any necessity to get permission from the Department of the Marine, the Department of Finance or anybody else, are secondary to the functions which are so carefully restricted and limited by the specific terms of this legislation. I do not know the logic of the argument but I cannot accept it.  The Minister does not accept it and anybody thinking straight and reading the section as it stands could not accept it either.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor-Quinn in her contribution on 28 February also adverted to a related matter in the section.  She quoted section 4 (4) which states:</P>
    <P>The corporation shall not, when carrying out any of its functions referred to in subsection (1) (a) or (1) (b) of this section, incur expenditure (including borrowing) without having&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  satisfied itself that any proposed investment is capable of achieving a commercially acceptable <Col N="612" /> rate of return on capital employed, taking account of all possible costs and potential risks.</P>
    <P>She continued:</P>
    <P>One would have to question how this will operate because we are talking about appointing a board and it is not clear that there will be members on that board capable of making the decisions that this subsection requires...</P>
    <P>The board consists of members of local authorities &mdash; Limerick County Council, Clare County Council, Limerick Corporation, Kerry County Council and a representative from SFADCo.  There is also a representative from the ports' users and four other people are to be appointed by the Minister.  In relation to these appointments, section 8 (5) specifically provides that a person, other than a person nominated under subsection (3) (a) of this section, shall not be appointed a member of the corporation unless he is, in the opinion of the Minister, a person with wide experience of, or capacity in, finance, commerce, shipping, law or management.  Is Deputy Taylor-Quinn seriously asking us to accept that a board consisting of all those people will not have the capacity to make the decision that expenditure in which they are involved offers a commercial rate of return?</P>
    <P>It is insulting to the membership of the board, and members of local authorities represented on it, to advance that argument. It is an unfair argument to put forward.  Deputy Taylor-Quinn is as aware as I am that many people who do not have paper qualifications are capable of making that type of decision.  Even if her fears, wild though they may be, turned out to be well founded we must remember that there is a double control in the sense that the Department of the Marine must be satisfied that expenditure being embarked upon by the new authority will offer a suitable rate of return.</P>
    <P>The Department will have to be satisfied that the risk involved is minimal.  If borrowing in excess of £200,000 is <Col N="613" /> involved the Department of Finance will have to be satisfied and that is a most onerous requirement.  If any criticism can be made of section 4 it is that it is too restrictive.  It confines the non-port management powers of the new estuarial authority within too narrow a limit.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that the corporation shall maintain their principal office at Foynes in the county of Limerick.  Arguments could be advanced in favour of establishing the headquarters in Limerick rather than at Foynes.  I have advanced that argument here and outside the House and I would prefer if the headquarters were to be in Limerick rather than at Foynes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section should not be in the Bill at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that later. I do not need the Deputy's assistance; I am well able to deal with the issue.  I am sure Deputy Kemmy will advance arguments in favour of Limerick and that other Members will advance similar arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Kerry or Kilrush?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that Deputy Foley will advance arguments in favour of Kerry and I am sure that the Minister could advance arguments in favour of Kilrush.  Ultimately, the siting of the headquarters is a political decision for the Minister.  The Minister has advanced arguments in favour of Foynes but I would not come to the same conclusion. However, like the position in regard to section 76 of the Finance Bill, I cannot say that the Minister reached his conclusion unreasonably.  I can understand why the Minister concluded that Foynes would be the appropriate place for the headquarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another argument can be advanced in regard to this.  The board of the new authority will be running the show and they should be allowed decide where their headquarters will be.  There is an <Col N="614" /> unhealthy tendency in western democracies to push difficult political decisions that have to be made by members of Government on to boards and authorities. The location of the headquarters of the new authority is a political decision and the Minister has not hidden behind any board or delegated that awkward political decision to anybody else.  He has made the decision and named the site of the new headquarters in the Bill.  He is to be complimented on not relying on any board to decide the location of the headquarters, although I do not agree with the conclusion.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot be accused of political cowardice.  He has been open in making his decision.  Without suggesting that the Minister would do anything underhand, I must point out that the legislation states that the appointment of the board is a matter for the Minister.  If he decided, before the appointment of the board, that the headquarters was to be located in one place rather than another, I am sure he could take the appropriate steps to see to it that that was done.  I congratulate him on not hiding behind the board and making a political decision.</P>
    <P>Another argument put forward is that there should be a different type of board. However, those who put forward that argument have not told us the type of board we should have.  The Limerick Harbour Commissioners, in their submission, stated that there was a need for a broadly based board with fair representation from local authority, industrial, commercial and trade union interests in the mid-west region and Kerry.  Section 8 provides that the board will include representatives from the county councils of Clare, Kerry, Limerick and Limerick Corporation.  The board will also include one representative from SFADCo, two to represent port users, two members of Foynes Harbour Trustees and four others qualified in finance, management, shipping law and so on.  In my view that will make for a broadly based board.  I do not know what other interests or representation the Limerick Harbour Commissioners had in <Col N="615" /> mind, apart from their point about trade union representation.  I agree with their point in regard to the latter and I hope the Minister will consider allowing trade union representation on the board.</P>
    <P>The section specifically states that there should be two members of Foynes Harbour Trustees on the board.  I presume that the argument being advanced by the Limerick Harbour Commissioners is that they should have equal representation. I am inclined to agree with that view.  Certainly, in view of the known record of Limerick Harbour Commissioners, the Minister should consider appointing representatives of the commissioners on the board.  I do not think it will be necessary to amend the legislation to do so.  The Minister has discretion to appoint four representatives on the board and when he is making his appointments to the new authority he should bear in mind the achievements of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to me, and other Members, about the position of pilots under the Bill.  It is my understanding that there is not any definite arrangement or contract between the various bodies which are being amalgamated under the Bill and the pilots who operate in the Shannon Estuary.  Deputy Taylor-Quinn said there was a loose arrangment in existence but there is nothing in the legislation to indicate that the arrangment that is in operation will change.  I should like to ask the Minister to confirm that when replying to the debate.  If the function and role of pilots changes it will be because of economic and industrial circumstances.  That will change it in due course.  We cannot write into legislation that provides for the amalgamation of a number of harbour authorites that will ensure that the present arrangements pilots have with those authorities will continue for all time.  It would be facile to suggest that.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to me, and others, about the status of the staff of the various authorities which will <Col N="616" /> be taken over.  Limerick Harbour Commissioners, in the course of their submission on the Bill stated that there was no recognition in the Bill in the form of special representations for the commissioners, their officials and staff, despite their outstanding achievements. They went on to refer to the insecurity of employment of the officers and servants of the commissioners who will now become the officers and servants of the new estuarial authority.  This matter is dealt with in section 14, a provision that appears clear to me.  It may be that Deputy McCartan, and others, will see something in that section that is not obvious to me.  That section provides that every person who, immediately before the day on which the new authority comes into being, is in the service of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, the Foynes Harbour Trustees or the council of the urban district of Kilrush, shall not receive less remuneration than the remuneration to which he was entitled immediately before he became such officer or servant, and shall not be subject to conditions of service less beneficial than those to which he was subject immediately before he became such officer or servant.  In other words, the people now employed by the various harbour authorities and who will be taken on by the new estuarial authority will have the same conditions of service and the same remuneration as they had on the day before the new authority came into operation.  I do not see how anybody can find fault with that provision.</P>
    <P>I notice that in regard to remuneration section 14 specifically states &ldquo;....receive less remuneration than the remuneration to which he was entitled....&rdquo;.  I do not know the significance of the use of the word &ldquo;entitled&rdquo; in that section.  I would prefer if the words &ldquo;receiving&rdquo; or &ldquo;in receipt of&rdquo; were used than the word &ldquo;entitled&rdquo;.  I presume the staff are entitled to what they are receiving at the moment by way of remuneration.  I find the use of the word &ldquo;entitled&rdquo; rather than the words &ldquo;in receipt of&rdquo; somewhat curious but there may be some statutory reason for including it in this section.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="617" /> The staff who will come into the service of the new authority will be subject to conditions of service which are not less beneficial than the conditions of service they have at present.  I want to advert to the fact that many of the staff of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners are at present residing in Limerick and working to a headquarters in Pery Square in Limerick City.  If these staff have to travel to Foynes, I wonder if some court could come to the conclusion that that is a less beneficial condition of employment than the conditions they operate under at present.  I do not think that it would be less beneficial and even if a court or the legal adviser to the Department came to that conclusion, the matter could be sorted out by way of monetary compensation. I do not think that, just because the staff have to travel from Limerick City out to Foynes, this will make their conditions of employment less beneficial. The place where a person lives is where he or she chooses to live.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear to me that there is provision for the continuation of employment and section 15 is drafted in such a way as to ensure continuation of employment. This means that the legislation on the Statute Book for the protection of employees, such as the unfair dismissals legislation, redundancy legislation and minimum notice and terms of employment legislation, will apply to the new employees.</P>
    <P>Representations have also been made in relation to the status of the pension rights of the employees who will be taken over by the new authority.  Sections 15 and 16 have been included in the Bill specifically to protect those pension rights.  Section 15 (2) states that a member shall not be subject to less favourable conditions in relation to the grant of superannuation benefits than the conditions which applied to him immediately before the date of appointment. In other words, the ratio of what a person has to pay into the pension scheme to what he gets out of the pension scheme will not change.  The officers and staff who are taken over by the new authority will continue to pay their superannuation <Col N="618" /> contributions in the same way as they are paying them at present and they will be entitled to the same benefits as if they were to go on pension at present.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for this until a separate superannuation scheme is set up and section 16 obliges the new estuarial authority to set up a separate superannuation scheme.  I presume &mdash; and I should like the Minister to confirm this for me &mdash; that the new superannuation scheme this section 16 envisages being set up will be subject to the provisions of section 15; in other words, when the new scheme comes into operation, the terms will not be less favourable than the terms which operate at present.</P>
    <P>Section 16 states that &ldquo;The Corporation shall, as soon as may be after the establishment day...&rdquo; from experience I thought the general wording should be &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; or &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;. I do not know the significance of the words &ldquo;may be.&rdquo;  On balance I do not think it makes a great deal of difference but I should like the Minister to confirm that the new scheme to be established under section 16 will be subject to the conditions in section 15.  From my interpretation of the section I think it will be, but I should like the Minister to confirm this for the peace of mind of the staff involved.</P>
    <P>At present the people working in Foynes have their own pension scheme which is operated by Irish Pensions Trust. The staff of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners do not have a similar facility. I understand that they tried on a number of occasions to establish a similar facility but that the departmental approval needed for doing this, was not forthcoming. I understand that the staff of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners have a pension arrangement similar to that operated by local authorities where pensions are paid out of general revenue rather than a separate scheme.  I should like the Minister to tell us what sort of system he envisages being operated when section 16 comes into force.  Will there be provision for a separate fund along the lines of the one operated by Irish Pensions Trust or will the situation which <Col N="619" /> obtains at present in relation to the Limerick Harbour Commissioners apply?</P>
    <P>I believe that some of the people from the Opposition benches who have spoken on this Bill genuinely believe what they said.  The kernel of this debate is whether the function of the port management, which will be central to the future of the Irish economy, should properly be carried on in conjunction with the other recreational facilities and developmental functions which the estuarial authority will be given or whether it is right and proper for those functions to be carried out by some other authority.  The functions laid out in section 4, and the examples given by the Minister of what is meant by those functions, make it clear that the functions are all marine related and will be carried out in or near a marine setting.  I believe &mdash; and I am not an expert nor do I claim any expertise in this area &mdash; that the functions outlined by the Minister in his opening speech would be more properly conducted by the authority who are managing the harbour.  Far from there being a conflict in giving one authority two functions, I believe one will complement the other.</P>
    <P>Fears have been expressed &mdash; and I have no doubt that the people who expressed those fears did so genuinely &mdash; that the new authority will spend money wildly on developing marinas, water skiing facilities, etc., and that in order to get the money to do this they will increase port charges.  This would be a disastrous development given our dependence on the external market.  I do not think this Government or any Government in their right mind would intend that development to come about and that is why section 4 (4) specifically provides that this cannot and will not happen.  We could argue all day about the proper type of authority to carry out the new recreational job creation functions which the Minister is talking about.  I believe the Minister is right that the harbour authority are the proper authority to carry out those functions.  There will be no conflict between those and the main <Col N="620" /> port management functions; in fact, one will complement the other.</P>
    <P>If we look at the United Kingdom at present and in particular over the past five years we see that there are estuarial authorities in existence.  For example, the Clyde Estuarial Authority carries on traditional port management functions but the legislation establishing it was passed in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War when the potential for these new recreational facilities was not recognised.  In fact, the recognition of that potential is of very recent origin. There are ports in the United Kingdom, such as Felixstowe, which are managed as ports because there is no potential for other type activities as there is in the Shannon Estuary.</P>
    <P>However, if we look at what entrepreneurs such as Peter de Savary is doing in Cornwall, what the Brent Walker Group are doing, what Shorewater &mdash; a company which was set up in 1986 &mdash; are doing in places such as Southampton and if we look at the Royal Albert Docks in Liverpool, we see that the direction in which they are moving is precisely the direction in which the Minister for the Marine is moving in this legislation.  I think it will complement the port management functions.  It will add to employment in my region.  It will give a great stimulus to the economic life of the mid west and to the economic life of all the area adjacent to the Shannon Estuary.  I compliment the Minister on getting the legislation this far.  I hope that in the lifetime of this Dáil we will see this legislation on the Statute Book.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party I should like to make some brief comments on the proposed legislation.  The Minister, and many of the Deputies who have spoken since indicated very globally the importance of port development to the Irish economy and its future development.  The point has been made time and again that we are the second most dependent country in the European Community after the Benelux countries on external trade. Once the Chunnel is opened we will be <Col N="621" /> the last major island nation within the European Community and consequently the development of port traffic to a modern standard is essential.</P>
      <P>It is true that the Limerick-Shannon Estuary is a unique geo-physical phenomenon, probably unequalled anywhere else in the European Community and certainly not in the western isles.  The question is whether the legislation, as drafted by the Minister, recognises these facts.  It represents the formula whereby the uniqueness of the estuary can be exploited and developed to its fullest potential to contribute as strongly as possible to the development of the Irish economy on an export-import basis.</P>
      <P>The Workers' Party, having considered the legislation carefully and having listened to many of the debates and arguments put forward here, have come to the conclusion that the Bill is, unfortunately, flawed in fundamental respects.  In referring to section 4, Deputy O'Dea suggested there is no significance to be attached to the order in which the functions and powers of the new proposed corporation are laid down.  He maintains that one can juggle them about and that it does not make a great deal of difference. In fact, in his closing remarks extolling the achievements &mdash; if one could call them that &mdash; of the Brent Walker Group and the like &mdash; many of whom are now on their financial knees &mdash; he exposed himself to one of the first and most fundamental problems with this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essence of a port is job creation and it is one that must be linked to industrialisation. There is no other way in which a port can give meaningful employment. Certainly as a means of bringing goods in and taking goods out, it has an essential function.  If it is to develop in this day and age as an employment base, it must have, close to or within its own land authority on the sea water, manufacturing industries based, in many instances, on raw materials, if necessary imported, processed and re-exported or, indeed, moved into the economy as a basis of trade.  It is essential, therefore, that we should have some commitment <Col N="622" /> from the Government, in practice and on paper, to that concept of the use of a port or harbour area as a major area of employment.  Dublin Port is an instance and I understand that the position in Limerick is very much the same.  Certainly, from superficial observation on visiting the area, the degree of dereliction that exists in the port area and the related unemployment figures which are available for the city of Limerick, where the major concentration of population exists and, indeed, for the city of Dublin tell a story in themselves.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have failed to appreciate the essential importance of a port as a job creation area and facility. One looked to this legislation to see if it contained a clear statement recognising this fact.  What do we find?  Section 4 states that the function of the authorities will be to develop investment in marine-related industrial, tourist, recreational and amenity facilities.</P>
    <P>I accept that the order in which these matters are listed is not important.  Statutorily they have effect.  There is a political significance to be attached to the fact that the concept of &ldquo;tourist, recreational amenity and facilities&rdquo; is put ahead of the development of activities of a marine-related nature and commercial and trading enterprises as contained in paragraph (b).  One has to put the legislation against the record of this Government in regard to marine development and their initiative in this area since they took office in February 1987.</P>
    <P>Within my own constituency, Howth Harbour represents a classical illustration of the point one tries to make about massive investment in that development primarily, if not exclusively, on the recreational marine-related and tourist side.  It is estimated in the Howth area, for example, that one and possibly two jobs have been created as a result of investment in the order of £12 million in the port development.  I understand that the Minister may in time take charge of the harbour.  One hopes that in time he will consider the establishment of an Authority there but certainly an Authority based on the priorities laid down in this <Col N="623" /> Bill would not be an acceptable development. Howth, like many other harbours &mdash; I instance it only because it is particular to my own area &mdash; requires a complete redirection and utilisation of the resources there to create jobs onshore, closely related, processing and other types of industries to create jobs and get people to work.</P>
    <P>Dublin Port is a classical instance being the largest port in the country.  I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach has joined us in the Chamber because it is remarkable that in Dublin the port Authority boast of a chairman who is a Member of this House. One would imagine that, as chairman, he would be a promoter of the five year development plan for the harbour and the port of Dublin.  Given their way the Authority may well begin to do something they have failed abysmally to do over the decades and provide intensive job creation oportunities within their area. The Minister of State, as a member of the local authority, has been singularly involved in trying to do down the objectives of the port development plan by seeking to block the redevelopment and reclaiming of a small area on the north side of the port which was intended to assist in providing the essential facility of increased roll-on roll-off space for the port Authority.  An essential important factor in that five year development plan has been thwarted.</P>
    <P>In Dún Laoghaire, another major port facility, the emphasis is on the building of a marina, filling in port space, the recreational development of the breakwater type concept that Deputy O'Dea was extolling earlier on.  That was the entire commitment to the idea of developing port space in the Dún Laoghaire area.  There was no plan for job creation, for creating industrial jobs related to the uniqueness of that facility.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Limerick/Shannon Estuary area, the worry is about the new corporation envisaged, given this political statement contained in section 4 where the emphasis again will be on this type <Col N="624" /> of recreational concept.  It is not good enough to say that everything is there in section 4.  It has to be taken with the realities of what is happening throughout the country at the moment, and the failure of the Government to recognise the essential importance of port areas in the creation of industrial jobs.</P>
    <P>That failure is significant but there is an even greater significance when one looks at the Shannon Estuary.  Limerick Harbour is the oldest harbour in the estuary region.  Limerick city developed around the harbour because of its important geographical location in terms of trading.  The harbour is essential to the city.  Every other major harbour in this country is essential to the city that has developed around it.  Unless there is a strong commitment to the development of the harbour, Limerick city will suffer badly.  The major concentration of population in the region is in the city and consequently the major thrust of development must be there also.  Foynes is no more than a village catering for a population of hundreds.  It does not make sense for the Government to shift the emphasis on Authority and on the concentration of power and investment away from Limerick to Foynes.</P>

I represent a city area in Dublin where there is the greatest concentration of population and the greatest concentration of unemployment.  This area of massive need has over the years suffered by the extent to which Government are prepared through Europe or their own endeavours to put money into rural investment and rural employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The region needs a single Authority.  I appreciate that the Minister is dealing with a complex and difficult area.  From the extent to which there has been simply local political comment, with the exception of my comments, I understand that there are competing interests, many of them narrow, at play in the estuary.  I hope a single Authority which will have the power and the political will to put to work the vast resources that exist in the region will be established in the lifetime of this Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation gives clear indications that the Minister is not addressing the key points that have to be addressed in this debate but that he is seeking to appease the huge antagonisms that exist locally.  If the local authorities and the <Col N="626" /> local political interests along the estuary are incapable of coming up with a reasoned solution, could the Minister not have considered SFADCo as an Authority that could well be brought into play in developing a single Authority for the harbour and estuary?  We recently legislated to extend SFADCo's geographical influences right around the estuary; if what is happening along the banks of the estuary cannot be resolved, is there not an argument for bringing in a well established Authority at least in the short-term to take on the work?</P>
    <P>I am concerned about aspects of the legislation.  I have considered the submission from Limerick Harbour Authority and from the Irish Ports Authority as did Deputy O'Dea and others.  They make good arguments for their case.  It is curious that it is only the Limerick Harbour Authority who have been mobilised into lobbying and making their views known, at least in a general way to Deputies here.  That in itself tells a story. Foynes is certainly being well looked after in this legislation.  I will not get into the pros or cons of that beyond saying that a clear message comes from this legislation that the city of Limerick and its harbour will not fare well under the new corporation.</P>
    <P>I find it remarkable that we seek to legislate under section 6 to tell a newly appointed authority where they should locate their headquarters.  I do not accept that this is matter of ministerial decision. I would have thought that to be a matter eminently suitable for and appropriate to the authority once established.  I understand fully &mdash; or think I do, having listened to some of the debates here &mdash; why the Minister must appease Foynes Authority.  Limerick is at the head of the harbour estuary.  It is pivoted right in the centre of the infrastructures of the region.  All roads going north and south move through Limerick; the rail lines do so; all the administrative and regional headquarters are located there.  There is no conceivable basis on which to sustain the suggestion made by the Minister that he is locating the authority at Foynes <Col N="627" />&ldquo;because I consider Foynes an ideal central location.&rdquo;  It is central to nowhere, with the greatest of respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Central to the activities of the estuary.  The Deputy should know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a ridiculous argument but one ably defended by Deputy O'Dea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Look at the movement of traffic in the estuary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also make the point that the membership of the proposed authority is not fairly established.  It is quite clear again that Foynes must be appeased.  The suggestion of appointing specifically in name two members of the Foynes Authority to the exclusion of those specific officers from Limerick Harbour Commissioner defies logic.  It is noted that Limerick Corporation will have a representative on the board but no representative as of right from the Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  That is insulting and an outrage, given the very good record illustrated in the documentation forwarded to us and quoted and adopted by Deputy O'Dea &mdash; a Deputy of the area and of the Minister's own party, who I take it to be endorsing the figures and facts outlined.</P>
      <P>Interestingly, the one matter that the Deputy did not refer to &mdash; and I appreciate his aversion to matters relating to labour and the like &mdash; was the very fine harbour employment rationalisation scheme that the authority in Limerick succeeded in introducing which they claim has resulted from work on the dock rationalisation scheme of 1973.  This succeeded in bringing the level of employment from 350 down to 30 and has secured industrial peace in the harbour for the last 15 years.  I wonder how Deputy O'Dea manage not to mention that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Two specifically named members from Foynes Authority automatically, as of right, will sit on this board, but not one member of the harbour commissioners will sit of right. Deputy O'Dea says that these can be brought in at the Minister's discretion. They should be there of right and their appointment not left to the discretion or foible of the day.</P>
      <P>The fact that no member of the unions representing the workforce in any of the harbour authorities to be brought in is included as of right on the board is another serious matter.  They should be there as of right and not, again, courtesy of the goodwill or discretion of the Minister of the day.  I ask that the Minister look into these matters.  Many of the other provisions dealing with staff conditions, work and other concerns are well covered.</P>
      <P>In summation, the Minister in replying must answer many very fundamental questions that arise from the debates' here.  Why is he going in that direction of trying to play down the central role of Limerick harbour, both in the failure to give recognition to the work of its commissioners in terms of representation on the new corporation and in the movement of the headquarters away from the obvious geographical political capital of the region at Limerick.  More importantly &mdash; and this is a fundamental matter &mdash; there is the question of the extent to which one can interpret a political statement on port development as contained in section 4, coupled with the record of Governments to date.  This legislation represents much of the haphazard approach to harbour and port development which has been the record of successive Governments to date.  That it has been introduced by the Minister in this debate and elsewhere as the prototype for further harbour development and harbour authorities is a matter of grave concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless these questions are seriously addressed and answered at the conclusion of the debate, The Workers' Party are left with no option but to exercise their vote against the further development of the legislation.  We shall be calling on the <Col N="629" /> Minister to take the matter back, not just to his draftsmen but to his political colleagues, to seek to redefine, re-establish and restate a policy on port and harbour development that recognises the essential contribution to job creation, and particularly jobs in areas of high population and equally high unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this Bill for the setting up of a single development Authority for the Shannon Estuary, which is of special interest to me.  I see it as a progressive step forward which will lead to massive development in the estuary, thus leading to the creation of much needed jobs.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to establish a new body to be known as the Shannon Estuary Development Corporation and to define their functions, powers and jurisdiction.  The new body will have a mandate to promote, co-ordinate and develop investment in marine-related industrial, tourist, recreational and amenity facilities and to encourage activities likely to contribute to the realisation of the marine potential of the Shannon Estuary.  If will also take over, manage and operate the existing harbours at Limerick, Foynes and Kilrush and will have jurisdiction over the entire waters of the Shannon Estuary.</P>
      <P>I welcome section 6 of the Bill which provides for the location of the Shannon Estuary Development Corporation headquarters at Foynes.  Foynes Authority have made tremendous progress over the years, with the co-operation of their excellent workforce.</P>
      <P>Section 8 sets out the membership of the corporation and the method of appointment of members and provides that members other than local authority members must have expertise in finance, commerce, shipping, law or management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present staff of Limerick, Foynes and Kilrush are catered for under sections 14 and 15 which provide for the transfer of staff from the present Authorities to the new body and for the preservation of <Col N="630" /> their terms and conditions of service and pension rights, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>For over 20 years we have heard much talk about an estuarial Bill and here I congratulate the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Daly, on his initiative.  This is not the first occasion on which proposals for the setting up of a single Authority for the Shannon Estuary have been put before this House.  The concept of a single estuarial Authority has been under discussion for a long time and has received the support of almost all Ministers who have been responsible for commercial harbours during that time.  Various Ministers have had extensive negotiations with the various interests involved over many years.  Bills providing for a single harbour Authority for the estuary go back as far as 1977 but lapsed on the dissolution of the Dáil.  Again we had a similar situation in 1986.  It is hoped that we will see this Bill through.</P>
    <P>I consider the establishment of a single estuarial Authority as vital to the development of the unique potential of the estuary.  The estuary is a large natural resource and it should be managed and marketed as such.  It has not to date developed to its full potential.  What it now needs is a co-ordinated approach with an overall plan for the estuary. Experts have confirmed the vast potential of the estuary for industry and services requiring deep water facilities.</P>
    <P>We have seen very successful projects developed to date, such as the ESB coal burning station at Moneypoint, the Alumina project at Aughinish, the oil jetty near Shannon Airport, etc. and all have resulted in the total tonnage of goods through the Shannon estuary increasing from 1.467 million in 1982 to 5.5 million in 1988.  With further planning and development under this Bill we can anticipate much needed employment being created, as the opportunities that exist in the estuary are stated to be without equal in Europe.</P>
    <P>The estuary's unique maritime capacity provides tremendous opportunities. It has the capacity with minimal dredging to handle bulk cargo vessels of <Col N="631" /> 400,000 tonnes.  Only three sheltered harbours in Europe can accommodate vessels of this size.  Many of the major traditional ports of north-west Europe have problems of congestion, shallow approaches and shortage of land and labour.  This will not be the position with the estuary.</P>
    <P>The north Kerry side, in which Deputy Deenihan has the same interest as I, has many acres lying idle and with this Bill we see the possibility of future development there.  A recent study by the RDO sponsored by the EC assessed heavy industrial sites throughout the area in question and special mention was made of Tarbert, Ballylongford and Astee in the north Kerry area.  These are also places of very high unemployment and it is imperative that these three townlands be noted as prime areas for positive development. Tarbert and Screen piers can now accommodate coastal vessels.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the principle of this Bill is to bring all harbour vessels along the estuary, whether commercial, fishery or recreational under the one administration and planning unit and it is intended that the new body would co-operate in and complement the work of other development agencies in the area.  I was surprised this morning to hear Deputy Taylor-Quinn opposing this Bill. She is in the same situation as the other Deputies from the region.  Her colleague, Deputy Doyle, has been pushing for this measure for a long time.</P>
    <P>In addition to Shannon International Airport excellent road and rail networks link the main estuary development areas with the national road and mainline rail systems.  The Minister has confirmed that he had prolonged and detailed discussions with the various interests in the region.  Special efforts have been made by him to get a concensus among the parties in favour of a single Authority. Time will prove that being part of a single Authority having access to a larger pool of resources, including financial resources, to aid further development will provide all regions on the estuary with more opportunities than handicaps.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="632" /> I agree that to work efficiently the board need a smaller membership than existing major harbour authorities who have a membership of up to 27.  For this reason the total membership of the board is to be 13, which I consider the most efficient consistent with adequate provison for a wide variety of interests along the estuary.  In order to ensure that the right calibre of person is appointed, a provision is included that members will be required to have wide experience of, or capacity in, finance, commerce, shipping, law or management.  Provision is made for one member each from Kerry, Clare and Limerick County Councils and from Limerick Corporation, SFADCo will have one member, port users two members and Foynes interests two members in recognition of that harbour's importance, for the successful operation of the corporation.  The Minister will appoint all members of the board.  He will have a personal &ldquo;family&rdquo; of four.  I appeal to him to include union representation on the new board.</P>
    <P>The development powers being conferred on the new estuary corporation are to apply only to the area within their jurisdiction where this development would be considered a normal function. Marine related facilities cover a wide area such as ship building, yacht or boat chartering, operation of marinas, aquaculture, fishing and water sports, not all of which would affect trade through ports of the estuary.  Marketing and promotion of the estuary will be most important. If these efforts succeed in attracting a prospective developer, the relevant State agency would then become involved. That is why I welcome the presence on the board of a member of SFADCo and I welcome the measure providing that port users' money is not used for activities other than commercial harbour activities. The Bill includes a provision that any investment in other marine related facilities will require the Minister's consent.  I welcome that.</P>
    <P>Only good can come from this Bill.  It will mean a great deal to the estuary and in particular to the Kerry region.  For years we have been looking for something <Col N="633" /> like this.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing in this Bill and I hope he will see it through.</P>

      <P>Although the Minister knows my view on this Bill, I would like to express my appreciation of his courage in bringing it forward.  I do not have to remind him that it is not universally acceptable to the people using the Shannon estuary, especially the main users, Foynes Harbour Trustees and Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  However, I congratulate him on behalf of people who are interested in the Shannon estuary and its development, and, even if I am critical of the Bill, I shall do my best today to put forward proposals which will make the legislation acceptable to everyone concerned.</P>
      <P>The Minister and I share the view that Clare and Kerry have lost out considerably in the past because of lack of representation, lack of any policy and because of monopolies by the main port users.  Over many years there has been a broad consensus in favour of a single ports authority for the Shannon estuary which would lead to a more cohesive approach to future planning and development and promotion of this most valuable natural amenity.  It is universally recognised that the estuary has great potential for heavy industry and could be the shipment gateway for the rest of Europe with its variety of geographical locations, natural sheltered deep water which could cater for vessels up to 400,000 tonnes etc.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the Lievense report which stated it would be possible to provide a channel in the estuary to allow for vessels up to 400,000 tonnes.  In the same report Mr. Lievense said the Shannon estuary was like a sleeping beauty waiting to be kissed awake.  All of us on this side would share that sentiment.</P>
      <P>I agree that a single port Authority would avoid duplication and lead to better overall deployment of scarce financial resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's efforts in bringing forward this Bill but in its present form it is not the best solution to the problem.  It is rather ironic that both <Col N="634" /> Limerick Harbour Commissioners and Foynes Harbour Trustees are both totally opposed to this Bill.  In the past there has been no great co-operation between them but they are united in their opposition to this measure.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposed by Deputy Jim Mitchell and later by Deputy Avril Doyle was far more acceptable to all interested parties.  Deputy Mitchell consulted with every development association on both sides of the estuary, with the county councils and all the local authorities.  In fact he over-consulted and as a result time ran out as regards getting the Bill through before the fall of the last Dáil. His proposal would have been better than that contained in this Bill.  If we can get a compromise between the Minister's proposal and that put forward by Deputy Mitchell and Deputy Doyle, we will come up with something acceptable to everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Foley said that we in north Kerry have great hopes for the future development of the Shannon Estuary where we have the problem of unemployment and emigration at an unacceptable level.  North Kerry, especially the area along the Shannon bank, was totally ignored and neglected in the past. The deepest water is at Ardmore Point at Tarbert.  This was borne out by the Foras Forbartha report in 1983 which identified Ardmore Point as the optimum location in the estuary for various types of industry.  We have a land bank on the estuary with over 1,000 acres, 600 acres of which are in public ownership.  It is a national scandal that having bought this land at a very high price it has been left idle since 1979, when the first part was bought, and the early eighties, when the last of the land bank was purchased.  I have seen no effort by anybody to do anything about development there.  This is not surprising when one considers that it is totally unattractive to industrialists. There is no road network leading to the land bank.  The road from Limerick to Tarbert via Foynes is a disgrace.  I travel along it twice a week and it would definitely discourage any executive or industrialist hoping to live in Limerick and commute to the Shannon bank or Foynes. <Col N="635" /> It is a disaster.  The national plan contains proposals to provide better access to our ports.  The Government should earmark sufficient finance for the Limerick-Foynes-Tarbert road.  Unless we have a proper road network to Tarbert I cannot see anything happening.</P>
    <P>There is not an adequate fresh water supply to the land bank.  There is just enough water to satisfy the needs of the local farmers.  There is a proposal with the Department of the Environment, which I hope is submitted in the south-west regional plan, to build major waterworks on the Smearla river in north Kerry.  This would ensure an adequate supply to that region and especially the land bank.  The Minister should emphasise to his Government colleagues, especially the Minister for the Environment, that this is necessary if there are to be any future developments in north Kerry as a whole or in the land bank.</P>
    <P>There is a case to be made for the extension of the national gas grid to include this area.  In view of reports of substantial finds off Kinsale there should be a sufficient amount of gas available to extend the grid to other parts of the country, including the estuary.  This would make the estuary far more attractive for intending industrialists.  In the past no effort was made to carry out an integrated study of the Tarbert land bank, to look at its viability for the construction of a deep water port.  I would accuse Limerick Harbour Commissioners as much as anybody else in view of their resources.  It is the most attractive location but it was not studied with a view to providing a proper jetty or any other infrastructural development.  My own party stand indicted as well as the Government.  There was no interest in the Shannon bank in the Tarbert-Ballylongford area.  I hope that the passage of this Bill and the creation of a dynamic port Authority will bring about change for both Kerry and Clare.</P>
    <P>The Minister is no doubt aware of the study on the estuary initiated by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Reynolds, to be carried out by <Col N="636" /> SFADCo.  A case could be made for awaiting the publication of this report before deciding what we want.  The report will show the way for future development in the Shannon Estuary and emphasise the priority areas.  Perhaps we should shape the suggested port Authority along the lines proposed in the study, which is to be published as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I now want to consider the title of the Bill and the basic arguments put forward by Foynes Harbour Trustees and Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  The 1977 Bill promoted by Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick and the 1986 Bill promoted by Deputy Jim Mitchell referred appropriately to a Shannon Ports Authority. The most important thing for any Authority to do is to look after the ports. Deputy O'Dea said it would be very easy to treat management of the ports as being more important.  Under section 4 management of the ports is being reduced in importance and the emphasis is on the development of marine-related activities, tourist, recreational and amenity facilities. I would not like to see that happen because the greatest asset of the Shannon Estuary is the ports and the possibility of access by large ships.  The more quickly ships can come in and out of the Shannon Estuary the more attractive it will be for ship owners.  The development of marine-related activities, mariculture and so on is all very fine but they only involve a very limited number of jobs.  I agree with the Minister that there are possibilities for developing these within the estuary, but the main function of this ports Authority must be to make the Shannon Estuary more attractive for port users.  One of the jobs to be undertaken should be the dredging of Foynes harbour and the dredging of a channel right up to Limerick harbour to bring in bigger ships; at the moment they can bring in ships of up to 4,000 tonnes.  This is where the emphasis must be put.  I would hate to think that this new corporation would feel that their function was to bring in industry as such.  That can be easily done by SFADCo.  A separate section could <Col N="637" /> be set up in SFADCo to promote industry in the Shannon Estuary.</P>
    <P>What is happening now will lead to a duplication of functions and to confusion. SFADCo see the Shannon estuary as their main focus for future development in the region.  Having another Authority in there vying with them will not create the right impression outside the country. We will have two Authorities competing with each other and, no doubt, with the IDA who will be trying to get as much port business and related industry for places like Ringaskiddy in Cork which has far more advantages and far better infrastructure and which in the past received far greater investment &mdash; over £100 million &mdash; for infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Again, the title &ldquo;Shannon Estuary Development Corporation&rdquo; is designed to impress people in north Kerry, west Limerick and the Minister's own constituency. The corporation will have the capability to initiate substantial developments like marinas, mariculture, fisheries, etc. in that area.  SEDCo will be confused with SFADCo.  In addition SEDCo happens to be the name of a well known oil drilling company which has operated off the Irish coast on several occasions.  I would point out also that at the moment there is a development Authority in south Kerry called SWADCO which some of the Minister's colleagues here often confuse with SFADCo.  The difference is that SWADCO in south Kerry is the South West Kerry Development Company whereas the other is Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  There is confusion between all the titles.  The grandiose title of the Bill is obviously intended to emphasise that the new Authority will give priority to such activities as marine-related industries, tourist, recreational and amenity facilities.  These functions, especially industrial development and tourism are already catered for by SFADCo with whom the port Authorities in the Shannon Estuary have a close and effective relationship.</P>
    <P>The recent initiative by Foynes Harbour Trustees in co-operation with SFADCo to bring cruisers into Foynes <Col N="638" /> harbour is a welcome one and should be encouraged because the Shannon estuary has considerable potential for this type of tourism.  Such cruisers could visit places like Bunratty Castle and Knappogue.  I would like to compliment Foynes Harbour Trustees and SFADCo on taking this initiative.  It indicates a co-operation that already exists between them.</P>
    <P>Furthermore the local authorities in the Shannon estuary region, some of whom own piers and jetties, are quite competent to undertake the promotion of marinas and tourist-related activities. If we had the resources in County Kerry we could do a very good job in promoting marinas and tourist-related activities on the Shannon estuary.  Our county development team have the capacity to do that type of work if we are granted the resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Why have you not done Fenit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Simply because we had not got the resources.  We have been crying out for investment in Fenit and other parts of north Kerry.  We have all the plans in the world.  The Shannon estuary has been surveyed more than any other estuary in the country.  Now there is another plan from the Minister, Deputy Reynolds.  What we want now is action and I am sure that is what the Minister wants as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the commercial side, it is difficult to see how SFADCo could finance marine-related industries, recreational and amenity facilities having regard to the fact that there will be no additional Exchequer costs as a result of the Bill. There is no State equity in the corporation and an existing debt of between £4 million and £5 million on the port of Foynes.  How can this corporation be viable when they will inherit this huge financial burden when they take Foynes over?  Hopefully activity within the estuary will generate the necessary finance but if there is competition in the shipping world, as there appears to be, if there is an increase in costs, I cannot see these <Col N="639" /> resources becoming too readily available to the corporation in the future.</P>
    <P>Certainly without initial financing I cannot see how this corporation will be able to do the things the Minister envisages they will do.  As I have said, a commercially viable project has a good chance of getting off the ground in the present circumstances.  If, for example, an industrialist wanted to set up a business in the estuary, outside of the land bank and the Tarbert area, it would have as good a chance of succeeding under the existing arrangements as it would under the Minister's proposal.</P>
    <P>The Bill is perceived by port users in the Shannon area as a vehicle for diverting port revenues to non-remunerative projects of a political nature.  I would point out to the Minister that one of his colleagues had photographs taken &mdash; one of which appeared in <i>The Kerryman</i>&mdash; with the local people in Saleen in Tarbert where he pointed out that when the development corporation was set up a marina would be established in Ballylongford.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated in his speech:</P>
      <P>The Estuary is a large natural resource and it should be managed and marketed as such.  It has not been developed to its full potential to date; such development as has taken place has been as a piecemeal operation in different places and by different organisations with no overall co-ordinated approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find this statement extraordinary.  It shows no recognition for what has taken place in the estuary in the past 20 years or so.  How can we guarantee that there will be development in the estuary in the near future?  Where is the evidence for this sweeping statement?  In the Minister's Second Stage speech on the previous Bill which was introduced by Deputy Mitchell who was then Minister, he mentioned piecemeal development by different organisations.  Does the Minister think, for example, that Moneypoint, Tarbert power station, Aughinish Aluminium and Dernish Island were built in the wrong place?  What was piecemeal about those developments?  They were all <Col N="641" /> built for a purpose.  If it were not for Dernish Island, Aeroflot would not now be in Shannon and Mr. Gorbachev probably would not have flown into Shannon a few weeks ago.  In all fairness to the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, if they did not set up Dernish Island and put resources into it Aeroflot would not now be in Shannon.</P>
    <P>The achievements of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners &mdash; and I criticised them here this morning &mdash; over the last 25 years are on record and indeed must be appreciated.  Deputy McCartan, who is not from Limerick, and Deputy O'Dea, the Minister's colleague, pointed that out also.  The Limerick people must be very disappointed with the Bill and they have reason to be aggrieved.  Deputy O'Dea has mentioned the development that has taken place already and I will not go into it now.  The Limerick Harbour Commissioners have outlined in a communique the various improvements they have been responsible for in the last 25 years and they merit some recognition.  I will quote from that communique which was sent to all Deputies last February.  It states:</P>
    <P>Since 1823 the Limerick Harbour Commissioners have controlled and developed almost the entire Estuary from Limerick City to the mouth of the Shannon.  Over the past 25 years ship sizes entering the Estuary have increased from 10,000 tonnes to 150,000 tonnes &mdash; a fifteen-fold increase.  The volume of goods loaded and discharged has increased from a level of 400,000 tonnes to 5.6 million tonnes &mdash; a fourteen-fold increase. Investment in maritime-related industrial plants, adjacent to the waters controlled by the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, has achieved a level of almost £2 billion.</P>
    <P>No other Irish port has rivalled these achievements over the equivalent period.  This spectacular level of development in the Shannon Estuary could not have been attained unless the Limerick Harbour Commissioners had&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="642" /> I would acknowledge this</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;developed a deepwater navigation channel and provided vastly improved services.  The development of the deepwater navigation channel entailed intensive hydrographic surveying, updating of navigation charts, locating wrecks, installing modern and sophisticated navigational lighting and other aids, as well as extending the existing port control radio communication system.  The larger vessels now using the Estuary are valued at between £20 million and £30 million each and consequently demand a high level of expert assistance on entering and leaving the harbour.</P>
    <P>The commissioners made the point that the large vessels, worth £20 million to £30 million, require the best port facilities possible.  That is why the prime objective of this Authority should be to improve port facilities in the Shannon Estuary.  It should not be relegated to the fourth or fifth function in order of priority of the new Authority, as stated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out the achievements of Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  For many years, in co-operation with SFADCo and the IDA, the Limerick Harbour Commissioners have marketed the great natural advantages of the estuary on a worldwide basis, in the UK, Europe, the USA and the Far East.  Presentations have been made by officers of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners to potential industrialists in all these locations.  The closest co-operation exists between the Limerick Harbour Commissioners and not only the IDA and SFADCo but also the local authorities, chambers of commerce, the Confederation of Irish Industry and labour interests in the region.  Having consulted people in all these organisations, the Limerick Harbour Commissioners would be the first to say that there was co-operation and that they were doing their best.  This has not been acknowledged and that is not right.  I am not here to speak for Limerick city but when we are speaking on this Bill we should at least give the harbour commissioners fair play.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" /> The Minister is aware of the number of publications by the Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  One could describe them as glossy. Because they did not prove to be successful one could say that they were ineffective but at least they made an effort.  I will repeat once again that it is significant that the Minister in his Second Stage speech gave no credit whatsoever to Limerick Harbour Commissioners for the efforts they have made during the years and for bringing the estuary to its present level of development.  It is now the second largest port area outside of Dublin and handled over 6.5 million tonnes of cargo in 1988.</P>
    <P>It is questionable as to whether we should bring commercial fisheries and recreational activities together under the one planning umbrella.  As I said, port activities are highly professional operations requiring staffs of the highest skill, calibre and experience.  Lumping their work with mariculture, leisure or recreational activities would be a most retrograde step and could have serious consequences for the primary responsibility of the harbour authority.  I have emphasised this over and over again and I will continue to emphasise it.  It is important before this Bill passes through the House that we would have inserted into it its prime role, that is, the management of the various ports.</P>
    <P>The Minister sees the new Authority, in the constitutional and functional senses, providing for the establishment of similar authorities in other port areas.  He listed the main advantages which can be expected to flow from the establishment of the development corporation.  In its present form, this Bill, because of the multiplicity of agencies, is more likely to bring chaos than cohesion to the future development and promotion of the estuary. It is idle to talk about pooling capital resources unless and until such resources exist and proper structures are in place to control, manage and develop the estuary and its ports.  There is no mention of such structures in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible to avoid costly <Col N="644" /> duplication of services with a downgrading of port management functions and the highlighting of tourism and industrial development which are already adequately catered for by SFADCo.  The case for EC and Exchequer grants is more likely to be weakened than enhanced with the overlap of responsibility between SEDCo and SFADCo.  That is why I say that the survey carried out by SFADCo on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce is of importance.  At least Deputy Mitchell consulted with everybody in the place.  In fact he over-consulted. He consulted with every development association along both banks of the Shannon, with the local authorities and with Deputies.  As a result the introduction of that Bill was delayed. With whom did the Minister consult in relation to this Bill?  I have to say that we discussed the Bill on many occasions.  I appreciated this but what about the county councils?  This Bill was never discussed by Kerry County Council whereas the last Bill was.</P>

He considers Foynes as an ideal central location on the estuary. Deputy McCartan referred to this matter in detail as did Deputy O'Dea.  We could all make claims about locating it in County Kerry or County Clare, or Foynes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with any place and I will say why in a few <Col N="646" /> moments.  In his Second Stage speech the Minister could not say a good word about Limerick Harbour Commissioners and about their work on the estuary to date. By recognising that Foynes should get the centre for the great work they have done and by ignoring Limerick the insinuation was that Limerick Harbour Commissioners did not have a good record in the past.  As I said I dispute this.  Is it now intended that the Foynes staff would manage the whole estuary from their home base?  That is another issue.  All credit is due to Foynes Harbour Trustees for operating an efficient and busy port which has been developed greatly in recent years but they would be the first to admit that they have neither the experience nor the organisation to take on the huge responsibility of looking after the whole estuary.  They have admitted this in discussions I have had with them. They have admitted that they would not be able to manage the whole estuary as they do not have the necessary background and experience to do so.  They have done a good job in managing their own port but they feel that is as much as they can do.  Managing the whole estuary would be another matter altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that he would appoint two members to the board to represent Foynes' interests in recognition of the harbour's importance for the successful operation of the corporation. There was no mention of appointing representatives of Limerick Harbour Commissioners to the board in recognition of the outstanding work they have done. Deputy McCartan also referred to this issue.  No one believes the Minister's stated reasons for the favourable treatment of Foynes.  This is obviously a sop to the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, who in the past was totally opposed to a single authority.  He resisted all efforts in the past to the setting up of an authority. There is no doubt that this Bill would not be before us today were it not for the fact that the headquarters is to be located in Foynes.  I say that with all due respect to the Minister.  Only for this sop being handed out to Foynes I am convinced we would not be discussing this Bill here <Col N="647" /> today.  Perhaps we would be discussing Deputy Doyle's proposal.</P>

      <P>It is to the credit of the Foynes Trustees that they refused to swallow Deputy Collins's bait.  I have before me copies of various press releases issued by Deputy Collins during the years and also newspaper reports.  For example, let me quote from a report which appeared in <i>The Limerick Leader</i> of 17 May 1986 under the heading &ldquo;Collins blasts harbour measure&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>The Bill circulated this week to establish an authority for the Shannon Estuary has been blasted by Mr. Gerard Collins T.D., a strong supporter of Foynes Harbour autonomy. Mr. Collins said that the new Bill was a political smoke screen to satisfy demands by supporters of the Government within Limerick Harbour Commissioners. The Bill is just adding more bureaucracy to the top heavy bureaucracy that already exists.  This Harbours Bill will be in dry dock before long. It has no financial element contained within it and it will further complicate the promotion of the Shannon Estuary.</P>
      <P>That is exactly what I have said here today.  He emphasised the whole aspect of resources&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In the debate to which I referred the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Transport and Communications, Deputy Wilson, said that the Harbours Bill was surreptitious.  That is a fine big word.

      <P>The quotations are relevant to my arguments.  The trustees unanimously expressed very strong opposition to proposals contained in this Bill because they consistently opposed their own dissolution and they said that the proposed Bill provides for the dissolution of Foynes harbour trustees.  They said that the functions of the corporation as <Col N="649" /> outlined in the proposed Bill were inconsistent with the functions of the harbour Authority up to now and conflicted with the statutory functions of Bord Fáilte, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, etc.  They said that there were no Exchequer costs or staffing implications in regard to the Department of State, State bodies and local authorities as a result of this Bill.  They said that no investment would mean no jobs.  They are basically their main objections to the Bill.</P>
      <P>The proposed Bill provides for the dissolution of Foynes harbour trustees, Limerick Harbour Commissioners and Cappagh and makes no provision for the dissolution of the authorities that control Clarecastle, Kilbaha, Querrin, Kildysart, Carrigaholt, Knock and Labasheeda on the north bank and Kilteely, Glin, Tarbert and Saleen on the south bank.  Will the Minister allow these piers to remain in operation?  What is the legal position, for example, of Clarecastle?  I understand that Clarecastle have their own commissioners. Why were they not dissolved in the Bill?  What is to prevent Clarecastle from becoming a mini-Foynes?</P>
      <P>The Limerick Harbour Commissioners have always expressed the view that the principal office should be a matter for the new Authority, not the plaything of local politicians.  Deputy McCartan and Deputy O'Dea said that a new Authority should decide where they would locate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to accept the Minister's explanation for the exclusion of Clarecastle as a statutory port in the proposed Authority on the grounds that it has no importance.  Clarecastle and other piers were included in previous Bills.  Why are they now excluded?  I have extracts from speeches in the Seanad &mdash; I will not quote &mdash; and the Minister's colleague, Senator Honan, said that she did not understand how a Minister could come into the House with legislation to abolish the Clarecastle trustees because of a High Court decision in November 1982.  The trustees appointed a fully qualified harbour master, developments have gone ahead and barges are now coming up to Clarecastle. The new body bought adjoining <Col N="650" /> land and buildings costing between £80,000 and £100,000.  Senator Honan said she did not understand how a Minister could repeal the Act and do away with this new body.</P>
    <P>I can see major problems ahead if the Minister allows all these little piers to operate separately without explaining why the new body will have total control over them.  I can see great annoyance being caused if nothing is done to curb the powers of Clarecastle and to include them in this authority.  Perhaps the Minister will refer to this when replying.  As I mentioned, CW Shipping Limited have leased Clarecastle and Kildysart piers from the Clarecastle harbour trustees and Clare County Council respectively.  The company have developed proposals in respect of these two piers and have applied for EC Structural Funds for Clarecastle pier, for example.  Indeed, I was looking through a submission by SFADCo to the working group for the south-west region for the national plan in relation to small ports' Structural Funds to the value of £500,000 for improvements proposed for harbour facilities at Clarecastle to encourage import and export of mineral products.  The Bill will have to be amended to ensure that Clarecastle is included.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to membership. Deputy Doyle's proposal was that there would be a 21 member Authority with overall responsibility for policy, planning and development of the estuary.  It was envisaged that the members would elect a seven member board of management which would have responsibility for the day-to-day administration of the estuary. This proposal had greater potential for all sides of the estuary.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal to restrict the membership of the board to 13 is too narrow and would not permit representation of all the interests involved. I do not agree with the method of appointment to the board.  If the board consists of members who have an interest in tourism, fishing or the provision of recreational facilities, they will direct their policies towards such developments. If the members of the board do <Col N="651" /> not have expertise in port development, that role will be diminished within the proposed Authority.</P>
    <P>There are many things I could say about the Bill based on the studies that have been carried out on the estuary.  I should like to tell the Minister that, despite my criticisms of the measures, I appreciate the fact that he has introduced the Bill.  I hope all sides of the House will work together to produce a Bill that will be acceptable to everybody.  We want to ensure the future of the estuary.  I am not trying to be negative or trying to block the Bill because I realise that anything is better than nothing for Kerry and to date we have not received anything.</P>
    <P>We welcome any new developments and I will be in favour of any Bill that offers hope for Kerry.  However, I can see problems arising if the Bill is adopted in its present form.  There is a need to amend some of its provisions and I hope the Minister will accept suggestions from this side of the House.  I look forward to legislation being in place by the summer to ensure the maximum development of the Shannon estuary.  I should like to compliment the Minister on introducing the Bill.  It was not an easy task.  I do not think the Minister, if he has his way, would have located the headquarters in Foynes but he has had to try to please everybody.  If the Minister succeeds in getting the Bill through the House, he will deserve great credit.</P>

      <P>It goes without saying that as an island nation good trade and good transport are essential to us.  It also goes without saying that we need efficient and well-run ports.  Our waterways are very much a part of a good transport system.  Unfortunately, when one looks at the history of the Shannon estuary and the difficulties experienced in trying to establish one estuarial Authority, which I favour, one will see that we have a very sad background in regard to the development of our waterways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Difficulties arose when efforts were <Col N="652" /> made to introduce the necessary legislation in the House.  Some of those difficulties arose because successive Ministers, and Governments, were afraid to grasp the nettle.  They were influenced by narrow, petty party political and parochial attitudes.  The Minister may claim that he is good at knocking heads together elsewhere, and I am not against knocking heads together if that is for a good purpose and in the interests of a progressive policy for the nation, but the Bill contains many narrow, party political and parochial attitudes.  If it contained the opposite I would say so in the House because I am not a parrot here.  I have almost 100 submissions on this topic.  I do not come into the House to parrot the words of somebody else or to steal or plagiarise documents.  I say my own piece and express my feelings about various topics.  I have not come to the House as a Limerick city chauvinist but as a socialist from a broad perspective in relation to Ireland and in the European context.</P>
    <P>In my view the Bill is flawed throughout. It is ill-conceived and ill-advised. Unfortunately, in spite of what the Minister said on Second Stage, he has lost a good opportunity to do some pioneering, to do something real and solid.  He has lost an opportunity of setting a good example of what can be done in regard to other Bills that will be presented to the House.  I am referring to legislation for the ports of Cork, Dublin and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Two months ago the House considered the Shannon Free Airport Development Company (Amendment) Bill which extended the writ of that company along the banks of the estuary to north Kerry. That represented a good and logical development because the estuary is in the middle of the mid-west.  It is natural that the banks of the estuary should be under the jurisdiction of SFADCo which is located in the middle of the region.</P>
    <P>Given the Government's decision to extend the brief of SFADCo to north Kerry, it would be a natural follow on for the Minister for the Marine to establish a central and democratic Authority in the estuary.  That is not being done and we <Col N="653" /> do not have one central body controlling the estuary.  Such a move should take place in a democratic, open and honest way.  Instead we have this botched, cobbled together legislation which seeks to eliminate the Limerick Harbour Commissioners. I am not a spokesman for that body, and I am not a member of it, but it is important to point out that the commissioners have been in control of the Shannon estuary since 1815.  The Minister has turned his back on that body and its record of public service over the years. The Bill ignores the contribution of the staff of the commissioners to the efficient operation of the business of running the estuary in that time.  In short, the Bill ignores the competence, professionalism and contribution of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I am not a Limerick city chauvinist and I will be the first to admit that the Limerick Harbour Commissioners is not and was not a suitable title for a body with control of the Shannon estuary.  It should be said, however, that the title dates back to 1815 but it is now outdated and outmoded.  It has no use in the present context.  However, I have some difficulty with the name the Minister has given to the new Authority.  I do not think the word &ldquo;corporation&rdquo; is a suitable description for a harbour Authority.  I have difficulty with the context of a Bill which downgrades Limerick city and its citizens by its proposal to move the headquarters of the new body to Foynes.  That is a most unusual and provocative proposal. It is without precedent and I have great difficulty in understanding why the Minister should include a provision to do that in the Bill unless, of course, one can understand the political implications behind the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is no valid reason to move the headquarters to Foynes.  Indeed, it defies logic and common sense.  Limerick city straddles the River Shannon.  It links the banks of the estuary and links County Clare with County Limerick.  It is the ideal location for the headquarters of any body charged with the control of the estuary. The city of Limerick is the capital of the region and it has been a port for <Col N="654" /> more than 1,000 years.  It has been the traditional headquarters of the estuary. Indeed, the name of Limerick is synonymous with the River Shannon and the estuary.  Therefore, it is the natural centre.</P>
    <P>A proposal to locate the new headquarters of the estuarial body in Foynes is tantamount to proposing that the headquarters of the Dublin Port Authority should be moved from Dublin city to Howth or Skerries or to proposing that the headquarters of the Cork Port Authority should move from Cork city to Ringaskiddy. I hope Members do not consider my views on this issue to be narrow.  I am speaking as a democrat and not merely as a representative of Limerick East.  I do not have anything against Foynes.  We live in a changing world and we must look around us at all times.  However, the decision in regard to the headquarters of the new body cannot be justified or defended on any grounds except that of parochialism and petty party considerations.</P>
    <P>Limerick city, particularly the area around the harbour and the docks, has suffered badly from unemployment and emigration in recent years.  It needs all the support it can get from the Government. The city needs many groups, public and private, to locate their headquarters there.  It also needs as much prestige and status as it can muster, particularly now that the city has been designated a university city.  We should always try to enhance and upgrade our regional capitals, particularly one like Limerick which is close to Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>In the area around Limerick port, there has been a great deal of dereliction in the last decade or so, particularly since the departure of Ranks and other factories.  That area should be upgraded considerably but there are no provisions in the Bill for tackling the problems I have referred to.  Instead the Bill proposes to move the headquarters of the harbour Authority out to Foynes and this will leave Limerick as a kind of vacuum.  I do not think this is a good enough proposal from a Minister who <Col N="655" /> lives in close proximity to the city of Limerick.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, and the Minister for Defence, Deputy Noonan, both live in West Limerick and they too should have a more sensitive approach in this respect.  As the Minister is well aware, a new bridge was built across the River Shannon last year, the Shannon Bridge, and this has opened up great potential and possibilities for Limerick.  However, these possibilities are not explored in this Bill; they are totally ignored.  I regret very much this lost opportunity to explore the possibilities for that area.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I have nothing whatsoever against Foynes but it cannot be denied that this Bill is weighted heavily in favour of that town, not only with regard to the headquarters of the proposed new body but in other aspects also. For example, the proposal to appoint two representatives of the Foynes harbour trustees to the new board is a most undemocratic and unfair decision and further loads the dice in favour of Foynes. This is clear preferential treatment for Foynes.  Not only does the Bill propose to abolish the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, the largest navigational lighting authority in the State with the exception of Irish Lights, as other people have said, but it also proposes to downgrade the port's managerial functions at a time when sea transportation is essential to our survival as a nation.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to reduce drastically the membership of the new board and to deny Tipperary County Council and local trade unions any representation on the new corporation.  I believe that trade unions should be represented on the new body.  They are represented at present on the board of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners and they should be represented on any new body which is appointed to control the estuary.  The Minister should not appoint a trade union nominee who is also a member of the Fianna Fáil Party as one of his four nominees. People in trade unions are entitled to be members of the Fianna Fáil Party, <Col N="656" /> or any party, but this would be a wrong attitude to adopt.  The trade union person appointed to the board should represent the interests of his members and not be appointed because of his loyalty to any party.  I hope the Minister will take that point on board.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a kick in the teeth to the staff of the Limerick Harbour Authority. These people have served the Authority and the Shannon Estuary well over the decades and they have good reason to be worried about the proposals in the Bill. They are worried about their jobs, their pensions and their futures and it is to be hoped that their jobs and pension rights will be guaranteed if they are transferred to this new body.</P>
    <P>The role of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Gerry Collins, in matters such as this down through the years has been mentioned by other speakers and, in particular, by Deputy Deenihan.  I have not come here to stigmatise the Minister or to vilify him.  I would achieve nothing by doing that.  I have not come into this House to be destructive or negative.  I have come here to speak in a constructive and positive way and to give my honest opinion on the merits and demerits of the Bill.  Down through the years the Minister was a very strenuous opponent of any attempt to establish a single united estuarial Authority.  Deputy Deenihan quoted from press reports and, indeed, hardly a week went by when the Minister was not quoted on the pages, and sometimes the front pages, of the <i>Limerick Leader</i> castigating and vilifying any attempt to establish one estuarial Authority. I do not understand how he has managed to change his attitude so quickly.</P>
    <P>I see the effort to upgrade Foynes, to make it the headquarters of the new body and to appoint two members of the Foynes Harbour Trustees to the new body as an effort to placate the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins.  This is not a good attitude.  It is inconsistent, illogical and does not impress anybody.  I will not say much more on this subject except that this Bill is merely a monument to parish pump politics.  We are trying to make <Col N="657" /> one of the great natural amenities of this country a monument to gombeen politics, but we should get above that.</P>
    <P>I will not delay the House much longer because, as I said, I am not here as a parrot to read other people's statements. I have come here to speak my mind.  I should like to make a few points about the title to the Bill and the title of the proposed body.  The title &ldquo;Shannon Estuary Development Corporation&rdquo; will not cover what the Minister has in mind.  The old title, the Shannon Ports Authority, was much nearer the mark.  The word &ldquo;corporation&rdquo; is identified mainly with big businesses and corporations such as Dublin Corporation, Cork Corporation and Limerick Corporation.  As Deputy Deenihan has pointed out the title of the proposed new Shannon Estuary Development Corporation, SEDCo, is also confusing because of the existence already of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, SFADCo.  The similarity between the two titles will cause a good deal of confusion.  If, as the Minister said earlier, SEDCo are to be a prototype for other Irish ports, will there be a Dublin port development corporation, a Cork port development corporation, etc.?  Will the primary functions of port authorities be altered to include other activities?  Perhaps the Minister will deal with this point when he is replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, port activities by their very nature are a highly skilled operation and experienced staff are needed to carry them out.  I do not think it is possible without proper planning and preparation to lump together the work of a port authority with mariculture, leisure and recreational activities unless the groundwork has been done first.  I am not against the expansion of the traditional role of a port or estuarial authority.  We live in a changing world and we must change also.  Indeed, such an expansion will be inevitable in the years ahead for all ports in Ireland and could bring about a different enhanced role for Irish port authorities.  However, it is easier to talk about this role than to achieve it and we must have our preparation done.  In any <Col N="658" /> event the Bill is far too vague and bland about how this expansion can be brought about.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the reason Foynes has been chosen as the headquarters of the proposed new body has nothing whatsoever to do with estuarial considerations.  It has more to do with the political considerations of the people involved.  It will be wrong if the new body becomes a plaything for local politicians in that area who are carrying out public relations exercises and trying to enhance their reputations.  We must get away from this if we are to develop that amenity.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that, both as individuals and through their trade unions, the Limerick Harbour Authority workers have written to their local representatives and made strong representations that State or Exchequer guarantees should be provided to ensure their future pension entitlements.  This is a very legitimate concern and it is of crucial importance to those people.  They have every right to ask somebody like me to raise that matter in this House.  The Minister may say that those provisions are included in the Bill, but we should emphasise that the workers who have served the Limerick Harbour Commissioners down through the years have rights which should be guaranteed in a very definite way.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the inevitable and unfortunate consequences of this Bill will be the downgrading of Limerick port and with it the city and people of Limerick whose fortunes have been intertwined with those of the port for many generations. It is a sad reflection on the Minister and the Government that a great natural asset, the Shannon Estuary, should become the victim of parochialism and parish pump politics.  What we need at present is vision and creativity with a view to developing that natural waterway, which is one of the finest we have, in a broadly based unified way, not only for the port but also for other industries in that area.  This would not be in the interests of the mid-west region only.  It would also be in the interests of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" /> This is a bad Bill.  It should be withdrawn and taken back to the drawing board and the parliamentary draftsmen who botched this job at the behest of some politicians.  A new Bill should be introduced.  If the Minister persists with this Bill he is set on a collision course; he is already on another collision course elsewhere.  He will find himself in some difficulty if he proceeds to pursue this Bill in its present form.  It was said elsewhere that he is a good man at knocking heads together but he should be very careful not to put his own head on the chopping block in this respect.  One must take account of people in this House who, like myself, have a definite viewpoint and take a democratic position, no matter how difficult it is, if we think it would benefit the region and the Irish people as a whole.  This Bill is not a good one and it is brought about and motivated for other reasons.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Estuary certainly needs further development, nobody denies that; I am as well aware of that as anybody else.  A Bill like this should have been adopted by the House two or three decades ago but it did not happen.  Now that it has come before the House it is a flawed Bill.  It needs to be recast, changed and altered.  This Bill will not result in a broad unified development of the Shannon Estuary.  For that reason I am opposed to the Bill and will be voting against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I was first elected to politics in 1974 as a member of Limerick County Council.  At that time there was a Shannon Harbours Bill and a Shannon Estuary Harbour Bill before this House.  All during my 15 years of active life in politics there has been a Bill dealing with the problems of a unified authority in the Shannon Estuary at some form of gestation or at some level of debate in this House.  &ldquo;The Kennedys of Castleross&rdquo; have gone off the air, &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo; have come and gone, we are in the days of &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dynasty&rdquo; but we still have a Harbours Bill before us.  The first question to be asked is: <Col N="660" />&ldquo;Why is there such a long delay in establishing what all sides of this House have said on several occasions is something which is desirable&rdquo;?  The answer is simple enough.  The political mischieviousness of the Minister's party over the last 15 years has prevented a competent effective authority being established for the estuary.  I do not think there is any other issue in my part of the country to which party politics was played quite callously to such an extent as on the issue of the Harbours Bill.  On this occasion when Fianna Fáil in Government decided to address the question, rather than moving from considerations of confidence and efficiency, of control of shipping in the harbour or of the economic development of the region, again they have presented us with a bad political compromise which arises from conflict between members of the Cabinet who happen to be elected for constituencies in the catchment area of the estuary.</P>
      <P>A Bill that is born in political controversy and is framed around a Cabinet table, with little reference to the parent Department, in an atmosphere of political compromise between competing Ministers, more conscious of their constituency interests than of the development of industry, has to be flawed.  This Bill is certainly flawed.</P>
      <P>I would like to comment first on the form the Bill is taking.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in the context of their policy to control public expenditure have spoken on a number of occasions about the desirability of not having agencies overlapping.  They have said that the private sector and the public sector should not overlap and that public sector agencies should not effectively be doing the same work as private sector agencies. Yet this Bill is cast in a mould which does not simply make the board a harbour authority for the estuary; it makes it a development agency for the estuary and in that respect is covering the same ground as the Shannon Free Airport Company for the development of certain types of industry on both banks of the estuary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="661" /> The most ludicrous form of the overlapping of agencies is to be seen in County Kerry at present.  I think it is worth commenting on in the context of this Bill. SFADCo are responsible for the industrial development of the north Kerry area.  The IDA are responsible for the industrial development of south Kerry. Udarás na Gaeltachta are responsible for the Gaeltacht areas in the Dingle peninsula, in south Kerry and in the area of Caherciveen.  On top of that there is a county development committee in Kerry. In the context of the drawing up of the national plan there is an advisory committee in north Kerry feeding in advice &mdash; and I presume being allowed to take on a permanent role as a monitor of the plan &mdash; in regard to the Mid-West region. There is a similar organisation in south Kerry with an advisory role and a monitoring role for the plan for the South-West region.  On top of those separate six organisations &mdash; all responsible for the development of County Kerry &mdash; we now have the Minister coming into the House with the SEDCo Bill which, as well as establishing a new board to control and monitor the movement of ships in the Shannon estuary also has a development role for both banks of the estuary and will be responsible for marine and port related industries in north Kerry.  As well as that SFADCo are responsible for the tourist industry in north Kerry and Bord Fáilte are responsible for the development of the tourist industry in south Kerry.  We have eight agencies looking after one county.  It really defies comment but it is the worst example of overlapping agencies that anyone can find anywhere in this country.</P>
    <P>My first objection to this Bill is of a general nature &mdash; that the region does not need another development agency. This development agency will overlap seriously with the SFADCo function.  It is curious that this should have occurred within 12 months of a Government decision, which was made more on a political basis than for reasons of efficiency or development, to give SFADCo the development role for the whole region.</P>
    <P>Up to two years ago the IDA were <Col N="662" /> responsible for large industrial development in the region while SFADCo were responsible for small industrial development there.  The cut off point was 50 jobs.  Bord Fáilte was responsible for the development of tourism in the region but for reasons of efficiency, according to the Government statement, and to prevent the overlapping of the functions of agencies, the IDA and Bord Fáilte were moved out of the region and SFADCo were given the role.  Why is that policy being reversed now and another agency being established which apart from its functions as an estuarial authority is also being given a role as the development agency for both banks of the estuary for marine-related industry and for port related industry and so on?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is the first problem I see with the Bill.  The second problem I see is that it is a Bill which is derived from political considerations. The positions of Limerick city and the Limerick Harbour Commissioners have been ignored to the point of insult.  Limerick Harbour Commissioners have been a very effective harbour board.  Deputy Deenihan has outlined the developments of the estuary over the last number of years.  Ship sizes entering the estuary have increased from 10,000 tonnes to 150,000 tonnes, the volume of goods loaded and discharged has increased from 400,000 tonnes to 5.6 million tonnes, a 14-fold increase, and investment in maritime industry adjacent to the waters controlled by Limerick Harbour Commissioners has achieved a level of almost £2 billion.  I will not repeat what Deputy Deenihan said, but Limerick Harbour Commissioners have done a very good job in the estuary.  To virtually ignore the work done by the Limerick Harbour Commissioners and the contribution they have made to the development of the estuary, by implication in the text of the Bill, is insulting to the workers and to those who on a voluntary basis as members of the Harbour Commission have worked there over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> Limerick city is the capital of the region and also its infrastructural centre.  It is the furthest down crossing point on the Shannon.  There are three bridges in Limerick. It is a simple fact of life that once one goes beyond Limerick one cannot cross the river.  All roads from surrounding counties which seek to cross the Shannon lead to Limerick.  Limerick also holds the main railway station and the airport is nearby.  It is a natural location for the headquarters of the estuarial Authority. Limerick Harbour Commissioners have had control of most of the estuary far away from the city, apart from segments controlled by Foynes.  By implication in the Bill we are suggesting that Limerick's role is not important any more.  Deputy Kemmy made the point that to move the headquarters from Limerick to Foynes is like moving Dublin Harbour Commissioners out to Howth or to Skerries or like moving the headquarters from Cork out to Ringaskiddy. It does not make sense.</P>
    <P>If we look at the downgrading of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners and at the position of their staff, we see that in the representation of the board it will be mandatory under statute for two existing employees of Foynes Harbour Trustees to be members of the board.  Will the Minister justify that?  How can one take the employees from one of the harbours and put them on the board while at the same time ignoring the primary harbour commissioners in Limerick city?  That would require an explanation to any outside observer but anybody who lives in the area does not require an explanation as it is obvious that this was Minister Collins's attempt to bring the Foynes Harbour Trustees on side with the recommendation of the Government.  Will the Minister explain why he felt that no employee of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, despite their excellent work done over the years, was considered good enough by the Minister to put on this board?  Without mincing words, is it not simply a political stunt that two people from Foynes have been designated, two people whom we can identify from the <Col N="664" /> job designation which is in the Bill, to be put on the board?  It is ironic that despite the best efforts of the Minister, Deputy Collins, these two people have also rejected this Bill as have the Foynes Harbour Trustees.  Neither Limerick Harbour Commissioners nor Foynes Harbour Trustees want this Bill.</P>
    <P>On the question of representation on the board, we should also look at the position of local authorities.  Limerick Corporation which is central to the region will have one member on the board and there will be no other representation from the city of Limerick.  That is not a fair representation from the primary port. The Minister has proceeded in this politically motivated way in circumstances where there was a perfectly adequate Bill available to him in his Department which was introduced by Deputy Jim Mitchell as Minister for Transport and which was accepted by the Limerick Harbour Commissioners and by the Foynes Harbour Trustees.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Minister will have plenty of opportunity to reply.  The Limerick Ministers have put the Minister into a corner in that he has had to propose a Bill which he knows is flawed, which he knows is a political trick of the loop and which he knows does not answer the problems of the estuary. I am not surprised now that the Minister <Col N="665" /> is trying to turn the attention to this side of the House to hide his own embarrassment in having to bring this legislation in.  It is a piece of political compromise which the Minister is attempting to pass off as a framework to establish a joint harbour authority for the estuary, which we all know is necessary.</P>
      <P>The development of the ports will be vital in the Government's development plan.  Quite a lot of attention and money are directed towards transport, in particular to the 1,500 miles of main road that has been singled out, where particular attention is drawn to the necessity for developing the infrastructure leading to our ports.  We are a trading nation, we must export to live.  Our standard of living depends on the volume and value of our exports.  We will not be able to organise this country so that all our citizens can benefit from having work unless we produce more and having produced it we will not be able to sell it at home but must sell it abroad.  It is quite clear that the ports have to be developed but in this Bill there is no attempt to integrate the development of the Shannon estuary.  If we take simple things already referred to by Deputy Deenihan, we are talking about Foynes and Limerick being the two major ports, yet the Minister for the Environment has failed to up-grade the road between the two to the status of a national primary road.</P>
      <P>There are other aspects of the Bill which are equally objectionable.  There is the question of locating the principal office of the new Authority in Foynes.  It is very difficult to justify this.  Many people in Foynes do not believe that the HQ of the board will be in Foynes.  They think there will be a brass plate arrangement which designates a particular office as the HQ and that perhaps board meetings will be held there once a month. There is no great enthusiasm among either the employees of Foynes Harbour Trustees or the local community for this headquarters because they simly do not trust the intention of the Bill to set it up there at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years, Limerick Harbour <Col N="666" /> Commissioners have contributed in a very major way to the development of the city and the region.  Likewise, Foynes harbour has been a very effective and efficient port contributing not only to employment in the region but to the development of the whole catchment area of that port.  The Minister comes in now with a Bill which neither the professionals in Limerick nor those in Foynes want to see passed.  I would ask the Minister to mend his hand in this respect and, if he cannot at this stage withdraw the Bill, at least amend it in a major way which makes it acceptable to the majority of people who have the interest of the estuary at heart.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i>&mdash;&mdash;to deal with the problems.  I have said already that it insults Limerick Harbour Commissioners collectively, but sections 13, 14, 15 and 16 have been framed in a manner which has caused great concern for the staff.  They are very concerned about the provisions in relation to transfer to the new Authority, about their pension payments and about the future status of the officers and staff of Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  The staff are insistent that pension payments in any <Col N="667" /> new Authority be State guaranteed.  I should like the Minister to take this on board, because there is great concern now among the employees of the harbour authority in Limerick.  There is also concern among the employees in Foynes authority.  The Minister is quite well aware of these concerns but, rather in the manner of the rod licence dispute, once he comes down from the mountain with the tablets of stone, he thinks it is a virtuous quality to stick to whatever bad decisions he has made and bulldoze them through.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Perhaps the Minister will succeed in bulldozing this legislation through the House, but if he does he will have done a bad job for the estuary, for Limerick city and county and for County Clare &mdash; a very, very bad job indeed.  I would advise him to mend his hand.</P>
      <P>There are so many things in this Bill which the Minister in logic cannot justify, and did not even attempt to justify in his introductory speech, that it is an extremely flawed Bill.  We come to the position of Clarecastle.  Why is it being left out?  If the intention is not only to establish a joint estuarial authority for the whole estuary but also to make it a development agency for the estuary in certain respects, why are certain ports being left out?  We can talk about Kilteely and Glin and Tarbert, they do not attract a particular level of shipping &mdash; perhaps that will develop in the future &mdash; but Clarecastle is up and running.  There is one very effective businessman who is operating from Clarecastle.  As Deputy Deenihan pointed out, there is a recommendation in the plan for the mid-west region for £0.5 million to be provided for the shipment of ore at Clarecastle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Limerick Harbour Commissioners and the Foynes Harbour Trustees are being dissolved, why is Clarecastle being exempt?  That is a reasonable question which should get a reasonable answer.  While little places like <Col N="668" /> Kilteely pier would be left out on the grounds that they are not relevant anyway and are no longer used for shipping, Clarecastle is not in that category.  The Minister should explain at the end of Second Stage debate why fish is being made of one and flesh of another.  What is the intention?</P>
    <P>Lastly, I have noticed SFADCo advertising recently for submissions on a study that they are undertaking into the development of the Shannon estuary.  If I may refer again to the multiplicity of organisations now responsible for the development of Kerry, is it reasonable in this House to be proposing a SEDCo Bill, setting up a new agency to develop the estuary and at the same time have SFADCo employing consultants to do a further study into the development of the estuary?  When I saw the new report initially that SFADCo were becoming involved in this study I thought that the Minister had come to his senses and was putting this Bill on the back burner until the report was to hand.</P>
    <P>Any reasonable report by SFADCo on the development of the estuary would deal with the very questions with which we are now dealing.  It would deal with the key questions of how best to develop shipping in the estuary, how best to develop the economic spin-off which arises from extra trade through the estuary and what would be the best way to organise and administer the estuary.  If these are not the questions at which the SFADCo study is looking, I should like to know what those questions are.  It is outrageous to be coming before the House with detailed proposals from one Minister of State while another Minister of State in the Department of Industry and Commerce is presiding over the expenditure of public funds by an agency to come up with answers to questions which the Minister for the Marine is suggesting he has answered in this Bill.  Do Ministers in this Government talk to each other any more?  Are these arrangements cobbled out in twos and threes in the offices of Leinster House rather than around the Cabinet table?  I should like <Col N="669" /> the Minister to explain how the Department of Industry and Commerce are sanctioning this study by SFADCo when the Minister is arguing that he has the answers, that they are now before the House and that all we have to do is steam ahead?</P>
    <P>It might be a very good idea if SFADCo were given a major role in developing the estuary.  I cannot see any reason at all for the role of developing marine-related industries being taken away from SFADCo by the proposals in this Bill.  If SFADCo were to remain the development agency for the region, for all development in the region, together with an estuarial authority which would deal simply with shipping in the estuary, that might be the best way to get the kind of Bill on the Statute Books for which there is support in this House and in the region.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to this Bill; I am opposed to the form that it takes; I am opposed to the fact that it is a document more in the nature of a political compromise than a development strategy; I am opposed to the downgrading of Limerick city and Limerick harbour; I am opposed to the treatment of the staff and members of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, by implication, in this Bill.  I am opposed to the manner in which the representation is organised on the board by the designation of two people together with representatives of other interests on this board, and I am opposed to the &ldquo;cart before the horse&rdquo; arrangement where we are passing the Bill before we have the results of the study which has been sanctioned by the Minister for Industry and Commerce into the form and function of the body who could control the Shannon estuary and into the strategies which would develop the Shannon Estuary to its full potential under the agency of SFADCo.</P>
    <P>I would like to return on Committee Stage, if this Bill gets to that stage, to sections which are causing concern.  In particular I appeal to the Minister, if he gets his way, to deal with those sections <Col N="670" /> concerning the conditions governing pension, payment and security of employment of the staff in the harbour authorities affected, particularly those in the employ of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill which was introduced just over a year ago and which we understood was shelved by the Government because it was not taken for such an extraordinary length of time. The information coming out about it was that the Government had changed their mind because they had done some form of deal with the Labour Party whereby their opposition to this Bill would be withdrawn and that they, for some reason that was not divulged, could be persuaded to abstain on this Bill.  That story is perhaps vindicated by the absence of the Labour Party here today in this debate.  I am the sixth, seventh or perhaps the eighth speaker on this Bill and the Labour Party have not yet offered.  They have nobody in the House, nor have they had since the debate began.  One wonders why.  If the Labour Party are not here to give an explanation of the rather strange attitude they are taking to this Bill, perhaps the Minister would give it on their behalf.</P>

      <P>It is a pity because when all parties and Independents in this House other than Fianna Fáil were expressing their opposition to this Bill and their intention to vote against it, the Bill was going to be defeated and there was no point in the Government trying to pursue it.  They have got a new lease of life with regard to it now as a result <Col N="671" /> of the reported intention of the Labour Party not to oppose it.</P>
      <P>A month or two ago the Labour Party Conference was held in Tralee and I understand that members of the Labour Party in both Limerick East and Limerick West before that conference expressed great concern and anxiety in regard to the reported attitude of the Labour Party on the Bill and that it was agreed then to withdraw the Bill from the Order Paper where it was due to be taken a week before that conference.  Apparently the Labour Party approached the Minister at the time and asked him to withdraw it. That was done even though it had been ordered for that week at the Whip's meeting the previous Thursday.  That was to encourage the delegates from Limerick East and Limerick West and perhaps from Clare to support what one would broadly call the establishment in the vital votes which took place at that conference, which they duly did.  This, therefore, appears to explain the resurrection of this Bill when many of us thought happily that it was buried.</P>
      <P>This is the third Bill of this kind that has been before this House.  It is the third Bill that purports to achieve particular objectives in regard to the Shannon estuary that has been debated in this House. It is significant that neither of the two previous Bills was passed.  I had reservations about some aspects of the previous Bills, but I would happily accept and agree to them now rather than have this Bill forced on us.  Without question this Bill is not a serious effort to deal with the management and development of the Shannon estuary at all.  This is simply a local, parochial effort to deal in a nakedly political fashion and for all the most local and parochial reasons with the management of one of the most important natural resources in this country.  That is regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A feature of the Bill is that virtually everybody who has commented on it, of all the various interests, including the competing interests who are seen to be antagonistic to one another, are unanimous that this Bill is a disaster and should <Col N="672" /> not be proceeded with.  It is unusual to get such extraordinary unanimity where there is a conflict between various interests.  They are all united on that and I do not think they are wrong.  It is not just local interests who are united on it. The Irish Ports Authorities Association, who held a special meeting to consider this Bill in early May last, a week or so after it was published, issued a statement in which they said the content of the Bill, especially in regard to functions and membership, was far removed from any recognised concept of commercial port operation, and the danger inherent in the Bill that revenues from commercial port users could be allocated to a diversity of non-commercial activities unrelated to port operations was stressed.  Of course, they are perfectly right.  Anyone who even reads the Bill, let alone knows anything about the background concerned, will see that is so.  One of the main sections of this Bill, section 4, sets out the functions of the corporation and lists them in order.  The normal thing in a Bill of this kind as in a memorandum of association of a company is to list the functions in order of priority or importance as the promoters of the company or corporation see it, and that is the way they are done here.  What do we find? Down at the very bottom of a relatively lengthy list of objectives of this corporation is the following: &ldquo;to provide, maintain, operate and improve such harbour services and facilities as the Corporation considers necessary or desirable in its functional area&rdquo;, the last and least important, in the Minister's eyes, of all the functions.  If one has any doubt about it one has only to read the explanatory memorandum provided by the Department of the Marine where they are also listed.  I quote from that memorandum:</P>
    <P>The Corporation will have a mandate to promote, co-ordinate and develop investment in marine-related industrial, tourist, recreational and amenity facilities and to encourage activities likely to contribute to the realisation of the marine potential of the Shannon Estuary.  It will also take <Col N="673" /> over, manage and operate the existing harbours at Limerick, Foynes and Kilrush.</P>
    <P>The fact that it will also manage the existing harbours is more or less an afterthought. It is a secondary function of this corporation.  It is deplorable that this should be the case.  It is made all the more deplorable in as much as this Bill, if passed, will purport to give these various functions set out at length in section 4 (1) of this corporation.</P>
    <P>They overlap with a whole variety of State agencies &mdash; the IDA, SFADCo, Bord Fáilte and the various local authorities in the estuary region.  The functions given to the corporation are precisely the functions which those bodies have.  There is, as is well known, already a problem in that region of overlapping jurisdiction as between the IDA and Shannon Development, which is certainly not benefiting the region.  There is a problem on the tourism side as between Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development which is the cause of a lot of problems. In order to try to avoid these problems Shannon Development have more or less voluntarily withdrawn from all aspects of tourism other than one, where they can carry on the local management without conflicting with Bord Fáilte's promotion of the region.</P>
    <P>As I explained to the House during the debate a couple of months ago on the Shannon Free Airport Development Bill, we have the extraordinary situation where the IDA have been hunted out of the mid-west region and have produced a map of Ireland for distribution abroad showing two parts of this island blacked out, Northern Ireland and the mid-west region.  Notwithstanding that, the function of this corporation according to section 4 (1) (a) is to promote, co-ordinate and develop in conjunction with the Industrial Development Authority activities in this region.  The whole thing is crazy.</P>
    <P>The sheer craziness of it is underlined by advertisements which appeared some weeks ago in the press announcing that SFADCo were carrying out a survey with <Col N="674" /> a view to producing a report on the development of the estuary from all points of view.  Of course, the marine related aspects of the estuary must by definition be among the most important.</P>
    <P>I understand from SFADCo that they are doing this as agents of the Taoiseach's office, not the Government, not the Minister for the Marine, not the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Tourism and Transport or anyone else.</P>
    <P>The incredible amount of overlap is further accentuated.  The House should seriously ask what this Government are at in relation to the mid-west region. They are all operating independently of each other.  If some major study of this kind is being carried out with a view to promoting the development of the estuary, obviously they should not be promoting legislation which will tie things down in a particular way while the study is going on, particularly as it is hoped that the study will be completed by the end of June.  That is only two months away.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless we have this Bill before us today in an effort to put into legislation a lot of detailed proposals regarding the development of the estuary which may totally conflict with whatever recommendations come from this report, in regard to which people are now making submissions.  What is the point of making submissions if this legislation is to go through? This is what the law will be if the Bill is passed and the recommendations of SFADCo in relation to the development of the estuary, no matter how eminently sensible and suitable they might be, can be forgotten about.  As far as this Minister is concerned this is to be the law.  It is extremely regrettable and it underlines the absolute futility of the constant overlapping of jurisdiction among State bodies which is at its worst in this region.  There are more of them there than anywhere else and this Bill is adding another.</P>
    <P>There is very considerable and legitimate concern about the definition of what is called in the Bill the functional area of this corporation.  It is very different from the definition in each of the two preceding Bills.  I recall that in each of <Col N="675" /> those Bills the definition was from Sarsfield Bridge to the sea to a line drawn from Kerry Head to Loop Head, but it also listed every pier and harbour in between.  For some extraordinary reason this is not done now in section 5.  A long list of places which were included previously are not included here.  The list would include the following piers: Kilbaha, Querrin, Carrigaholt, Knock, Labasheeda and Kildysart on the north bank and Kilteery, Glin, Tarbert and Saleen on the south bank.  Of course, Clarecastle harbour on the north bank was specifically included in the previous Bills and we are entitled to ask why it is excluded now.  There are plenty of people in the region who will say it is excluded because part of it is already leased privately as is one of the other piers I have listed.  This is done by the Minister for his own purposes and he does not want these things included.</P>
    <P>The definition in section 5 which is markedly different from the earlier definition makes no reference to the Fergus estuary or to tidal waters in any of the other tributaries of the Shannon west of Sarsfield Bridge.  One is entitled to ask why.  Are we to have some rival port authority set up in the Fergus estuary in opposition to this one?  If not, why not include it in this Bill?  The Minister grins at this and at so many other things, but we get no answers.  Unfortunately it is not even drafted accurately.  There is reference to Sarsfield Bridge in the county of Limerick as being the boundary of one end.  I happen to have lived in Limerick for 50 years and I know that Sarsfield Bridge is in the city of Limerick.  It has nothing to do with the county of Limerick, nor did it ever have.  In any event, the appropriate line from which to draw the boundary at the eastern end would be the Shannon Bridge at Limerick. There can now be no navigation east of the Shannon Bridge.  I do not know the point of referring to Sarsfield Bridge as being in the county of Limerick.</P>
    <P>Section 5 needs complete redrafting to make it absolutely clear that all the piers concerned and the Fergus estuary, all the <Col N="676" /> tidal parts of the Fergus and any other rivers such as the Moy are included and that the new Authority would have jurisdiction over them if it comes into effect. To do otherwise would be absolutely ridiculous. It is worth bearing in mind that there is a planning application before Limerick County Council at present in respect of a proposed new jetty of a major kind, if it ever takes place, a couple of miles east of Glin.  Will that be included?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of employment exchanges where it is necessary for applicants to queue in the open air, often in rain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are at present some 50 employment exchanges in the country and each office operates a timing system whereby applicants sign at specified times on days of attendance.  The objective of this system is to ensure an even distribution of claimants during opening hours and to eliminate as far as possible the needs for queueing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general where signing times are adhered to, queueing in the open air should not be a problem.  However, the experience at a number of employment exchanges is that on pay out days there is a tendency for applicants to form queues outside the building before official opening time or to attend before their respective signing times.  This action hinders the effective operation of the local office <Col N="677" /> which is dependent on applicants adhering strictly to signing times.  Officials in the local offices do, however, continue to encourage applicants to sign at the designated time in their own interests.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware, from my reply to him in a recent parliamentary question, that good progress has been achieved in the opening of new local offices and the refurbishment of existing offices.  In this field I would like to reiterate my determination to continue with a programme of improvements until all local offices of my Department measure up to the highest possible standards in the services for the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister first clarify the question of the number of employment exchanges?  He said there were 50.  Does this include all the local exchanges?  For instance, there are five in my own constituency, so I find it difficult to understand how there could be only 50 in the entire country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The question refers to employment exchanges.  There are 50 employment exchanges throughout the country.  There are, in addition, 79 branch offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that in many employment exchanges and local branches offices there is considerable hardship being suffered by people signing on?  In some instances there is danger because of passing traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The various exchanges try to arrange for the unemployed to call at specified times and where this happens there is no problem.  I accept that there can be problems especially when people come ahead of their time, which may suit them in particular circumstances but may cause difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very much concerned with improving the local office accommodation. There has been a considerable improvement and there is a sizeable programme in train at the moment.  In the last few years new employment <Col N="678" /> exchanges have been opened, six existing offices have been extended or renovated, five new exchanges will be opened during 1989 and into 1990 and seven existing offices will be improved during 1989.  In addition, nine offices are planned for the future, subject to the financial resources being available.  Therefore, 29 out of the 50 exchanges have been improved or opened and there is a plan for development of a further nine.  We have a budget of £3 million this year for the improvement and development of exchanges plus another £700,000 to the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether full medical examinations are undertaken by medical referees before decisions are arrived at to disallow disability benefit payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Medical referees provide a second opinion to that of the person's own doctor for the guidance of the Department's deciding officers and they carry out such medical examinations as are necessary in each individual case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every effort is made to ensure that the interests of persons referred for medical referee examination are fully safeguarded. Their own certifiers are advised of the forthcoming examinations and invited to submit an appropriate medical report including references to any recent consultant examinations.  In addition, it <Col N="679" /> is open to a certifier to attend a medical referee examination if he or she so wishes.</P>
    <P>In carrying out examinations, the referee reviews the history of the case including the initial diagnosis already made by the person's own medical practitioners, considers any fresh reports received and expresses an opinion based on the results of his medical examination of the claimant.  Where following the examination the claimant is deemed capable of work and appeals against a decision by a deciding officer disallowing payment of disability benefit, the claimant is normally referred for a second examination by a different medical referee. Medical referees are highly qualified professional medical personnel.</P>
    <P>Where the &ldquo;capable&rdquo; finding is confirmed, the case is considered by an appeals officer who examines the case afresh and includes in his considerations any additional submissions received from the appellant or on his or her behalf.</P>
    <P>I think it is clear from the procedures which are followed in these cases that a dissatisfied claimant is given every possible opportunity of putting forward evidence in support of his claim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that in many instances the examination by medical referees is cursory? Would he also respond to the perception that is abroad that these medical referees may be under pressure to reduce the numbers drawing disability benefit?  Will he further deal with the case of those people in receipt of disability benefit with complicated conditions for which they are being attended by consultants, and say whether medical referees who may have only GP qualifications are in a position to dispute the findings of the consultants who are treating the applicants in question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make it clear that there is no question of pressure being applied to medical referees in regard to the decisions they make.  The medical referees are under a medical <Col N="680" /> adviser and a deputy medical adviser. They make their own decisions in their own way.  What the Deputy may be referring to is the fact that because of improvements in the administration of the scheme people are referred on a more regular basis and this may give the impression that there is extra pressure being created. It is the improvement in the system which is bringing people forward at regular intervals.</P>
      <P>As far as the medical referees are concerned, they make their decisions in a professional way.  I would like to point out that medical referees are required to be medical practitioners who are registered in the general register of medical practitioners without holding an appointment. They must have at least six years satisfactory experience for appointment. They must also have the requisite knowledge and ability, including ability to communicate effectively.  These decisions are made at the time of appointment and the appointments are independent. Finally, our panel of medical referees consists of one consultant physician, a doctor with a master's degree in psychology, members who are members of the faculty of occupational medicine, and three medical referees engaged currently in advanced courses.  Most of the medical referees have been senior house registrars and have worked at junior consultant level.  They have the technical qualifications and they make the decisions based on those qualifications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister if there are guidelines for the medical referees as to the definition of fitness for work? Some of the decisions that have emerged appear to be very perverse. What is the position regarding a manual worker who might be able to walk or write but obviously would not be fit for <Col N="681" /> heavy work?  What is the guideline in such a case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice is that the person may be found to be unfit for work for quite some time because of a particular injury but in the longer term the person could be fit for some other kind of work.  The question of long term disability may be raised at that point but it would be after a very considerable length of time.  The Deputy mentioned the question of perceptions and I accept that there are various perceptions about this.  I pointed out in the reply that, on their appointment, the medical referees are required to have the requisite knowledge and ability, including ability to communicate effectively.  I have asked the staff development unit of my Department to make available to our medical referees the in-service training programmes which are available to all other staff in my Department who deal with the public.  In-service courses are also provided by the Civil Service Training Centre and I will ensure that these also are made available to the medical staff as the needs are identified. The point I am making here is that initially this matter is covered at the appointment stage.  There has not been an in-service training programme in operation but I am now making those facilities available to the medical staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he has any plans to change the method of securing information from social welfare recipients with particular reference to interviews conducted by the special investigation unit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Information from social welfare recipients is secured by my Department in a number of ways ranging from the filling of forms to the furnishing of required information to officials, whether at offices of the Department or <Col N="682" /> during the course of investigations outside of those offices.</P>
      <P>Officers in the Special Investigation Unit have, as their main task, the duty of investigating cases of suspected abuse of the unemployment payments schemes. The abuse most often encountered is that of claiming, or being in receipt of, payments while working.  Where there is reason to believe that an offence of this nature has been committed, the person concerned may be interviewed by an officer of the unit.  The person is invariably made aware of the nature of the investigation and in general will also be cautioned that he is not obliged to say anything unless he wishes to do so but that anything he may say may be used in evidence.</P>
      <P>Where, as the result of replies to questions put to him, it becomes apparent that there is, or has been, abuse of any of the social welfare schemes by him, the person is informed of the nature of the evidence held and of any statements or declarations made by him which have a bearing on the case.  Any statement then made by him will be voluntary and, before signing it, he will be afforded an opportunity of reading over it and of making any alterations or amendments as he wishes.</P>
      <P>Social welfare officers' reports and all statements obtained in the course of an investigation are submitted to a deciding officer where any question as to entitlement, or continued entitlement, to payment arises.  If the person concerned is not satisfied with the decision of a deciding officer he has a right of appeal to an appeals officer.  Decisions in these matters are not made by social welfare officers.</P>
      <P>The interviewing procedures have been specifically devised to comply with basic legal requirements and to safeguard the rights of the person involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare, given that out of a total combined workforce of 245 in three firms in the mining industry, 176 workers were claiming and being paid disability benefit while either working or on paid holidays <Col N="683" /> between 1983 and 1987, the reason it took four years for this fraud to be detected; the steps he has taken to ensure that such irregularities do not occur in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1986, and particularly since the present Government took office early in 1987, extra resources have been committed to the control of social welfare fraud and abuse in general and in the disability benefit system in particular. As a result the detection of fraud and abuse and the prevention of unwarranted claiming has increased substantially in 1987 and 1988.</P>
      <P>There is now a very effective control system in operation.  Given the resources now deployed on anti-fraud and abuse measures assisted by enhanced computer systems, I am satisfied that a rigorous system of checks obtains in regard to disability benefit claims.  A system of random checking combined with specifically targeted examinations directed at areas which are perceived to be at risk ensures that a more thorough control is kept on fraud arising from concurrent working and claiming.  I think the improved situation is best exemplified by comparing the number of new claims for disability benefit received in 1981 &mdash; over 290,000 &mdash; with those received last year &mdash; 180,000.  This drop may be attributable to a number of factors but the control and anti-fraud measures have undoubtedly made a significant contribution.</P>
      <P>In relation to the cases mentioned in the question, the Deputy will be aware that PRSI contribution records at an individual level are remitted after the end of each year and so it is only when these come to hand that it is possible to begin the job of comparing the work record of a person in a particular year with their claim record for that year.  Thus, for example, PRSI contributions for the 1983-84 income tax year would only have been available to my Department for this type of specific analysis purpose from January 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that the bulk <Col N="684" /> of the infringements occurred in 1984, 1985 and 1986 and only a few small instances relate to 1983.  Bearing in mind the description I gave of the timing of the arrival of the relevant PRSI data, there was nothing to indicate infringements of any significance until early 1986 when the full PRSI data for the 1984-85 tax year was available to the control staff.</P>
    <P>Some of the infringements were very small.  It was considered, however, that 113 cases should be prosecuted and, in fact, some of these cases are not yet completed, being on adjournment to court sessions coming up next June and July. For this reason I want to be careful not to say anything which might prejudice the outcome of the cases.</P>
    <P>The programme of activities currently on hand is quite obviously yielding successful results and while it is not envisaged making any changes at this point in time, the system is kept under constant review and I will introduce appropriate new or improved measures as the need is perceived.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>While accepting that there was a slight delay in PRSI records being submitted to the Minister's Department, could he say why there was such a long delay in detecting the payment of disability benefit when those records where received?  Given that 71 per cent of the workforce concerned was involved, were the Department not in a position to see something unusual and carry out their own investigation?  Is any legal action contemplated against the eight GPs who were involved in supplying certificates to these people who were working?</P>

      <P>I feel I must alert the House to the fact that the time for priority questions is exhausted.  Perhaps the Minister would give a brief reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of people claiming disability benefit in March 1987 was 82,000 and in 1986 it was approximately 80,000.  It is now down to just over 60,000.  I think the Deputy will realise that a great deal has happened in that timespan in terms of control.  One of the <Col N="685" /> principal matters relating to the question raised by the Deputy is the questionnaires sent to employers.  They disclosed these particular cases.  Having disclosed the cases, it was then a long, time-consuming task to investigate them fully and those investigations have led to a number of prosecutions.</P>
      <P>The Deputy finally mentioned the question of the medical practitioners involved.  It is extremely difficult to prove retrospectively whether a person was or was not sick on a particular day.  It can often be easy enough to prove that the person was drawing a benefit and working on the same day.  On the general question, obviously this matter led to a review of the practice in the particular cases and that review is still going on.  It cannot be completed until the court cases are completed and that is one of the limiting factors.  The procedure could involve a report to the Medical Council.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will outline the outcome of the inspection of tax and welfare fraud conducted by the Joint Revenue-Social Welfare Inspection Unit established in September 1986; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Joint Revenue-Social Welfare Investigation Unit, drawn from the inspectorates of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare, was set up on a pilot basis on 1 September 1986.  The activities of the unit were concentrated in the area covered by the Dublin taxes districts.  It is staffed by one social welfare supervisor, two social welfare officers and two Revenue inspectors. The objective of the unit is to secure maximum compliance with the social welfare-tax legislation.  Although initiated as a pilot scheme such has been the success of the unit that it has now become a permanent feature and is in the process of being expanded nationwide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the beginning, the unit decided on a &ldquo;sector by sector&rdquo; approach.  They selected enterprises from sectors known to have a high incidence of tax and social <Col N="686" /> welfare evasion and fraud.  These enterprises are then subjected to comprehensive investigation of tax-social welfare compliance in respect of both the enterprise itself and of its employees.</P>
    <P>Since the setting up of the unit three sectors have been investigated: tree harvesting in the Forestry sector; the Security industry; and the hotel industry.  As well as these sectors they have also been involved in some &ldquo;one off&rdquo; operations where there were strong grounds for suspecting that fraud and evasion were occurring.</P>
    <P>Up to 31 December last, the unit had completed some 247 inspections of various enterprises.  It recorded an estimated £2,300,000 of unpaid arrears of PAYE or PRSI in the cases investigated and it collected cheques to the value of over £800,000 in respect of those arrears.  The collection of the remainder is being pursued in the normal way by the Collector-General of Taxes.</P>
    <P>Of the approximate 3,000 employees in the firms concerned, some 250 were found to be improperly drawing social welfare payments while working, at an estimated cost of some £13,000 a week. Termination of further benefits and recovery of overpayments were put in hand by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The joint investigation unit has been particularly successful in identifying and tracking abuse in the black economy and arrangements are at an advanced stage to expand the unit by an additional 17 officers and to extend its activities throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that about 8 per cent of the 3,000 employees in the firms inspected were engaged in some kind of fraud, can the Minister tell us if he is going to expand the unit to such an extent that it will be able to carry out a more comprehensive investigation of other sectors of the economy, in particular the motor trade where there is huge scope for the black economy to flourish?  In relation to the figure of £13,000, is this the amount paid out in social welfare?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us if the Department will be pursuing the employers and employees as the case may be to ensure that the sum outstanding will be paid over to the State?  Finally, can the Minister tell me, given that the hotel industry was one of the sectors investigated, why this sector was not included in the new commencement of earnings scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the Deputy's last question first, those sectors considered to be the worst at that time were chosen.  Great difficulties can be experienced in setting up such an operation. Once it is up and seen to be going well the intention is to extend it to other areas. I will bear the Deputy's views in mind.  I should point out that 125 subcontractors were detected, of which only two were registered for PAYE and PRSI purposes. The Deputy will be aware that I was recently given the power in the Social Welfare Act to bring in similar arrangements for subcontractors and these will come into effect as soon as it is administratively possible to do so.</P>
      <P>This unit does not require big numbers of staff but it does require the assistance of Revenue Commissioners' staff.  Since the unit was set up the legislation has been changed somewhat.  It has strengthened the hand of social welfare officers. Up until then they could not gain access to records.  Therefore they will be able to gain a certain amount of the information which could only be obtained through this method previously.  The intention is to extend the unit's activities throughout the country.</P>

However, it is not very easy to get additional staff as, again, the Deputy will be aware, but I have managed to do so.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will outline the latest position regarding the dispute with members of the Irish Dentists' Association; the action he intends to take to ensure that spouses of insured workers <Col N="689" /> receive treatment to which they are entitled and that those who have paid the appropriate PRSI contributions receive all types of treatment for which they are eligible; the action he intends to take against dentists who are refusing to provide treatment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish Dental Association has been in dispute with my Department since October 1987 when I extended the treatment benefits scheme to cover the dependent spouses of insured workers.  Despite the association's opposition to the extension, 190 dentists to date have signed agreements to operate the extended scheme and claims in respect of around 40,000 dependent spouses have been submitted. Over £1.8 million has been paid to dentists in respect of claims from dependent spouses.  Dependent spouses may obtain the names of their nearest participating dentist by contacting their local social welfare office or by telephoning my Department.</P>
      <P>Following discussions with the Irish Dental Association I set up a joint working group to examine all aspects of the social insurance dental benefit scheme to see if improvements could be made within the limits of the existing budget.  I had a further meeting with representatives of the association on 26 July last at which the findings of the working group were presented and discussed.  On 20 December last I again met with the representatives of the Irish Dental Association for detailed discussions on possible improvements arising from the recommendations of the working party. Subsequently, on 10 January this year a letter setting out proposals for improvements was given to the association. Despite this, the Irish Dental Association on 14 January announced their decision to instruct their members to stop providing dentures and root canal treatment to all insured workers other than medical card holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further discussions took place at <Col N="690" /> official level on 24 January.  At this meeting the association's representatives stated that a prerequisite for reaching agreement was the introduction of openended grant-in-aid for all but a few treatment items.  They indicated that, if this was forthcoming, they would be prepared to consider special arrangements for lower income insured workers such as medical card holders.  This was not acceptable to me and I decided to proceed with a set of improvements to the scheme.  These were issued to all dentists on 2 February last.  The Irish Dental Association then extended their instruction to members not to carry out certain treatments under the scheme to cover extractions.</P>
    <P>A small number of complaints have been received by my Department of dentists refusing to carry out such treatments and these are being investigated at present.  Where I am satisfied that the complaints are substantiated, I will have no option but to regard the dentists concerned as being in breach of their agreement with me to provide dental treatment.  I will invoke the sanction, which is provided for under the contract signed by each dentist operating the scheme, by removing from my Department's dental panel dentists who are in breach of their agreements.</P>
    <P>There can be no question of my going back on the decision to extend the dental benefit scheme to dependent spouses.  Furthermore, I am not prepared to consider the introduction of a two-tier system of entitlement to dental benefit on the lines advocated by the association and I have refused to discuss any such changes in the scheme.  However, I am always prepared to consider improvements in the scheme.  The wide range of changes which I introduced earlier this year involved a significant increase in expenditure on the scheme and I am prepared to consider with the association any further improvements in the scheme which may be possible within the financial constraints which exist.</P>

      <P>When did the Minister <Col N="691" /> last meet the dental association to discuss their problems?  Will he agree that whatever differences exist should be sorted out between the dentists and the Minister so that the innocent victims &mdash; the patients &mdash; will not suffer?  May I encourage him in his suggestion that where complaints are substantiated he will have no alternative but to take action against the particular dentists for breach of contract? That would be appropriate because it is appalling that people in need of essential dental care are suffering in this dispute. Will the Minister agree to meet the dentists with a third party, an independent person, to try to iron out some of the difficulties which I understand could happen if a meeting took place?</P>

On 10 January the dental association got a letter setting out proposals for improvements. On 14 January the association announced their decision to instruct members to stop providing dentures and root canal treatment.

      <P>It is significant that the Minister has not linked Question No. 5 with the questions to which he replied. The proposal in Question No. 5 is the framework within which a solution could be found.  Has the Minister closed his mind to the recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare which involved the transfer of the dental and other treatment benefit schemes from his Department to the Department of Health so that we could have a unified dental scheme? The Minister said that 39,000 people had availed of the extension of the scheme. That was in reply to a written parliamentary question yesterday.  What percentage of the total number is involved since the introduction of the scheme a year and a half ago?  Following up a point made by Deputy Harney, I suggested some time ago that the Minister might look at the example in the GMS dispute where John Horgan of the Labour Court was involved as a conciliator. Will the Minister consider that route as a possible way of bringing an end to the problem which is causing so much hardship?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The social insurance treatment benefit scheme, including dental and optical benefits, is specifically designed for people insured under the social insurance system and their dependent spouses.  Entitlement to treatment benefits is subject to the payment of social insurance contributions under the PRSI system administered by my Department and treatments are provided by dentists and opticians under contract to me.  As it is a social insurance scheme, with entitlement determined by PRSI <Col N="693" /> contributions, the most effective way to administer it is under the Department of Social Welfare as at present.  The Department of Health have responsibility for dental and opthalmic services as part of their overall responsibility for health services generally.  A range of treatments is provided under the health services to patients with entitlement to medical cards.  However, there are fundamental differences between these arrangements and the treatment benefit scheme.  I consider that the treatment benefit scheme is a very significant benefit to insured persons and their dependent spouses. The scheme is administered in an efficient and effective way at present and I do not see any advantage to be gained, in present circumstances, in transferring it to the Department of Health.  It is a highly computerised scheme which is extremely efficient and one of the first requirements would be for the Department of Health to get similar computer facilities to deal with it.  In determining whether a person is eligible they would still have to consult the Department of Social Welfare to find out their position in relation to social welfare contributions. Our involvement is principally one of determining a person's eligibility.  When that is determined the contracted dentists supply the service and we have a very close liaison with the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the scheme, 350,000 people would be treated in a year for dental problems and there are about 400,000 people eligible for such treatment.  Probably over 40,000 dependent spouses have been treated out of a total of slightly over 300,000 who are eligible for such treatment.  Of course, they would not necessarily all need their teeth treated at the one time.  Initially the Department's estimate was that we would require 150 dentists to operate the extended scheme but 190 dentists have now signed the new agreements.  Some of those dentists do not want to participate in the extended scheme as they have very big private practices which, presumably, they want to keep.  Our scheme constitutes a very <Col N="694" /> small element in the work of these dentists. The figures can be very confusing as they include many people who do a small amount of work for us.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate what proportion of dentists are in the scheme?  The Minister told the House that 190 dentists are operating the scheme but I should like to know where those dentists are located.  There seems to be a scarcity of them in Dublin North-West. A constituent went to four dentists, was refused treatment and, eventually, had to seek private treatment.  Will the Minister agree that the dental care system is in need of radical overhaul? Will he consider establishing a dental commission to examine how best a service, both private and public, can be provided?</P>

      <P>Several studies have been carried out on this matter.  I should like to tell the Deputy that 56 practices in Dublin are operating the scheme, 35 in Cork, 15 in Donegal and 15 in Louth. Smaller practices around the country are operating the scheme.  There is no dentist in Wexford offering a service and that is something that I will have to attend to in the near future.  I should like to remind Members that for new dentists there is only one scheme, the extended scheme.  I am prepared to listen to what the dentists have to say.</P>

      <P>As I have said on a number of occasions, those requiring treatment should contact their local social welfare officer, employment exchange or the Department directly.  Initially many people did that but we have very few complaints now.  I have read a lot about complaints in the newspapers but I am aware that the system is working very effectively.  Many people are being treated under the scheme which is costing more money than ever before.  The Deputy may be misled into thinking that there is a major difficulty but that is not so.  Obviously, I want the scheme extended throughout the country.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of workers who are paying the reduced rate of PRSI by virtue of being holders of medical cards; if he has satisfied himself that this reduced rate is being availed of by all those who are entitled to it; if he intends to take any action to increase public awareness of the availability of the reduced rate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Medical services cards are <Col N="696" /> issued by the health boards to many categories of persons.  Many holders of these cards are over pensionable age or unemployed and are not, therefore, in insurable employment.</P>
      <P>The PRSI contribution payable by employees includes a 1.25 per cent health contribution and a 1 per cent employment and training levy.  Under the Health Contributions Act, 1979, and the Youth Employment Agency Act, 1981, holders of medical services cards are exempted from paying these two elements of the PRSI contribution.  Where the employee is exempted the contributions are payable by an employer.  In 1986-87, the last complete tax year for which the returns have been fully analysed, 27,500 employees benefited from the exemption.</P>
      <P>Under the PRSI system, an employer is required to apply the appropriate contribution class applicable to each employee.  For each income tax year, my Department issue various PRSI documentation, including PRSI rates leaflets, to all registered employers.  In addition, details of the main contribution classes are published in the newspapers.  All this information includes reference to the fact that employees holding current medical services cards pay a reduced rate of PRSI contribution.</P>
      <P>The operation of all aspects of the PRSI system is monitored.  In this context, the situation of employees who hold medical services cards was stressed in a covering letter which issued with revised PRSI documentation to all registered employers earlier this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On an on-going basis, my department's information section are engaged in pursuing a very active policy to increase public awareness of all aspects of schemes and services.  Officers of the Department regularly participate in seminars and give talks and lectures covering the various aspects of the PRSI contribution system. Recently an information leaflet, entitled &ldquo;Employee's Guide to PRSI&rdquo;, has been produced and will shortly be issuing to persons registering for PAYE-PRSI purposes. This new leaflet makes specific reference to the PRSI situation of <Col N="697" /> employees who hold medical services cards.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that every effort is made by my Department to acquaint both employers and employees of the PRSI liability position of medical card holders. I believe that the new guide aimed specifically at employees will do much to ensure that employees continue to benefit from the exemptions in appropriate circumstances.</P>

      <P>What proportion of those entitled to the reduced rate are availing of it?  The Minister indicated that 27,500 people benefited from the exemption and I should like to know what proportion that is of the number of people who are entitled to the benefit.  Will the Minister consider introducing a more direct way of informing employees of their entitlements, perhaps through a note circulated with tax free allowance certificates, or by way of getting the Department of Health to notify medical card holders in the standard letter they receive?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have done two things in regard to this in recent times.  I have had an information leaflet published for employees.  That leaflet is important for other reasons as well as notifying them of the benefits that are available.  The Department of Health have been asked to consider highlighting the position. They deal directly with medical card holders and they are in a position to notify them.  The simple answer to the Deputy's question in regard to numbers is that we do not know.  About 700,000 medical cards are in circulation and many of them are for the elderly, the sick and the unemployed. For example some 90 per cent of those over 65 years of age are in possession of medical cards.  Through the new information leaflet, and the work of the Department of Health, we should get the message across.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that those with medical cards are adjudged through a means test to be at least on the border as far as income is <Col N="698" /> concerned?  Will the Minister accept that the reduction such people would be entitled to would be significant?  I came across an employee in the public service who was losing £3 per week as a result of not knowing his entitlements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>The figures available up to the end of March 1989 show that up to 3,716 of those who have not availed of invitations to participate in the Jobsearch programme, since its introduction in April 1987, have had their cases reviewed resulting in disallowances under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>In addition some 32,700 have left the live register voluntarily in the context of the programme during the same period. A further 97,000 got places on mainline courses and social employment schemes and some 12,600 got jobs directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the programme is to help those on the live register, especially the long term unemployed, to secure a job or a priority placement in a scheme or course administered by FÁS.  I am <Col N="699" /> satisfied from surveys that the programme has been very beneficial and widely accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we will have to disagree about the purpose of the scheme but the effect of it is what I am concerned about.  Can I ask the Minister how many people in all were either called for interview or asked to come forward in relation to the scheme?  Is it the case that of those who were called about 10 per cent left voluntarily and, if so, can the Minister tell me if these people signed again or stayed outside the social welfare system? If they stayed outside the social welfare system were they working or claiming benefit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the total figure because it was not asked for in the original question.  With regard to the actual number who have been called to date, I know that in the first year the figure was set at approximately 150,000, and it turned out to be around 142,000. The next year added a further 50,000 or so to that figure because some of the others were coming back.  There was nothing for them when they were called up in the first instance and they were seeking priority after that.</P>
      <P>The Deputy made a point about the purpose of the scheme.  I wish people could understand that this scheme for the first time gave priority to those who are on the register of unemployed for the mainline courses, social employment schemes and treatment generally.  That is what is important to me as Minister for Social Welfare.  I am very anxious to ensure that that process continues so that the people who are on the register get options.  We have evidence to show that a large number of the people on the register were not getting the options and were being by-passed all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have now set out a programme to create at least 35,000 new jobs each year for the next five years.  We know that 25,000 people are coming on to the market, for example, school leavers and others looking for jobs, and that <Col N="700" /> there are 240,000 people on the register of unemployed.  It is very important to me as Minister for Social Welfare that the options coming up are offered to the people who are on the register of unemployed. There is a tendency, and there is evidence to show this, to leave them on the register and in that sense it is a very important programme.  The initial stages had a control effect in that there were people there who obviously were not available for work or whatever and they left voluntarily.</P>

The programme includes all the options which are offered. The smallest number of people, 12,600, is going on the Jobsearch course.  After the first year that course was reviewed by FÁS in the light of experience.  We were very anxious to have the course reviewed and there was a number of things suggested which we felt would be helpful to <Col N="701" /> people on that course.  Some of those improvements have been made and the course is being improved on an ongoing basis.  Basically the review is intended to be helpful and the course will be updated as it goes along.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister to indicate whether some very basic things with regard to the appeals system are included in this review, such as, the right of a person to an appeal?  There is no obligation on an appeals officer to inform claimants that they have a right to an appeal.  There is also the problem that a person does not have an automatic right to an oral hearing &mdash; an appeals officer can decide not to give an oral hearing.  Can the Minister also indicate if it is intended to ensure that where a decision is given the reasons for that <Col N="702" /> decision are conveyed to the claimant?  A claimant can get a decision but he may not be given the reason as to why that decision has been made.</P>

      <P>With regard to what is being considered, would the Minister also indicate if the evidence which an appeals officer may have in whatever form, either reports or information, will also be made available to the claimant who is appealing so that he or she can ensure he or she presents his or her boss with the best possible case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I understand it, <Col N="703" /> in appeal cases the evidence is available on request.  That is the basic difference. The evidence is not issued all the time but if it is requested it is made available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that if people go into an oral hearing, assuming they get an oral hearing &mdash; if they do not they have no chance &mdash; they may be told &ldquo;We have reason to believe X&rdquo;, but there is no presentation of the actual evidence to the claimant.  If they do not get an oral hearing they have no chance at all of refuting whatever evidence is being presented against them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to oral hearings there are many cases in which the appeals officer may consider that the case should be decided summarily.  Obviously if it is a case of entitlement, for instance, the number of stamps or whatever, it is a strictly legal matter and there is no point in having an interview to discuss the matter.  Outside of that kind of summary decision it is normal to give an oral hearing, if it is requested.</P>

      <P>Two special reviews of continuing entitlement to payment were carried out in Cumberland Street Exchange between October 1987 and May 1988.  The cases reviewed involved persons who had been in receipt of unemployment assistance for some time and who appeared to have skills which could assist them in finding employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> In the case of the first review, the position of 609 postal claimants was examined. Arising from this examination 132 claims were disallowed.  The second review involved the investigation of the position of 134 claimants; 39 of these reviews resulted in disallowance.</P>

Up to that time they had been scattered all over the place.  For reasons of efficiency and delivery of service they were concentrated in the one place. Many of them had not been reviewed for a long time and that is the principal reason there were a relatively high number of disallowances.  The selection was at random other than the fact that people in particular categories who seemed to have particular skills and had been claiming for a long time were picked out.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will issue guidelines which would elaborate for claimants <Col N="705" /> of unemployment payments, the necessary requirements to be regarded as available for and seeking work under the terms of the social welfare scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a basic statutory condition for the receipt of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit that a claimant must be available for and genuinely seeking but unable to find employment suitable to him or her having regard to his or her age, physique, education, normal occupation, place of residence and family circumstances.  The legislation provides also that the onus is on the individual claimants to prove that they are available for work.  It does not, however, state what form such proof should take.  It is accordingly a question for the deciding officers and appeals officers to decide whether any claimant has shown that he or she fulfils the condition having regard to the available evidence.</P>
      <P>On making a claim for unemployment benefit or assistance, claimants are furnished with an information leaflet which advises them about the scheme, including the statutory conditions which they must satisfy.  In addition, they are asked to compete a questionnaire regarding their efforts to obtain employment.  In completing this questionnaire, claimants are advised that they must not place any unreasonable restrictions on the type, location or hours of work they are seeking. Claimants may also be asked subsequently at any stage of their claim about these matters.  Each case has to be considered on its own merits and it is a matter for the deciding officer to decide the exact evidence required in any case having regard to the individual circumstances of the claimant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that claimants generally are aware that they must be available for and genuinely seeking work.  I accept, however, that it would be helpful to claimants if they could have the maximum possible information about the requirements.  I am glad to be able to tell the Deputy that new comprehensive information booklets on the unemployment assistance and benefit schemes <Col N="706" /> will be available soon.  These will improve the information on these matters available to the public.</P>

      <P>I am glad to learn of the decision to issue information booklets but I am a little worried that it will not touch on the kinds of questions that are raised with us as local representatives when applicants ask exactly what proof is required.  How much traipsing around must they do in an effort to obtain letters in what appears to be a useless exercise &mdash; certainly in some of my towns and villages where virtually no new jobs have come on stream for the last couple of years?  Yet there is an insistence that they produce massive documentation.  The Minister should be more specific as to what is required of people in that situation. I want to raise one other issue.  It occurs to me in relation to applications for unemployment payments that women get a very rough deal.  I am thinking in particular of married women where there appears to be an automatic assumption that they are not available for work.  In my experience it appears that the extent of the proof required from them is far greater than from any other category.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is a question then of interpretation.  That is the reason we have deciding officers.  We can take any set of circumstances and say in one set of circumstances it is reasonable to look for three, four or five letters or to show reasonable frequency.  I have had quite a number of people at my clinics &mdash; and I am sure the Deputy has had the same experience &mdash; where they did not seem to get their message across and it appeared to me that they were available for work.  You would then find from what they said or what they produced could have created the impression that they were not really looking for work or were looking for it fairly generally.  There are <Col N="707" /> the classical cases in Dublin where on a particular road they go to about five places beside each other and that is it.</P>

You will always find &mdash; and I will find as a public representative &mdash; that there are cases which are difficult to understand and perhaps with a little assistance we can help the people to get over that.  So far as the married women are concerned the guidelines to the officers are specific and it is clear that there is to be no discrimination on any kind of grounds, even in relation to child care responsibilities these are to be the same both for male and female claimants.</P>

I have never had one man come to my advice centre saying that he had been asked who is minding the children.  That question has never been asked of them.  What guidance is being given to unemployed people as to how they should prove they are actively seeking and are available for work.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Payment of disability benefit to the person concerned was disallowed from 29 August 1988 following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.  She was notified of the decision and advised that she could appeal, if she so wished, by notifying the Department in writing within 15 days. Unfortunately there is no record of an appeal or of representations from the Deputy having been received in the Department at that time.</P>
      <P>I have had the circumstances of this case reviewed in the light of the more recent correspondence received from the Deputy and I am satisfied that the right to an appeal should be allowed in this case.

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mrs. Barnes</b> asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the change in the number of insurable weeks from 26 to 39 to qualify for social welfare benefits disentitled many casual workers employed in the hotel industry, especially waitresses, in view of the irregularity of their hours; if he has any proposals to allow an annual assessment of their hours which would allow them to qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for insurance based benefits a person must have at least 39 contributions paid and 39 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  The increase in 1987 from 26 to 39 in the number of contributions required was designed to ensure that scarce resources are directed to those in the greatest need and to ensure that for entitlement to full weekly benefits under the social insurance system there is a reasonably lengthy history of recent attachment to the labour force.</P>
      <P>Part-time workers who are employed for fewer than 18 hours per week and who are not mainly dependent on their earnings from employment are insurable at a reduced rate which gives cover for occupational injuries benefits only. Weeks of insurance at the reduced rate do not reckon for the purposes of entitlement to disability or unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>The issue raised by the Deputies is a complex one involving both the position of part-time workers generally <i>vis-à-vis</i> social insurance coverage and the award of credits.  These matters are currently under review in my Department to see how such workers might be provided for within the system while ensuring that entitlements to full weekly benefits are not obtained on the basis of minimal contributions. Any changes in the existing arrangements would require new legislation and would have major implications for all social insurance schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Pensions Board have <Col N="711" /> been specifically asked also to examine the question of pension entitlements of part-time workers.  The board are expected to address this issue in detail in their final report which is expected to be completed by the end of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that there is an urgency in clearing up this anomaly?  In many cases the total number of hours worked in the hotel and tourist related trades is equivalent to or greater than those worked by people who would be clocking up 39 weeks' contributions, but in the case of people working in the hotel industry these hours might be concentrated over a fewer number of weeks.  They would have the hours worked, but would not get the credits because the work was concentrated. Does the Minister accept that it is unjust that they should be penalised and that the system must be changed to take on board the rights which such people should have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy suggests a change in the system which would be fairly complex in relation to its operation. I am particularly concerned about the position of part-time workers and the extension of part-time working within the community.  This is an experience throughout Europe generally which is causing a great deal of difficulty in relation to the whole social insurance area.  For that reason I set about a fairly substantial review of this situation in order to look at the criteria used and the bases on which it should be used. Another criterion relates to earnings, as people may be working fewer hours earning substantial amounts of money and they are excluded from pension and other cover.  As the Deputy will be aware, this is a complex problem.  I have asked the National Pensions Board to examine the matter and they will include their views on it in their report which will be available at the end of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I was commenting on the fact that this Bill, for some extraordinary reason, seems to not include a large number of piers and one small harbour within the Shannon estuary.  I was accused by the Minister, in one of his interruptions, of having changed my mind on the desirability of a single estuarial authority.  I most certainly have not changed my mind.  For the last 20 years I have striven for that.  There were two earlier Bills which certainly had defects and of which I was not enamoured, but I would have preferred either of the two to this one which is very seriously defective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The big row in the past was whether or not Foynes should be included in this estuarial authority.  Foynes is included now but for some incredible reason various other places are not.  I drew the Minister's attention to the fact that there is an application at the moment before Limerick County Council for planning permission for the development of deep water port facilities and associated industrial development and extractive facilities at Caheragh and Killacolla on the Shannon estuary about one and a half miles east of Glin.  I wish that project well.  If the promoter thinks he can make a success of it, by all means, but will that be included?  Will the dues that will be generated by that go to a private operator or to this development corporation?  The <Col N="749" /> obvious thing is that we should have a single estuarial authority and every shipping activity that takes place in the estuary and in its immediate tributaries should come under the jurisdiction of the estuarial authority.  Instead of that we do not have a harbour authority as such, but an industrial development and recreational and tourist authority which has as one of its subsidiary functions, the running of a harbour, and that only in respect of some parts of the estuary.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to ask why these nine or ten piers which I named earlier have been excluded when they were included in the earlier Bills.  Everyone who has compared this Bill with the earlier Bills feels that there is something sinister in this and equally about the exclusion of Clarecastle.  There was a debate in the Seanad in 1986 on the estuary and its development and great things are promised for Clarecastle within a short period but they have not occurred.  What has happened in regard to Clarecastle and to at least one pier called Cahiracon somewhere in the Kildysart area is that it has been leased to a private operator and the latest European Regional Development Fund report of applications for funds from this country shows that an application has been made for £500,000 from the Regional Fund to develop Clarecastle and what are called other small piers. This requires some explanation.  At the very time when we are supposed to have a single authority, which in itself is a cause of controversy, are a whole lot of places in that estuary to be excluded including the proposed development near Glin and whatever is supposed to happen at Clarecastle?</P>
    <P>Clarecastle, I understand, has not operated as a port for nearly 20 years but it has been established under an Act, the Clarecastle Harbour Trustees Act of, I think, 1933.  The previous Bills brought in here proposed to repeal that Act, which, of course, makes sense.  This Bill does not propose to repeal it and I wonder why.  I understand that an application was made to the High Court within the past couple of years to appoint new trustees of that port and that that application was acceded to by the High Court. This would seem to suggest that it is the <Col N="750" /> intention to retain it as a port independently of this corporation.  We are entitled to ask why.</P>
    <P>It seems that the manner in which it is sought to placate interests in Foynes is pretty hamfisted, to say the least.  From what one hears, the reference in section 8 (3) (d) to two officials in Foynes was not in the Bill as drafted by the draftsman or prepared by the Department but was put in at the last minute as a result of a local political decision in order to try to placate opposition that might be expected and similarly with section 6 in regard to the principal office of the corporation, which was inserted in that way. It makes no sense that any Bill should contain a provision making it mandatory on a body to establish their head office in any particular place.  It is a matter for the body concerned, if and when established, to decide where their principal office should be.</P>
    <P>The staff of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, who are competent and dedicated people in my experience over the past 20 to 25 years, certainly feel extremely sore, to say the least, about the provisions of this Bill and I do not blame them in any way.  They are quite entitled to feel very aggrieved about it. They are senior and highly qualified people who are now going to be made subsidiary to people much less qualified than they in the formation of this corporation. There is not the slightest acknowledgment of their achievements over the past quarter of a century, in particular.  Indeed, the thought struck me when the Taoiseach was making much of his meeting in Shannon a few weeks ago with Mr. Gorbachev, that Mr. Gorbachev would not be there, nor would there be a Russian plane landing in Shannon on any occcasion, were it not for the actions of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners in building a jetty for Russian fuel at Shannon and doing it entirely out of their own resources and providing storage there for that purpose.  What they have done has been hugely to the benefit of the whole area, but they get very little thanks for it.</P>
    <P>On the position of the staff of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, in particular, they are very concerned indeed <Col N="751" /> about the provisions of sections 15 and 16.  At the moment the ordinary staff of the harbour commissioners are entitled to pensions which are unfunded, unfortunately, because the Department concerned never allowed a funded pension scheme to be established for Limerick harbour.  They are not too worried about its being unfunded because Limerick Harbour Commissioners are in a very strong financial position and have a very substantial income; they are very much in the black.  They are now going into a corporation which will have to take over other bodies if this Bill is passed, one of which has very substantial liabilities.  To have to do that from an unfunded pension position is extremely unfair to those people.  A man of, let us say, 60 years of age who has worked for perhaps 40 years with the commissioners and given excellent service should not now be faced with the possibility that, if he retires within the next couple of years, his pension may not be paid, or that it may not be paid in full.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which this Bill does not deal with at all is the whole question of pilotage.  The Pilotage Acts, I notice, are not referred to in the list of Acts at the start of this Bill.  At the moment, pilotage is a function of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  They carry out that function for all the authorities within the estuary, including Foynes, Cappagh and Clarecastle.  Presumably, by implication, pilotage will now become a function of the new corporation and the pilots involved are certainly very concerned about what their position will be.  Needless to say, there has been no consultation whatever with them and they do not know where they stand in this regard.  They feel that a great many attempts may be made to let many of them go and that they have no continuity of employment.</P>
    <P>There are numerous other matters of detail in this Bill which I, among many other people, find extremely objectionable. I shall deal with those matters on Committee Stage &mdash; if there is a Committee Stage which, presumably, now there may well be.  This Bill is ill-conceived. It has, remarkably, obtained almost universal opposition from all the interests concerned and I cannot stress <Col N="752" /> that strongly enough, particularly as several of the interests concerned see themselves as being in conflict with others involved.  They are all unanimous that this Bill is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I find it extremely regrettable that at a time when at long last I had hoped that we would see legislation passed into law to unify this estuary and its control, we find it is not a unified port authority at all.  It is an industrial development, a tourist development, an amenity and recreational development corporation with subsidiary powers of managing the harbour. That is not satisfactory.  In addition, it is not the entire authority as we had all expected.  It includes Foynes, but excludes a great many other places.  Quite frankly, I do not see the point of an arrangement like that.</P>
    <P>I cannot blame the people of Limerick, Clare and elsewhere if they think there is something sinister, in this.  The evidence would seem to suggest, in the absence of some truthful and plausible explanation, that there is something sinister and that it is being done for a sinister and improper reason related to some private interest. Otherwise, why should this whole area be excluded?  It is, therefore, a great disappointment that the third of these Bills is actually the least satisfactory by far of all three that we have seen in this House. The other two Bills were not passed and, if there were reasons for not passing the other two, certainly the reasons are infinitely more compelling for not passing this Bill which is extremely detrimental and disappointing.</P>

      <P>It reinforces my belief that this Bill, in the ridiculous form in which it is, is the result, not of any intelligent thinking by anybody but of all sorts of local, parochial, political compromises to try to facilitate particular people.  I understand that in order to get some of it in they had to wait until the celebrated Minister for Defence, who had taken himself somewhere outside the jurisdiction, came back and he discovered various bits and pieces had been put into it without his knowledge.  The dealings and strokes that went on behind the scenes were pretty sickening and deplorable.</P>
      <P>Everybody could see clearly why there was such widespread and fundamental opposition to this.  Not even the efforts to buy off people in Foynes, for example, have succeeded.  Even the two officials mentioned in this legislation, and given pride of place in it, easily see through what the Minister is up to and they are not one bit impressed to find themselves mentioned in this legislation by name, being given a special and privileged position on the corporation.  They know it is only for improper reasons that that is being done at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very strongly opposed to this Bill which is such a huge disappointment.  My party will be voting against it.  I hope all <Col N="754" /> Opposition Parties will vote against it and reject it.  In that way they will be doing a great service to that region and the country as a whole.  The port users and port authorities of all other ports are equally vehemently opposed to this.  The Minister has announced that if and when this Bill is passed, similar provisions will be applied to all other port areas &mdash; Dublin, Cork and Waterford in particular. If so, that will be an absolute disaster.  It is totally unsuitable, particularly when we need to develop our ports as efficiently and economically as possible to meet the challenges of 1992.  It is deplorable that the management of ports should be given a subsidiary in this Bill and that port users will be called on to fund all kinds of non-commercial activities in which this Bill will give the corporation power to engage.</P>
    <P>I hope very fervently that this Bill will be defeated or if not defeated on Second Stage, amended drastically to ensure we at least have a Bill that makes sense, that covers the entire estuary and concentrates on the management of ports rather than on creating yet another bureaucratic overlap which is in direct conflict with the action of the Taoiseach's Department in the last month or two in looking for a report from Shannon Development on the development of this estuary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am greateful to get an opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I admire the Minister's tenacity in bringing it in. He has shown an interest in the development of the Shannon estuary and has campaigned a long time for it.</P>
      <P>However, the nature of the Bill is giving rise to a great deal of controversy. I believe there is an element of expediency in the Bill itself.  It reminds me of another Bill that was before the House some time ago, Coillte Teoranta Bill, and before that the Bord Telecom Éireann Bill.  The draftsmen seem to have a stereotype Bill which they conveniently draw out when they have to bring in legislation quickly.  I regret very much the terms in which this Bill is drawn up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What upsets a number of people is that the Bill would promote substantial overlapping of development agencies at <Col N="755" /> a time when some of us are at least not too happy with even the development agency who are there.  To overlap in this regard is going to complicate matters further. There must be unification of all these people who are promoting industries and services and trying to create employment.  The competition, or lack of it, and the spreading of resources that will be involved even if this Bill is passed will mean less money will be available to promote the mid-west region.  We are all trying to see that employment is increased in the Shannon estuary and the Shannon estuary basin.</P>
    <P>The Shannon estuary is an extensive area.  Other speakers have mentioned that it is a natural resource &mdash; the deep water, the beauty, the marine culture potential.  All these assets and aspects have been paraded and there is reason to believe they will be availed of in future. It is an achievement for the Minister to get Clare, Limerick and Kerry agreeing on anything.  No more ethnic, parochial group exists than we find in those counties and, as Deputy O'Malley pointed out very vehemently, in Limerick city.  In places of work in Shannon in particular where different counties are represented, you find them going in different directions. The Minister in getting the groups together and banging their heads, so to speak, has made a real achievement.</P>
    <P>I agree with the number of members proposed by the Minister for the board of directors.  Any higher would be too big.  If you speak to people from those localities you will find they each want a big slice for their own area.  Clare County Council feel they are under-represented, or unrepresented sometimes.  Limerick Deputies here today spoke about non-representation of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, Limerick Corporation and Limerick County Council in the Bill. Even in the previous Bills the big problem was representation.  The public must be cynical of this exercise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of talking about political power and the misuse of that power. I would like to see coming from this <Col N="756" /> House constructive legislation that will lead to real development on the lower estuary up to Limerick.  A problem is that we cannot utilise the very deep water there.  Substantial, continual dredging must be done at the mouth of the river. For that reason I have always supported some authority who would have the power to raise the funds necessary to provide a continuous service to the waterway of the River Shannon.</P>
      <P>In this Bill certain powers are being taken.  I consider a port authority preferable to a development corporation.  In current circumstances with the possibility of getting Structural Funds from the EC, maybe a development corporation would be the better proposition, and this lays greater emphasis on the promotion of the activities listed in section 4.  The Bill provides that the functions of the corporation shall be:</P>
      <P>(a) to promote, co-ordinate and develop, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte Éireann, the Industrial Development Authority, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited, and the appropriate local authority, investment in marine-related industrial, tourist, recreational and amenity facilities ....</P>
      <P>That work is already being done by other groups within the counties and semi-State organisations such as Shannon Development. The main emphasis should be on providing maintaining and improving harbour services.  That should be the sole purpose of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to recognise the experience of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, who say that the functions specified for this new corporation are too wide.  I have had substantial correspondence from the Irish Ports Authorities Association and various other groups who all make this point.  One harbour which is to be included is that at Foynes where they already have a development programme which was published following their employment of the consulting engineers, Delap and Waller.  The harbour commissioners want drainage and dredging, removal of a jetty, road services, cargo handling facilities, warehousing, fire fighting equipment, a weighbridge, land <Col N="757" /> reclamation and additional berthage. That is a long list of items which would keep any corporation fully engaged. When we take the other ports into consideration, it is obvious that the corporation would be fully employed in the various development programmes which have already been drawn up in preparation for the implementation of the legislation.  At Foynes they were looking for £5.5 million for these small developments. At Cappagh in Kilrush they also need a programme costing in the region of £5.5 million.  The Kerry people want Ardmore Point developed.  Many of them were disappointed that Toyota decided to bail out for the UK and abandon the land on which they had an option at Ardmore Point.  I do not believe it was lack of development of the estuary which prevented their establishment but a proper infrastructure would have made it more attractive for Toyota to locate there.</P>
    <P>With a unified port authority in place the Government would be able to upgrade the roads on both sides of the river.  The road from Ennis to Kilrush along the river badly needs to be upgraded.  Some years ago when the Department of the Environment were giving substantial funds for road development I proposed that the road from Ennis to Kildysart and onwards should become the main Ennis to Kilrush road.  People thought it was a farcical proposal then but things have changes since with the establishment of Moneypoint and the possibility of other developments along the river.  At Cahercon we have a Mr. Whelan who is very busy repairing ships and providing a service which we have not had before on our side of the river. We need road development on the Clare side.  Deputy Deenihan also pointed out that it is necessary to upgrade the Limerick to Ballylongford road and make it a national primary route.</P>
    <P>There are a lot of inhibitions to substantial development but a unified port authority would be in a position to provide the means which would promote the potential of the existing facilities even as they stand.  They would also produce a new development programme.  I do not understand why other people are being brought into the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="758" /> There is quite a lot of marine-related activity on the northern bank.  The West Clare Co-operative in conjunction with SFADCo are engaging in marine culture. They have joint ventures in progress at Carrigaholt, where the Minister opened a facility some time ago.  There is substantial potential in the marine-related area and the people in the Carrigaholt-Kilbaha area are taking advantage of it. I congratulate them on the work they have done in expanding their fleet and taking advantage of some species like hake and other fish which had not been landed in Clare for some time.  We have a certain sense of initiative in County Clare.  At one time we had a meeting with the co-op people which did not end in the friendliest way since they sought to take over the entire northern bank of the River Shannon.  Since they started to look out to sea they have made substantial progress and they will go from strength to strength.  The marina development at Kilrush, so ably championed by the Minister, is welcome.</P>
    <P>Why do we need this entire corporation? Why can we not have a unified port authority with the people in place taking the necessary steps to exploit the amenities there already?  At Moneypoint there is a substantial berth which is underutilised. The ESB had a proposal to discharge coal there and send it all over the country, making it cheaper for industrial users even if domestic users would not take advantage of it.  I regret that the Dublin lobby and the Cork lobby became active in the promotion of the Moneypoint jetty.  People will look back and see an opportunity missed.  It would have brought down costs for the domestic and the industrial user and provided competition for the Dublin people.  Competition is supposed to be the spice of life, the way to make progress.  I do not understand why people want development to take place only in the Pale, in the greener than green parts of Ireland in Dublin and along the east coast.</P>
    <P>The ESB are a Dublin-based body and I suppose we are in luck that the chairman is a Kerryman.  They had a reasonable proposal which, if it was not going to be good for Dublin, would be good for the west; and they objected.  Now the whole <Col N="759" /> thing has stalled.  I hope in the future the ESB will seek joint ventures with other people and get involved in trans-shipment so that this major jetty can be fully utilised.</P>
    <P>I am with the Minister when he says he wants to see the corporation up and going.  If they just gave priority to the deep water ports, I would be happy with that.  I do not want to see any of the other frills.  It must be the people in his Department who are telling the Minister that all these other antics are necessary because we are all reminded on a daily basis in county Clare that we should have an understanding of what is needed for the Shannon estuary.  In that regard I would ask the Minister to consider what has been said by the speakers who are concerned about overlapping and to take out section 4 (a).  Perhaps (b), (c) and (d) could stay there, but I certainly cannot support this other idea about Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development.</P>
    <P>The Limerick Harbour Commissioners have done a good job over the years. They themselves were very parochial in some of the things they did.  While they gave Clare County Council an opportunity to take part in their meetings when they existed as Limerick Harbour Commissioners they never appointed a Clare county councillor as a member of the harbour commissioners, and I regret that very much; they were insular in their attitude to Clare people.  It would have been better if they had been more open.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Limerick Harbour Commissioners were set up in 1815, so they have been in existence for a long time and many work practices have grown up which stifled the port and port users.  They got to grips with their difficulties and I believe this is the reason Foynes started to flourish.  Nevertheless the commissioners have to be commended for the substantial work they have done.  They promoted the Shannon estuary.  I have here a copy of the handout which the Limerick Harbour Commissioners use when advertising abroad. The outside of the brochure refers to <Col N="760" /> Ireland's super port, Limerick and the Shannon estuary.  It gives a full description of the existing facilities, the Moneypoint jetty, Aughinish, Foynes, Limerick city docks etc.  It is a good commercial document, well put together, and is worthy of support.  The map beside it shows the major site locations and the deep water channel.  Limerick Harbour Commissioners have, as a promotion agency, promoted the Shannon estuary abroad.  It is well known among shipping interests that we have substantial services and berthing facilities available.  The services include port terminal operators, shipping agents, towage and the facilities of other companies like Shannon Free Airport Development Company and Shannon International Airport which other Deputies mentioned.</P>
      <P>I regret therefore that the Minister has not given a special place to the harbour commissioners in this Bill.  I would forfeit a lot of support in order to see them included because I believe this corporation will not succeed without enormous goodwill on the part of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners for the operation of this proposal.</P>
      <P>When the harbour commissioners made representations to the various Deputies whose constituencies border on the estuary they expressed substantial fears.  While it might be premature for the Minister to negotiate in advance regarding any of the things they expressed fears about, private assurances could have been given to the staff of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners who were in grave doubt about their future. The same could be said about the Foynes Harbour Commissioners who said at the time that no one in the Department of the Marine had spoken to them and that they felt very bleak about facing the future.  Many of them had given enormous service to the Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  Limerick Harbour Commissioners have made a substantial contribution and will continue to do so.  I appeal to the Minister to give them a role in this development corporation he is proposing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irrespective of the tribal difficulties that exist in Clare, Limerick and Kerry, my anxiety is to see something in place <Col N="761" /> to ensure that the waterways are utilised to their maximum potential, to see that if oil refineries are on the way we will get an oil refinery etc.  I know a lot of land was purchased there some time ago for an oil refinery.  While there has not been a find of any substance in the Porcupine Basin I believe it is west of the Shannon that a substantial oil find will be made. There were indications by visiting geologists that there are substantial deposits of oil off the Porcupine Basin and for that reason the Shannon estuary is well placed.  I hope there will be unity between all the sections.  If competition does take place I would not like to see a situation where Galway would win out and the Shannon estuary would be ignored.  We have a substantial facility to manage.  I wish the Minister every success.  I regret that there seems to be an element of dealing.  That, as far as I can see, is most important to the Government press secretary, Mr. P.J. Mara, who loves to talk about deals.  Maybe there was a deal by the Government in this case.  I am sure such a deal was made.  Otherwise the Minister could not have got agreement on this matter.  Other Ministers tried it and failed but at least this Minister has had that much success.</P>
    <P>The question of the principal office is a real bone of contention.  While the Minister conceded all the power to Foynes harbour he should not have agreed to locate the office there.  Why should they get everything?  That will be a distinct advantage to the people in that area.  If people in Cappa, Kilbaha or Carrigaholt want access to the head office they will have to make the long journey by road to Foynes.</P>

      <P>That would be all right in daylight but they could not do so at night. The Minister should reconsider the location of the principal office.  Section 6 states: &ldquo;The Corporation shall maintain its principal office at Foynes in the County of Limerick&rdquo;.  That section should be deleted.  The Minister should be a good Clareman and locate the office at Shannon Airport where it should be. <Col N="762" /> There was a ferry in operation to Aughinish when the industrial development was taking place there and that was an easy method of transport.  Shannon Airport would provide an immediate facility and Shannon Free Airport Development Company are also situated there.  There are many reasons for industrial promotion at Shannon Airport.  I wish to refer to Clarecastle harbour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the little village in which I reside has been mentioned so often in Dáil Éireann.  It is a great help to me in that I will be able to call to my parishioners and tell them we were mentioned all day in the Dáil for one good reason or other.  This was a great day for Clarecastle because every speaker who contributed asked why Clarecastle was left out.  I am the harbour commissioner and I did not ask the Minister to leave out Clarecastle but neither did I ask him to include it.  It is acceptable to me whether the Minister includes Clarecastle or not.</P>
      <P>Substantial development has taken place at Clarecastle.  An entrepreneur of great vision and courage, Mr. Whelan, has invested heavily in the area.  He was the first Clareman to provide an oceangoing tug on the River Shannon.  I admire his tenacity &mdash; I do not know whether he admires mine or not &mdash; and the way he has proceeded with the development of ports on the Shannon.  He created a lot of employment for Clare people on our side of the river.  In Clarecastle there is a small port that was utilised substantially by traders for a long number of years but it then fell into disuse because the river silted up and there were other impediments to shipping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the drawing up of the national plan the commissioners made a submission &mdash; I think at the encouragement of the Minister &mdash; in which they sought £500,000 for the further development of the Fergus estuary.  I believe that would be money well spent.  In the long term substantial savings would be made to the Exchequer if Clarecastle port was fully utilised.  For instance, quite heavy loads could be <Col N="763" /> taken off the west Clare roads and the goods could be shipped directly from Clarecastle down along the estuary to any of the major developments along the River Shannon.  With the Moneypoint development there was the sad experience of the roads being wrecked by heavy loads.  By using the national primary route to Clarecastle from whatever quarries exist in the area, heavy stone could be transported quite easily down the Fergus estuary. The proposal that was submitted to Brussels was badly needed and I hope it will be successful.</P>

      <P>Like my collegaue, Deputy Carey, I too have quite a lot of reservations about this matter, especially in view of the fact that this port has been taken as a model for other ports.  Perhaps the mistake the Minister made was in starting at the most difficult one.  If he had considered a more straightforward port such as the port of Cork he would not have had as many problems with awkward Deputies like Deputy Carey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concept of a port authority is absolutely right.  My main concern is the constitution of the board.  Maybe the Minister was advised on this matter and if there are reasons for his decision I would like to hear them.  I am of the opinion more and more as I get older that the fewer appointments the Minister makes the better, for a number of reasons.  For instance, the Government could consider some very experienced people when a vacancy becomes available &mdash; people who would probably be interpreted even by the general public as being the best possible people for the job.  I am not saying we would appoint <Col N="764" /> political hacks.  Invariably &mdash; and this has been the pattern &mdash; these people settle down to do a good job but regrettably what happens, as happened very recently in the Sugar Company, is that when the time comes for reappointment these very good people are kicked out and the Minister appoints somebody of his choice. That has been the pattern and we are all to blame for it.  I would like to see us getting out of that rut once and for all.</P>
    <P>If a sugar company, a harbour or a port authority is to succeed, people who are prepared to take courageous, unpopular decisions are needed.  Whether they offend one Minister or another is immaterial. In the long term we need to appoint people who will be there for a determined term of office and who, depending on their merits, would be reappointed.  A different system of reappointment would have to be introduced at that stage.  What a harbour ports authority needs more than anything else is continuity as the results of any decisions made will not be seen for a long time.  As I said, a person is entitled to supervise decisions made and see them bear results. What has happened in the past is that no sooner has a person been appointed but he has been kicked off with the result that there is no continuity.  People waver about wondering what the Minister may think about a certain matter but this should not be a consideration.  Decisions should be taken based purely on commercial consideration.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this legislation relating to Shannon is to promote business and to develop the harbour.  With respect, these areas are fairly well looked after.  In the first place we have SFADCo, whom I have worked with and who are doing excellent work, and, secondly, we have the IDA who are doing a good job in that region.  Since taking an interest in this legislation I have begun to wonder whether the Minister is now setting up a third tier of bureaucracy to do the work that is already being done reasonably well by both the IDA and SFADCo.  For instance, and this is a delicate question, what effect will the legislation have?  Will it lead to confrontation and will there be local jealousies on the part of SFADCo, the IDA and now the new Authority? <Col N="765" /> Surely there is already a super abundance of corporations and bodies in the Shannon region.</P>
    <P>Does this proposal meet with local approval?  We have heard Deputy Carey and others say that it does not.  Is this another IDA for Limerick with separate funding?  When we take a closer look we will see that no funding is provided.  If we are to talk about a Harbours Bill we must in fairness consider all harbours. We should not consider one harbour in isolation and draw up a set of rules for that harbour.  We should take a look at the entire scene &mdash; Dublin, Cork, Galway, Rosslare, Waterford and even Youghal.  In this miniscule harbour recently we witnessed the most extraordinary decision in respect of a pier that was falling down.  When we were in Government in 1975 a deputation came to Dublin to meet Deputy Peter Barry when we had to do something about it but what happened recently is that the Fianna Fáil controlled urban district council decided to lease the pier to someone for their exclusive use for a 35 year period.  He overhauled it.  This does not amount to good harbour development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>It fell into the sea while the Minister's party were in power but in our time we had to put it right.  Now it is being given over to private enterprise. That certainly is not the way to do business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need a common harbours policy, not sloppy legislation relating to one port. A pre-requisite for the development of marine and leisure facilities is a clean and unpolluted harbour.  We talk about the need to erect treatment plants but the Water Pollution Bill which will come before the House shortly will only deal with pollution caused by farmers.  That <Col N="766" /> Bill should tackle the pollution being caused by urban and city municipal authorities who are the highest pollutors. Who in their sane senses would put these people in charge?  I certainly would not but it is one job I would like to give to the Shannon Harbour Authority as it is they who would be best suited to looking after this problem.  However, they are not being given that power.</P>
    <P>I note from the Bill that the Minister proposes to give the new body the authority to take an interest in mariculture and fish farming.  I would have my doubts about this, not that there would be anything wrong with it but I would rather see them concentrate on their main job, the getting of ships in and out quickly, both efficiently and cheaply.  We have seen what has happened in Scotland and in Norway and it is now clear that a pre-requisite for marine development, already taking place around our coasts, is clean water.  We do have safe and sheltered harbours but if the waters are not right fish will not survive, be they shellfish, salmon or trout.</P>
    <P>During the years we have built up a respectable level of commerce.  Our harbours are very busy.  The shipment of meat, butter and milk powder is now a daily event.  We can further expand our harbour business by promoting industry on the water front, given that most of what we process will be exported.  We do not need an extra body or structure to do this.  The harbour commissioners are more than capable of regulating harbour business.  The IDA promote and develop our industry.  If we have to have another type of harbour commissioner, so be it, but let him for goodness sake concentrate on what is to my mind the primary job of a port authority, controlling traffic and making sure that very expensive ships move quickly and safely in and out of our harbours.</P>
    <P>We have a small open economy heavily dependent on overseas trade.  Opportunities do exist and indeed we should not forget, as Deputy Carey pointed out, about our offshore developments as these will provide us with harbour business. These offshore service stations require specialised harbour development and harbour servicing.  After the Channel <Col N="767" /> Tunnel is open we will be the only truly island nation in the EC, hence our first priority must be the appointment of a top class commercial team to keep shipping moving, to provide weather information along with up to the minute information on docking availability.  Time in this case means big money.  We must have competitive harbour charges.  How many times has it been said that the most expensive piece of water in the world is the strip between ourselves and the UK and Europe?  Dredging operations must take account of bigger and bigger ships.</P>
    <P>As we have heard, the people in the Limerick region are not happy.  As an island nation we are totally dependent on sea transport both for our imports and exports.  Ports are the focal point of international trade.  It is vital that our ports be managed and equipped efficiently.  The importance of efficient ports to the economy will be of greater significance as time goes on.  If this Bill is the prototype for other ports it will be disastrous.  How in heaven's name will the complicated business of harbour shipping be operated by a loosely knit board?  It should be all about proper port management, yet this new body will dabble in mariculture, tourism and recreation which are already taken care of under diverse headings. Inefficiency adds up to higher port charges and less competitive ports.  Giving a wide range of duties to management means dissipated and diminished levels of service.  If this Bill is to be a model let it be a good one.  We need a broadly based board with a fair representation of local authorities with a single mandate to run the ports efficiently.  Navigational facilities and manned weather stations are also needed.  I recently raised that issue in the House as we are falling into the same trap as Britain fell into ten years ago, of going for automated weather stations. We do not seem to realise that a manned weather station is the traffic lights of a port and only men &mdash; not machines &mdash; can tell when a fog is approaching, causing delay to shipping. Conversely they also know when the fog will lift and when it is safe to let the ships in.  We should not go down the same road as Britain in this regard.  One of our vital <Col N="768" /> ports in Cork is getting rid of the weather station and putting in a machine.  The same applies to other areas.</P>
    <P>Special facilities will be needed to deal with the bigger vessels now operating. We cannot allow a disaster of the magnitude of Bantry Bay to happen again but it will if we do not have the proper facilities.  Pollution control in our harbours is becoming increasingly important but this Bill as a pattern for our major ports does not meet our requirements. Opposition to the Bill has been voiced by all authorities in harbour areas.  A good port is our industrial lifeline as we export three quarters of what we produce, almost £11 billion worth and we import goods to the value of £9 billion.  As a nation on the periphery of Europe we must have cost effective links with the market place.  This waterway to the UK and Europe is the most expensive in the world and we do not realise how vital our ports are until we are faced with disputes such as the 1988 strike by the British National Union of Seamen when many firms were completely cut off.  One or two of my acquaintances nearly went to the wall.  Port efficiency requires all the structures to be in place to ensure efficient handling of shipping.</P>
    <P>Leave mariculture to the fish farmers and the Department of the Marine.  This is a highly specialised area where a large volume of expertise is needed and is readily available.  Fish farming in our estuaries is moving at a slow but disciplined pace.  We have encountered many problems in this highly specialised area and the farmers concerned work very closely with their colleagues in the UK and Norway and the Department of the Marine.  We would be very unwise to dabble in this area or to transfer this responsibility to somebody else.  When we discuss other marine matters the same rules should apply.  Shellfish farming is a very expensive venture involving virtual ownership of stretches of the estuary.  It is best left to the people involved under the control of the Department of the Marine.  However, especially in the case of the Shannon Estuary, pollution control to ensure the survival of marine life is vital and this should certainly be under the control of the new Authority.  With <Col N="769" /> the increased number of port industries and the increased levels of municipal effluent it is vitally important that the new Authority should be in a position to continuously monitor the problem and bring polluters before the courts.</P>
    <P>I see no problem in the new Authority working towards more harbour related industries because such industries are the principal harbour users but it makes good sense to work with a properly constituted harbour authority.  There is merit in this Authority working closely with harbour industries and if we had such an authority in Cork harbour more could be done to get shipyards like Verolme Dockyard once more repairing ships.</P>
    <P>Investment in port industry is the key to greater economy and efficiency and it will be a vital factor in our survival after 1992.  This country is very keen on boards and it is useful to have them to blame when things go wrong.  We need national investment to ensure that we have more and more trade which will generate more prosperity.  That, in turn, will bring more investment in harbour industry and infrastructure. Look at the North with whom we are now in competition for harbour business.  They are heavily funded by the UK Government and by the European Regional Fund of which we do not seem to be aware.  This enables them to offer much lower port charges than ours.  The Central Statistics Office stated that in 1988, 25 per cent of our exports and imports came through the North and this means more job losses and less business for us.  We need positive action on a national scale to recover that business. With the change in transport, mostly to container traffic, roll-on roll-off with a quick turnaround, any harbour authority must be on its toes and allowed to concentrate its attention without any other distraction.  The main business of any port authority is to move goods quickly, cheaply, efficiently and safely.  Ports should be handled by the commercial sector, outside the Civil Service environment, and we are now in a position to avail of the European Regional Development Fund.</P>
    <P>We have voiced our concern about this Bill in the context of a national ports policy.  The Minister stated his intention <Col N="770" /> to model future legislation on this Bill. The object of the Bill is to promote activities other than the main one, the statutory duty of any harbour authority to provide an efficient, cost effective service to seagoing trade.  This new body should be concerned with the full, effective use of the harbour in making a success of our export drive, no more and no less.  After this you are left with duplication.  Do not make this Bill a model for anything as different ports will require different solutions. We need laws to allow our harbours to compete commercially and all the &ldquo;mod cons&rdquo; facilities for trade activities supported by a port authority, tourism, mariculture etc., must not be allowed to take from the main business, a cost effective service to the nation.</P>
    <P>All legislation must be co-ordinated and my main opposition to the Bill is that the board which the Minister is thinking about is not the one to do the job.  I do not even agree with my colleague, Deputy Carey.  We need a team of commercial people appointed by their chambers of commerce and who would not be shifted by successive Ministers.  They would be appointed on the basis of their talent and proven ability.  They would have a vested interest in the port.  Why not?  They are the people who would ensure that schemes would work.  We should appoint people who would ensure that that very expensive strip of water is developed to its full potential.  There is a lot of talk about 1992 but my concern is what will happen after that year.  I would like to think that this little country of ours, the only island nation in Europe, will be able to compete in a difficult market place and will continue to attract industries.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ivan Yates gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the circumstances surrounding the finding of the <Col N="771" /> bodies of two psychiatric patients of a hospital in County Carlow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.  Some of the issues I wish to raise are, perhaps, more appropriate to Question Time, but I hope the Minister will be forthcoming in his reply.  On Tuesday week in the river Barrow, which is near St. Dympna's psychiatric hospital in Carlow, Anthony Burke was found drowned.</P>
      <P>Mr. Burke, who was 28 years of age, came from Rowanville, County Kildare, and I understand he had been missing from the hospital since late March.  Last Friday the body of Mr. Christopher Coleman (32), who was a patient in St. Dympna's was found in the river Barrow.  Mr. Coleman, who was from Ballymurphy in County Carlow, had been missing from St. Dympna's since 5.30 p.m. the previous Thursday.  I understand that the body was found only a few hundred yards from the hospital.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he will agree to hold an inquiry into this matter.  I do not wish to cast any aspersions on the staff or the standard of care at St. Dympna's hospital.  It is a fine hospital and I have no quibble about it. I should like to know whether those patients were voluntary patients or in-patients. I am not understating the case when I say that it is highly unsatisfactory to have the bodies of patients found in these circumstances.</P>
      <P>On my travels to different psychiatric hospitals throughout the country, and from studying reports from two health board areas, including the South-Eastern Health Board, I have learned that there has been an increase in the rate of suicides here.  Will the Minister say if he is aware of this trend?  I note that the coroner for County Kildare, Doctor B. O'Donnell, in the course of his report stated that in his 17 years of preparing such reports he has noted an increase in suicide rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of national issues arise in relation to psychiatric care.  Last November I raised in the House the circumstances surrounding the death of a patient of St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane. <Col N="772" /> The body of that patient was found on Sunday, 6 November, in a ploughed field adjoining the hospital.  I am not singling out the hospitals I have mentioned for criticism but they are symptomatic of a wider experience.  I was surprised to read the written reply on 15 November from the Minister on this matter.  I resent the contents of it.  In the course of that reply the Minister said:</P>
    <P>In this hospital the archaic, destructive custodial model of care has been replaced by one in which patients are afforded the greatest possible degree of independence.  If the arrangements the Deputy refers to mean the return to locked wards and high walls, then I can assure him we will not revert to this.</P>
    <P>That was to misrepresent the argument and the point I raised.  The concept of planning for the future and changing the whole notion of psychiatric care out of institutions is something I support strongly.  However, I am concerned about the level of supervision and community nursing for voluntary patients. They should be watched in their own interests.  If they are nervous or depressed special care should be given to them by the community nursing pesonnel but not in a custodial or oppressive way.  We should investigate the procedures to see if they need to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look at the national statistics in regard to this subject.  In an article in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> of 17 March it was stated that the number of in-patients in psychiatric hospitals dropped by 3,000 over the last five years &mdash; that was according to figures given by the Minister for Health.  On 31 December 1983 there were almost 12,000 patients in health board psychiatric hospitals and units and the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, has stated that at the end of 1988 the number stood at 8,600, a reduction of 3,400.  Those patients are no longer in psychiatric units as in-patients. However, when we look at the alternative care that has been put in place we see 204 hostels were provided with 1,300 places and that day hostels and day centres had 1,300 attenders.  There is a big <Col N="773" /> gap between those figures.  If we discharge 3,400 patients and provide day places and hostel facilities for about half that number, what has happened to the remainder?  I am wondering if those patients have been discharged into the community without adequate community care facilities for them.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the patients I mentioned.  Were there adequate hostel arrangements in the area for them?  Will the Minister ensure that an inquiry is carried out so that the full facts are brought to light?  A statement was issued by St. Ita's in regard to the Portrane patient to the effect that that patient was a &ldquo;liberty&rdquo; patient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Acting Resident Medical Superintendent of St. Dympna's Hospital notified my Department in a letter dated 19 April that the body of a patient at that <Col N="774" /> hospital, one of the patients referred to by Deputy Yates, was recovered from the Barrow River on 18 April.  The patient, who had been admitted on a voluntary basis was found to be missing from his ward at 8.30 p.m. on 27 March. In accordance with normal procedure, the grounds of the hospital and the local area were searched.  The family of the patient were notified and the Garda were given a description of the missing person. Some days later a Garda sub-aqua team searched the river and found the body.</P>
      <P>In the second case the acting Resident Medical Superintendent notified my Department in a letter dated 21 April that the body of the second patient referred to by Deputy Yates, who had also been admitted on a voluntary basis, was found in the Barrow River that day.  The patient had absconded from the hospital on 20 April.  Again the normal procedure with regard to missing patients was followed. As a result of a report that a person similar to that of the description of the patient was seen near the river, a search of the river was carried out by the local sub-aqua club.  In neither case, according to the hospital authorities, have the families expressed dissatisfaction about the efforts made by the hospital on their relatives' part.</P>
      <P>In accordance with normal procedure, these cases have been referred to the Inspector of Mental Hospitals of my Department who will undertake whatever investigations he feels are required under the circumstances.  I may say that the evidence from the preliminary investigation which has been made is that the very highest standards of supervisory care is provided and continues to be provided at St. Dympna's Hospital in Carlow.  The inspector or his assistant have inspected each of the public psychiatric hospitals and units in the country, apart altogether from this investigation, and from their reports I am satisfied that the standard of supervisory care for all patients, including voluntary patients and the community nursing arrangements, are generally satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with the questions raised by the Deputy.  With regard to the carrying out of an inquiry, as I have said, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals has <Col N="775" /> already made his inquiry and I hope to have a report from him in the near future. I have the preliminary report and it does not appear that there is anything we need be concerned about.  As regards the increase in the number of suicides, certainly an increased number of suicides are being reported but whether that is a real increase or increased reporting of suicides is something one would have to look at.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the man who died at St. Ita's Hospital in Portrane and the Parliamentary Question which was answered.  I saw the answer to the Parliamentary Question and was very satisfied with it because I think it is very important that all of us in this House would agree that we should not go back to the custodial service which was provided for years.  Maybe it was appropriate in its day but it is very important that we accept the open care method which is being provided at present.  Unfortunately the only way we can ensure the patients will not abscond from psychiatric hospitals and end up tragically as these patients did is the high wall.  It is very important that all of us in this House would commit ourselves to ensuring that we do not go in that direction again.  In fact the patient who died in Portrane went out for a walk in the grounds, which I think we would all recommend, but unfortunately he suffered a coronary thrombosis when he was out.  Again I do not think we could hold the hospital or the authorities in any way accountable for this incident.  It could have happened <Col N="776" /> to him in the building just the same as it happened to him outside.</P>
    <P>With regard to the final question raised by Deputy Yates, it is true that the number of in-patients in our psychiatric hospitals has been reducing over the years, and will continue to reduce mainly because of the number of elderly patients.  The number of patients who are admitted to psychiatric hospitals nowadays and maintained for their lifetime is minimal.  Many of these patients are elderly and some of them pass away in the hospitals.  With regard to the 3,400 patients Deputy Yates referred to as having been discharged out into the community, I do not think it would be correct to say that they were discharged out into the community.  Many of these patients would have been elderly and would have passed away while in hospital.  More of the elderly patients would have been transferred to more appropriate accommodation in residential homes for the elderly and many of them would have been mentally handicapped and would have been transferred to more appropriate accommodation for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>As regards these cases the Inspector of Mental Hospitals investigates each case and I should like to assure Deputy Yates that we monitor the situation very carefully to ensure so far as possible that we avoid this type of incident, and any measures necessary to ensure this will be taken.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 2 May 1989.</P>

      <P>The social insurance treatment benefits scheme, including dental and optical benefit, is a scheme specifically for people who are insured under the social insurance system and their dependent spouses.  Entitlement to treatment benefits is subject to the payment of social insurance contributions under the PRSI system administered by my Department and treatments are provided by dentists and opticians under contract to me.  As the scheme is a social insurance scheme with entitlement determined by PRSI contributions I consider that the most effective way to administer it is under the Department of Social Welfare as at present.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health have responsibility for dental and opthalmic services as part of their overall responsibility for health services generally.  A range of treatments is provided under the health services to persons with entitlement to medical cards.  However, there are fundamental differences between these arrangements and the treatment benefits scheme.  I consider that the treatment benefits scheme is of very significant benefit to insured persons and their dependent spouses.  The scheme is administered in an efficient and effective way at present and I do not see any advantage to be gained in present circumstances in transferring the scheme to the Department of Health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>People who came into full rate social insurance cover in April 1974 when the social insurance income limit was abolished were covered for old age (contributory) pension from that date.  When they reached pensionable age and provided they had no previous insurance, their contributions average for pension purposes was calculated from 1974.  On the other hand, people who came back into full insurance in 1974 having been previously insured had their contributions average calculated from their original date of entry and because of gaps in their insurance prior to 1974 many of these failed to meet the average test requirements for old age (contributory) pension.  The arrangements which I made last year were designed to provide <i>pro-rata</i> pensions for the people concerned who had averages of less than 20 contributions and to remedy their position <i>vis-à-vis</i> that of other people who came into full insurance in 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These arrangements were intended for this specific group of people whose position was anomalous in that they were compulsorily insured for pension from 1974 but were precluded from qualifying for pension through having contributed <Col N="714" /> previously.  To extend similar arrangements to other categories of persons whose contributions' average is below the present minimum of 20 contributions would have considerable financial implications.</P>
    <P>Persons whose contributions average is low because of a mixture of full and modified insurance are one such category. These would be mainly public servants who were promoted into a permanent and pensionable grade insurable at a modified rate, having been previously fully insured, or people who enter such a grade from fully insurable employment in the private sector.  These people would, however, in due course qualify for an occupational pension based on their pensionable service.</P>
    <P>Mixed insurance of this kind is an ongoing feature of the social insurance system and can result in a person not having sufficient insurance at the full rate to qualify for pension.  The abolition of the income limit in 1974 has no particular significance as far as this issue is concerned and to make special arrangements for one particular group of people with mixed insurance without addressing the broader question of mixed insurance generally would merely create other anomalies and would not be justified.</P>
    <P>The contribution conditions generally for pensions, including the average condition, and the question of mixed insurances in particular, are among the issues which will be specifically addressed by the National Pensions Board in their forthcoming report on pensions generally. I propose to examine possible solutions to these issues in the context of the board's report.</P>
    <P>There are no firm data available as to the numbers of persons who did not re-enter insurable employment at the full rate in 1974, including those with mixed insurance between 1953 and 1974, and who would qualify for <i>pro-rata</i> pension if the average requirement were altered. The number involved, however, is likely to be substantial.</P>

      <P>Following their detailed examination of the major payment systems in my Department the consultants, Craig Gardner, submitted three reports containing a large number of recommendations. The first report was an overview of the Department's payment systems as a whole and the other two reports dealt in detail with the disability benefits and unemployment payments systems.</P>
      <P>The consultants reported on organisational and procedural weaknesses, on the inadequacy of certain control procedures and on the difficulties which reliance on outside agencies can cause. In a separate study the consultants assisted my Department in developing statistical sampling methods to estimate the level of social welfare abuse.  The results of a survey of disability benefit and unemployment payments abuse in the Dublin area are contained in a booklet which contains a summary of the reports and this was circulated to members of the House last year.</P>
      <P>Since I took up office, I have placed a very high priority on the curtailment of abuse of the social welfare payments system and major strides have been made in that area.  I intend to continue to monitor the situation and to take whatever measures are necessary to curb fraud and abuse in social welfare and to ensure that resources are directed to genuine claimants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of the consultants' operational recommendations in relation to the disability benefits payments system have been put into place.  In relation to the very extensive report on unemployment <Col N="716" /> payments, the consultants while finding that the way in which the Department were adapting to meet the security issues, by their emphasis on information technology and their plans to localise the delivery and control of their services was satisfactory, called for a fundamental organisational change particularly in the local office structure.  This will take time to accomplish.  To facilitate these improvements this Government undertook major investment in new technology for employment exchanges in 1987.</P>
    <P>Following a detailed examination of the recommendations on the local office structure comprehensive proposals were drawn up on the lines recommended by the consultants.  My Department are having discussions with the Department of Finance about these proposals.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, individual recommendations which are not dependent on the major policy issues are examined and implemented by the various branches within my Department as part of my ongoing reviews of security and fraud prevention controls.  Some of the major recommendations which have already been implemented include the following &mdash; first, agreement in principle has been reached with the Revenue Commissioners that this Department will take control of the issuing of RSI numbers. Second, greater exchange of information between the Department and the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate joint operations in relation to tax and social welfare matters was provided for under the Social Welfare Act, 1988.  Third, legislation which requires employers to notify the Department of the commencement of employment of new employees was introduced last year, together with increased penalties for those, including employers, caught abusing the social welfare system.  I have made provision in this years Social Welfare Act to enable me to extend the notification procedures to sub-contractors.  Fourth, procedures have been introduced to improve controls in the payments operations in local offices by for example, providing better segregation of duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">

      <P>Under the legislation governing the supplementary welfare allowance schemes persons in full time employment are not entitled, except in certain exceptional circumstances, to receive assistance under the scheme, including assistance with rent or mortgage costs. Persons receiving rent or mortgage supplements are generally persons in receipt of a basic social welfare payment.  They are required in all cases to meet the first £3.10 of rent or mortgage interest payments and in determining the amount of supplement to be paid, the practice is to leave the client with a disposable income, <Col N="718" /> after rent, equivalent to the basic supplementary welfare allowance rate for his family size, less £3.10.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence that present levels of social welfare payments, including where appropriate, supplements in respect of rent or mortgage interest, are so high by comparison with earnings as to constitute a significant disincentive to taking up employment.  The measures taken in this year's budget to increase tax exemption limits, will be of significant additional benefit to low earning families and will improve work incentives.  The family income supplement provides a further incentive to employment and I will shortly be announcing improvements in that scheme to come into operation in July.</P>

      <P>The person concerned reapplied for unemployment assistance on 17 October 1988.  A social welfare officer was asked to investigate his means at this point but, pending the outcome, unemployment assistance was paid at the weekly rate of £82.20 on the basis of his qualification certificate from an earlier claim which assessed him with means of £6.27 per week derived from capital.</P>
      <P>Following investigation of his means, a deciding officer assessed him with weekly means of £71.20 from 23 November 1988, derived from income from self-employment as a sign-writer and from capital. The person concerned appealed against the amount of means assessed against him on 25 November 1988.  An appeals officer upheld the deciding officer's decision on 10 February 1989.</P>

    <P>He applied for a review of his means on 20 March 1989 and his case is currently with the social welfare officer for reinvestigation of his circumstances.  On completion of the social welfare officer's report, his case will be reviewed by a deciding officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the Defence Forces <Col N="720" /> are divided into two categories for social insurance purposes: (a) commissioned Army officers and permanent members of the Army Nursing Service and (b) non-commissioned Army officers and enlisted members of the Defence Forces.  Commissioned Army officers are insured at the PRSI Class C rate of contribution and are covered for widow's and orphan's (contributory) pensions and deserted wife's benefit.  Non-commissioned officers and enlisted members of the Defence Forces are insured at the PRSI Class H rate of contribution and are covered for all social insurance benefits with the exception of occupational injuries benefits.  However, only certain benefits are payable during service and disability benefit is not payable during absence from work due to illness.</P>
      <P>The differing social insurance cover for members of the Defence Forces reflects the various career structures of Army personnel.  Commissioned officers, for instance, generally remain in the Army for most of their working lives and are, accordingly, insured on a similar basis as other permanent and pensionable public servants.  Non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel, on the other hand, are recruited for fixed periods and many will eventually leave to take up ordinary employment.  The social insurance cover which is provided for such personnel, reflects the pattern of their employment and ensures that they are fully protected under the social welfare system in the event of leaving the Army.</P>
      <P>Members of the Defence Forces are entitled to full pay during periods of illness and injury whether occurring on or off duty and disability benefit is therefore not payable during service.  To compensate for this non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel do not pay the full rate of PRSI contribution which applies to workers generally, the Class H contribution being at a reduced rate which reflects their restricted entitlements under the social insurance system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social insurance position of all public servants, including members of the <Col N="721" /> Defence Forces, is currently being examined in the light of the decision in principle by the Government to extend full PRSI cover to all public sector workers on an agreed basis with effect from April 1990.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Applicants for social assistance payments who have capital invested or savings are assessed with a notional income from it.  A widow may currently have capital of £51,160 and still qualify for the minimum rate of widow's non-contributory pension.  A single person applying for old age non-contributory pension may have capital of £26,907.50 and still qualify for the minimum payment.</P>
      <P>The difference in the amount which claimants under these schemes may have arises from the different formulae used to assess the value of capital in each scheme. The formula which applies under the old age pension scheme applies to men and women applicants alike.  As far as the formula which applies in widow's pension scheme is concerned a similar formula will apply to widowers and deserted husbands under the new scheme of allowances for these categories which will come into operation in October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In principle I would agree that a uniform approach to the assessment of means of all applicants for social assistance is desirable.  However, the introduction of a single uniform means test would require amending legislation and <Col N="722" /> given that some 25 per cent or 40,000 recipients of old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, and social assistance allowance payments are assessed with means, it would also have major cost implications.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to cost the effect of increasing the maximum means limits. Means may be derived from a variety of sources and my Department do not have detailed information on the proportion of the means assessed against existing pensioners which is derived from capital or savings.  Any increase in means limits would also extend entitlement to additional numbers of people who do not qualify for any pension at present.</P>

      <P>The Jobsearch Programme has been a major success since its introduction in April 1987 as a new service giving priority and assistance to the unemployed, especially the long-term unemployed.  Up to the end of March 1989 over 212,000 unemployed persons have been interviewed under the programme. Of these over 12,600 have been placed in employment and close to 97,000 have been placed in Manpower schemes, mainline training courses or on Jobsearch courses.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any recent protest by participants as a whole at the Jobsearch Course centre at St. John Vianney School, Bonnybrook, County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did receive representations from a small group to which I replied towards the end of last year about the use of Irish <Col N="723" /> material for the course at this centre.  I am also aware of a picket mounted outside the centre in early February last by persons whom, I understand, were not course participants.  While individuals at the centre may have expressed reservations on occasions about the content of the course, a significant majority of those who have furnished observations on the course from among some 600 who have completed Jobsearch courses there, have indicated that they were well satisfied with them.</P>
    <P>The content of these courses has been specially designed by persons with professional competence in this area and its relevance and usefulness is kept under review.  I am satisfied it contributes significantly to improving the jobseeking skills of those who avail themselves of the opportunities it presents.  So far over 25,000 people have completed over 1,800 courses at 280 locations throughout the country.  Two separate studies in the early stages of the programme established that around three quarters of those who completed these courses had derived value from them and indications from a balanced cross section of urban and rural centres since then continues to support these early positive results.</P>
    <P>Since the Deputy submitted his question, a very small group of men (6) carrying placards briefly picketed outside the private residence where I hold my clinic in Bonnybrook in protest against the Jobsearch programme in general.  As I came out one of the group took photographs while I was talking to other members carrying placards.  I found this anxiety to take personal photographs unusual in the circumstances.  It was also unusual that the group did not seek to meet me at the clinic to discuss their views especially as I had met delegations about other matters on the same morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the provision made in the Social Welfare Act, 1988 for the introduction of a pre-retirement allowance which will remove the requirement for certain older unemployment assistance applicants to prove unemployment at their local employment exchange or signing centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pre-retirement allowance is designed for people who have reached a certain age and who have been in receipt of unemployment assistance at the long-term rate.  Many of these people regard themselves as semi-retired and no longer part of the labour force.  At present, they are required to attend each week at their local office where they sign on and receive their unemployment payment in cash or, if they live more than six miles away, attend at a signing centre to have their declarations of unemployment certified by the Garda.  This latter group receive their payment at their local post office. The new scheme will relieve the elderly unemployed of the need for weekly signing. In addition, all participants will <Col N="725" /> receive payment at their local post office which will have obvious attractions for those who at present have to travel every week to the local employment exchange to collect their payment.</P>
    <P>I recently introduced a number of modifications to the pre-retirement allowance in the Social Welfare Act, 1989.  As a result the allowance will be payable where, for example, a recipient is ill, and a recipient will not need to be available for and genuinely seeking work.</P>
    <P>The date of implementation of the pre-retirement allowance is to be prescribed by regulations which will be made as soon as the necessary administrative arrangements are in place.  Although I am not in a position at present to say when that is likely to be, I can assure the Deputy that I am very anxious to bring the scheme into operation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The method of payment proposed for pre-retirement allowance participants is by means of a book of payable orders encashable at a designated post office.  I would like to mention that my Department is committed to making the widest choice of payment-methods as possible available to social welfare clients generally. The main focus at present is on improving the system of payment to the unemployed.  Computerisation of the employment exchanges, which is being extended as quickly as possible, is opening up new possibilities on this front.  I plan, for instance, to introduce a pilot system of payment to the unemployed by means of post drafts later this year.  Later on I hope to see other systems such as electronic funds transfer being used to make these and other social welfare payments.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the plans, if any, he has to co-ordinate the provision of social welfare payments in order to harmonise the value and level of benefit for adults and their dependent children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Government took <Col N="726" /> office we have achieved considerable success in the harmonisation of social welfare payments.  At the same time significant increases in payment have been given which more than maintained the level of all social welfare payments and which provided special increases for those on the lowest levels.  For example, taking account of the increases which will come into effect next July, payments to the long term unemployed will have increased by over 24 per cent (18 per cent in real terms) since 1987.</P>
      <P>As far as co-ordinating different rates of payment is concerned a number of major initiatives have been taken.  Last year, for example, the number of child dependant allowance rates was streamlined and reduced from 36 to 20 rates. This work is being continued this year by the reduction from July to only 12 rates and the introduction of a minimum child dependant rate of £10 per week, which is equivalent to a 25 per cent increase in some rates.  Another move towards streamlining in the area of payments for children is the extension of the payment of child dependant allowances to all long-term recipients for children up to the age of 19 who are in full-time education.  This is a first step towards extending them to the age of 21.</P>
      <P>Another major initiative which I have taken in this area is to abolish from next July the urban/rural differential in unemployment assistance payments.  This means that a single person who was previously on the long-term rural rate of assistance will receive an increase of £6.30 per week or 15.5 per cent.  A couple with four children will receive an increase of over 11 per cent.  A couple with six children on the short-term rural rate of assistance or receiving supplementary welfare allowance will receive an increase of almost 13 per cent.  From July the same rates of payment will apply to all men, women and dependent children for the first time in all parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant progress on streamlining the adult dependant allowances has also been made, for example, the number of adult rates of unemployment payments <Col N="727" /> will be reduced from five to two, a long-term and a short-term rate, from July. The adult dependent rates paid with invalidity pension are also being streamlined.</P>
    <P>I have also introduced a new assistance scheme for widowers and deserted husbands with children, from next October. This is a significant harmonisation as this new scheme for men will be very much along the lines of schemes currently in operation for women.</P>
    <P>Significant progress on harmonising the rates of payment has therefore been made.  The achievements to date show the Government's continuing concern to improve the position of those dependent on social welfare and fulfil the commitments given in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  It is the Government's intention to build on the considerable successes achieved in the social welfare area in recent years by continuing the ongoing review of the social welfare system and bringing forward proposals for its reform and development.</P>

      <P>Representations from the Deputy on behalf of the person concerned, together with a fresh application, were received in my Department on 16 November 1988. This application was investigated by a social welfare officer and it was established that the applicant has substantial cash assets.  Despite a number of requests by the social welfare officer, however, the applicant has failed, to date, to provide a full and satisfactory explanation of his total means.</P>
      <P>The social welfare officer referred the application to a deciding officer on 20 April, 1989 with a recommendation not to award the pension on the basis that means were not fully disclosed.</P>
      <P>The deciding officer, by a decision dated 21 April 1989 refused the pension application on the basis that the applicant had failed to prove that his means did not exceed the statutory limit.  The person has been notified of this decision.</P>
      <P>He has the right to appeal against this decision.  It will be necessary for him, however, to set out fully the grounds for his appeal giving a satisfactory explanation as to his means to enable his entitlement to pension to be established.</P>

      <P>During the 1988 calendar year, the latest date for which figures are readily available, 351 prosecutions under the Social Welfare Acts were finalised in Court.  Convictions resulted in 273 of these cases.  The Deputy will, no doubt, understand that as a result of the normal delay inherent in Court proceedings some of these cases finally dealt with by the Courts in 1988 would have been first presented in 1987 or possibly earlier. Some 120 cases have been sent for prosecution to the Chief State Solictor's <Col N="731" /> office so far in 1989.  However, no details are available of the number of these that have been presented in court or of the outcome.</P>
      <P>The prosecutions arise from the extensive control measures exercised by my Department as a result of which breaches of the legislation are detected.

      <P>The existing nationwide arrangements in relation to the issue of signing cards for persons claiming unemployment payments, have been in place for many years.  Each person claiming an unemployment payment is issued with a cardboard signing card.  The main functions of this card are: To enable the hatch officer in the local office to identify and retrieve the correct claim when the claimant attends to sign; To remind the claimant when and where he or she must sign; and to act as a deterrent against personation. Experience over the years has shown that the existing cards are of an inconvenient size and because of their composition, wear out quickly, and have to be replaced on a regular basis.  In addition the information on the card is capable of being altered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of these factors, a move to a more modern plastic covered card was considered.  A new card was introduced on a pilot basis in July 1987 in Thomas Street and Townsend Street Employment Exchanges, and issued to approximately 10,000 persons.  It contains information similar to that on the cardboard card.  In <Col N="732" /> addition, the card has a durable laminated plastic cover, is of a convenient size similar to a bank card, and the information contained on it is tamper proof.</P>
    <P>The initial reaction from those who were issued with the new card has been very favourable.  The results of the pilot study are however, still being examined.</P>

      <P>He was subsequently referred for examination by a medical referee of the Department on a number of occasions in the normal course of his disability benefit claim.

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance on 27 November 1987.  His means, derived from the value of the board and lodging in his parents' home and a small amount of capital were assessed at £28.25 per week. The amount of means assessed against him was confirmed on appeal.  He applied for a review of his means on 15 December 1988 and his means, derived on this occasion solely from the value of board and lodging in his parents' home, were assessed at £30.10 per week with effect from 11 January 1989.  He is currently in receipt of weekly payments of £10.60 being the maximum amount appropriate in his case of £40.70 less means of £30.10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 146 (1) (e) of the Social Welfare Act 1981 as amended by Section 13 of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act 1985 provides that the means of an applicant for unemployment assistance must take <Col N="734" /> account of the yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by him.  Free board and lodgings while residing in the home of one's parents or of a relative are considered to be a benefit for this purpose and its value must be assessed as means.</P>
    <P>The purpose of assessing the value of board and lodgings is to achieve a degree of equity between applicants living in relatively better off circumstances as compared with those who are not so well off.  The criteria used to assess the value of board and lodging to an applicant in these circumstances are designed to ensure that each case is decided fairly having regard to the standard of living of the household.  No assessments are made where the parents' sole income is derived from social welfare payments.</P>

      <P>My Department has been associated with a major research project on poverty and the social welfare system in Ireland, carried out by the ESRI.  The project involved a large-scale national household survey on poverty, income distribution, the usage of State services and in particular the effectiveness and efficiency of the social welfare system. The initial results of the study were published by the Combat Poverty Agency in September 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The survey indicated that a small percentage of potential claimaints appeared to be receiving from the social welfare system less than their entitlements.  The question of why people appear to be living on incomes of less than their apparent entitlements is one of a number of issues which are currently being further investigated, as part of a second phase of the ESRI study.  The fieldwork for this second phase is currently under way, and <Col N="735" /> the final report should be ready before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I am also very conscious of the need to ensure that social welfare payments are made to claimants as speedily as possible. There has been a steady improvement in this regard in recent years.  The average time taken to process practically all categories of claims has fallen.  This progress can be attributed to a number of important steps which have been taken to provide a more efficient and co-ordinated service to people who are dependent on social welfare or health board payments. These have included the setting up of the Social Welfare Services office, which is an executive office of the Department, responsible for the delivery of services.</P>
    <P>The development of computerisation and improved procedures for processing claims have also brought about major improvements in the delivery of services. I am committed to ensuring that the service provided to social welfare recipients is continually improved and I will continue to keep procedures under review and to make any further improvements which are possible in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous statement that insurance policies are issued on the basis of exporters estimated turnover was made in the context of offering one possible general explanation for why there can be a difference between the insured value of exports generally and official trade statistics which are not compiled on the basis of insurance data.  This remains valid.  For example, in the case of comprehensive shipments policies, which are in place for about 90 per cent of exporters availing of the scheme, insurance is based on turnover estimates.</P>
      <P>On the other hand the statement that insurance is only provided on the basis of irrevocable letters of credit which are drawn up for payment purposes was made in reply to a specific question about meat exports to Iraq for which the required terms of payment is on the basis of irrevocable letter of credit.  Even where the latter requirement applies however payment will only arise where forecast shipments are realised.  In other words a policy may be agreed for an estimated level of business even where ILCs are present but actual cover will arise only in respect of actual shipments and payments due thereunder.</P>

      <P>It would be inappropriate to specify the percentage of the total export credit insurance cover available for beef exports to Iraq in 1987 and 1988 which is held by individual companies.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce, arising out of his replies to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 56, 57, 58 and 59 of 20 April 1989, whether it confers an unfair advantage on an exporter to be given what amounts to an exclusive right to the available export credit insurance market for beef exports to Iraq on the basis of that exporter's estimated turnover for a particular year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the general operation of export credit insurance, the matter of giving exclusive rights to cover or unfair advantages to any applicant or applicants does not arise.  In fact a practicable approach to underwriting business is as far as possible adopted consistent with the desire to maximise export achievement which is the objective of the scheme.  As already indicated in regard to beef exports to Iraq within the ceiling of cover available for the market, the first two companies to apply in 1987 had at the time of their applications firm contracts for the supply of beef to Iraq.  At the same time, the total amount of insurance cover sought by these companies &mdash; when added to existing exposure on the market and allowing for a reasonable level of residual cover for industrial exports &mdash; reached the overall limit set for the market.  Accordingly it was possible to facilitate only the first two applicant companies with export credit insurance in respect of their firm contracts.</P>
      <P>This is still considered to have been the correct approach in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the overall limit which was set for the export credit insurance market in respect of (a) all exports and (b) beef exports to Iraq in 1987 and 1988; whether the cover available within these limits was fully taken <Col N="744" /> up in each year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Insurance Acts, 1909 to 1981, the maximum liability which the Minister could assume in 1987 in respect of all exports at any one time was £300 million.  Under the Insurance (Export Guarantees) Act, 1988 this was increased to £500 million.</P>
      <P>Beef exports to Iraq in 1987 and 1988 were subject to no specific limits but were subject to the overall limit imposed in respect of all exports to that market consistent with normal insurance prudence and practice.  The overall limits are not annual limits but reflect the maximum liability which can be assumed in the market at any one time.</P>
      <P>As regards all exports, the overall ceiling of £300 million was not reached in 1987 but as it seemed likely to be reached during 1988, the Insurance (Export Guarantees) Act of 1988 increasing the ceiling to £500 million was enacted.  The new ceiling was not reached during 1988.</P>

In relation to the placement of graduates from teacher training colleges following the change in the arrangements governing the staffing of national schools, it was agreed that vacancies as temporary replacements for teachers leaving on career breaks would not have to be filled from the redeployment panels, thus enabling new graduates to apply for these posts.  Some 450 national teachers availed of career breaks this year and the total number of teachers absent on career breaks now stands at 1,233.  Newly qualified teachers may also <Col N="748" /> be employed as substitutes for teachers absent on sick leave, maternity leave, etc. and some 800 substitutes are employed in national schools on any school day.  In addition, measures have been taken to reduce substantially the intake of students into the colleges of education.</P>
