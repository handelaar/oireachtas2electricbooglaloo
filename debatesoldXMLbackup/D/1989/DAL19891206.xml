It is also proposed that the Dáil shall sit later than 9 p.m. today and business shall be interrupted at 10.30 p.m. It is further proposed that No. 1 shall be taken without debate.

      <P>This item relates to the appointment of Members to the five committees that have been constituted, four of which The Workers' Party have been excluded from.  Notice in regard to the convening of the Committee of Selection was not delivered to The Workers' Party until after that committee had sat.  That is not a satisfactory way to deal with the business of the House.  We do not think we have been properly dealt with in regard to this matter.  We object to item No. 1 being taken without debate and we propose to register our protest when the question is put.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="346" /> Question, &ldquo;That item No. 1 be taken without debate&rdquo;, put and declared carried.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach if at some stage in the next few days he will make available time to discuss the present position of Irish Steel because there appears to be a contradiction between what the Minister for Industry and Commerce said in the House yesterday in reply to parliamentary questions and a report in one of this morning's newspapers to the effect that the German company involved are in the process of dismantling part of the financial arrangements.</P>

I should like to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>

      <P>On the Adjournment I should like to raise the inhuman and intolerable conditions that the people of Swords have to endure when queueing to sign on on Tuesday.  The conditions are not only inhuman but a danger to their health.  It is wrong that they should have to queue in this smog.</P>

I should like to ask the Taoiseach if, when that legislation is introduced, it will be able to deal retrospectively with the hardship that some employees have had to endure after pension funds have been used imprudently or without proper care.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>28.&mdash;(1) In this section &ldquo;possession&rdquo; means&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  actual possession, or</P>
      <P>(b)  constructive possession where goods are in possession of a person over whom another person has authority or control and by reason of that authority or control should be regarded as possessing or exercising control over the goods.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his speech on this Bill indicated to the House that the Bill is designed to make life harder for those who receive and deal in stolen property and that he is replacing the existing offence of receiving stolen property with a more broadly based offence of handling stolen property.  The Bill is deficient in the aims set out in the explanatory memorandum as it should expand on the term &ldquo;possession&rdquo;.  This Bill seeks to implement the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in their report dealing with receiving stolen property. That report indicates that possession of stolen property is difficult to define.  Possession means that one has the goods in one's hands, on one's property or in a cupboard in one's home.  We accept that that means possession.  But, constructive possession may mean that goods are in the possession of another person over whom the defendant has authority or control and in these circumstances the question may arise as to whether the defendant should be regarded as being in possession of or exercising control over the goods, in legislation or by case law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should introduce an amendment to deal with the term &ldquo;possession&rdquo; and explain it under the heading of actual <Col N="358" /> possession or constructive possession. The Bill would be enhanced by having these terms indicated in section 2.  I am asking the House to adopt this amendment so that we can say that goods are in possession of a person who has authority over or is in control of another person and by reason of that authority or control could be regarded as in possession or exercising control over the goods.</P>
    <P>The Bill endeavours to update the 1916 Act.  It is a series of amendments to that Act but it does not attempt to bring our larceny legislation up to date.  The Bill is defective in that it does not take into account the changed circumstances covering a period of almost 80 years. Present day larceny is different from what took place at the turn of the century. Larceny is very sophisticated nowadays in that not only are there people who steal but there are godfathers who send people out to steal, who have control over others but who do not actually steal.  In this amendment I endeavour to expand the term &ldquo;possession&rdquo; to cover modern criminals such as those referred to in the report on crime by the Garda Commissioners which was published last December.</P>
    <P>There has been a huge escalation of offences.  In 1988, 51, 291 recorded cases of larceny took place here.  This is an increase of 3,300 cases over 1987.  Unfortunately the detection rate has only slightly improved on the previous year and only 16,000 of the 51,000 cases were detected.  The value of the goods stolen is about £30 million and the value of the goods detected and returned to original owners is very small, amounting to something like £3 million or £4 million.  Ordinary breaking, entering and stealing has been outdated by sophisticated methods of stealing and the use of modern technology. The return to the criminals is very great indeed.  If our legislation does not reflect modern trends the Bill fails in this area, and we have failed to take an opportunity today and have to wait for another Bill in order to deal with criminals and the type of crime being committed today under the heading of larceny.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> It is with that in mind that I have introduced this amendment to give a better definition of possession, to reflect the thoughts in the Law Reform Commission report, so that the contents of this Bill will be brought to bear on the godfathers of crime and the Garda will have the instrument, in the form of this Bill when it becomes an Act, to act against these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is virtually unanimous agreement in this House that the present law needs to be changed. The purpose of the debate on Committee Stage is to ensure that the legislation we put in place will be as effective as possible in ensuring that the godfathers of crime are brought to justice.  Clearly there is need for an improvement in the present situation.  The figures in the crime report bring this home to us.  Last year there was an increase in the value of property stolen from £31 million to £34 million of which less than £3 million was recovered. Clearly crime is a major industry and, unfortunately, for many of the large scale receivers it is very clear that crime does pay.</P>
      <P>Our job here is to try to ensure that this Bill is as tight and as effective as possible.  I understand fully the concern of my colleague, Deputy Kavanagh, in tabling this amendment.  In the spirit in which I made my opening remarks, I would like to hear the Minister's reaction to this amendment.  If I am convinced that the amendment proposed by Deputy Kavanagh will result in a tighter and more effective Bill then I want to see it in the legislation.  At page 5 of the Law Reform Commission report, dealing with receiving stolen property, it is stated that the willingness of the courts to adopt the concepts of actual and constructive possession has, on occasion, confused rather than clarified the issue.  That is a factor that we will have to take into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point that has to be addressed is whether Deputy Kavanagh's amendment, which has its attractions, ties in with the new section 3.  That is <Col N="360" /> really where I want clarification from the Minister.  I will defer further comment on the matter until I hear what the Minister has to say on Deputy Kavanagh's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first of all, to thank all the Deputies in the House for the spirit in which they have approached the debate this morning.  We all appreciate very much that crime is indeed a major industry and that our job here today, and in other legislation in this whole legal reform area, is to try to eliminate crime as far as that is possible.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh's arguments all relate to possession of stolen property and the issue here is possession of articles for use in larceny, etc.  The amendment is opposed.  There is no need to define possession for the purposes of the new offences which will be created under section 28 of the 1916 Act as provided for by section 2 of the Bill.  The meaning of &ldquo;possession&rdquo; in a statute must always be gathered from the context and the purpose of the statute in general.  A definition should not be used unless there is an actual need, for example, where the expression is used in an artificial way, or it is desired to include something extra to what would ordinarily be understood by the expression or, again, where the expression is technical.  In the present case I am satisfied that the courts will have no difficulty in applying the section without a definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take first the offence under subsection (1).  In this case the doctrine of constructive possession will probably have little relevance, because the offence consists essentially of going out with an article to be used in committing an offence within a reasonably short time.  Subsection (1) specifically provides that the offence is to apply when the person in question is not at his place of abode. Therefore, if a person has a screwdriver in his home for use in burglary at some later time, and if he goes out leaving the <Col N="361" /> screwdriver at home in his wife's possession, he will not be guilty of the offence under subsection (1) as drafted; but with the amendment he would probably be guilty, which clearly would not be the intention.  If, on the other hand, he goes out intending to use the screwdriver to commit burglary, but takes his son, who is innocent, with him, and tells the son to put the screwdriver in his pocket, the father would, rightly, be guilty of the offence under subsection (1) without any amendment.  It all comes down to the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The offence under subsection (2) of the new section 28 is different from that under subsection (1) since it does not depend on an intention on the part of the possessor to use the article in order to commit crime.  But in this case also the subsection will work without any amendment. If a person has an article made or adapted for use in larceny, etc. such as a skeleton key, in his home, and if he goes out leaving the article at home in his wife's possession, then the husband is likely to be liable because the rule as to constructive possession will apply, but there is no need to refer expressly to the rule.  Of course his wife &mdash; assuming that she is not an innocent party &mdash; might also be liable for the offence, but this will depend on the circumstances and the ordinary rules as to accessories to offences, and there is no need to make special provision for such a situation.</P>
    <P>There are many offences of possession of articles for criminal purposes.  For instance, the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, contains references to possession of controlled drugs and possession of controlled drugs for sale or supply, in sections 3 and 15 respectively.  Possession is not defined in that Act.  Further examples may be found in section 4 of the Explosive Substance Act, 1883, and in section 27A of the Firearms Act, 1964, as inserted by section 8 of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976.  There sections provide for offences in connection with the possession of explosives or firearms, and again no definition of possession is provided in these Acts.  Two other Bills which the House recently passed, on <Col N="362" /> videos and on incitement to hatred, similarly contain references to possession but no definition.</P>
    <P>There is a very good reason for this. The courts are well used to applying the concept of possession to circumstances of particular cases, including, for example the case where the owner of a car is charged with possesion of a kit of burgler's tools which has been found in the car and which may or may not have been put there by somebody else with or without knowledge or suspicion on the owner's part.  But any attempt to define possession in legislation is fraught with dangers: the twin difficulties of drawing a definition so wide as to include unwanted cases, and drawing it so narrow as to exclude desirable ones.</P>
    <P>In every case, the question whether and how far constructive possession is sufficient depends on the purpose and construction of the enactment.  I am quite satisfied that possession is best left undefined so that the court will have no difficulty in applying the concept of possession to the particular facts of each case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's very full reply on this.  I accept also, that the interpretation section may have been a more appropriate area in which to have this amendment.  I just want to say again that while the Minister has stated on several occasions that it is best left to the courts to decide, the Law Reform Commission did not feel that was so when dealing with their interpretation of constructive possession.  Deputy O'Keeffe had pointed out that decisions in court had sometimes confused rather than clarified the position.  Therefore, I took the opportunity to propose an amendment in this area so that the Minister could, through her advisers, put in an interpretation that would at least reduce the confusion if not completely remove it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1a:</P>
      <P>In page 2, lines 17 to 29, to delete subsection (1).</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes to delete in its entirety subsection (1) of the proposed new section 28 of the Larceny Act, 1916 which we are seeking to insert by means of section 2 of the current Bill.  I was prompted to do this having regard in particular to some of the questions raised by Deputy O'Dea on Second Stage, wondering why there was a difference to be drawn between a person found in the circumstances under subsection (1) and subsection (2).  At the conclusion of Second Stage I asked the Minister to address this particularly in the interim and he circulated a memorandum to that effect, explaining it.  I am not entirely convinced by the reasons advanced by the Minister.  We should try to tease this out a little more at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see why there should be a difference between a person found at his or her abode or found abroad without lawful authority in possession of goods capable of being used to commit a crime within the context of this Bill.  We should be at least intending in both circumstances to address and deal under the law with a person who without lawful authority or reasonable excuse is found in possession of an implement or weapon capable of being used for the purposes of committing an offence, and that should apply whether it is in the home or abroad. The Act allows for possession with lawful authority, on the one hand, and &mdash; or reasonable excuse.  In other words, if a person is found at home with a screwdriver &mdash; borrowing from the Minister's <Col N="364" /> reference in the previous amendment &mdash; surrounding circumstances that would clearly be available to the person as a defence.  For that reason I think we should be in no difficulty.</P>
    <P>I propose the deletion also because I think it would help to avoid confusion. The issue arose in the context of another Bill we were discussing here where we were attempting to address the question of possession.  My colleague will have to help me recall it.  It was last week when we had something like five different categories of circumstances, exception and excuse being allowed, for possession of weapons.  It was under the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Bill, section 5, where there was a complete hierarchy of order being established for the purposes of possession &mdash; being found in a public dance hall, or place of resort, then a different standard with regard to a different implement if it was abroad generally and a different standard for different implements if it was in the home.  The whole section was completely and utterly tied up in knots of reasoning, exception and otherwise.  I made the point then that in this type of legislation we should try to keep matters simple and straightforward and that there is nothing wrong with the general approach of one rule applying right across the board in whatever circumstances, be it in the home or abroad as in this context or in the context of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Bill, in the context of the dance hall, place of resort, public place or home.  I made the point that we have the general rule that possession of offensive weapons or weapons capable of being used in offence should be equally treated, with the saving provisos, obviously, that the person always has the right to claim lawful authority on the one hand or reasonable excuse on the other.  Clearly a person in his or her own home with an implement of domestic appliance or of handiness, such as the screwdriver, has no difficulty in establishing lawful authority or reasonable excuse.  We should not be unduly worried.  Members of the Garda are not going to go into people's homes, confront them and ask about a <Col N="365" /> screwdriver found in the pantry, the toolbox or wherever.  It would be ridiculous.</P>
    <P>However, suppose, for example, a person is pursued off the street at night, that he or she makes the sanctuary of the home but has in his or her possession a screwdriver, having been abroad for the purpose of committing an offence.  How can that person be dealt with?  The officer who has been in pursuit is not in a position to say whether the person was in possession of the implement because there had been no opportunity to search or frisk down or find out what was concealed under the coat or in the pocket.  If we provide for entry without warrant as proposed in the Bill the person is searched there and then and if he is found to have a pickaxe, a crowbar, a screwdriver or any other weapon of offence, is he to be dealt with under subsection (1)?  I submit that nothing can be done in regard to him because he is now at the place of abode.</P>
    <P>I think the better way is to deal with this on one general principle, recognising clearly that the person at home in normal circumstances has a cast iron excuse or absolute authority for possession of these implements and has no worries.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealing with the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Bill talked about the need to recognise the constitutionality of a person's right in the home.  There are balances in all these rights under the Constitution.  If we want effective legislation to work in this area we should ensure that the balances are drawn towards legislation that will work. Again I am concerned under this section that the way we are relating the different circumstances and standards that would then apply will lead to confusion.  It will lead to opportunities for persons who, seeking to evade justice under the Bill, will be able to play havoc or play around with what is available to them under this Bill.  In moving this amendment I advocate simplification and a process that will recognise fully and protect absolutely the legal and constitutional rights of any person found in the home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy McCartan has stated, rightly, I raised this question with <Col N="366" /> the Minister on the Second Stage debate and on 14 November I received a letter from the Minister which I assume has been circulated to other people who participated in the Second Stage debate.  The letter states, and I quote:</P>
      <P>The point on which Deputy McCartan sought clarification was in relation to the distinction between subsections (1) and (2) of the new section 28 of the Larceny Act, 1916.  Subsection (1) applies to possession, for use in larceny, burglary, etc of an article of any kind (whether specifically made or adapted for such use or not). Thus it is the intention of the possessor which is the critical issue, and accordingly a prosecution under this subsection will usually depend for success mainly on the circumstances in which the accused was found in possession. Subsection (2), on the other hand, is directed at the possession of articles the intrinsic nature of which is wrongful in that they are made or adapted for use in larceny etc.  In this case it is the possession itself and not the purpose of the possessor that is in issue.</P>
      <P>I take the Minister's point.  As this is the first debate I have addressed where the Minister of State was involved in bringing forward legislation I congratulate her, at this late stage, on her appointment as Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his letter dated 14 November 1989.  I am 99.9 per cent happy but I am not 100 per cent happy, unfortunately, as a result of the Minister's letter.  It would seem on the face of it that subsection (1) is designed to deal with people who are in possession of weapons that are not specifically made or adapted for use in crime with the intention of using those weapons for the purposes of house breaking, etc.  That seems to be the obvious interpretation of the section but it is not 100 per cent clear. If it is the Minister's intention that the subsection be designed to deal with that situation it would be much simpler to say that.  We have provided for it in the other legislation to which Deputy McCartan referred, namely, the offensive weapons <Col N="367" /> legislation where we are dealing with the possession of weapons with intent to do something.  There is no reference to intent in subsection (1).  I take the Minister's point that a person who is in possession of any article &ldquo;for use in the course of&rdquo; means possession with intent to use.  I would much prefer if the term &ldquo;intent&rdquo; was inserted so as to make the section clear without any shadow of a doubt.</P>
    <P>In relation to the amendment proposed by Deputy McCartan &mdash; I have had the opportunity to see it only now &mdash; if I read it correctly he proposes to delete the entirety of subsection (1).  If the amendment is accepted section 2 would then read:</P>
    <P>a person who is, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, in possession of any article made or adapted for use in the course of or in connection with&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) larceny or burglary, or</P>
    <P>In other words, there would be nothing to deal with people who are in possession of articles not made or adapted for use in larceny or burglary but with that intent, whether they were at home or abroad.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister's letter of 14 November 1989 and the section as it stands, a person can be in possession of any amount of weaponry to which he would not normally have access or have any use for with full intent to use those weapons in the course of larceny, burglary or housebreaking provided he does not take them out of his own house.  The only weapons which a potential housebreaker can have without specific intent are weapons which are made or adapted for use for the commission of a crime. Perhaps Deputy McCartan who has vast experience in this area would be able to enlighten us.</P>
    <P>In this context I do not know what is a weapon which is designed specifically for crime purposes.  I can understand the concept of some otherwise innocuous weapon being adapted for use in crime, but I do not know what would constitute <Col N="368" /> something which is made specifically for the purpose of the commission of crime and nothing else.  Almost every weapon we have mentioned, and almost every weapon to which reference was made on Second Stage, has some non-criminal use.  Do we have a category of weapons which are designed and distributed specifically for use in crime and which have no other possible use whatsoever? I cannot think of any example but I would like to hear the Minister's comment.  Perhaps Deputies who have more experience in this area of law than I would be able to point to such a weapon.  I am simply making that point to illustrate the general difficulties in this section.</P>
    <P>If the intent of Deputy McCartan's amendment is carried into effect &mdash; I can see the reasoning behind it &mdash; that would leave subsection (2) as constituting the entire section.  A person can be found outside any property at any time of the day or night with a weapon, the possession of which he would not be able to explain but it would be obvious that he intended to use that weapon for housebreaking purposes and if it did not fall within that narrow category of a weapon made or adapted &mdash; whatever that means &mdash; for use in crime, then it would not be possible to subject that person to the legal process unless he had already begun the attempt to break in.  While I take Deputy McCartan's point and I agree with what he says &mdash; I glanced at his Second Stage contribution on the offensive weapons legislation &mdash; I proposed something along the same lines.  I do not think that to delete subsection (1) <i>simpliciter</i> would carry those very worthy objectives into law, there would still be difficulties.  Even as the section stands there are difficulties.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is the purpose of subsection (1) to get at people who have innocuous weapons, weapons with an otherwise innocent use, with intent to use those weapons for the commission of crime.  I do not understand why the word &ldquo;intent&rdquo; is not used.  No matter how clear the section appears, we should make it clear beyond any shadow of a doubt.  I do not understand the rationale behind a person being able to possess &mdash; once he <Col N="369" /> is not abroad &mdash; or allowed to be in possession of weapons which might have some non-criminal use but which he obviously intends to use for criminal purposes. I do not know what the expression &ldquo;a weapon made solely for use in crime&rdquo; means.  They are the difficulties I have with the section.</P>
    <P>I have been looking through the other amendments to other sections proposed and I can see good reason &mdash; while I sympathise with the thinking behind them &mdash; why many of them would have to be rejected.  I am sorry I have to start on this somewhat jarring note.</P>
    <P>It is time we dealt with receivers and handlers of stolen property.  To deal with them the first prerequisite is effective clear understandable legislation where it will be possible to secure convictions. There are a number of areas in this section where there is a lack of clarity.  If there are answers to my questions or if the legislation can be made clearer I would appreciate it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with possession of housebreaking implements, not weapons, but the section states &ldquo;any articles&rdquo; and where it refers elsewhere to other than &ldquo;his place of abode&rdquo; that is far too tight.  I expect Deputy McCartan, in endeavouring to improve this Bill, has the right idea in asking for the deletion of this whole section, but I do not think that will happen.  Therefore, it is necessary for me to hope that an amendment which extends the place of abode of any person to the place of his work should be included in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Articles for use in the course of or in connection with larceny or burglary are many and varied, but in one industry, the construction industry, one would probably find more articles used in burglaries than most others.  I believe &mdash; and I have been harping on this since this Bill was introduced &mdash; that rather than the old fashioned way of breaking down a door, breaking a window or jamming a door open, pieces of plastic and other devices are the more sophisticated ways of breaking into a house or premises.  Carpenters, joiners, bricklayers, or labourers handle <Col N="370" /> articles which can be used in larceny or burglary and, therefore, &ldquo;elsewhere than in his place of abode&rdquo; is not sufficient. My amendment adds &ldquo;or in transit to or from his normal or present place of work or at his normal or present place of work&rdquo;.  People in that industry do not work for long periods in a specific area except, perhaps, when they are working in a factory as part of a maintenance crew.</P>
    <P>In the building trade people move from place to place and have to carry their tools of the trade.  In my constituency quite a large number of people travel to Dublin to various building sites &mdash; at least they used to when there was a lot of building taking place, but that has decreased in recent years.  Nevertheless, it is the tradition that three or four people travel in the same car and put their equipment in the boot.  Their work may bring them to a different place every day.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment if she does not accept the one in the name of Deputy McCartan.  She should extend &ldquo;abode&rdquo; to &ldquo;place of work and passage to and from work&rdquo; because it is quite likely that these many and varied articles could be found in the transport used to go to and from work.</P>
    <P>The section relates to possession of articles for use in the course of a burglary, but it should clarify that it is only operative where there is evidence of the accused being involved in a crime.  This would obviate the need for Deputy McCartan's amendment.  Members on all sides have expressed doubts about the section and if the Minister pursues the line taken in the Bill, it would be reasonable to accept my amendment.  Indeed, section 2.28 (1) should be deleted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a cumbersome element in section 2 and I hope the Minister will work out a compromise to the points made by the proposers of the amendments.  Having listened to Deputies McCartan and Kavanagh, I am not sure whether their amendments will get round the apparent difficulties.  If Deputy McCartan's amendment was accepted there would be an extraordinary loophole <Col N="371" /> in so far as the articles to which the Bill refers under section 2 (2) must be made or adapted.  However, certain articles need not necessarily be made or adapted to suit a larceny.  If we accept Deputy McCartan's amendment it would entail making a deletion in line 32 for which we have not catered.</P>
      <P>On the question of strict liability, under subsection 28(1) the onus appears to be on an accused when he is out of his residence carrying these implements. Notwithstanding the statement in the Minister's letter, the intent is not adequately covered.  Under subsection 28 (1) if a person has a particular article outside his residence or place of abode he is clearly in difficulty.  Previous speakers laid emphasis on the question of firearms legislation and offensive weapons but we are not dealing with firearms and we may not be dealing with offensive weapons. What about a person who has a set of 40 or 50 keys on his person outside his place of abode, where it can be proved that he has no connection with a security business and does not have authority to have such articles in his possession?  We should not run the risk of confusing &ldquo;articles&rdquo; and &ldquo;offensive weapons&rdquo;.  It is regrettable that there is not a definition of &ldquo;article&rdquo; in the Bill.  Does &ldquo;article&rdquo; cover all contingencies? What about a person outside his residence on a summer's night in possession of a woollen balaclava?  Will that person be charged under this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between now and Report Stage the Minister should tease out this point further. Deputies have raised a valid point in that under subsection (2) there appears to be the defence of &ldquo;lawful authority&rdquo; and &ldquo;reasonable excuse&rdquo;.  These definitions can only be judged on their merit and yet a person charged under subsection 28(1) does not appear to have that safety valve which, perhaps, should apply.  We have not addressed the problem by virtue of an amendment which would be suitable to the circumstances, nevertheless the Minister should consider allowing the defence of &ldquo;lawful authority&rdquo; or &ldquo;reasonable excuse&rdquo; to a person found in possession of articles outside his <Col N="372" /> place of abode or residence.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify why a person who may be in possession of an article for use in the course of or in connection with a larceny or a burglary does not have the defence of &ldquo;lawful authority&rdquo; because the burden of proof is such that the intent must be taken into consideration whereas, under the strict liability clause, there is no clear definition or need to define a particular intent.  The Minister's letter has not adequately covered that point.</P>
    <P>One could say that any conceivable article could be used in the course of a larceny or burglary.  Somebody outside his place of abode with a torch or flash-lamp could be in difficulty under subsection 28 (1) because, clearly, a torch or a flash-lamp could be used in the course of a larceny.  I think we should seriously consider allowing the defence of lawful authority irrespective of where the person is.  This tends to defeat what the Minister is attempting to introduce in the proposed section 28 (1).  Unfortunately, I do not go along with Deputy McCartan's amendment because that can only be considered by amending the proposed section 28 (2) as well, and deleting the words &ldquo;made or adapted&rdquo;.  Perhaps we should consider that angle before enacting the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan has crystallised the discussion.  The word &ldquo;article&rdquo; has not been defined and the Minister and her advisers might consider whether there is a need for such a definition. As Deputy Flanagan has pointed out so graphically, are we talking about balaclavas or about flashlamps?  This needs to be looked at.</P>
      <P>Second, on the question of intent, how do you prove it?  How does the defendant, who may have a reasonable excuse, mount that defence?  It seems that the concept is of strict liability and there does not appear to be a possibility that the accused could prove in court that he had a reasonable excuse.  The Minister should accept that we have legitimate concerns which have been articulated by Deputies McCartan, Kavanagh, and O'Dea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="373" /> Unless the Minister can put our minds at ease at this stage, I suggest that the best course of action is that the Minister makes the Department aware of our views so that they can look at the section further with a view to coming back on Report Stage with amendments that she might consider advisable in the light of our discussions.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to hog the debate, but I will reply very briefly to some of the points made.  I hope Deputy Flanagan was not implying that there was some confusion in my mind between this legislation and the firearms and offensive weapons legislation.</P>

      <P>When I mentioned the firearms and offensive weapons legislation, I was referring to the fact that possession of various implements and weapons is dealt with in that Bill.  In this Bill we are dealing with possession of housebreaking implements and I was comparing the way the concept of possession has been dealt with in both Bills. I can answer Deputy Flanagan's point as to why the defence of lawful authority or reasonable excuse is not allowable under this subsection.  According to the Minister, subsection (1) refers to a situation where a person is in possession of a weapon with intent to use that weapon for criminal purposes.  In that situation, it would be totally illogical to talk of lawful authority or reasonable excuse. One could not have lawful authority or reasonable excuse if one was in possession of a weapon with the intention to commit a crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand the reasoning behind Deputy Kavanagh's amendment.  He made a very good contribution but unfortunately, I do not think that Deputy Kavanagh's amendment would work on account of the Minister's interpretation of subsection (1).  In subsection (1) a person must be away from his abode and in possession of a weapon with intent to commit a crime.  I made the points that if the person is at home and has such a <Col N="374" /> weapon and intends to use it to commit a crime, he should also be subject to the criminal process.  If Deputy Kavanagh's amendment were to be accepted a person could, with immunity, go from his home to his place of work in possession of a weapon with the intent to commit a crime.  I do not think the amendment would work.  I thank Deputy Kavanagh for his contribution and I understand the reasoning that underpins his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This section sets up two new serious offences involving the possession of articles in connection with larceny and related crimes.  The new offences replace a range of offences involving possession of burglarious implements, etc., under section 28 of the 1916 Act, as amended, and under section 4 of the Vagrancy Act, 1824.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Vagrancy Act, 1824, makes it of an offence for a person to have in his or her custody or possession any picklock key, crow, jack, bit or other implement with intent felonously to break into any dwellinghouse, warehouse, coach-house, stable or outbuilding. The maximum penalty for the offence is three months' imprisonment, and the section also provides for the forfeiture of the implements involved.  The offence, therefore, applies to possession of such articles at any time and in any place.</P>
      <P>A related provision in the Larceny Act, 1916, is section 28 which deals with possession of such articles by night only as an offence and imposes a maximum sentence of five years in the case of a first offence and ten years if the offender has been previously convicted of a similar offence or of any felony.  As was indicated on Second Stage, the provision in section 2 of the Bill largely follows the Law Reform Commission's recommendation in their 1985 report on Vagrancy and Related Offences.  It updates the law considerably on the offences of possession of housebreaking implements and other items connected with fraud or blackmail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) of the new section makes it a felony, punishable by up to five years' imprisonment, for a person to <Col N="375" /> be in possession, elsewhere than at his or her place of abode, of any article for use in the courses of, or in connection with, a range of larceny-related crimes.  These are: larceny itself, burglary, extortion and blackmail, under sections 29 to 31 of the 1916 Act; obtaining by false pretences under section 32 of the 1916 Act; and taking a vehicle without lawful authority under section 112 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.</P>
    <P>The type of article involved in an offence under this subsection could be anything from, say, an ordinary household or work object, or even a document, to a device specifically made for forcing open doors or windows.  There is, however, an onus on the prosecution to show that the accused had the article in question for use in the course of or in connection with one of the listed offences; and of course this subsection, by contrast with subsection (2), specifically excludes possession in one's place of abode from the scope of the offence.</P>
    <P>There is almost a limitless number of ordinary items of everyday legitimate use which can, without modification, be used, as Deputies have said, for nefarious purposes.  Many people carry bunches of keys with them on a regular basis, but where a person is found in a car park with a key ring holding a variety of car keys, none of which belongs to a car which he or she owns, that must surely give rise to suspicion that he or she has them for use in connection with taking cars without lawful authority, in other words, car theft.  If the prosecution in such a case can satisfy the court that he or she did have them for that purpose, then he or she can be convicted under this section. Similarly, a stiff plastic credit card can be used for opening certain types of door locks, but a prosecution has no hope of succeeding unless a person is found in possession of such a commonplace object in circumstances which the prosecution can convince the court were suspicious enough that the only inference to be drawn was that it was in that person's possession for just such a purpose.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of the new section 28 <Col N="376" /> makes it an offence to be in possession, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, of any article made or adapted for use in connection with any of the larceny-related offences listed in the subsection.</P>
    <P>The offence created by this subsection differs in a number of important respects from that created by subsection (1).  First, it applies to articles made or adapted for use in connection with one of the listed offences.  Second, possession need not be outside of the possessor's home for a prosecution to succeed.  Third, a prosecution will not succeed unless it is shown that the accused did not have lawful authority for the possession of the articles and any excuse offered by the accused is not considered reasonable by the court. Deputy Kavanagh is right, we are not talking about weapons, we are talking about articles.  Thus it will be possible under this subsection to prosecute for possession of documents relating to a false charity, or a device specially made for extracting the barrels from car locks, or a set of lock picks or skeleton keys. In fact, one of the legal experts in the Department has said that he has seen an implement the only purpose of which was to extract coins from a telephone meter. That answers the questions raised by Deputy O'Dea in regard to what implements are used specifically for the purpose of committing crime.  Perhaps Deputy McCartan has seen in the course of his work many other articles that are specifically adapted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean professional work, of course.  In line with the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission the effect of the subsection is that there will be an onus on the accused to give an explanation of these items.  In other words, he or she will be under an evidential burden to adduce sufficient evidence to raise an issue as to the innocence of his or her possession.  If the accused raises a genuine issue as to his or her lawful authority, or reasonable excuse for the possession, it will be for the <Col N="377" /> prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that there was no such authority or excuse and the reasonableness of any excuse offered by the accused is a matter to be decided by the court or the jury.</P>
      <P>The onus of proving that there was lawful authority or reasonable excuse will not &mdash; in contrast to provisions in other legislation regarding possession of offensive weapons in public places &mdash; rest on the accused.  Thus, if the prosecution adduces evidence of lack of lawful authority or reasonable excuse, it will not be necessary for the accused to prove, even on the balance of probabilities, that he or she did have such authority or excuse in order to secure an acquittal; he or she need only cast reasonable doubt on the prosecution's evidence.</P>
      <P>The effect of Deputy McCartan's amendment No. 1a would be to delete a crucial part of the new offence of the possession of articles.  The new subsection (1) is designed to give effect to the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission &mdash; in their report on Vagrancy and Related Offences &mdash; that possession of any article for the purpose of burglary, theft, etc., should be an offence.  It updates the existing provision in section 28 (1) of the Larceny Act, 1916, which &mdash; though not saying so specifically &mdash; is understood to exclude possession of such articles at home.  Under the new subsection (1) it is the intention of the possessor, which is the critical issue here, and accordingly, a prosecution under the subsection will usually depend for its success on the circumstances in which the accused was found in possession of the offending items.</P>
      <P>The new offence under subsection (1) will apply only to possession outside the home because to have it apply also to possession within the home would unduly change the character of the offence.  As I said on amendment No. 1, the offence under subsection (1) consists essentially of going out with an article to be used in committing an offence within a reasonably short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the new subsection (1) was to be deleted then the only available offence would be that under subsection (2), of the <Col N="378" /> possession of articles made or adapted for the nefarious purposes specified.  Accordingly, the possession of ordinary household items such as knives, screwdrivers, hammers, etc., with the intention of using them for larceny, etc., would not be an offence.  That is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Equally unacceptable is Deputy Kavanagh's amendment No. 2 which would weaken the subsection completely. If amendment No. 2 were to be accepted then it would not be an offence to have an article with the intention of using it in larceny or other crimes if the possessor was at work or on his or her way there or back.  The purpose of Deputy Kavanagh's amendment appears to be to protect the tools of a person's trade.  But nobody should be immune from prosecution if he or she intends to use those tools for larceny or burglary rather than for their lawful purposes and it is possession for such use that constitutes the offence under the subsection.</P>
    <P>Turning to Deputy J. O'Keeffe's question regarding there being no definition of &ldquo;articles&rdquo; in the section, I should say the existing provisions which section 2 replaces, that is part of section 4 of the Vagrancy Act, 1824 and the present section 28 of the Larceny Act, 1916, do contain a list of articles &mdash; picklock key, crow, jack, bit or other implement.  It is not the intention to use similar wording in the new section because the existing definitions clearly are out of date.  Deputies made the case originally that the range of implements, documents and so forth which can be used today to carry out unlawful activities covered by the new section &mdash; larceny, burglary, blackmail, obtaining by false pretences and the taking of cars &mdash; has been almost limitless in the eighties.  The omission of a definition is deliberate in order to ensure that genuine miscreants cannot use hair-splitting arguments as to what is or is not covered by the new provision in order to escape justice.</P>
    <P>Government amendments Nos. 2a and 2b are designed to make an addition to the list of criminal purposes for which the possession of an article will be an offence under both subsections (1) and (2) of the <Col N="379" /> new section 28.  Section 113 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 makes it an offence to interfere with the mechanism of a stationary vehicle or to get into or onto such a vehicle without authority.  The effect of the two Government amendments is to include in the new offences under section 28 of the Larceny Bill possession of an article respectively for use in, and made or adapted for use in, an offence under section 113 of the Road Traffic Act.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Dea and Flanagan in particular have mentioned section 2 (1) where it is stated:</P>
    <P>A person who is, when not at his place of abode, in possession of any article for use in. . . .</P>
    <P>Both Deputies put the point very forcibly that the words &ldquo;with intent&rdquo; should be included in that they might serve to tighten the provisions, rendering it easier for the courts, prosecutors and lawyers generally to interpret them.  The advice of the parliamentary draftsman to the Minister is that the words &ldquo;with intent&rdquo; are included in the wording in the section. But, in the light of what both Deputies have said, and bearing in mind the intent of Deputies on all sides of the House &mdash; which is to ensure good legislation &mdash; I will have the drafting re-examined, as Deputy Flanagan requested a moment ago, to ascertain whether this apparent difficulty can be overcome in some way between now and Report Stage.  The Minister will be here on Report Stage, when, no doubt, he will be able to inform the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully take the point made by Deputies O'Dea and Flanagan. In pursuing my amendment I would be agreeable to having deleted the words &ldquo;made or adapted&rdquo; at line 32.  That was an oversight on my part.  When Committee Stage was ordered originally, the Minister's memorandum had not been circulated or received.  I think it arrived on the 14th and the previous week the schedule of business for that week was agreed.  Therefore, it was necessary to have amendments tabled.  At that point, <Col N="380" /> with a view to opening up the debate &mdash; following on what had been said on Second Stage &mdash; I tabled this amendment to address the problem.  I have to press this somewhat further.</P>
      <P>Clearly my amendment simply to delete subsection (1) would not have been a good one were we simply to confine subsection (2) to an article made or adapted for use in the course of or in connection with an offence.  I stand fully corrected there.  I would be happy to allow those words to be deleted.  If we approached the section in that way we would have a much better Bill in that we would then be laying down the one single standard in regard to all articles in all circumstances.  If the Minister presses the present regime &mdash; that there be a different standard with regard to an article found in the home as opposed to one found outside the home &mdash; then we should take the next logical step and accept Deputy Kavanagh's well reasoned amendment, that there should be a furthere standard applied to a person at work or moving to and from work.</P>
      <P>I fully understand and accept the difficulties encountered by people who work inordinate shift hours, often at dirty, dusty, mucky jobs, being found at all kinds of hours, having the mark and disorder of their job, particularly those coming from a construction site, also carrying over their shoulder a bag of tools, being confronted by a disgruntled officer, being made to answer for the circumstances in which they are found either in a police station or subsequently in court.  Those are circumstances to which we should have a little more regard because workers are to be found at all hours, in all places, moving to and from their workplaces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should have as much regard for a person working as for a person at home, and that is what Deputy Kavanagh is proposing.  The simple suggestion of the Minister that the intent clause will be an adequate protection simply will not work. I take her point that the amendment will open up a loophole, but that loophole has been opened in any event.  The concept of <Col N="381" /> possession of articles for the commission of crime is setting different standards in different circumstances.  I make the argument again that there should be a universal test or provision should be made for all the circumstances that can be reasonably raised.  Certainly in this context the case of a worker moving to or from his place of work is very genuine.</P>
    <P>The Minister has correctly pointed out that there are differences between the two sections.  The more she makes that point, the more she makes my case that there should not be such differences.  The suggestion has been made that under subsection (1) proof of intent is needed. Deputy O'Dea is absolutely right about this, there is no reference to it.  Drafting should not be just confined to the intent but the whole issue as I have raised it should be considered.  The Minister might accept that there might be an argument for a single universal testing standard and that there is no need for this differentiation. If the Minister would clarify that I would be happy.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 2a and 2b in the Minister's name are sensible, although it could be argued that they are not necessary in some regards.  Section 112 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, deals with the taking of a motor car.  I would give a small piece of information to Deputy O'Dea. There is an implement known as a barrel popper, the only device I can think of that has one function only and that is to unlock the barrel of a car.  The basic implement is the brace which is placed in a fixed position so that it can be used for that purpose.  It is the only implement I can think of that has a function in crime only.</P>

      <P>The barrel popper is <Col N="382" /> well known in the city of Dublin and, I am sure, elsewhere.  Paragraph (c) will deal adequately, with this.  I would say one word of caution.  Section 113 deals with a person attempting to get on or into or interfere with a mechanism.  I can only think that the reason a person would want to get on or into a mechanism is to commit a crime under section 112, or alternatively to steal.  Larceny is dealt with in section 28 and taking is dealt with in section 112.  Therefore I wonder if we need section 113 at all.</P>
      <P>The reason I raise this matter is that section 113 deals with a summary offence which can only be dealt with in the District Court and the maximum penalty imposed was three months but is now 12 months &mdash; maybe it is six months, I am not too sure; perhaps this could be clarified. We are providing under this section that possession of a weapon to enable the commission of an offence under section 113 could attract a penalty of five years. There is a degree of contradiction there. We are providing, in the case of a substantive offence, a far lesser penalty than could be provided for in the case of possession of an article to commit the offence.  All eventualities would be covered under paragraphs (c) or (a), except perhaps the element of interfering with a mechanism.  That is merely by way of observation and it is a matter that maybe the Minister could consider.</P>
      <P>Our approach in this instance should be towards a simplification of the law.  I can see no reason there is not a universal testing standard.  That could easily be achieved under subsection (2), the operative subsection, by agreeing that the words &ldquo;made or adopted&rdquo; be deleted.  I would ask the Minister to consider that before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The barrel popper which Deputy McCartan mentioned is also used for legal purposes.  For example, financial companies who attempt to seize cars use them regularly.  If garages for some reason cannot get keys for cars, they pop the barrel with this implement and then put in a new barrel.  It is almost impossible to find one implement which is not used for legal reasons.  I accept that the ideas behind these amendments are very good but I am concerned about anything that would interfere with the whole thrust of the Bill.  I take this opportunity to thank the Minister for bringing the Bill before the House and for discussing it in this fashion.</P>
      <P>These amendments have a direct relationship to the type of problems that arise in a constituency like mine.  People who break into houses destroy the standard and quality of life.  Probably the best way to break into any house is to use a sledge-hammer to knock down the door. As Deputy McCartan said, workers might carry tools on their way home from work.  If someone is going down the road at 1.30 a.m. with a bag of tools and a sledge-hammer, he might say he is on his way to work and it would be difficult to prove otherwise.</P>
      <P>In many parts of my constituency there are very few cars to be seen.  This is not because the people cannot afford cars but they just cannot leave them outside their houses and they cannot allow visitors to leave their cars there either.  I wholeheartedly support any law which is brought in to deal with these problems. I hope this section, as it is put forward by the Minister, is agreed to and that the Bill is passed as soon as possible.</P>

It is difficult to understand how a person can be a criminal at home and not at his work or <i>vice versa.</i> I believe the work is an extension of his home because a person would be at home most of the time if he did not have job and a person can be approached at work.  In my opinion, this section is far too tight and I cannot accept the Minister's argument.</P>
      <P>Further on the question of possession, will all the occupants of a car, for instance, some of whom may be criminals and some who may not, be considered under section 28(2) to be in the possession of goods which may be in the boot and about which some of them may or may not know?  Will the driver of a car who gives a lift to a person who throws a bag of these articles or weapons into the back of the car be regarded, if he is stopped by a garda, to be in possession of these articles?</P>

      <P>The short answer to that question is, not necessarily. It depends, of course, on the knowledge of the person concerned.  I want to say in reply to Deputy Kavanagh that the proposed section 28 (1) includes articles in the possession of a person outside the house or home and the proposed section 28 (2) refers specifically to possession in the home.  The reason it is important to include this provision is because, as I said earlier, under the 1916 Act it has been interpreted as to exclude possession in the home.</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 11, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In some ways this may not appear to be a very important amendment but I should like the House to reflect on the proposal I am making.  Under the Bill as presently drafted the court has discretion as to what should be done with any article for the possession of which an accused person has been convicted.  The court has the discretion as to whether an article should be forfeited and destroyed or disposed of in such manner as it may determine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that there is hardly a case for such discretion.  We should make <Col N="386" /> it clear that the court &ldquo;shall&rdquo; either order the article to be forfeited, which would seem to be the sensible thing, and destroyed or if in certain unusual circumstances the court decides that that is not the proper course of action it has the right to order its disposal in such a manner as it may determine.  If a person is convicted of the possession of an article I do not think there would be any case where the court would not order such an article to be forfeited.  The court has the discretion to either order the article to be destroyed or disposed of in such a manner as it determines.  I should like to hear the Minister's opinion as to whether there is any logical answer to the case I am making.  It seems to me that in all such circumstances where there is a conviction for the possession of an article used for felonious purposes that article should be forfeited and the discretion should be left to the court as to what should be done with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this amendment, the effect of which would be to limit the range of a court's discretion in responding to offences under this section of possession of articles. It would mean that in every case where a person was found guilty under the section the court would be obliged to order the forfeiture and destruction or other disposal of the articles in question. This sounds good on the face of it but there are persuasive overriding arguments as to why that should not be the law, arguments which I will illustrate by an example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of a person who is a welder by trade who owns his or her own gas welding-plant, consisting of a trolley for carrying the bottles of oxygen and acetylene, various pipes, valves and nozzles and all the other accoutrements of his trade, and who is found at the dead of night lurking with his equipment at the back entrance of a bank's premises, charged under subsection (1) of the new provision in section 2 of the Bill and quite rightly found guilty of possession of an article for use in burglary.  Under Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment, the court must <Col N="387" /> deprive the offender of his welding-plant notwithstanding that it is his only means of earning an honest living.  That alone might be considered by the court to be such a severe penalty that it might decide not to make matters worse by imposing a term of imprisonment or a fine.  It is surely not just that society should punish a person for abusing his or her only means of livelihood by depriving him or her of that means.  Apart altogether from the effect on the rehabilitation of the offender himself, it cannot serve the wider interests of society.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of ownership of the article in question.  The steel bottles in the welding-plant would be the property, not of the offender but of the industrial gas suppliers who are innocent of any involvement in the offender's crime. it is not right that, through the dishonesty of their customer over which they have no control, they should be deprived of their property by the inexorable operation of the law as Deputies O'Keeffe and Flanagan would have it.</P>
    <P>There certainly will be cases where the articles in question should be forfeited and that is why this provision is in the Bill.  To make forfeiture mandatory in all cases would be wrong in principle and could in practice even mean that, because of its draconian effect, juries might prefer to acquit in some cases rather than subject an accused to a mandatory punishment which they felt was far too severe in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I would direct the attention of Deputies to two Bills which have recently been passed by this House where the courts were given a power of confiscation.  These are the Incitement to Hatred Bill and the Videos Bill.  In neither of those instances is the court compelled to exercise the power in all cases: the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; was used rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  It should be likewise in this Bill.  It may set Deputy O'Keeffe's mind at rest if I say that it is generally accepted that a formulation such as this which confers a power on the court implies a duty to exercise that power in proper cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a bit amused at the graphical description given by the Minister of a welder who is found lurking behind a bank in the dead of night and who will need his equipment thereafter for the purposes of carrying on his honest business.  I am not sure that the Minister intended to convey the impression that a person lurking behind a bank premises in the dead of night with his welding equipment was carrying on an honest business there.</P>
      <P>If we are talking about the severity of the penalty we are talking about somebody who has been convicted of an offence which carries a five year sentence. I accept that that is a maximum but it appears to me that the instruments which were being used, or the position which led to the conviction, should be taken out of circulation.  The Minister referred to the fact that the person convicted may not have the lawful ownership of the goods and mentioned the ownership of gas bottles that an honest welder may have at the back of a bank. However, the section provides that the court, having made a forfeiture order, can either order the destruction or the disposal of the goods.  I presume that is to cover the return of the gas bottles referred to by the Minister to the company that supplied them.</P>
      <P>We have a lot of heavy material to cover in the Bill and I am satisfied to have raised this issue for discussion.  I will consider the Minister's response and if I feel the point needs a further airing I will table an amendment on Report Stage. This is not an issue that is dreadfully serious because the court, in any event, has discretionary powers.  Rather than prolonging the matter further I am prepared to withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3a:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 27, to delete &ldquo;believing it to be stolen&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;being reckless as to whether it was stolen&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The central issue in these amendments represents the most serious of reservations and concerns that the Opposition have about the Bill.  What is proposed in the amendments in my name, on behalf of The Workers' Party, and I believe in those tabled by Deputies O'Keeffe and Flanagan on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, is to the same end.  We are dealing with the whole issue of <i>mens rea</i>, the intent that should ground a finding of guilt of a person charged with the handling of stolen goods.  The Bill suggests that a person who handles stolen property knowing or believing it to be stolen property shall be guilty of a felony. The Minister has adopted the formula of requiring a person to be found, and held, by a court and jury to have either known or believed that the goods handled or involved in the commission of the offence were, in fact, stolen property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, we argue that that is the wrong standard entirely.  We believe the element of recklessness as to whether or not the person knew or believed that the goods were stolen is an essential ingredient in any modern definition of the offence of handling stolen goods.  Without such an amendment the law will, in fact, not progress one iota.  The formula used by the Minister, that of knowing or believing, is merely repeating in essence what has been the law since 1916.  That law has been found to be entirely unsatisfactory. I notice that the Minister is shaking her head furiously in disagreement.  The <Col N="390" /> current law is well stated in the Law Reform Commission's report which, I must say, has been shamefully ignored and neglected by the Minister in the drafting of the Bill.  On Second Stage we addresed that central, key issue.  The Law Reform Commission worked exhaustively to analyse, understand and recommend, on their understanding and analysis of the existing law, in order to help us draft good working legislation.</P>
    <P>The majority of the amendments I have tabled were prompted by the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission. Those recommendations were not only in summary form but in a Bill they proposed.  The Workers' Party have borrowed from that detailed analysis and included their recommendations in our amendments.  One thing we will obtain in this debate is a response from the Minister as to why the detailed and reasoned recommendations of the Law Reform Commission were ignored virtually <i>seriatim.</i> The commission, and the House, are entitled to know why the Government have adopted an entirely different approach.  We are entitled to ask why the vast resources, so thinly employed and spread in the commission's offices, are not put to better use particularly when so many good documents are produced.</P>
    <P>It is worth remembering that the commission provided a consultative paper, assembled a seminar of practitioners in the area to deliberate on the issue before ultimately producing their final report. Obviously, that report is poorly regarded in the drafting of the Bill.  I should like to refer to the furious shaking of her head by the Minister when I suggested that the Bill as drafted was not an advance of the current law.  Section 33 (1) of the 1916 Act states that a person would be guilty of the offence of receiving if he or she received goods knowing them to have been stolen.  That provision was subjected to judicial interpretation over the years and the ultimate achievement of the statute of 1916, as interpreted, adapted and applied by the courts, is summarised in the report of the Law Reform Commission on receiving stolen property.  The commission summarised <Col N="391" /> the current state of the law under the 1916 Act as follows:</P>
    <P>38.  In the light of these decisions [the decisions of the courts over the years in interpreting section 33 (1) of the larceny Act, 1916] the law in Ireland can be stated to be as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  Nothing less than actual knowledge that the goods were stolen is sufficient to found a conviction for receiving stolen goods.</P>
    <P>(2)  Actual knowledge need not be direct; thus the alleged receiver need not have witnessed the theft of the goods.</P>
    <P>(3)  Since actual knowledge is essential, a belief that the goods were stolen falling short of such knowledge will not suffice.  <i>A fortiori</i> mere suspicion that they were stolen will not suffice.</P>
    <P>(4)  Recklessness as to the provenance of the goods is also not sufficient to found a conviction in respect of stolen goods.</P>
    <P>The Bill, admittedly, allows for the inclusion of the believing aspect that, perhaps, was not in the law to date.  We have to consider whether that inclusion will advance the cause of those anxious to deal with the position of the receiver in court much, if at all.  Let me first make the point that the cornerstone of the new definition in the Bill is &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; or &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;.  As we can see, this is full square with the definition contained in the 1916 Act.  Knowledge is the essence. There is no doubt that when the courts and the lawyers get to work on that aspect of the definition they will simply borrow from and build upon what is already there and we will not, as I said, advance the cause for a modern definition in relation to this offence much, if at all, by relying on the concept of knowledge.</P>
    <P>It is also clear, and this has been analysed in the Law Reform Commission report, that the formula of knowledge coupled with belief has in time been judicially interpreted as requiring a standard <Col N="392" /> of knowledge, such that the belief element slips to being of secondary or of no importance at all.  The words in other jurisdictions, and this has also been analysed in the report, have been paraphrased or condensed to mean something approaching knowledge in all circumstances. In these circumstances belief becomes a matter of nothingness.  For that reason I make the case that the Minister's definition will not achieve an advance in the law in this regard.  A person will still be able without difficulty to stand in the dock to present the case that he or she did not know the goods were stolen.  Under the law the standard will be subjective, whether or not the accused person can convince the jury that in the circumstances he or she did not know or did not have grounds for believing that the goods were stolen.</P>
    <P>We are also aware from our law that the standard of appreciation of that knowledge is, in the current state of things, at a ridiculous level.  I do not think any of us in this House can be happy with the judicial interpretations which have emerged during the years with regard to standards.  The law says and the judge charges the jury that even if they do not believe what the accused is saying and that what has been said could possibly be true, then they should acquit.  It goes further to say that even if the jury believe the accused, in advancing an explanation, is lying this of itself does not exclude the possibility of innocence or a possible innocent explanation.  All of us would agree that the current law bends massively in favour of the defendant and makes it practically impossible, in glaring instances, to secure a conviction.  We are trying to address that problem.  Certainly the Law Reform Commission addressed the problem four square and recommended, without any difficulty, that the concept of recklessness should be included in any new Bill.  They tried to address the problem in such a way that in court the accused would not be able to say: &ldquo;Look, I got the goods.  I bought them in the pub but I asked the person selling them to me at a ridiculously low price&rdquo;&mdash; or in the unusual circumstances <Col N="393" />&mdash;&ldquo;whether they were stolen and I was assured that they were not.  So, I was happy and took them home.  I would not have done so if I had any doubts and I am asking the jury to believe me&rdquo;.  That is too common a scenario in receiving cases today.</P>
    <P>We have to address this problem and the only way to address it is in the way recommended by the Law Reform Commission and that is there should be an element of recklessness.  In other words, an accused would be answerable for the offence if he or she had no regard to all the reasonable circumstances in which the goods were obtained.  In their report, the Law Reform Commission make the recommendation clearly and unambiguously, and we should have regard to it, on page 115, under the heading Summary of Recommendations, in paragraph 3, that the test of liability in the new offence should depend on whether the defendant knew or was reckless as to whether the goods were stolen.  They go on to state in paragraph 4 on the same page that recklessness should be defined, so that a person acts recklessly if he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the goods were unlawfully obtained and that the risk must be of such a nature and degree that, considering the nature and purpose of the defendant's conduct and the circumstances, its disregard involves culpability of a high degree.</P>
    <P>Therefore we, as legislators, in looking to the body we asked to work on this for us, cannot make the case that we have not been told clearly and unambiguously what standards should be applied in these cases.  At page 117 of the report the commission set out the provisions which should be contained in a Bill on this area. They state that section 6 should provide that a person is reckless within the meaning of section 3 if (a) he consciously disregards a substantial or unjustifiable risk that the property he handles is unlawfully obtained, and (b) the risk is of such a nature and degree that considering the nature and purpose of the handler's conduct and the circumstances known to <Col N="394" /> him, its disregard involves culpability of a high degree.</P>
    <P>Borrowing on that advice, grounded on an extensive examination not just of the law here and in England but the law elsewhere in other common law jurisdictions, the amendments I seek to promote to this section are for the following reasons.  I believe we should extend the standard of culpability to include the concept of not only knowing or believing but, as I suggest in amendment No. 3a, also recklessness.  Therefore my amendment would remove the words relating to believing them to be stolen and make it an offence for a person to handle stolen property knowing or being reckless as to whether they were stolen.  This would leave out the area of belief and the subjective in these types of cases.</P>
    <P>We then address this preposterous formula, as it now stands, that even if a jury disbelieve the account given by the accused they can consider other factors and can, and must in some circumstances, acquit, should those circumstances arise. We have to address this matter in a commonsense way and ensure that a jury at the end of the day, if they do not believe the account given by an accused, must convict.  That is the essence of trial by jury, a jury of our peers of men and women applying commonsense to the facts within the parameters of the law.</P>
    <P>If commonsense tells them that the circumstances and/or the excuse offered are unbelievable, the only logical conclusion is to convict.  The law to date, because it allows for the belief element, allows for the subjective standard to be applied, then opens up this extra formula saying that if the jury, even though they disbelieve the accused, believe that what he or she is saying could be true, then an acquittal should follow.  Even if the jury are convinced that the person is telling a lie, that is not enough to convict.  I have always found that formula very welcome when defending a case.  This is a formula that we could effectively run riot with. Experience shows that an accused rarely admits straight off to the charge of receiving and will produce defences, excuses, fairy tales and whatever else he can, in <Col N="395" /> the hope of acquittal.  We have to take out the element of the belief, the avenue into the unbelievable.  We have to take out the subjective standard and apply an objective standard of common sense based on what is reasonably possible and allow juries to address the facts in cases of receiving on a commonsense basis.</P>
    <P>My consequential amendments include where necessary this substitution, taking out the belief element and putting in strict knowledge or recklessness in knowledge as to whether goods were stolen.</P>
    <P>In amendment 8a I include a definition of &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; in the context of this legislation and I borrow heavily on what the Law Reform Commission indicate should be a definition of recklessness &mdash; which should be construed as to include a person who acts consciously to disregard a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the goods were unlawfully obtained.  This puts every person on his guard in relation to people selling goods in unusual circumstances. The dishonest person who ultimately purchases or takes into custody goods will be answerable to the law where it can be shown that he was reckless or showed total disregard for the circumstances in which the goods were obtained.</P>
    <P>This issue is essential to the Bill.  The Minister should take on board this amendment which encompasses the views not just of The Workers' Party but of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Law Reform Commission.  Otherwise we will not improve the law.  The Workers' Party did not oppose the Second Reading of this Bill but we will have grave reservations about supporting this legislation if at the conclusion of Committee Stage we have not done something to put matters right.  I urge the Minister to have regard to what is being advocated in these amendments which if accepted will improve the Bill.</P>

      <P>There is a real danger that the Minister is opening an enormous excape hatch for receivers because of his <Col N="396" /> failure to adopt the approach recommended by the Law Reform Commission. The Bill as drafted appears to follow the approach adopted in the 1968 English Theft Act and we should recognise the difficulties in judicial interpretation to that Act.  The Law Reform Commission report discussed these difficulties and quoted an observation on the section in the English Theft Act saying that sometimes one would think that the courts were trying to make a dog's breakfast out of the law on handling stolen goods.</P>
      <P>In one line of section 22 of the UK Theft Act, 1968, they have interpreted the words &ldquo;knowing or believing them to be stolen&rdquo; to mean knowing or believing them to be stolen, which is quite ridiculous and so perpetuating the defect in the earlier law which the addition of the words &ldquo;or believing&rdquo; were designed to cure.  In section 3 of our Bill, the same wording &ldquo;knowing or believing it to be stolen property&rdquo; are included.  I am gravely concerned that by following this line of approach we will have the same difficulties bringing these godfathers of crime to book, these receivers who are making such a fortune out of crime.</P>
      <P>It is relevant to point out that the Law Reform Commission addressed this question at great length.  As Deputy McCartan said, they obviously did so because they go into the whole core of our approach in tackling receivers when we are deciding the basis on which convictions can be secured against them, what level of knowledge they are supposed to have had in relation to the goods being handled and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission examined 12 different possible legislative strategies in dealing with that difficult question of the mental element.  There is a whole range of issues which they dealt with from receiving without regard to the belief of the accused as to whether the goods were stolen, to an absolute obligation on the prosecution to prove that the accused was actually certain that they were stolen.  Having considered the pros and cons of these different strategies, <Col N="397" /> the Law Reform Commission ultimately concluded, not without a lot of thought, debate and deliberation, that the test of liability in the new offence should depend on whether the defendant knew or was reckless as to the provenance of the goods. A satisfactory explanation has not been forthcoming as to why the Minister departed so radically from the approach recommended by the Law Reform Commission. Neither have we had an answer from the Minister to the criticisms in the Law Reform Commission report in relation to the definition, or the problems associated with the similar definition in the UK Theft Act.  There is no great difference between having the section read &ldquo;knowing or being reckless&rdquo; and &ldquo;knowing or believing or being reckless&rdquo;. That minor difference could be worked out.  The essential point is whether the Minister is prepared to accept that recklessness as to the ownership of the goods should be sufficient to constitute a mental element.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that they have looked at this issue in the US.  The model penal code in the US, at section 202, paragraph 2 (c) defines recklessness.  The ultimate proposal of the Law Reform Commission is based on the definition of recklessness in the US draft penal code.  We have to face the problem head on.  I am not satisfied with the approach adopted here of not following the Law Reform Commission report.  We have not had an adequate explanation as to why somebody who is reckless as to the background of the goods being handed to him should not be landed in the dock.  That is the core of this Bill.  My grave fear is that if the Minister does not take on board that proposal the receivers will be able to escape with their ill-gotten gains in the same way in the future as they have done in the past.</P>

      <P>We agreed to take all these together so it would be just as well for me to comment on mine.  I am not going to take too long on this because what I have to say has been said by the previous Opposition speakers.  We should remember what the Minister said on Second Stage.  He said that this Bill largely follows from the 1987 Law Reform Commission report on receiving stolen property which recommended that the Larceny Act of 1916 be amended in order to address the serious difficulties being experienced in the prosecution of receiving offences.</P>
      <P>I have to disagree that the Bill largely follows the 1987 Law Reform Commission report.  Indeed, it largely ignores it, and it has been argued very cogently here that that is the fact.  Given the general scheme of the Bill, the Minister had an opportunity to make some changes in that general scheme and that would appear to be the obvious thing for him to do.  All he seems to have done is to pick very selectively from what was being recommended by these eminent people who were gathered together to make these recommendations.  There is nothing in this Bill that a sensible judge and jury could not have dealt with under the existing legislation.  I believe the Minister has missed a great opportunity as we are dealing with the core issue in the Bill, to deal with the new offence of handling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission are being largely ignored.  In that respect the Bill does not add up to very progressive legislation.  I put down an amendment because I thought it was necessary to clarify the section.  The section provides that a person who handles stolen property knowing or believing it to be stolen shall be guilty of a felony.  At paragraph (c) of section 3 we find that believing property to be stolen includes thinking that such property was probably stolen.  We extend <Col N="399" /> belief into actual thinking and, if people think nowadays, it appears to be a crime.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I instanced the fact that a lot of people read the small ads and articles for sale ads in the evening papers and there they see some bargains, particularly in the area of videos and televisions where they are told that something is in its original box and has never been used and it is about one-third the retail price.  One may immediately wonder if this property is stolen because it is so cheap.  When I was looking at this Bill and at the ads in the paper I even saw an advertisement for a snooker cue signed by that well known snooker player, Mr. Davis.  It costs about £150 in the shops and one was recently for sale, brand new, in the articles for sale column at £25.  I do not think one would go into Elvery's or Clery's or somewhere like that and buy a cue with that man's signature on it for £25, but I am sure if somebody could find some outlet selling them at £25 there would be great business done in them &mdash; either the signature was forged or one might think that the cues were stolen.  Nevertheless we are invited, through our national newspapers, to buy goods which, if the prices are anything to go by, one would be inclined to think are stolen.  Under the section I am endeavouring to amend, it will be an offence even to think that.  I cannot really accept that we should put into our legislation that if one believes, one is also thinking something.  That is stretching credibility too far.  We often hear the term that something fell off the back of a lorry.  If one even thinks that now, one is committing an offence under this Bill.</P>
    <P>We are introducing a dangerous precedent. This Bill is going to go through more or less as it stands because the Government have the numbers.  I believe the Minister should look at reasonable and well argued amendments from this side of the House and accept, where possible, that there is an argument and a reasonable case being made.  In my view <Col N="400" /> a section is being introduced into legislation which extends believing into thinking. It is time to remove that.  The whole world is opening up at the moment and the days when one's beliefs and thoughts in other areas were being questioned are gone.  Let us not introduce the concept here that if one thinks, one also believes.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Kavanagh is proposing is diametrically opposite to what Deputy McCartan is proposing. There are two sets of amendments to the general <i>mens rea,</i> the Fine Gael amendment and Deputy McCartan's amendment. If one does not accept that the definition in the Bill is sufficient to put receivers out of action then I submit &mdash; with no disregard for Deputies O'Keeffe and Flanagan &mdash; that Deputy McCartan's amendment is the logical one to discuss. Deputy McCartan's amendment would result in a situation where the criterion was either actual knowledge or recklessness. If the Fine Gael amendment is accepted the criterion would be actual knowledge or belief, and belief includes thinking or recklessness.  I would suggest that the term &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo; includes believing and the expanded definition of belief that is to be found in the Bill. Therefore the Fine Gael amendment is, to my way of thinking, irrelevant.  I say that with all due regard to Deputy O'Keeffe.  I must comment, in passing, that if the Fine Gael amendment were to be the one accepted it would not damage the legislation in any way.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan in his general remarks made the point that the section as proposed by the Government would not advance the law one iota from what it was under the Larceny Act, 1916.  He also referred to the report of the Law Reform Commission at page 25 from which I quote a short passage:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>35.  Section 33 (1)  of the <i>Larceny Act, 1916</i> requires knowledge on the part of the defendant that the goods were stolen.  What does &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; mean in this context?  Since it is necessary for the prosecution to establish that the goods <i>in fact</i> have been <Col N="401" /> stolen, the only type of case that can warrant a conviction is where the defendant believed that the goods were stolen and his belief was <i>correct.</i></P>
    <P>Again, however, one must ask what is meant by &ldquo;belief&rdquo; in this context?  A person's belief may range from complete certainty through confident belief to mere suspicion.</P>
    <P>It goes on, in paragraph 36, to state:</P>
    <P>In two decisions since Independence, the question of the relationship between knowledge and belief has been discussed by the Irish courts.  In both of these cases, the courts took the position that knowledge, as distinct from belief, was essential.</P>
    <P>Cases are quoted and various quotations are given from the judgements.  It is to address that situation that we have this new section in the Bill.  &ldquo;Belief&rdquo; is now being included with actual knowledge as a possible <i>mens rea</i> for the offence of receiving or handling.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan went on to make the point, with which one must have some sympathy, that the Theft Act, 1968, in section 22, added on the criterion of &ldquo;belief&rdquo; to actual knowledge.  The House of Lords in the UK took the view that belief in section 22 of the Theft Act, 1968 meant actual subjective belief; in other words, it added very little to actual knowledge.  The relevant section, 22, should be read to refer to a person who knows or practically knows the property in question has been stolen.  There is nothing to indicate to me that the Irish courts would take a similar view of similar legislation which was passed here by this legislative body.  The view taken by the UK courts would, of course, be persuasive. It would be referred to by counsel for the defence, I have no doubt, but there is no guarantee or certainty or nobody can predict that the Irish courts would take a similar approach.  Even if the definition were the same as in the UK Act of 1922 &mdash; which it is not &mdash; the Irish definition is radically different in the sense that the term &ldquo;belief&rdquo; in the Irish legislation is specifically defined in a <Col N="402" /> pretty wide way under section 3 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>To my way of thinking, the term is defined in such a way by the Irish parliamentary draftsman as to give a very clear signal to the courts when they come to consider this matter that the English approach is not to be followed; it is not the approach to take and something substantially more than actual knowledge will now be required under the interpretation of section 3 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan adverted to the report of the Law Reform Commission. I endorse fully what he says about the Law Reform Commission.  They are an excellent body of people.  The research they have done on this and other aspects of the law is truly praiseworthy.  The arguments they have advanced for incorporating various legislation within our system, or amending legislation that is already there, are most persuasive. However, I have often argued in this House against slavishly following British legislation.  I can advance the same arguments against slavishly following the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  Neither the British Legislature, the Irish Legislature, the Law Reform Commission, Deputy McCartan, myself, the Supreme Court, nor anybody else, has a monopoly of wisdom. I submit to Deputy McCartan that he himself is not following the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in this regard.</P>
    <P>The report of the Law Reform Commission on pages 90-92 discusses the concept of recklessness.  The specific proposal of the Law Reform Commission for legislation is contained on page 117. It is clear, to me at least, that when the Law Reform Commission are recommending that recklessness be included as a criterion, they are talking about subjective recklessness, where there is some degree of culpability on the part of the accused.  They are not suggesting for a moment &mdash; and I am surprised to hear Deputy McCartan suggesting it &mdash; that we should introduce civil law concepts into criminal law even in an area such as this.  It is obvious that there is no such thing as recklessness <i>per se,</i> but I give <Col N="403" /> Deputy McCartan credit.  He goes on to define recklessness as he sees it and he indicates clearly his definition in his amendment 8a where he gives a clear signal as to the sort of recklessness he is talking about, namely objective recklessness. It has been accepted by courts, academic writers and whatever that there are two types of recklessness, subjective and objective.  The report of the Law Reform Commission, in recommending that recklessness be used as a criterion, is talking about subjective recklessness. It is contained in paragraph 6 of their general scheme for a Bill to provide for amendments to the law.  Paragraph 6 states:</P>
    <P>. . . a person is reckless within the meaning of section 3 if:</P>
    <P>(a) he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the property he handles is unlawfully obtained.</P>
    <P>They go on to define it further in paragraph (b) where it provides that &ldquo;the risk is of such a nature and degree that considering the nature and purpose of the handler's conduct and the circumstances known to him, its disregard involves culpability of a high degree&rdquo;.  It is stitching it in firmly because what they are talking about there is subjective recklessness to which the accused has at some stage consciously adverted.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan's amendment No. 8a states that &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo; is to be construed as including a person who acts consciously to disregard a substantial and unjustifiable risk.  He is only including the person who is acting consciously.  It is including somebody who is subjectively reckless.  I submit to Deputy McCartan that it leaves wide open the possibility of objective recklessness being used as a criterion for a person to be guilty of handling or receiving stolen property.</P>
    <P>As I have said, Deputy McCartan has the advantage of me in this regard because he has vast experience of the criminal courts, which I do not have.  I take it, therefore, when he is talking <Col N="404" /> about the problems that arise he is doing so in good faith, but I suggested that the way &ldquo;belief&rdquo; is defined in section 3 is a clear signal to the courts that we want them to take a much broader interpretation of the <i>mens rea</i> of this offence than has been taken by the courts in the UK under section 22 of the Theft Act, 1968.</P>

      <P>About an hour and a half ago Deputy Stafford made the point that he was one of the few non-lawyers in the House.  He has since left.  I think that is significant.  I realise Deputy Kavanagh and the Minister are here, but they are here in their capacity as spokespersons for their parties.  No other person of the 166 of us is here.  Deputy Stafford made a justifiable point that perhaps people were reluctant to come into the House and engage on the finer points of the debate for fear of being overrun by the lawyers.  Let us hit that on the head.</P>
      <P>If we had more people in here we might be in a position to tease out the problems we have.  The lawyers appear to be concentrating on the logical aspect of a piece of legislation and running the risk of throwing out the commonsense.</P>
      <P>I would like, for a brief moment, to take the debate back to the reasons for this legislation.  The Law Reform Commission were encouraged to consider the various aspects of the problem and to produce a report.  This was because the Larceny Act, 1916, had been a failure. Because of the loopholes in that legislation we were experiencing severe problems of crimes against property.  It was in an effort to counteract those problems that the Minister for Justice came forward with this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that section 3 is the <Col N="405" /> kernel of the legislation because it introduces the new offence.  I genuinely do not think that we will turn about the very alarming rates of crime against property in Ireland unless we broaden the new section 3 to include what is envisaged by the amendment.  The fact is that in this city of Dublin, on a square footage basis, we have three times the rate of crime against property as is the case in London. We are far and away the crime against-property capital of Europe.  This attempt, under section 3, to stem that tide is too weak.  We can learn from the British experience where, as Deputy O'Keeffe has said, the line we appear to be following in this amendment has been a failure. If we are to tackle the receivers of stolen goods we have got to place an onus on them to account for their behaviour at the time of receipt of the goods.  I do not believe that by adding the word &ldquo;believing&rdquo; to actual knowledge we will achieve that.  We have got to look at the broader concept which was exhaustively reported by the Law Reform Commission in considerable detail, where they looked not only at the law in the UK but also at the American situation.</P>
    <P>I have not yet had the benefit of hearing the Minister's response to the amendments other than to hear her say she is opposing them.  I do not want to delay her pronouncement of the reasons she is opposing them.  Is it because she feels there will be a danger of a fair trial to somebody who is faced with a very high burden?  Is it because she feels that the concept of recklessness is something new to our law?  We have legislation and pronouncements from the courts as to the definition of recklessness, as already referred to by Deputy McCartan and as in the Murray case of 1970 where Mr. Justice Henchy stated the concept of recklessness.  I quote from the Law Reform Commission report, page 92, as follows:</P>
    <P>A person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an offence when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the <Col N="406" /> material element exists or will result from his conduct . . .</P>
    <P>That is a follow-on from the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission which has already been quoted extensively by Deputy McCartan.  It can be argued, as the Law Reform Commission have stated, that the definition of recklessness, as handed down by Mr. Justice Henchy in 1970, could form an appropriate basis for the definition of recklessness in a new offence of handling unlawfully obtained property.  That is what the Law Reform Commission have said and I cannot find any evidence to suggest that that is not a correct or a suitable approach to the tightening up of our legislation on receiving stolen goods. We have not had a look at this area since 1916.  We are now reviewing it for the last time until God knows when.  I believe we are missing an opportunity of stemming the tide of crime against property in the community by not introducing a test of recklessness on a person who may be engaged in the handling of or dealing in stolen goods.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stafford said he is loath to engage in an argument where there are lawyers involved.  I consider that particularly bad form for this House because it means we might leave aside our eagerness to construct a logical argument and bring in the commonsense approach. There are people in this community who are waiting for protection under this legislation so as to stamp out the Arthur Dalys of the community.  I do not think we can do it unless the Minister can see her way to accepting the amendments as tabled by Deputy McCartan, Deputy O'Keeffe and myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the next piece of legislation we should be discussing here is legislation that gets rid of or eradicates the perceived intimidation of our colleagues who are not members of the legal profession by the members of the legal profession in this House.  I said already that it is the Government's intention to oppose all ten amendments.  Before referring to the <Col N="407" /> amendments I want to refer to a point raised by Deputy McCartan.  He said that in the case of this Bill the Law Reform Commission's recommendations had been ignored in its drafting.  That is not true because the Government went along with a number of the Law Reform Commission's recommendations in an earlier consultation paper in this particular case and in others and sometimes did not go along with the recommendations made. It should be remembered also that the function of the Law Reform Commission is to analyse our laws and make recommendations for change.  The Government are not obliged to accept or adopt any or, indeed, all of the recommendations in any particular instance.  Certainly the Government study them and they can decide as a matter of policy to accept or reject proposals as they see fit.  They do not reject proposals in a cavalier fashion as seems to have suggested by Deputy McCartan in his contribution.</P>
      <P>The intention behind Deputy McCartan's amendments is to introduce the concept of recklessness into the mental element for the new offence of handling. As such it mirrors the Law Reform Commission's recommendation which was considered by the Government and rejected.</P>
      <P>The recklessness test proposed is a subjective one, which corresponds broadly speaking to the test that has been applied by the courts in this country and others in branches of the criminal law in relation to violent crimes, such as the law on rape or murder.  There are, however, some difficulties about the concept of recklessness, and its exact scope is somewhat uncertain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This concept is based on a proposal in the Model Penal Code drafted by the American Law Institute, a distinguished private organisation in the United States. I think it is important to note that the Law Reform Commission were unable to provide any example of this concept actually in use in the law on receiving or handling stolen goods in any country &mdash; though they do cite a recommendation as to its use, as a basis of general liability in <Col N="408" /> the criminal law, which was put forward by the Criminal Law and Penal Methods Reform Committee of South Australia in a report entitled &ldquo;The Substantive Criminal Law&rdquo; published in 1977.</P>
    <P>The Government felt that, in the context of handling/receiving cases, the test of recklessness would prove unsatisfactory in practice and confusing to juries.  It is not favoured by the Director of Public Prosecutions whose office would have to apply this provision in practice.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the level of calculation and culpability implicit in the test of recklessness would, if applied as a test of guilt in handling cases, have a very limited effect in securing the conviction of handlers who, while not knowing for certain that the property is stolen, have a strong suspicion that it is indeed stolen.</P>
    <P>The principal difficulty which the Government perceived with the commission's proposal, which Deputy McCartan would follow, was that it would require a jury to decide whether the accused acted recklessly.  Recklessness is not a clear cut concept, and while the Law Reform Commission endeavoured to clarify what is intended by providing a definition of recklessness, that definition itself contains scope for uncertainty.  The commission's definition is at paragraph 4 of their report at page 115.  It reads as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Recklessness&rdquo; should be defined so that a person acts recklessly if he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the goods were unlawfully obtained.  The risk must be of such a nature and degree that, considering the nature and purpose of the defendant's conduct and the circumstances known to him, its disregard involved culpability of a high degree.</P>
    <P>Taking the first sentence of the definition offered by the commission alone, it is difficult to see how a prosecutor can prove &ldquo;conscious disregard&rdquo; of a risk, or how substantial &ldquo;substantial risk&rdquo; is nor is it easy to see how it can be shown that a trader, whose normal day to day business is to buy goods so they can be <Col N="409" /> sold at a profit, took an &ldquo;unjustifiable&rdquo; risk that a particular item was stolen.  The second sentence attempting to flesh out the nature of the risk, offers similar conceptual challenges &mdash; challenges which the defence would be able to convert into obstacles in the way of a conviction for his client.</P>
    <P>All in all, and having consulted with the prosecuting authorities here, the Government took the view that the Law Reform Commission's &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo; recommendation would not, in practice, extend sufficiently the scope of the offence beyond the existing requirement of &ldquo;knowing the property to have been stolen&rdquo;.  Other options were then sought which would have the effect of extending the scope to the desired extent.  Of particular interest was the formula already canvassed in the commission's earlier consultation paper and in the report itself which is modelled on the situation in England, Wales and Northern Ireland where a new formula of &ldquo;knowing or believing&rdquo; was introduced in 1968.  After some initial difficulties, this provision has operated in a generally successful manner in that jurisdiction for two decades.  As already stated this was the commission's preferred approach originally and, while nevertheless recommending &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo; in their report, the commission admitted that a strong case could be made in favour of this solution.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe made the point that we are following the English example with all the difficulties associated with that provision.  We are not doing so because we have further provisions in our Bill defining &ldquo;knowing or believing&rdquo; and certain inferential provisions.  As to the difficulties he referred to with the English provision in the 1968 Theft Act, the point may be made that they were more apparent than real and it is certainly the case that those earlier decisions in the lower courts did cause a certain lifting of the eyebrows in higher judicial circles and among legal commentators, to put it mildly, but it is true that in a few cases, soon after the Theft Act was passed, some lower courts may have misconstrued the Act or misapplied it.  The <Col N="410" /> Appellate Court have spelled out its meaning in clear terms and the initial problems have long since disappeared.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that the proposal contained in the Bill draws on the English legislation, which has proven itself reasonably satisfactory in 20 years of practical use, but with the additional feature of defining &ldquo;believing&rdquo; as including &ldquo;thinking that the property was probably stolen property&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, Deputies O'Keeffe and Flanagan would introduce the concept of recklessness as an additional element of the <i>mens rea,</i> to stand parallel with the concept of knowing or believing. This would make the task of the jury, the judges and lawyers on both sides so complicated as to be virtually unworkable. It would have all of the disadvantages of the &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo; concept that I have just outlined, and would not add usefully to the scope of the offence. All in all, I am satisfied that the section proposed extends the scope of the offence sufficiently to secure convictions in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>The effect of Deputy Kavanagh's amendment No. 8 would be to delete what the Government regard as an important element in the <i>mens rea</i> of the new offence of handling stolen property. The provision in question is intended to cover the situation where the accused strongly suspected that the property was stolen.  The discussion paper produced by the Law Reform Commission put forward this option as their preferred approach.  In their final report, at page 93, the commission, while not recommending this option, said that a strong case may be made in its favour.  As the commission stated &ldquo;why should any person escape criminal liability where he accepted property when actually suspecting it was stolen?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The concept of &ldquo;believing that the property was stolen property&rdquo; is elaborated on by the subsection which Deputy Kavanagh's amendment would delete.  Its effect is that &ldquo;believing&rdquo; will include &ldquo;thinking that the property was probably stolen property&rdquo;.  The Government believe that this formula will enable <Col N="411" /> persons to be convicted in circumstances in which, on any view, they should be convicted.  It is also a much less burdensome requirement for the prosecution to prove, and is likely to result in an increasing number of convictions of those who dishonestly trade in stolen property, whether they do so in a once off transaction or as part of a regular &ldquo;fencing&rdquo; operation.</P>
    <P>The effect of Deputy Kavanagh's amendment would be to narrow unduly the scope of the new offence.  It would mean that in a case where the prosecution demonstrated that the accused had a strong suspicion that property was stolen, the likelihood of a conviction would be diminished because of the possibility of the jury taking the view that the suspicion was not strong enough to constitute belief.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan seemed to suggest that there is authority for the proposition that &ldquo;belief&rdquo; adds little or nothing to the concept of knowledge that the property was stolen.  We would be most interested on this side of the House to hear Deputy McCartan cite references for such authority because we are not aware of any.</P>

      <P>I hope it will be more common sense and less law.  The Minister has thrown down the gauntlet in regard to citing examples.  I refer her to the section in the report of the Law Reform Commission where, under comparative aspects, headed United Kingdom, starting at page 59 and going on to pages 60, 61 and 62, there is a detailed discourse on the whole question of section 22 of the Theft Act, 1968.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section indicates the difficulties that have occurred there in interpreting the concept of &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; and &ldquo;belief&rdquo; conjunctively and that is the way the courts have dealt with it in Britain. Deputy O'Keeffe drew the Minister's attention to the fact that, in some instances, &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; and &ldquo;belief&rdquo; mean <Col N="412" />&ldquo;knowing&rdquo; and &ldquo;knowing&rdquo;.  The report states at page 60, paragraph 71:</P>
    <P>The mental element has also given rise to some problems.  Efforts by some trial judges to give some explanation of the phrase &ldquo;knowing and believing&rdquo; have caused more harm than good. The boundaries between a subjective and an objective approach have proved difficult to maintain, especially in cases where the facts should have given rise to suspicion as to the goods provenance or where the accused was considered to have been wilfully blamed.</P>
    <P>It goes on to refer to three cases and said that over the past three years the Court of Appeal have been forced to spell out the position in clear terms.  The Court of Appeal are trying to assert that there is &mdash; and should be &mdash; a difference in law in interpreting the concepts.  They are clearly addressing a situation where, at Crown Court level, the interpretation in practice is that there is little or no difference between those two concepts. That is a matter which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The arguments seem to boil down to the fact that the proposed amendment by way of inclusion of the concept of &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo; gives rise to uncertainty or might give rise to uncertainty and difficulties. More difficulties and uncertainties are likely to arise as a result of the Minister's proposal in the Bill.  I then tried to use common sense &mdash; if anything coming from me is either common or sensible &mdash; to make the case that the law in practice must be looked at.  I believe that the term &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; in time will become the ultimate dominant concept in the definition.  If we are in any doubt about that let us look at what the courts have done with the 1916 definition. Within a period of 60 years its interpretation has become nonsensical.  Juries were told that even if they disbelieved the version of the accused they were still obliged, in certain circumstances, to acquit.  The courts, armed with their powers of judicial interpretation and the Minister's proposal in the Bill, will reduce it to nonsense in time, if it is not already nonsense.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manager of the public affairs <Col N="414" /> department of the Electricity Supply Board offered his services, free of charge, to the trustees of the Chester Beatty Library, in December 1988 to carry out a management study of the library.  That offer was accepted by the trustees of the Chester Beatty Library in January 1989.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference agreed between the consultant and the trustees included a study of the following aspects of the library: organisational structure, staffing, funding/budgeting, commercial sponsorship and marketing-exhibitions.  I have not yet received a copy of the consultant's report which was presented to the library in March of this year.  I understand that the report has been considered on a preliminary basis by the library's trustees, who will consider it in further detail.</P>
    <P>As I have already advised the House on a number of occasions, the trustees are independent in the exercise of their functions under the will of the late Sir Alfred Chester Beatty.  That will empowers the trustees to fill vacancies except in three cases &mdash; the director of the National Library is <i>ex-officio</i> a trustee, and the President and Taoiseach each has a right to appoint a nominee. Appointments have been made without expiry dates but my personal preference would be for a fixed term.  The mandate of the library is entirely governed by the will of Chester Beatty.  To attempt to amend that mandate would require legislation and possibly also an application to the courts.  I am reluctant to pursue that course of action at present.</P>
    <P>I undertook in the House on 25 October 1989, to convey to the trustees the gist of the remarks and anxieties then expressed by a number of Deputies in relation to certain difficulties being experienced in the Chester Beatty Library.  I then also indicated that I would ask for the expedition by the trustees of their consideration of the consultant's report.  These points were conveyed in a letter, dated 17 November 1989, addressed by my private secretary to the chairman of the trustees.  The chairman, Mr. Justice Brian Walsh, was then abroad but he replied in letters dated 27 November and 1 December 1989.  I have <Col N="415" /> his assurance that the substance of my undertaking will be brought to the notice of the next meeting of the trustees, which will be held on 14 December.</P>
    <P>The total amount of the subventions made by the State to the Chester Beatty Library over the past ten years amounts to £1,932,330.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that it is not satisfactory that an organisation which has received almost £2 million from the State, and whose principal source of income is from the State, should be governed essentially as a private organisation with little or no public accountability?  A report was furnished to the library in March, but the Taoiseach has not yet received a copy, although he is responsible for the funding of the body.  On that basis, would he consider, in addition to having conveyed the gist of our remarks on 17 November, conveying also to the trustees his clear view that the report should be furnished to him forthwith, the system of appointing trustees be altered so that there will be a greater input by Government on the number of places on the board and that the term should be fixed and, if necessary, there should be legislation to govern the subject, if agreement cannot be reached by voluntary means?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the report, I would be glad to accept the Deputy's suggestion, however, I would like to consider carefully the other matters which the Deputy raised.  As the Deputy knows, this priceless collection was left to the State by will and on very specific terms, and I would like to consider carefully the implications of intervening and whether it would be desirable to introduce legislation to change the situation.  It might establish a precedent that would have detrimental effects down the road, but it is something that I will consider.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that this is the third occasion in recent times that this matter has been <Col N="416" /> raised in this House and that on each occasion he has been extremely sympathetic to the points being made by Deputies and has said that he will take up the suggestions made with an equally forthright approach, but that he does not seem to be taking any clear directive role on his own account?  Would the Taoiseach agree, for example, that it is not to his credit that a report which was in the hands of the trustees since last March has not been presented to him and that he had not sought it until it was suggested by this side of the House and that this negligence on his part &mdash; I do not want to use a word that strong but something approaching negligence &mdash; is not in line with the importance of the institution concerned and the need to ensure that £2 million of public money is spent to good effect?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's approach at all.  This is a situation which is governed by a will made by a very generous donor and I think we are honour bound to respect the terms of that bequest.  This attitude has been adopted by all my predecessors and I do not think it is necessary for this House or, indeed, for me as a principal of this House to intervene of necessity in situations of this type.  I do not think that the situation is of such a nature that it calls for alarmist intervention of that kind.</P>

If the Taoiseach is so aware would he indicate to the House, having regard to the sensitivities involved, if he has received a request for financial assistance to resolve these administrative difficulties?

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement on the source of the estimated receipt of £295,000 by his Department in appropriations-in-aid in 1990; the reason this item is estimated to increase by 224 per cent over the comparable figure for 1989; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated increase in appropriations-in-aid for my Department in 1990 arises from a change in accounting procedures in regard to the non-Exchequer receipts generated by the National Museum, the National Library and the National Archives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Heretofore, it was the practice to lodge some receipts to appropriations-in-aid and others to bank accounts held by the institutions.  By agreement with the Department of Finance, following views expressed by the Comptroller and Auditor General, it has now been decided that properly all receipts should be brought to account in the appropriations-in-aid in my Department's Vote and to <Col N="419" /> allocate an equivalent amount of money for ongoing developments in each of the institutions.</P>
    <P>The expected receipts for 1990 are: National Museum of Ireland £200,000; National Library of Ireland £50,000; National Archives of Ireland £20,000 and Department of the Taoiseach £25,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand why, in the present circumstances, he had to so recommend but does that not suggest the desirability of separating the National Museum so that it would have its own funds, raised by its own means and from Government by way of grant-in-aid, rather than having to operate under this cumbersome mechanism of paying everything it receives into the Exchequer and getting equivalent sums out again?

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour, in view of his attack on the private sector for not providing more jobs, whether before making those remarks, he considered the total cost to an employer of putting £1 nett with (a) a single employee's wage packet and (b) a married employee's wage packet; if so, if he will give, in the case of both categories, the total amount it would cost an employer, including provision for employer's PRSI and holiday pay to pay the average individual wage gross; and the nett amount this would leave in either weekly pay packet after deducting employee PAYE and PRSI; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 12 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firstly, a married man, on standard tax relief, with four children, earning the <Col N="427" /> average industrial wage of £209.70 per week can expect to take home £158.25 after tax and PRSI; similarly, a married man in receipt of standard benefits with four children, on unemployment assistance would receive about £120.96 per week.  As circumstances differ from case to case, any attempt to generalise with regard to other reliefs and benefits could serve only to mislead the House.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy wishes to contact me with regard to specific cases then I shall be more than happy to itemise the relief and benefits available in each instance. The deduction mentioned would of course reduce both take home pay and the differential between the disposable income of the two persons mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of wage costs the position is as follows:</P>
    <P>(1) Where an employee is on the average industrial wage of £209.70 per week it would cost an employer approximately £2.54 extra for a single employee and £1.87 for a married employee to increase the nett wages by £1 a week, taking account of both marginal tax codes and employers PRSI.</P>
    <P>(2) After this increase a single employee on the average industrial wage, without additional tax relief, could expect to take home approximately £141 per week while a married man on the same wage could expect to bring home about £159 per week.  It should be borne in mind that these calculations do not take into account additional tax relief available for health cover, life insurance, mortgages and so on; with such relief the nett take-home pay would be significantly greater in each case.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of job creation generally the Government's overall strategy is to create the conditions for employment growth.  The effects of this approach are clearly apparent; economic growth of 4 per cent is forecast for this year, inflation is at a very low level <Col N="428" /> historically and is predicted to fall even further next year, manufacturing production has set new records and the live register is at its lowest November level since November 1984.</P>
    <P>Over the past three years with job creation and economic recovery uppermost in mind, considerable strides have been made in the reform of the tax system.  These strides were made despite the constraints imposed by the difficult budgetary situation inherited in 1987. These constraints still apply, albeit in reduced fashion: current budget deficit of £819 million; one of the highest debt-GNP ratios among developed economies. Nevertheless the Government are committed to this process of reform to ensure that the optimum conditions for continued employment and economic growth prevail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that with emigration at 46,000 a year, the highest in 31 years, and with almost 230,000 people on the unemployment register, the question of creating jobs is the biggest single question facing us at present.  Would the Minister not agree that there is a problem in respect of take-home pay?  The Minister confined his reply to take-home pay after tax and PRSI.  He did not include other essential elements which affect the ability of people on social welfare to take up jobs, such as the differential rent which is £17 a week, the non-availability of medical cards to people on the average industrial wage, as if they got that into their hand, or the fact that they do not get a Christmas bonus or free fuel allowance. When all these things are taken into account, low and all as the figures are for a person on long-term unemployment assistance, the disposable income for a married man, with four children, on the average industrial wage is even higher. Would the Minister agree that this poverty trap is not unusual in this case and that the single biggest step we can take to facilitate job creation is to get rid of that poverty trap?  Would the Minister <Col N="429" /> not further agree that apart from substantially reducing income tax in the next budget, one way we could do this is by moving to means testing on nett pay rather than on gross pay as they have done in the United Kingdom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the most important issues from an economic point of view are the high levels of unemployment and emigration.  I referred to take home pay after tax and PRSI because if I was to do otherwise I would have to look at individual cases. I accept that all long-term unemployed persons and their dependants are entitled to medical cards and butter vouchers, but only 50 per cent would be eligible for fuel vouchers, 25 per cent would be eligible for footwear allowances and only about 3,000 would be eligible for rent supplements. I accept that there are instances where people would be eligible for all those benefits but we have to refer to the individual case.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that if we take the case of a single person on unemployment assistance against that of a single person on the average industrial wage, there is a clear incentive for a person with two dependants to work but if a person has four dependants there is almost no difference in the amount.  That is the reality.  It is for that reason the Government are committed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to tackle tax reform particularly in cases like those we are talking about here.  Three things have to be done in this regard.  We will have to try to bring down the standard rate to 25p &mdash; assuming we can get as many people as possible into the standard rate band.  We will also have to look at the PAYE allowance or the bands. However, those are matters for the Minister for Finance and he said recently that he hopes to deal with these items further in the next budget which will be introduced in and about six week's time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that one of the reasons for the lack of job creation is contained in the second part of his reply?  In order to put £112 &mdash; which is what a married man with four children on the average industrial wage gets into his hand after paying rent, etc. &mdash; into the packet of an average industrial worker, it costs an employer over £290. This is too costly and is one of the reasons jobs are not flowing as a result of the low inflation and the balance of payments surplus which we have had for the past five years, and which has continued under the present Government.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 42 and 60 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government recognise the contribution made by the private sector to the process of job creation over the past two years.  According to the latest labour force survey, total employment in the economy increased by 10,000 between April 1987 and April 1989. When allowance is made for a decline of 20,000 in public sector employment over the same period, continuing job losses in agriculture and a lower intake into FÁS employment schemes, it can be seen that there has actually been a net increase of 35,000 in non-farm private sector employment.  This contrasts sharply with the trends of previous years which saw a <Col N="432" /> decline in total employment of 76,000 between 1980 and 1987.</P>
    <P>While no comparable figures are available for the number of jobs lost in the private sector between 1987 and 1989, an encouraging indicator of trends in this area is the fact that there has been a 41 per cent reduction in notified redundancies during the first ten months of 1989, compared to the same period in 1988.  Up to the end of October 1989, there was a total of 11,546 redundancies notified to my Department.  This compares with 23,037 notifications in 1988 and 24,090 in 1987.  These figures suggest that the net effect of new jobs created in the economy during 1989 is likely to be significantly stronger than it was in either of the past two years.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> continues until the end of next year.  Most wage settlements and the agreements associated with the programme continue well into the following year.  The programme represents an agreement and commitment on the part of all the main interests in our society.  I believe the programme has provided substantial benefits from the point of view of the parties. It provided stability for the economy in general and for employers in particular. It has at the same time, coupled with tax concessions, protected living standards and provided substantial improvements on the employment front.  There is, therefore, in my view, no option but to continue on the same path.  It is, however, premature at the present time to speak of further negotiations.  What must be done now is to review the present programme and its achievements so that all the parties can objectively see the benefits that have accrued.  Work along these lines is under way.</P>
    <P>The Government, for their part, are determined to do all they can to help facilitate greater employment growth in the private sector.  The major contribution which the Government can make is in maintaining the existing favourable economic climate and the existing range of incentives to employment creation, improved where necessary.  The range of incentives has recently been extended. <Col N="433" /> with the introduction of a new PRSI exemption scheme and an increase in the subsidies payable on the FÁS employment incentive scheme for certain categories of unemployed persons.  Both these initiatives can, I believe, make a substantial contribution to employment growth in the private sector over the coming year.</P>

      <P>Can I take it from the Minister's response that he has changed the strong views he expressed about the failure of the leading companies in the private sector to contribute adequately to job creation?  I want to refer the Minister to a reply given by the Taoiseach yesterday when he spoke about the success of inviting in the heads of the semi-State companies.  Does the Minister have any plans to invite in representatives of, say, the 50 leading private sector companies which I think in the view of most, if not all, Deputies is completely inadequate? Would the Minister agree that it is likely to be insufficient to merely talk to them and that some measures, like those advocated by the Congress of Trade Unions, such as changes in company law, award those who create jobs in this economy and punish those who export profits, are now overdue?</P>

      <P>I have not changed my mind.  As the Deputy knows from numerous speeches I have made in the past six months I am covering the overall employment position.  I know that small employers, co-operatives and the selfemployed sector are doing their utmost in regard to job creation and I suppose many larger industries are trying to maintain and increase the number of jobs.</P>
      <P>With regard to large companies I still strongly hold the view that given the high profits, high growth rate, high exports, the favourable climate and PRSI incentives, such as the employment incentive scheme, they could substantially increase the number of jobs.  Anything I have said recently was said in an effort to remind them of the commitment I believe they have under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland participated actively in the discussions on the draft Charter proposed by the Commission. Those discussions took place on a multilateral basis, in a group of representatives of Ministers from all members states, and on a bilateral basis at ministerial and at <Col N="437" /> official level between individual member states and the Presidency.</P>
      <P>Ireland's approach to the Charter took account of the views of ICTU and the FIE.  From the very outset the Government's approach to the Charter has been positive and constructive.  We recognised that there was a need for a strong political commitment on fundamental rights and objectives as the first step in a process of balanced economic and social development which would be carried out progressively and at a reasonable pace.</P>
      <P>We made it clear that, for us, the most important social dimension was the creation of sufficient jobs to meet the needs of our people but that the pursuit of this objective did not exclude our supporting a Community policy in which conditions of work and employment would be further improved.</P>
      <P>We made it clear &mdash; and the European Council at Madrid endorsed this &mdash; that only those tasks that can be better achieved at Community level should be subject to Community regulation, with other tasks left to national legislation and collective bargaining; and we wished the Charter to have regard to possible effects on cost competitiveness and, therefore, on employment prospects, particularly for small and medium sized enterprises.</P>
      <P>We are satisfied that what has now emerged reflects a reasonable balance between our employment concerns and the need for basic protection for those at work.  The Charter will, most likely, be agreed by the great majority of the member states, including Ireland, at European level this week.  The Charter is a political commitment which reflects the objective of reducing the disparities between the various regions.  It is not a legally binding instrument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be implemented by an action programme over the next three years on such diverse areas as free movement, freedom of association, equitable pay, working time, contracts of employment, training, information, consultation and participation, social security and social protection, employment equality, safety and health at work, vocational training, <Col N="438" /> protection of young persons and protection of the elderly and the disabled.</P>
    <P>These items, taken together, represent an impressive package of some 45 items, many of them legally binding instruments, covering many areas of social reform.  To implement that package while at the same time maintaining efficient, competitive undertakings and a healthy economic environment for business is a challenge which Government, employers &mdash; whether large or small &mdash; and workers will have to face together.</P>
    <P>One element of this package has been singled out for special mention: a requirement that workers should be assured of an equitable wage, sufficient to enable them to have a decent standard of living. I have no quarrel with that concept. Where I do part company with some commentators on this matter is in relation to whether this implies a statutory national minimum wage.  This is not the intention of the Charter, nor is it mine.  The Commission, wisely in my opinion, is limiting proposals in this area, taking the view that this topic is the affair of the member state or, as appropriate, the two sides of industry.</P>
    <P>Government policy in regard to a statutory minimum wage is clear.  Statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment are already provided for certain sectors of the economy covered by joint labour committees.  It is open to any trade union, or any organisation which claims to represent a class or category or group of workers to apply to the Labour Court for the establishment of a new joint labour committee.  I have looked long and hard at this question of how to deal with low pay and I am convinced that the joint labour committee system is the most effective way in our circumstances.  For that reason in my proposals for industrial relations reform I am making changes in the law designed to improve the operations of those committees.  Moreover, I am setting up machinery &mdash; a new labour relations commission &mdash; which will have statutory responsibility for reviewing whether new joint labour committees should be established.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="439" /> Finally, there is the matter of the implementation of the Charter and the programme of the Irish Presidency.  The action programme, it must be emphasised, is the programme of the Commission and not of the Council.  The President of the Commission will notify the 1990 Work Programme to the European Parliament early in 1990.  In consultation with the Commission and the Troika of Ministers, I will do my utmost to advance discussion on the priority dossiers during my Presidency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that while he has talked as if he was in favour of the Social Charter, in fact the consequence of his several reservations is that he opposes the substance of the Charter?  Will the Minister agree that he is merely hiding behind the skirt of Mrs. Thatcher in Britain and he has slapped the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in the face?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am totally opposed to everything the Deputy has said.  I should like to ask the Deputy to consider a number of points.  Unfortunately, many people have not read or studied the Charter and that is not my fault because at every opportunity I have explained that the Charter is the most major document on workers' rights ever produced.  It is a conterbalance to what is in the Single European Act.  I have raised three questions in the entire debate because I was not happy about certain issues.  If we reach the stage that a Minister of the Social Affairs Council must sit and accept every document put forward by the Presidency, the Commission or other Ministers, it will be a sad day.  I hold strongly on minimum wages because in this country we have a free collective bargaining system, we do not follow legal statute in the area of negotiations.  We would be better dealing with this matter through a voluntary approach, through joint labour committees which have employers and workers representatives. That is a better system than having legally binding rates.</P>

      <P>The provision of career information, carried out by the Department of Labour since the late sixties passed to FÁS on their establishment in 1988.  In recent months, FÁS have had all career information leaflets re-examined with a view to revising and updating them.  Developments and changes in careers require frequent revision and updating.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply.  At the moment we have no national career guidance service.  This has been the position, as the Minister said, since he abolished the scheme under which the National Manpower Service distributed the leaflets.  It is disgraceful that teachers have to send to England for career information.  While I welcome the <Col N="444" /> Minister's commitment to update the existing information and to distribute it, I would like him to assure us that this will be done immediately.  It is not right that we should force our teachers to send to England for this information.  My final point is this.  FÁS issue leaflets on the courses they organise.  They do not issue leaflets on several other careers.  I would like the Minister to tell us if the updated information which FÁS will issue will include details on careers other than the apprenticeships schemes which they organise?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to my appointment as Minister for Labour in March 1987, CERT had been seeking a suitable location in Dublin city for a new headquarters incorporating training facilities.</P>
      <P>I indicated to CERT in November 1987 that I would not favour the existing Roebuck centre site in Dublin as the location for the new development and asked that CERT explore the following alternatives:</P>
      <P>(i) locating the development in the inner city, and close to the Custom House Docks project,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii) siting the training facility in an <Col N="445" /> AnCO training centre or the whole development in the grounds of one of their centres.</P>
    <P>CERT subsequently decided on a site in Amiens Street, Dublin, which they have now purchased.  Such a central location has obvious attractions from the point of view of bus and train routes as against a less central location like Roebuck.</P>
    <P>I welcome CERT's decision and I am pressing CERT to commence construction as a matter of urgency.  The new building will be funded through the sale of existing buildings in the ownership of CERT and through Exchequer and European Regional Fund grants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently announced a number of training and employment scheme measures which will assist the long-term unemployed.  The social employment scheme which is directed at the long-term unemployed will operate at an increased level in 1990 with 10,200 man years activity compared with 9,200 man years in 1989.  The payment of a child dependant allowance, which I announced last Monday, will make the scheme more attractive to older, long-term unemployed persons with dependants.</P>
      <P>The employment incentive scheme has been revamped and redirected towards the long-term unemployed, early school leavers and other disadvantaged groups. I am hopeful that the existence of the subsidy will assist disadvantaged persons in obtaining employment.</P>
      <P>Direct responsibility for the contents and the disclosure of provisions in the annual budget lies with the Minister for Finance.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the contents of the budget.</P>

      <P>In relation to these schemes, would the Minister say if it is <Col N="448" /> necessary if people feel they are unable to join in one of these schemes, to deny them social welfare payments, particularly where they can prove to the authorities concerned that they are not fit to join in one of these schemes?  It is unfortunate that these schemes have been abused to some extent in that they are being used to get people off the unemployment register.  Employment offices are using these schemes in an effort to disqualify people from receiving social welfare payments.  Would the Minister care to outline his Department's point of view on this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>FÁS contact people who are nominated by the employment offices.  There are a number of ways by which people, if they so wish, can get out and they can appeal.  They are not forced to go on a social employment or any other scheme if it would mean a substantial loss in benefits.  That is precisely the reason why this year we increased the allowance and introduced a dependant allowance and a child dependant allowance.  We wish to make these schemes more attractive for people who would lose money in taking up a position in the schemes. People are not compelled to go on a scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 21, 35, 36 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that I announced, earlier this week, that from 1 January, 1990, social employment schemes participants will receive an allowance of up to £10 per week for each child dependant.  I would also point out that payments under the scheme were increased in July of this year to £65 per week (personal rate) and £92 per week for participants with an adult dependant. I am confident that these improvements will make the scheme more attractive to persons with child dependants and go some way toward alleviating existing problems.  All allowances are of course reviewed on an annual basis in the context of the budget.  I have no plans to make a payment equivalent to a free fuel allowance, or any other similar social welfare allowance, to participants on the scheme.  The scheme is a part-time employment scheme and participants work on average two and a half days per week.  Participants may engage in other work or activities during their time off without any abatement of their social employment schemes pay.  In these circumstances, I regard the present rates &mdash; particularly following the general increases in July and the proposed increase for those with child dependants next month &mdash; to be reasonable.  In addition increases in the individual rate of payment would, in a situation of limited budgets, have to be at the expense of the numbers participating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="451" /> The Deputies will also be aware that I announced, in September, that an extra 1,000 people would be recruited for the social employment scheme in severely disadvantaged urban areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the negative form of the Minister's reply but would he not agree that there is a very small number of people on social employment schemes who would qualify for the free fuel allowance and that not all of those who would apply would qualify so that the cost would be extremely small?  Is the Minister not aware of the sense of grievance of these people as often they have a smaller total income than they had when on social welfare and they are now also deprived of the free fuel allowance?  Would the Minister not consider the matter again?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This highlights the fact that the Government do not know what they are doing as in the case of those on the average industrial wage versus those on social welfare.  Deputy Stagg's point is correct.  Would the Minister not agree that it is hard to expect unemployed people to take up FÁS and social employment schemes, if by doing so they will lose their free fuel allowance and their Christmas bonus and be worse off?  That is what we are asking people to do.  We are asking them to take up jobs and be worse off.</P>

I have already <Col N="452" /> made a number of changes this year.

We should remember that people on social employment schemes are not working a full week and one quarter of them are working in other activities with no abatement of their social employment scheme money. The Deputies suggest that people should get all the benefits of the social welfare <Col N="453" /> recipient and be able to engage in other activities.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Registered Employment Agreement (REA) Security Industry sets out the basic minimum terms of employment of persons employed by companies operating in the security industry to provide a security guarding service, static guards, for clients of their employer.  These minimum conditions of employment are applicable to all persons coming within the scope of the REA whether on contract to State, semi-State bodies or private sector companies.</P>
      <P>In addition all Government Departments have been advised of the minimum conditions of employment applicable and it would be necessary for any contractor to satisfy the employing Department that it was observing all statutory provisions prescribed in the relevant REA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in this profession there are quite a number of fly by night operators who do not observe the minimum rate per hour?  The Minister said that a directive had gone from his Department to various Government Departments, but is he absolutely certain that there are no abuses?  A bona fide operator could be under priced by someone who is not obeying the rules.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said a year ago, these fly by night operators were highlighted and I undertook then to ask the secretary of the Government contracts committee to instruct all Government Departments to include a clause in their contracts concerning the obligations of employers in terms of employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements.  I know all of the data was given and I hope the <Col N="455" /> rules are being fully implemented.  If a Deputy has any information to the contrary I will get it examined, but it is now written into the contracts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question, but the employment regulation orders and the registered employment agreements would have statutory effect as being registered Labour Court agreements. Any one breaking those agreements would be breaking the law.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept from me, as the person who negotiated the joint registered agreement in question, that it is indeed being breached by Government Departments?  I could give as an example to the Minister the case of the Labour Court in his own Department where a company not so registered is employed.  At least, it did in my time a very short time ago.  Is it not appropriate now that the Minister should seek to enforce the direction he has given to the Government contracts department to ensure that Government Departments incorporate the terms of the agreement when employing companies to provide security?</P>

      <P>The Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1988, provides for the introduction of sub-board participative arrangements in a wide range of State bodies.  My Department organised a briefing day for officials of the State enterprises concerned to outline the provisions of the Act and to inform them of their responsibilities under the Act.  I am satisfied that as a result significant progress will be made in the area of sub-board participative arrangements in the State sector in the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that sub-board arrangements have been introduced, or are about to be introduced, in a number of State enterprises concerned.  Under the Act, all the enterprises specified must describe in their annual reports, beginning this year, any action which has been taken to introduce sub-board arrangements and any participative agreement made during <Col N="457" /> the year.

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Whereas I agree that the Act so provides, has there not been a great dragging of feet on the question of the introduction of sub-head democratic structures and, in some of the large semi-State companies in particular, can the question of membership of the board of directors not be a very long way indeed from the factory floor?  It is a matter of urgency that provision be made and those companies ought to be exhorted by whatever measures are necessary to cause these sub-board mechanisms to be made operable.</P>

The numbers that are taken up by industry are very low and even the targets we are working to prior to 1992 are extremely low.

    <P>In regard to the question the Deputy <Col N="460" /> asked before I read this reply, the committee who have worked on this have come up with a number of proposals, in some areas controversial, because they will affect the training institutes, the technical colleges involved in the apprenticeship system.  The committee worked on the proposal so I hope at an early date, perhaps by Christmas, to publish the report and for a matter of a few months to allow debate on it by the interested groups, and then to get a submission. The real conflict is that to get up the number of people in apprenticeships they would propose to shorten the apprenticeship programme from about four years to somewhere in excess of two years.  This is controversial, to say the least.</P>

The fact that I was late getting to my seat does not indicate that I am not actively pursuing the amendments in the name of The Workers' Party, that is, amendment No. 3a and related amendments which seek to include the concept of recklessness in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier I was beginning to address some of the questions levelled in my direction by the Minister in seeking to maintain a case as to why there should be no change in this section as it stands. The Minister had suggested that the proposed amendment would be uncertain, that it would present difficulties and that it would be hard to define.  I have tried to counter that by suggesting that there are similar difficulties surrounding her own proposal and that they have been referred to in the report of the Law Reform Commission at page 60 where the judges, in attempting to interpret the definition of <i>mens rea</i> in the English Theft Act, 1968, up to 1987 and 1988, have <Col N="506" /> been obliged to be addressed emphatically by the Court of Appeal in the English administration of justice to try to re-establish that court's view of what the Legislature in 1968 was attempting to do in Britain.</P>
    <P>The point is that upwards of 20 years since the passing of the Theft Act, 1968, in Britain, they were still having difficulties in defining judicially the concept of knowing and believing; these are the very words the Minister wants to put into her Bill today.  I find that remarkable in the face of the realities and the judicial dealings with the definition in Britain. After 20 years and upwards, they still have not got any form of unanimity at judicial level in interpreting the section. In the face of the strongest possible recommendations from the Law Reform Commission the Minister seeks to persist with a proposal similar to that contained in the British Theft Act, 1968.  I want to pursue a little further why we are coming down to that line.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea has sought to suggest that there is nothing definite in the proposition that the Irish courts in interrupting the provision would borrow for English decided cases.  The fact is that he acknowledges that judicial decisions of the British courts have the strongest persuasive status in legal argument before our courts.  They are not binding, but it is in order to refer to them and, as he correctly points out, they would certainly present us with a strong persuasive argument that what would be availed of by a lawyer in the Irish courts in seeking to interpret the section.</P>
    <P>If that is coupled with what has happened and what the Irish courts have done with the 1916 provision &mdash; well knowing the words of the 1916 Act to have been stolen &mdash; with what they have done judicially in restricting that provision, I do not think there can be any doubt in the minds of people in this House trying to predict the outcome, in some years time, of the judicial paring down and sharpening of the provision contained in the present Bill, that is, the provision of &ldquo;knowing or believing&rdquo;. Coupled with a combination of what has <Col N="507" /> been determined in this jurisdiction, in defining the concept of knowing with the very strong persuasive judicial pronouncement in Britain as to what they have done with the double concept of &ldquo;knowing or believing&rdquo;, no doubt we would have an Act that is as protective and as restricted as the current legislation.</P>
    <P>In short, I do not believe that the formula presented in the Minister's Bill would advance the cause of dealing with handlers and receivers one iota.  That is a great pity.  If there are to be uncertainties and difficulties then let us err &mdash; if that is the word &mdash; in favour of a more stringent attack on handlers and receivers.  All of us would agree that there is, perhaps, no more pernicious offender in the law of dishonesty and in the law regarding attacks on property than the fat cat who sits back in his surroundings and allows others to carry out and direct the fences on his behalf.  He is the fence who passes on goods, who secretes them and provides the wheels and oil for the whole industry of crime in regard to the disposal of property.  We should make no apology for being definite and resolute in regard to that type of offender.  In view of the history of the courts in interpreting the 1916 Act and of the persuasions that will be brought to bear on the Judiciary from the English authorities, the Minister is not as resolute as she should be in pursuing this issue.</P>
    <P>The report of the Law Reform Commission records the fact that the Director of Public Prosecutions does not support this formula but this is not a view which should hold great sway in this House.  As legislators we are attempting to redress the existing situation and we know that, to date, under existing law the handler, fence or receiver runs rings round the judicial process.  There are major loopholes available to him or her in the law which we are trying to close off.  That is why I tabled the amendment.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to the reasoning behind the Law <Col N="508" /> Reform Commission's concept of &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo;. On page 89, paragraph 4, they deal with the area of liability based on reception where the accused was reckless as to whether the goods were stolen.  Subparagraph 114 states:</P>
    <P>This option is far closer to the traditional policy of criminal law although, as we have seen, it does not represent the law in relation to receiving stolen property.</P>
    <P>The committee, in reviewing several options of liability that could be imposed, refer to nine and are of the view that the inclusion of &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo; as a concept is far closer to the traditional policy of the criminal law.  The subparagraph continues:</P>
    <P>In favour of this option it may be argued that the requirement of recklessness affords sufficient deference to subjective wrongfulness in this context. We are dealing here with anti-social conduct of a serious kind.  If an accused, having addressed the question whether the goods were stolen, decides to take a chance, it may be said that this behaviour is sufficently wrongful to warrant punishment.</P>
    <P>I fully adopt that line of reasoning and argument.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>Recklessness was used by the legislature in the definition of rape in the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981.  The legal implications of recklessness were addressed by the Supreme Court in the context of a prosecution for capital murder of a Garda in the People v. Murray.  It appears to us that the concept of recklessness, property defined, has advantages in the context of the appropriate <i>mens rea</i> for receiving.  We say &ldquo;properly defined&rdquo; because, unless the term is clearly defined, the Court could interpret the term in either a subjective or objective sense.  One interpretation would require the accused to have actually adverted to the risk that the property had been <Col N="509" /> stolen before there could be a conviction. Under the alternative interpretation there could be a conviction if a reasonable man would have adverted to the risk in the circumstances, whether or not the particular accused adverted to the risk.</P>
    <P>I also adopt that argument to pursue my interests here.  The report indicates areas where the concept of recklessness has been used on previous occasions and should be applied to this Bill.  The report goes on to say:</P>
    <P>There can be little or no doubt that recklessness in criminal law has always been defined in a subjective sense, at least before the Caldwell decision. Ranged in its favour are Kenny, Smith and Hogan, Jerome Hall, Glanville Williams, the English Law Commission and the American Law Institute, not to mention Lords Edmund Davies and Wilberforce who dissented in Caldwell.  It presents an acceptable and just definition for the criminal law in general.</P>
    <P>From comments that have been made it is obvious that there are misunderstandings about the differences as to where the subjective and objective come into play.  My amendments are subjective to the extent that they turn the spotlight on the accused and require him to be subjectively observed.  The concept of recklessness throws a certain onus on his or her shoulders to act carefully where the circumstances so require.</P>
    <P>The definition provides for an objective approach to be taken by the jury when they analyse, in their deliberations, the activities of the accused.  In other words, they will be asked &mdash; and will be entitled to ask of themselves &mdash; whether the accused acted objectively or in a way in which a reasonable man would have acted in the circumstances.  That is the test I advocate in these amendments.  The jury must be given the opportunity to rely on their common sense and to provide a test and standard which would be measured against the approach of the reasonable man.  I wanted to clarify that point so that there will be no doubt in <Col N="510" /> anyone's mind as to the line I seek to adopt in proposing these amendments.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister dismissed my amendments and I do not believe she has made a case for her own provision which is worthy of support.  I intend to press the amendments in the names of The Workers' Party and myself because they are central and crucial to the effective workings of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan went over all the arguments which are well set out in the report of the Law Reform Commission, which we have all read.  They are very compelling arguments and it is unfortunate that the Minister is not prepared to accept them.  We have now reached a stage of honest disagreement as the Opposition believe that the test of recklessness should be included in the Bill which would facilitate, to a far greater degree, the conviction of people responsible for handling and receiving stolen goods.  We have argued this all morning and part of this afternoon and I do not see any indication that the Minister is prepared to accept the amendments.  There are a number of amendments tabled and we will have to put one of them to the test.  The first is in the name of Deputy McCartan and it covers my point and that of Deputy Kavanagh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe's remarks illustrate the difficulty we are in. There may be some logic to the arguments of the Opposition but there is a distinct lack of clarity.  Deputy Flanagan is also confused in regard to this matter. Deputy McCartan quoted Glanville Williams, Kenny and Criminal Law, Smith and Hogan, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, and I have the same page of the Law Reform Commission report open in front of me, these cases are cited as authorities for the proposition that when the term recklesness <i>per se</i> is used in legislation, it means subjective rather than objective recklessness.  In the case of the Crown <i>v.</i> Caldwell the English House of Lords divided three to two on <Col N="511" /> the question of whether it was objective or subjective.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan is advancing the argument that the concept of recklessness should be a mixture of subjective and objective.  Earlier he argued that the concept of recklessness would be the clearer approach to take; however, everything that I have heard demonstrates exactly the opposite.  Having read the Law Reform Commission's comments on recklessness, it is by no means a clear test.  I looked up an article referred to in the report by Professor Mary McAleese in the 1981 Dublin University Law Journal entitled &ldquo;What is Recklessness?&rdquo; and anybody who reads that article will know that recklessness is a very uncertain and ill defined concept.  If they do not want to believe Professor McAleese, they can read the judgment of the House of Lords in the case of the Crown <i>v.</i> Caldwell where there were fundamental differences between the Lords and they decided on a bare majority of three to two that it meant objective recklessness as opposed to subjective recklessness.</P>
    <P>The basis of Deputy McCartan's submission seems to be that the further elaboration of the word &ldquo;belief&rdquo; the proposed <Col N="512" /> section 33 (2) (c) where belief is specifically defined as including a situation where a person thinks that the property was probably stolen is going to have no effect.  The courts will just ignore those words and treat them as if they were not in the legislation.  I do not share the Deputy's pessimism.  I think the courts will give them a very clear and specific meaning.</P>
    <P>By and large, the solution being adopted is preferable to the concept of recklessness, unless we are very clear in our own minds what we mean by recklessness. A test for recklessness, which suggests a mixture of subjective and objective, is not clear and the Fine Gael amendment does not purport to define recklessness at all.  They are perpetuating that uncertainty and ensuring that it will be carried into Irish law.  I do not accept that.</P>

      <P>I feel strongly about this amendment.  I am very anxious that the Minister would take on board the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission.  However, it appears quite clear, in the light of the last vote, that the Minister has set her face against taking on board the definition of &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo; which we on this side of the House felt would make it easier to bring receivers and handlers of stolen property to book.  On that basis I see little point in putting this amendment to a vote at this stage but I would say to the Minister that I will be renewing my efforts on Report Stage and I hope she will consider the matter further in the meantime.</P>

      <P>The principle behind this amendment is totally unrelated to the matter we have been discussing for the past couple of hours.  It concerns the ability of the court to order compensation to be paid, where the court considers it appropriate, to the victim of the crime.  This is a concept in which I believe very strongly.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>All these amendments refer to the payment of compensation to the victim of the crime.  This is a concept that should be developed a lot more and should be given a statutory basis.  When we are talking about receivers, the common language we use is the godfathers of crime, the fat cats who grow rich from the ill-gotten gains, the proceeds of crime.  I do not know whether there is a real basis for that but I suspect there is some basis for it.  My <Col N="516" /> concern is that unfortunate people who have had their goods stolen find themselves at the end of the day without recourse to anybody.  There probably are people who have grown rich from the proceeds of crime and the figures alone give an indication that this is so.  The Garda report on crime last year indicated the value of stolen goods in the order of £34 million.  That is a lot of money.  It indicates that somewhere along the line there are people who are living, if not in opulent circumstances, certainly in a degree of luxury on the proceeds of crime.  I want to deal with that problem. I do not think it is sufficient that we change the procedures to put these people more readily behind bars and it is not right that the moneys accumulated should be there for them when they come out.  In addition I want the court to have a statutory power to order compensation to be paid to the victim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This serves two purposes.  First, I have a natural sympathy for the victims of crime and I would very much like to see a system in place whereby there would be some degree of compensation to them. Secondly, it would serve as a further deterrent to those who are involved in crime if they knew that their ill-gotten gains could be sequestered by the court. I accept that in all cases it may not be possible to ensure that compensation is paid.  I accept that there will be instances of receivers and handlers who have not got the wherewithal to pay and quite frankly they are not the people I am after because you cannot squeeze blood out of a turnip.  If they do have such moneys vested away in properties or otherwise, I say take it from them.  That will help the victim who will have suffered distress and it will also act as an additional deterrent. Some of these people would put with serving a year or two in jail, would consider they had paid their debt to society and then live of their ill-gotten gains for the rest of their lives but we should not permit that,.  That is the central thinking behind my amendment which is to permit the court to order a convicted person to pay compensation, where appropriate, to <Col N="517" /> the person from whom the property was stolen.</P>
    <P>I do not think much notice is taken by the Government of the Law Reform Commission report and I am not sure whether it is helping my cause to point out to the Minister that the Law Reform Commission suggested that this course be followed.  On page 110, paragraph 151 of the report that is very clear and explicit. It states: &ldquo;We also consider that, where appropriate, in addition to any penalty imposed, the Court should be able to order payment of compensation by the handler to the victim of the primary offence whether or not that offence was committed by the handler himself&rdquo;.  The Law Reform Commission are on my side in this case.  It is clear from the amendment tabled by Deputy McCartan that he is behind this move and I have no doubt that the Labour Party will favour it also. I think the entire Opposition is in support of this approach and I am not surprised because it makes total sense.  I would be very interested to know whether the Minister could muster up any logic or commonsense to oppose this amendment.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that amendment No. 12 is to be taken with this amendment. That amendment is consequential and therefore there is no need for me to address it separately.  Deputy McCartan's amendment is on all fours with mine and we can cover the issue by dealing with it on the basis of amendment No. 5.  I would urge the Minister very strongly to take this concept on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise simply to support what Deputy O'Keeffe has said and to draw attention to amendment No. 13 in my name on behalf of The Workers' Party.  This amendment is on all fours with what the Law Reform Commission recommend.  It provides that in addition to penalties of imprisonment and/or fine, the court should consider reparation being made to the victim of the primary offence, in other words the person whose property was first taken.  That victim should be compensated by the person convicted of handling regardless of <Col N="518" /> whether the person convicted is the original taker or depriver of the property.  It addresses the fact that the handler is more often than not a person of substance, a person with accumulated property, ill-gotten or otherwise.  It does not matter, for the purposes of this section, whether the accumulated wealth of the person is found to be legitimately obtained or otherwise.</P>
      <P>If he or she has money at their disposal, then at the time of sentencing a court should be specifically empowered to order the payment of compensation to the party who lost the property at the outset.  That is why I am proposing that this amendment be adopted.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty supporting Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment.  He slots his amendment No. 5 in under section 3 but I felt it was more appropriate, as he did with his amendment No. 12, to bring the amendment under section 9 which deals with all offences.  However, the principle is clear and it should be supported.  I hope the Minister will acknowledge what wisdom is to be shared on this occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest the previous speakers are in any doubt as to the position of the Labour Party on these amendments, I want to say that the concept appeals to me.  I understand these amendments will deal with handlers.  As the layman on this side of the House I was of the opinion that nobody could make money out of stealing and other sorts of crime and that if the stolen money was found it would be returned to the owner.  Obviously this new offence of handling should be extended to people who are not directly involved in perpetrating the crime in the first instance. The beneficiaries of stolen goods should be proceeded against also.  Therefore, these amendments are totally acceptable to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware that some people who have spent time in prison seem to live off the benefits of their crimes many years after they come out.  They do not work in the normal way but they are able to live in style in this country and abroad off the benefits of their nefarious activities <Col N="519" /> and ill-gotten gains.  If this concept can be adopted and put into effect, the Minister should seriously consider accepting the amendments.  I know she will produce also sorts of arguments why she cannot accept the amendments but surely she knows as well as the rest of us that the godfathers of crime seem to be the people who are making the money. We are able to quantify the loss to the public from the statistics which the Garda Commissioner gave us recently and we should use this Bill to ensure that when these people leave prison they will not be able to live off the gains made from their nefarious activities.  I hope the Minister will accept the spirit of these three amendments and if she cannot accept the present wording perhaps she will promise to look at them and see if something can be done between now and Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to taking these amendments on board.  I am sure it has been brought to her attention that in practice judges in the courts have been making orders of compensation payable to victims of crime.  We now have an opportunity to give statutory effect to this practice which has grown over the past number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to adequately discuss the amendments without saying a few words about the place of the victim within our criminal law system.  We can readily see the changes which have come about over the years in the fundamental principle that the victim of crime was a member of a certain socio-economic grouping.  Given the importance of property in the framing of our criminal justice system, it was unfortunate that we did not give pride of place to victims because of their place within society, as ordained in past centuries.  If we look at the Brehon Laws we can see the importance of compensating a victim for a crime which was perpetrated against him.  A fundamental feature of the Brehon Laws was not that society as a whole would be compensated, as we see now, but that the victim would be compensated.  We should <Col N="520" /> be moving in that direction.  This is the only area of the Brehon Laws we should consider re-enacting, but it is worth considering that the primacy of property rights over the past number of centuries has moulded our criminal law system.  We have not really debated the importance of changing that system in accordance with changing times.</P>
    <P>The public prosecutor is the agent for the victim but he does not have any power under the criminal justice system to ensure that a victim is adequately compensated. I hope the Minister will see fit to accept the amendments.  Over the past number of years other jurisdictions have taken on board an element of the compensating a victim.  Pilot studies carried out in the United Kingdom show that there has been a remarkable decrease in crime both against persons and property in areas where these studies were carried out.  One can see that as well as compensating the victim and making him feel a little more important in the entire criminal process, the results towards society as a whole have been positive.  In other debates we discussed our prison system which has become terribly expensive. Rather than having a term of imprisonment as an immediate priority for conviction under this legislation our priority should be to pay compensation to a victim who has suffered the trauma of the burglary, larceny or some other crime.</P>
    <P>The arguments in favour of the amendments are compelling.  If they are otherwise I should like to hear the Minister's views in that regard.  When concluding the Second Stage debate the Minister for Justice said he looked forward to a positive approach being taken on Committee Stage.  This is an area in which the positive approach by the Minister could be seen to bear fruit.  We must look at the broader concept of the victim within the criminal law code.  It is not a matter for this evening's debate but I hope we will have an opportunity to discuss it at a later stage.  In keeping with the need to highlight the importance of not alienating the victim from crime we should include a provision which would be discretionary and available to a judge to help him make <Col N="521" /> up his mind in accordance with the merits of the case.  It is also very important to consider whether the person paying the compensation can afford to do so.  We would not want to have one law for those who can afford to pay the victim and another law for those who cannot.  It is important to preserve a balance. However, I do not believe that that should be an excuse for the Minister to rule the amendments out of hand.  I look forward to her positive reply.</P>

      <P>These amendments are opposed.  These amendments follow a recommendation in the Law Reform Commission's report that the court should be able to order payment of compensation by the handler to the victim of the primary offence whether that offence was committed by the handler himself.</P>
      <P>The commission's recommendation in this regard touches on an overlap between the criminal and civil law.  The area of tort in the civil law is principally concerned with the provision of compensation for loss or damage, whereas criminal law is concerned with the regulation of conduct and the maintenance of social order and, to this end, with the imposition of penalties or sanctions. There can obviously be an overlap between the two areas, and one set of facts may at the same time constitute both a tort and a crime.  In the present context a thief may be prosecuted by the State for larceny and sued by the owner for trespass to goods or conversion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing system which requires that issues of criminal and civil liability be dealt with in separate proceedings has been criticised on the basis that in many cases it would be convenient to apply criminal and civil remedies together.  In <Col N="522" /> that regard reference has also been made to be desirability of avoiding unnecessary litigation and saving expense for victims.</P>
    <P>There are, however, important matters to be teased out before the final form of a system of compensation in criminal trials could be settled, such as, for instance, whether it is right that the victim could get adequate compensation if, as Deputy Flanagan said, the offender was well to do but would have to manage without if the offender was penurious; whether a well-off offender should be able to buy his way, as it were, out of a punishment to which he might otherwise rightly be subject and whether a criminal court should have to concern itself with the difficult questions of title to stolen property which are likely to arise from time to time.  There is also the question whether, in determining the amount of compensation to be paid by a particular offender, the concepts of contributory fault as between concurrent wrongdoers which apply in civil proceedings should be employed by the criminal courts.  One must also face the fact that even if a prosecution fails because the guilt of the accused is not proven beyond a reasonable doubt, civil proceedings may still lie for compensation arising out of the same facts because there is sufficient evidence to prove the commission of a civil wrong on the balance of probabilities: thus a system of compensation in criminal trials may not always do away with the need for two sets of proceedings.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a formal system of compensation by offenders would require very careful consideration.  My view, however, is that this question raises issues of much more general application in relation to compensation by the criminal to the victim in all cases, and it should, therefore, be dealt with in the context of crime as a whole and not on a piecemeal basis.  That is what I propose to do.</P>
    <P>These amendments are not wrong in principle and I accept the spirit in which they were tabled.  The Minister is considering this matter in the context of separate legislative proposals dealing with compensation generally and any general provision will of course, have to include <Col N="523" /> detailed provisions as regards enforcement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like my remarks to be taken as being critical of the Minister's advisers, certainly, they are not intended as such.  However, I must say that the reply read by the Minister amounts to the greatest lot of bureaucratic gobbledygook that I have heard for a long time.  The Minister told us that the issue we have raised requires serious consideration, but any change in the law requires serious consideration. The Law Reform Commission some years ago gave the matter serious consideration and produced a recommendation. If there were other matters that the Minister, and her colleagues, wished to have teased out in the meantime, that could have been done.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister seriously suggesting that there cannot be an overlap between the civil and criminal law?  Deputy Flanagan has told us that, almost on an extra-statutory basis, the courts are making orders for the payment of compensation to victims.  In my time I came across a case where a judge adjourned an assault charge to see if compensation would be paid.  The judge said his final decision would depend on whether a certain amount of money was paid to the injured party.  I do not think we should put judges in the position where they may be straining the boundaries of the law by doing what they think is proper.  From what I knew of the case I mentioned, the judge was right in his decision but I wonder why we fear to tread where judges are pushing out the judicial boundaries.  We should be prepared to bite the bullet and give judges the necessary legislative and statutory backing for the course of action they adopt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the danger of people buying themselves out of jail.  I should like to point out that one of the reasons I tabled the amendment was that I wanted to tag it on to the penalty provided. That penalty is a term of imprisonment not exceeding 14 years or a fine or both.  I made it clear that the power <Col N="524" /> available to the courts was in addition to those penalties.  There was no question of permitting any person to buy his or her way out of jail.  At the end of the day it would be a matter for the presiding judge to decide what is best in the circumstances taking everything into consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised a question about the title to the goods.  There are two answers to that question.  Under the Police Protection Act of about 1890 applications are made to the District Court for the disposal of goods and district justices make decisions for the disposal of items held by the Garda Síochána as a consequence of a crime.  There is a precedent for the courts to make such decisions.  I should like to make it clear that I am not merely talking about the restoration of stolen goods to their rightful owner but about compensation.  I am talking about developing a new approach so that we can get at the ill-gotton gains of the fat cats we hear so much about.  It pains me to read about such people living in luxury and very often sending deprived people to do their dirty work.  One can have a degree of sympathy for the minions employed in that capacity but we must get at the arch criminals, the people who are in the background, who will not stick their necks out but who are quite prepared to take advantage of the huge profits that can be made from crime.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that the provision we have suggested will be a deterrent and, very importantly, it may help the victims of crime.  As Deputy Flanagan pointed out, we have a precedent for our suggestion in the Brehon Laws.  What is good in the laws of the past can be put in place in current legislation.  The Minister has not faced this issue head-on.  We would be strengthening the provision in the Bill if we included our amendment.  We would be hitting two targets with one arrow, providing an additional deterrent and including a compensation provision for the victims of crime.  I accept that the compensation will not be available in all cases, but where it can be made available those fat cats should be nailed and made pay it.  We should have a procedure under <Col N="525" /> which a judge can go beyond sending such people to jail for a couple of years. Of course, he could send him in for a longer term at a cost of £30,000 a year to the taxpayer which, again, is a matter which cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who believe we should hit the criminal where he would feel it most.  The way to really get at some of those who have made it their profession to cream off the proceeds of crime is through their pockets.  I am speaking metaphorically of course but if we can sweep out of their pockets the proceeds of such crime they will not be too quick to get involved in it again.  In so doing we would have the opportunity to compensate the victim.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to rethink this one. Logic, commonsense and humanity all combine to support the case being made by my colleagues and I on the Opposition benches.  I feel so strongly about this that I am making a further appeal to the Minister to rethink the matter and accept the idea in principle.  Perhaps the wording needs to be tightened up somewhat &mdash; that is always an out for a Minister &mdash; but if the idea is accepted in principle that would satisfy me that we have done a good day's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take this opportunity to address some of the reasons the Minister has advanced which, again, I am sad to say are unconvincing in their reasoning.  The fact is that on an every day basis the courts, in imposing sanctions and penalties, can and do provide for the payment of compensation in whole or in part to the victims of crime of all sorts.  As Deputy O'Keeffe has pointed out, judges advise the victims of assault to head off to the civil courts and issue a writ for assault or trespass of the person.  In cases where cars are stolen and damaged and where property is stolen and disposed of, the courts will, where they feel it is appropriate to do so, order the accused to pay compensation. Often this is on top of a suspended sentence, a sentence which has to be served or in lieu of part of a sentence.  There are <Col N="526" /> a myriad of ways by which the court can do so.</P>
      <P>What we are seeking to do with these amendments, in recognising that fact, is to underpin the idea in law so that it is made clear to a court dealing with the crime of receiving and disposal of stolen property that the Legislature take the view that it is appropriate for judges to address the concept of compensation in all, if not the majority of cases dealt with. That is all we are saying.  If one likes, we are simply acknowledging that this practice takes place already, that it should be part of our law proper and that we are saying to the judges that we agree with them, that they should continue to do so and that they should have regard in particular to those with wealth and property stashed away, ill-gotten or otherwise, whenever they have to answer crimes of dishonesty, such as the conversion of stolen property.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that there will be an overlapping of the civil and criminal law and that what victims should do is head off to the civil courts to look for damages there.  However, she does accede to the proposition, idea and concept that there can be overlaps and there is nothing wrong in principle with this. That being so, why advance the argument at all in the first place?  Let us be clear that an overlap is allowable and does not fly in the face of either of the principles of the civil or criminal law.  Let us also recognise that the victims of crime need some form of recognition on the part of the Legislature.  I pointed out on Second Stage of the Rape Bill a few days ago, if not yesterday &mdash; I am in and out of here so often that I am losing track of when and where&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Government have not had a good record in recent times in dealing with victims.  We have closed down, effectively, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  No further applications are being accepted.  We are simply mopping up there and disposing of the hundreds of cases outstanding. <Col N="527" /> Effectively, it will then be closed.  The Irish Association of Victim Support have complained that central Government pay little regard to their need for funding. The Rape Crisis Centres, who counsel the victims of rape and serious sexual assault, have been on their knees during the past two to three years with little or no response from the Government.  I understand that the Rape Crisis Centre in the Minister's consitituency has had to close its doors, if it is not gone entirely. I suppose one could mention that the malicious injuries code is also gone.  This code was used in compensating owners of property from the public purse where the loss resulted from a criminal act or action.  Overall, we do not have a good record.  We could redress the balance slightly if we were to include an amendment along the lines of the one proposed here given that the Minister has indicated that there is nothing wrong in principle with the idea.  I am sure she recognises and acknowledges that it is an every day practice in our courts for judges to order the payment of compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister indicated that there are general issues to be looked at and regard has to be had to a general scheme of things before we move in this direction. She also stated she was looking at the matter.  In welcoming this greater review of the law and recognising the fact that it will be some time before that law is put in place, let me suggest that we might concede to this amendment, its correctness in principle and allow it in gently. When we come to introduce a comprehensive Bill on compensation for the victims of crime, whenever the Minister has completed her review of the law we could simply retreat from this amendment and repeal it in the new Bill.  This would show a certain degree of goodwill and earnestness on the part of the Government towards the victims of crime and it would not cause great upset to the general principles, contrary to what the Minister says.  Therefore let us include the amendment and when comprehensive legislation is introduced we <Col N="528" /> could rescind it.  This is a simple procedure so I can see no reason for the Minister not acceding to this request.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said also that there are matters of concern which need to be addressed.  She spoke about the rights of victims.  How does one address the right of a victim who is faced by a defendant who is poor on the one hand and a defendant who is wealthy on the other? This is an everyday occurrence and it has not caused headaches for the courts up to now in its administration of the law in this area.  I do not think it is a major consideration or would cause any problems in the future.  Not wanting to anticipate anything, I suggest that the only conceivable law we could introduce is one which would allow the courts discretion in circumstances where it is appropriate for the courts to order the payment of compensation, unless of course the Minister is suggesting that the Government will establish alongside it a general fund from which the courts could borrow to compensate the victims in criminal cases if the accused is simply not in a position to do so because of his or her poor circumstances.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the suggestion is made that provision in this regard might allow for an accused to buy his or her way out.  There is no suggestion of that. This is an alternative provision that allows for imprisonment, fine and/or compensation, one or all or any combination of two or three options.  None of us is advocating that we put in a buying out option.  We are underlining the primacy of consideration for the victim and saying that irrespective of what happens to the accused, that where possible the victim should be compensated out of the resources of the accused person whether or not he or she is locked up in Mountjoy for any number of years.  If the accused has wealth and the victim is at a loss, the wealth should be appropriated in appropriate circumstances and paid to the victim.</P>
    <P>Dealing in stolen property means that one is specifically accumulating wealth from it.  The case is not the same where a person in a brawl strikes another person. <Col N="529" /> Whilst the victim of such a crime might require compensation, the fact that a person hits someone does not by definition mean that he gains wealth.  However, a person in the business of selling stolen goods is by definition accumulating wealth.  It is appropriate in legislation dealing with the handler of stolen goods that there should be a provision to address that situation.  The area of the drug baron is an example that has screamed at us from the headlines of newspaper articles.  The Dunne family here in the city have been well documented in their dealings over the years in the pernicious drugs trade.  They have a house in Stepaside, in the uplands of the Dublin mountains, looking down over the city with big bay-fronted windows. Whilst Mr. Dunne was locked up in prison that wealth remained intact. There is an example in relation to the other brother up in Crumlin, with the corporation house converted into a gin palace of sorts with a counter and plush surroundings.  What about that other infamous character about whom we have heard so much, the general, Mr. Cahill, with his corporation house in one street and his townhouse off Cowper Road next door to the home of the retired company director of one of the biggest corporations in the country?  Are not these people cocking a snoot at the system?</P>
    <P>Whilst I am referring to them in the context in which they are better known, for their dabbling in the drugs scene, do they not represent an appropriate analogy to be referred to in the handler situation? When we get people into the dock, to a great extent they are people involved in the retail business, or the wholesale business, or in some aspect of it.  They are involved, for example, in dealing in cigarettes, spirits and other goods smuggled over the Border.  Many of these people are dealing in stolen goods over the counters in their own shops, pubs and bars and they appear before the courts. Is it not appropriate that some brake be put on their business, at least to ensure that at the end of the day a victim is compensated?  We must address this problem at some stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> Very wealthy, resourceful people end up in court answering for crimes which happen to be one of many of their pastimes in crime generally.  At that stage we should be in a position to hit them with the full rigour of the law.  We should not simply say that the victim could have a right to go to a civil court and bring an action there for trespass on property or otherwise.  This is not the way to deal with it.  After the trauma of the crime and of having to give evidence in court, we would be asking the victim to look to the prospect of putting good money after bad to try to get redress in the courts from the handler, and if the judgment was not honoured it would be passed on down to the sheriff who would be asked to go knocking on the door of the big house in Stepaside or in Cowper Gardens asking the occupants to hand over goods to the value of the award that the victim has secured in the civil courts.  That does not seriously address the issue and the Minister should look at it again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have criticised this Bill in that we have not taken the opportunity, after some 70 years, to do a root and branch job on updating the principal Act of 1916.  The proposal being put forward in these three amendments gives a dimension which has been lacking in this important section.  These amendments do not simply direct the Bill in the manual handling of stolen goods.  They attempt to get at the blue collar type of crime. The Minister in spite of the arguments already made about the overlapping of criminal and civil law should accept what has been said so forcibly here from the Opposition benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1988, 30,000 or more premises or homes were burgled, 2,500 cars were stolen and 17,000 or 18,000 cars were broken into and goods or parts of them were stolen.  The people who have made the money from these items were not those directly involved in carrying out the acts but the organisers, the people who handled the goods when they were stolen, knowing them to have been stolen.  We are asking for an option of compensation <Col N="531" /> to be included in the penalty when such people are caught and brought to justice.</P>
    <P>A person, before he becomes a victim of these crimes, is paying for them, as we all have to pay very heavy insurance on homes or cars especially if one is living in this city or near it, because the loading here is very high due to the crime rate. The victim of such crimes endures hardship, trauma and stress, as well as the loss of the goods and the wreckage of his home or car and he continues to suffer from that experience.  When one's home has been burgled, it is likely that the insurance loading will be heavier in certain instances.  At any rate, a certain amount of the insurance will be deducted in that the first £50, £100 or £1,000 of the loss suffered must be paid by the victim. A garda said to my brother when his house was burgled in rural Dublin that he had it insured, as if the loss did not matter.  That did not make any difference to him.  He had lost valuables, some items of sentimental value and his house had been wrecked.</P>
    <P>Not feeling comfortable about going out and leaving the house unattended means such people suffer that trauma for years and probably for ever, and there is no compensation.  Nor are these victims looking for compensation on that basis; but more is needed than somebody simply coming along and saying that the perpetrator of the crime has been caught and has got ten years in jail or four years in jail or whatever, that the victim has insurance and can make a claim and that everything will be fine.  It is about time something a little stronger than that was done in these cases.  These amendments are underlining a way that this Bill can be used to take an additional incentive in this whole area by introducing the offer of compensation.  The Minister should not simply argue that it is not possible or that it should not be in here.  She should be positive and accept that this is a worthwhile proposal and endeavour to see how her advisers could include this in the Bill before she denies us the option of having that additional compensation as a measure of how the transgressor can be <Col N="532" /> penalised beyond a monetary penalty or a penalty of imprisonment.  Some compensation should go to the victims of these crimes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am strongly in favour of a system of compensation for the victims of crime, not just crimes of theft but also offences against the person.  This is something the Government will have to consider as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I want to take issue with Deputy O'Keeffe's statement that the Law Reform Commission have considered this in some detail and have made the recommendation here.  I am open to correction on this but it appears that, to the question of handling stolen property, the Law Reform Commission gave very cursory consideration, throwing it in as a possible addition to the penalties that can be imposed by a court.  I listened carefully to Deputies Kavanagh and O'Keeffe. What they said demonstrates that this is a complex issue.  The Minister has demonstrated that also.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the updated position is in the UK but I note that in the 1968 Theft Act there is a section 28 which allows the court to make an order for restitution in certain cases.  It is narrowly drawn.  I do not think it would go anywhere near meeting the points raised by the various speakers and by this amendment.</P>
      <P>If this amendment were accepted today, there would be statutory provision to enable the victim of a theft to be compensated if it was a receiver who was convicted.  There would be no corresponding statutory provision to enable that victim to be compensated if a thief, in the widest possible sense, were convicted. That would be illogical.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Law Reform Commission are considering the entire law of theft with a view to updating it. The Minister of State has nodded her head, which I take to mean that they are considering that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The appropriate place for a statutory provision which would enable the courts to compensate the victims of theft in a wider sense is in the general law of theft.  That is being considered at the moment by the Law Reform Commission. I would like some indication from the Minister as to when we might expect a report from the Law Reform Commission.  The Minister has said that when that report is available, the Government will act expeditiously to bring legislative proposals before the House.  That is the proper way to proceed.</P>
      <P>I do not know if it would be preferable to ask the Law Reform Commission to consider as a separate issue the question of compensation for victims of theft and offences against the person or whether we should take the question of compensation for victims of theft and include that in the consideration which the Law Reform Commission are going to give to the general law of theft.  In so far as we are talking about victims of theft here, any provision which would enable the court to order compensation for those victims should be part of the general law of theft.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan has demonstrated that there are various ways to go about that including ordering direct compensation from people who have profited in some way or applying something analogous to the old Criminal Injuries Tribunal or a combination of both.  It would be illogical to have a situation where a court could order a victim to be compensated if a receiver is convicted but cannot do so if the thief is convicted and the receiver is not.  The general law of theft is the place for this, but I am strongly in favour of a system whereby victims of theft would be looked after and there would be statutory provision for this.</P>

    <P>Deputy Kavanagh said he thought the <Col N="534" /> Larceny Act should be replaced completely instead of amended piecemeal. We all accept the need for a more thorough-going look at the Larceny Act itself.  The Law Reform Commission are looking at the whole area of dishonesty and will be making further reports on the matter.  These reports will be dealt with fairly quickly and should enable us to take a very useful step towards ultimate codification of the criminal law by, perhaps, codifying in one statute all aspects dealing with theft.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing against the principal of the amendment.  I am aware of the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements that were mentioned by the Deputies and which individual judges and justices make in cases which come before them.  What I am saying, however, is that there are many matters of detail to be teased out to find a suitable, comprehensive system of compensation. Contrary to what Deputy O'Keeffe has said &mdash; and Deputy O'Dea is right &mdash; these matters have not been explored in any great detail by the Law Reform Commission.  The matter raised in the amendments is much wider in scope than the Bill before the House and deserves separate, comprehensive and thoroughly thought out legislation.  The Minister's Department have this matter under consideration with a view to formulating such a Bill.</P>
    <P>I accept that it could be some time before this comes into law and I have great sympathy with the arguments which have been advanced by all the Deputies. For the information of the House there is provision for restitution of stolen property, a very partial provision in section 45 of the 1916 Act, but it is very obscure and of no value at present.  It was replaced by section 28 of the Theft Act 1968 in England which was replaced in its turn in 1972 and 1974.  It is a wide and general provision not just applicable to larceny cases.  That is the point we are making.  It needs separate consideration in a general context.</P>
    <P>Before I make a final decision, the points and arguments being put forward by Deputy McCartan are the very arguments I was putting forward to my <Col N="535" /> officials on the right here earlier and I would like to ask for advice from the lawyers in the House as to how they might reconcile the jurisdictional problems that could arise.  For instance the Circuit Court, wearing its civil hat, cannot go beyond £15,000 compensation.  What happens when it is wearing its criminal hat?</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied with the response here.  I take the point that of course we need a suitable, comprehensive system of compensation and I would be delighted to see the Government coming up with such a system here and now.  I make a prediction that we will be waiting a while, but while we are waiting it does not make sense not to use this ready-made vehicle at least to make a start.  Deputy Flanagan went back to the Brehon Laws.  The Minister herself accepts that in 1916 an effort was made from the point of view of restitution and compensation, but it was unworkable. Therefore, Deputy McCartan and myself are being original by raising this point; it was thought of previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we bridge the gaps in the Brehon Laws up to the Larceny Act, 1916, and again up to date, we are talking about long spans of time.  I am worried as to whether we will have the same span of time before we have this very comprehensive system the Minister and Deputy O'Dea have spoken about.  That <Col N="536" /> is why I go back to the point that the good is not the enemy of the best.  It is an addition to this Bill to have it in the Bill.  The fact is it is not there in relation to people directly involved in the charge of larceny.  I would prefer if it were there. I am prepared to broaden the amendment, if that is Deputy O'Dea's problem. It poses no difficulty whatever to me. After all, this is a Larceny Bill so that would cause me no problem whatever. What worries me about the Government's attitude is the approach that because we cannot have a perfect, comprehensive solution today we can have nothing.  I do not accept that that is the basis on which we should legislate here. There is the opportunity to add to the effectiveness of this Bill here and now. On that basis I am pressing the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to delay the House in regard to this amendment.  I said earlier that I could not accept the Minister's reasoning behind this section in the Bill. I said that &ldquo;believing&rdquo; should be extended to include &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; and although the Minister claims that if this section is not in the Bill wrongdoers would not be apprehended, she must know that obviously I did not want to make it any easier for these people to avoid being apprehended.  I believe in sticking to the meaning of words but what is included in this Bill stretches credulity and introduces an aspect where the thinking person can be regarded as a criminal for thinking that property was stolen rather than believing it was stolen.  I cannot accept that and, therefore, I have to press this amendment.</P>
      <P>My final words may seem a little strange but next Sunday when the Minister goes to Mass &mdash; as I believe she does &mdash; and if instead of saying &ldquo;I believe in God&rdquo; she says &ldquo;there probably is a God&rdquo; she will find herself in trouble with many people outside this House.  Using that analogy in regard to the Bill, it is not acceptable in this form.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8aa:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  In a prosecution for an offence under this section in relation to fish or shellfish, it shall not be necessary to prove that the said fish or shellfish shall have been reduced to captivity before being stolen.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment touches on an unusual point and when I explain it, the Minister will find it close to her heart.  A problem has arisen because of the development of mariculture and aquaculture around our coast, which is very relevant in Connemara in the west and down my way in the south.</P>
      <P>The problem, as it has been explained to me, is that in many instances there really is no legal ownership of these oyster beds or areas where mussels and scallops are grown.  But there is the trade, as it were, in oysters and other shellfish being improperly taken and handled by receivers.  The tabling of this amendment arose out of an endeavour to resolve that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty from the legal point of view, as I understand it, is that one cannot prove that oysters have been stolen because one cannot prove that they have been reduced to captivity; that is the difficulty. I had better explain how an owner operates at present.  He will either be the <Col N="543" /> possessor of a charter, he may hold a Roinn na Mara aquaculture licence, or in some instances he may have moved ahead of the designation and licensing procedures, as it were, merely staking out his claim on the seabed, putting in his oysters, mussels or whatever.  Clearly that person is the owner of the shellfish because he has staked out his claim, he has seeded the bed, he regularly handles shellfish, looks after them, which may involve dredging to remove weed and to deposit spatting shells.  Therefore, there is clear evidence that the person who does all those things is the owner of the shellfish.</P>
    <P>Probably the point I am raising is more relevant to shellfish than, say, to farm salmon because normally farm salmon will be in a cage and, therefore, can be interpreted as being reduced to captivity. But, in the case of somebody with an oyster bed, that will not be so; the owner will be growing the oysters which cannot move of their own volition.  Yet I understand that if those oysters are improperly and wrongly abstracted from the oyster bed and therefore traded by a receiver, there is the legal problem that an offence of receiving or handling does not lie because one cannot prove that those oysters have been reduced to captivity.  I hope I am making my point clear.</P>
    <P>I have taken advice on this point since it was raised with me and it does appear to be a very genuine problem.  The Bill, as drafted, does not cover the point. Accordingly, I have tabled an amendment to provide that, in a prosecution for an offence for reciving or handling in relation to fish or shellfish, it shall not be necessary to prove that the said fish or shellfish shall have been reduced to captivity before being stolen.  That is the net point of my amendment.</P>
    <P>I did have an opportunity of looking at the English law.  Mind you, they have a Salmon Act of 1986 which was touched on at page 61 of the report of the Law Reform Commission.  The approach followed in the Salmon Act, 1986, in the United Kingdom does not answer the point raised with me in regard to the <Col N="544" /> problems of those involved in mariculture and aquaculture.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that the amendment, as drafted, is a worthy one and would go a long way towards resolving the problems of those people who are involved in mariculture and aquaculture.  I see a very big failure here for the development of aquaculture and mariculture.  It is important that we ensure that the legal protections are in place so that the fruits of their labours are not filched by some people who could steal their oysters or shellfish, trade them and then not be answerable to the law.  That is the purpose of this amendment.  I would ask the Minister to accept the bona fides of the complaint made to me in this regard and also the bona fides of the manner in which I have attempted to deal with that complaint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it is my fault but I have difficulty in understanding what the Deputy is trying to get at.  In the case of oyster beds, for instance, their ownership is clearly laid down in Department of the Marine guidelines &mdash; the beds themselves are either in private ownership or are owned by a co-operative &mdash; and there is a very strict mapping procedure such people must follow in order to select.  I know it is difficult to imagine but I find it easier since I was involved in one in my area not so long ago which covers a vast expanse of water.  There are very strict guidelines laid down, so there would not be a problem with regard to ownership.  If it is property, then it is covered.  Perhaps there is some other point I am not getting that the Deputy is trying to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It was explained to me by one of those involved in such an undertaking who drew it to my attention. That person referred to the fact that one can operate either under an old charter or a Roinn na Mara aquaculture licence. He contends that a prosecution will not succeed unless one, as the possessor of a charter or a licence, can prove that the shellfish had been reduced to captivity on one's beds before being stolen.  Of course, this is impossible to prove with <Col N="545" /> legal certainty when dealing with shellfish in the open sea.  I can see the point. Where one may be dealing with farm salmon in cages there is no difficulty showing that they have been reduced to captivity, but, if one is talking about an area of open sea, where one is growing one's oysters on the seabed, apparently a prosecution will not lie if somebody takes those shellfish because the State will not be able to prove that the shellfish have been reduced to captivity.  I hope I am making the point clear.</P>
      <P>I will say that the person who raised the issue with me felt so strongly about it he sought the advice of Senior Counsel. Senior Counsel agreed that there will have to be a change in the law, that there is a basis for the problems highlighted by my correspondent, incidentally somebody I would regard as being totally reliable.</P>
      <P>If the Minister would like an opportunity to tease out the matter &mdash; I appreciate I did not raise this point on Second Stage; It was only brought to my attention after I had spoken on Second Stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If I thought that the pearl might grow between now and Report Stage, or if I were given an indication of same from the Minister, I would accept it.  I do not want to try to ram through an amendment if the Minister is not totally satisfied with it.</P>
      <P>I do want to reiterate that the point has been raised with me in all good faith and I am presenting it in all good faith. If, as has been suggested to me, there is a genuine problem involved here, then we should avail of the opportunity to resolve it in the context of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Deputy is presenting his case in all good faith but I still have difficulty satisfying myself in relation to the point he is making because oysters just do not <Col N="546" /> happen, they grow.  Whether one is talking of an old charter of rights or of the new system under a Roinn na Mara licence to operate an oyster bed, the ownership of the property which one might call sea property is clearly mapped out. Therefore, everybody knows, within their own oyster bed, what oysters are there.  Normally most of them would be growing oysters on a regular basis, putting seeds in all the time.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy wishes, we can have another look at the amendment between now and Report Stage.  I think it is probably more a matter for the Department of the Marine rather than for this legislation. It is something that I can have discussed between the Department of the Marine and the Department of Justice between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make some general comments in respect of the section, now that we have disposed of the amendments proposed by the various spokespersons in Opposition.  I want to mark my concern that while the Minister has, on each occasion, responded to the amendments by saying she is attempting to be as helpful and as receptive as possible in dealing with them, she has rejected each one in turn.  We have made no progress whatever in trying to convince her that the section is not all that it should be and it will not achieve all that we had hoped for or all that she claims it might achieve when passed into law. Nonetheless, it has to be conceded that it represents an improvement on existing law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Workers' Party do not intend to oppose it but we certainly must take the <Col N="547" /> opportunity to say that we are gravely disappointed with the way the Minister has handled our requests to her to consider amendment of the Bill.  Section 3, as it stands, and section 33 (1) of the Principal Act, once this is passed into law, will not be as effective a means of combating the handlers of stolen property as we would like it to be.  The Government are not being as earnest or as determined as they should be in dealing with what is a very anti-social activity in our community.  At the end of the day, those who are engaged in dishonest activities in this regard, will be sighing with relief, realising that the Government have won their way on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to be a bit cynical about the 14 years' imprisonment that is proposed in this Bill.  People who commit murder in this country do not even serve 14 years.  The proposal to fine people who are engaged in receiving stolen property should be more realistic and the sentence should be without remission.  Again I have to voice a certain amount of cynicism about a person who handles stolen property, knowing or believing it to be stolen property.  How do you prove that a person knows or believes it to be stolen property?  A person who is accused of that offence has only to sing dumb.  How do you prove it? Surely it should be inserted in the Bill that the onus should be on him to prove from where he received it.</P>

      <P>I was not here earlier when the question of compensation was being discussed.  The proposal in this regard is very laudable but who will pay the compensation?  How many people who are engaged in the business of crime have no assets or will be seen not to have assets?  Again the State, the suckling pig, will be called on to pay the compensation. Last week my car was broken into and the stereo and radio stolen from it.  In Dublin there is a whole sub-culture <Col N="548" /> engaged in the business of stolen property and people are living off it very well.  I have no difficulty with the imposition of strict sentences but some realism has to be introduced into the matter.</P>
      <P>One Deputy suggested earlier that prison is too expensive.  Prison can never be too expensive for people who are engaged full time in crime.  If people have assets, in addition to serving the prison term they should compensate the victims. It is very unrealistic to believe that the accused will pay compensation to the victims. What we are saying is that the State will pay yet again and therefore I have certain reservations about that.  If we are really going to pursue the accused, will that entail selling their homes in order to pay compensation to the hapless victims of crimes?  We have to be serious about this.  While I agree with the sentiments behind the Bill, I have doubts as to how it will work in practice.</P>

      <P>I believe that this section, the major section of the Bill, is an improvement on the existing law but a major opportunity has been missed to make it very much better.  I am not going to oppose the section because, as I have said, it is somewhat better than the existing, entirely unsatisfactory position.  It is proper to record my major reservations that this section does not go far enough and, as a consequence, a golden opportunity has been lost which would have enabled us to bring some of these godfathers of crime to book.  That about sums up my view in regard to this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the sake of completeness I should also raise the issue in regard to the portion of the section which shifts the legal burden of proof onto the accused.  On the face of it, I am not unhappy with it but the Law Reform Commission report states that they do not favour setting specific circumstances in which presumptions may be raised in the section constituting the offence.  They have this considered view based on constitutional implications. I mention it merely for the sake of completeness.  I would be happy, if the transfer of the onus of proof in the circumstances outlined in the Bill does <Col N="549" /> stand up constitutionally, to have it included but obviously if there is the slightest danger of a constitutional implication it behoves us as legislators to address our minds to it.</P>
    <P>When I raised this point on Second Stage I think Deputy McCartan did not consider that it was a constitutional problem. If that is the case, I would be very happy to agree with the transfer of the legal burden of proof as proposed in the section.  Overall, I would be prepared to let the section through as it stands.  I hope the Minister, between now and Report Stage, will give further consideration to the points raised.  We will again make an effort to make this provision a lot more effective and watertight.</P>

      <P>We have battled hard to gain some improvements in this the most important section of the Bill &mdash; the main reason the Bill was brought before us to deal with the new crime of handling &mdash; but we have failed in this respect. Nevertheless the position will be improved in that we will not have to rely on a Bill which was introduced many years ago.  The introduction of this new offence is an improvement.  We endeavoured to avail of the opportunity to further improve the Bill but we have failed in that respect.  Nevertheless the Bill will be an improvement and I do not intend to oppose this section on behalf of my party.  I hope the Minister will be a little more receptive to the reasonable arguments I believe will be made during the remainder of the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8b:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;(1)  Where in the prosecution of offences under section 3 of this Act possession by the accused has been proved to the satisfaction of the jury <Col N="550" /> or the court, within the meaning of the foregoing section, and that the goods have been unlawfully handled, and the accused has failed or refused to offer any reasonable explanation, upon which the jury or court may act, the court or jury may take such failure or refusal as a consideration in reaching a verdict of guilty against the accused.</P>
    <P>(2)  Nothing in this section shall be construed as lifting the general burden of proof of all matters from the prosecution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In my concluding remarks on the previous amendment I indicated that I thought the Government were showing a half-hearted attitude in dealing with the problem of the professional handler in our community.  This amendment will put that view fully to the test.  It proposes to insert a new section which will allow a jury who are presented with all other proven facts to have regard to an accused having remained silent and made no effort to address the facts when confronted with them.</P>
    <P>My amendment proposes that if in the prosecution of an offence for handling the prosecution are able to prove to the satisfaction of the court or jury that the goods were unlawfully handled, the accused was found in possession of them and he failed or refused to offer any reasonable explanation on which the court or jury could act, the court or jury could take such a failure or refusal into consideration in reaching a verdict of guilty against an accused.  The amendment is designed to address full square the resourceful and skilful crook or handler who knows that singing dumb in the face of incontrovertible facts is a good device which he or she should stand by. Say nothing and let the devil be damned is the good advice given by a lawyer to an accused in a police station.  Time and again in the prosecution of these offences we have seen that the failure to make an accused answerable for incontrovertible facts allows him the opportunity and benefit of silence.  We have also listened to judges in court advising the jury that it is a factor they should not bear in <Col N="551" /> mind because there is a universal right to remain silent and not to self-incriminate oneself.</P>
    <P>We must address the law in modern circumstances and modern circumstances tell us there is a difficulty in dealing with receivers and handlers.  For that reason we are purporting to redefine the law in its entirety in this Bill.  We have also introduced in previous legislation the concept of making it necessary to respond to circumstances when they present themselves.  Under the 1984 Act an accused is obliged to explain the circumstances whereby he or she is found in the possession of stolen goods, firearms or explosive substances.  If an accused fails to give an account a jury or court can have regard to this in the prosecution of offences under the 1984 Act.  The concept I am proposing here is not anything new.</P>
    <P>The amendment has been drafted at the suggestion of the Criminal Law Review Committee.  Their report suggests that one of the things which should be provided for in the scheme of a Bill is the raising of this entitlement of a jury to have regard to the silence, refusal or failure of an accused to offer any reasonable explanation in the face of other facts being proved.  It is for that reason I put forward my amendment.  I have dealt in the amendment with the constitutional reservations Deputy O'Keeffe referred to by suggesting in subsection (2) that nothing shall be construed as lifting the general burden of proof of all matters from the prosecution.  In other words, nothing in this section should require an accused to prove a case against himself. It merely says that if he or she elects to remain silent when found in the possession of stolen goods then a jury can be asked to have regard to that factor when they are ultimately sent to reach their verdict.  For that reason I believe my amendment should be supported.  I want to say without any hesitation that the position of the Government in regard to this amendment will illustrate one way or the other whether they are all serious in trying to firm up the law so that life will <Col N="552" /> be made harder and hotter for those who want to engage in receiving and handling stolen goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot of merit in the case made by Deputy McCartan. It is really a question of putting the Government to the test as to how serious they are in tackling the problems we have all spoken about and which have been highlighted in the Law Reform Commission's report.  It also puts the Government to the test about whether they give tuppence for what the Law Reform Commission say.  Even though the Minister for Justice paid tribute to the Law Reform Commission on Second Stage and implied that the Bill was brought forward as a result of the recommendations of the commission virtually all of their recommendations have been rejected.  That is no compliment to the commission who did such marvellous work by way of research, ultimately producing their final report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission thought it would tighten up the law if the kind of provision I was proposing was included in the Bill and they gave a draft outline of what they thought should be included.  Deputy McCartan quite frankly admitted that this is the precedent he used for his amendment.  If we delve a little further we find that the reason the commission recommended the inclusion of this provision is not because it substantially changes the law in any way, in fact it largely states the law, but they highlighted the fact that the law, as stated by the Court of Criminal Appeal, has been misinterpreted by the lower courts on a number of occasions.  I think it was largely for that reason that the commission thought it was appropriate that the matter be spelt out clearly in the Statute. They made it clear that while the onus of proof never leaves the prosecution and no legal or persuasive burden of proof is shifted onto an accused, possession will raise a presumption of fact which will shift an evidential burden onto an accused.  This matter was teased out in a number of decisions, including the Oglesby decision in the Court of Criminal <Col N="553" /> Appeal to which I referred.  The Law Reform Commission stated:</P>
    <P>We are satisfied that the Oglesby decision has occasionally been misunderstood by the courts.  Certain judges and district justices have, from time to time, interpreted the decision to mean that unexplained possession of recently stolen goods does not even raise a presumption of fact and have therefore acceded to applications for a direction.</P>
    <P>That statement was not put in lightly.  It points to an obvious escape route that has been used by a number of people who have been hauled before the courts by the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions.  That escape route has been pointed out to us and we would be criminally negligent if we did not ensure that it was sealed off straightaway.</P>
    <P>It will not be sufficient for the Minister to say in reply that that is the law, that all our amendment does is restate the existing law.  That is not the problem as highlighted in the commission's report. We will be testing the sincerity of the Government on this amendment.  There seems to be no reason why the amendment, or the principle of it, should not be taken on board.  I strongly endorse the views expressed by Deputy McCartan and I should like to urge the Minister to, to the minimum, accept the spirit of the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment covers the same ground as subsection (2) (b) of the new section 33 which makes it clear what the circumstances are in which an accused shall be taken to have known or believed that the property in question was stolen property.  Subsection (2) (b) is designed to meet the situation where the accused is proved to have acquired the stolen property but denies that he or she knew or believed <Col N="554" /> that it was stolen and, perhaps, says that he or she thought it was smuggled.  It is proposed to place an evidential rather than a persuasive burden on the accused in such an instance to show that he or she did not know or believe that the property was stolen.  This is as recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  In placing an evidential burden on the accused in such cases it is following the precedent of section 8 of the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act, 1976 which inserted a new section 27 (a) in the Firearms Act, 1964, under which a person is guilty of an offence if he has a firearm or ammunition in his possession or under his control in such circumstances as to give rise to a reasonable inference that he has not got it in his possession or under his control for a lawful purpose, unless he has it in his possession or under his control for a lawful purpose, unless he has it in his possession or under his control for a lawful purpose.</P>
      <P>If the prosecution in a handling case proves the possession or control of the stolen property in suspicious circumstances and the accused puts forward an innocent explanation it will be for him to adduce evidence sufficient to raise an issue fit for consideration as to the innocence of his receipt of the property in question.  If he fails to do so he will be taken as having known or believed that the property was stolen.  &ldquo;Believing&rdquo; will have the extended meaning here of thinking that the property was probably stolen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subsection sets out in clear terms that where a person does anything with stolen property which, if done dishonestly, would constitute handling, in circumstances where it is reasonable to conclude that he or she knew or believed that the property in question was stolen, then he or she shall be taken to have so known or believed.  The exception to this is where the court or jury is satisfied on the basis of all the evidence, that there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused knew or believed that the property was stolen.  The purpose of this provision is to set out in clear terms that the knowledge or belief, which is a necessary ingredient of the offence of handling, can <Col N="555" /> in appropriate cases be inferred from the accused's actions in receiving the stolen goods, or in doing any of the other things that would constitute a handling offence. It is designed to give effect to the Law Reform Commission's recommendation in the general scheme of their report, at page 118.  Neither of the Deputies has persuaded me that their approach has anything more to recommend it than that which is contained in the Bill.  Accordingly, I am opposing the amendment.</P>

      <P>Up to now I was given to expressing feelings of disapointmnent but the Minister is pushing me in the direction of becoming somewhat annoyed with the attitude she has adopted.  If she is to borrow from the commission's scheme of things perhaps she will take on board their recommendation which I included in my amendment, the avoidance of doubt.  The Minister said the matter is covered under section 3 and, therefore, that there is no departure between us in principle but I wonder why she has not included a provision along the lines of my amendment. It will not take from the Bill, or the principles being pursued by the Minister in it.  It will do what the Law Reform Commission suggested that we should do, it will avoid any doubt that might arise in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission set out different headings and then sought to go a step further in the general area of section 3 and in the definition of <i>mens rea.</i> However, the <Col N="556" /> Minister has not gone as far as the commission in the definition area.  She has jettisoned the concept of recklessness as a basis.  The commission were firmer than the Minister in regard to this, but they felt there was a need to clear up the issue and avoid doubt.  They addressed the problem of interpretation that has arisen time and again in the working of this law, in the context of Oglesby and the <i>mens rea</i> element.  What they have suggested is not sloppy; it is sure, firm and certain.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us that subsection (2) (b) of the new section 33 covers the matter and, consequently, a person who offers an innocent explanation will be thrown against the test laid down, such as could the person have possibly believed or thought that the property was innocently obtained in the circumstances. The Minister went on to say that the failure to offer an innocent explanation would automatically mean that a finding would be laid against him, that because a person remained silent he or she would be presumed to have thought that the goods were improperly obtained.  I do not think that follows at all.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that a court in construing that section will take the step that silence by definition means that the person was thinking, or must have been thinking, that the goods were stolen.  It is for that reason I am proposing this amendment which would enable the jury to at least draw on or act upon the fact of silence and no more to allow them have regard to that when all other matters have been proved to their satisfaction and beyond doubt.  It does not address the case where a person offers an explanation but rather the case where the person simply remains dumb.  That is the situation borrowed most on in reality by the more skilful and resourceful and by those who have their brief in tow and who have been advised by their lawyer either in advance or on being interviewed by him in the police station to say nothing, to wait and see what happens when the evidence has been fully assembled and the case is made against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot for the life of me understand why, when there is no disagreement <Col N="557" /> between us in principle, when the Minister maintains one inference from section 3 and I say I have worries about it as do the Law Reform Commission, she cannot take the little step of including this small amendment to show that a firm view is being taken on this area and that we are prepared to make life difficult for the handler.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but let me point out that I have already explained that it is included in subsection (2) (b) of the new section 33 and that it is not necessary to include it again.  Does the Deputy accept that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the Minister I do not think subsection (2) (b) is all that she makes it out to be.  That is why I seek to amend it, in conjunction with the early major amendments in regard to recklessness.  I am saying that in practice the courts seek to resolve all doubt which is their duty in some regards in interpreting penal statutes in favour of the accused.  Because of the way the 1916 Act has been interpreted we are now at the stage where urgent amending legislation is required.  We have to concede that the courts in construing the provision of the 1916 Act have rendered it almost unworkable and an ass.  It is possible that they will do exactly the same with subsection (2) (b).  I agree with the Minister that this could be covered by subsection (2) (b) but I believe the judicial interpretation will be more in favour of the accused and that in time this will work to exclude the instance of silence.  I am trying to address that factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I understand the Minister's line of reasoning, it is that silence will by definition be construed by the courts as representing a thought in the mind of the accused that he or she did think it may have been stolen property.  This is taking a step and a leap which I do not believe <Col N="558" /> the courts will take and it is for that reason I am suggesting we address the issue of silence directly.  In my amendment I state that where possession has been proved and where theft has been proved beyond doubt the failure of the accused to give an explanation should be considered.  I wish to make the point that I do not believe the courts will interpret silence, in the context of subsection (2) (b), as representing a belief on their part that the accused had to be thinking that the goods were stolen.  I do not accept that proposition at all.</P>
    <P>What I think the courts will say is that the accused has the right to remain silent, that there is no onus on the accused to make any comment good, bad or indifferent and that the members of a jury should not draw any inference good, bad or indifferent from that silence.  That is what happens at present and I do not see anything in subsection (2) which would lead us to believe that it will be otherwise. Silence will not be construed in such a way as to allow the jury infer that the accused was thinking or should have been thinking that the goods were stolen.  As judges point out constantly to juries, there are many circumstances where an accused might well want to remain silent. He or she might be unsure of the law, their legal rights or their position and they might well like to wait for another day to give their explanation.  In order to deal with this issue and avoid confusion, which the Law Reform Commission have highlighted, and I agree with them, we should address this matter full square. That is all my amendment seeks to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I also have a difficulty with this one.  I agree with what Deputy McCartan has said.  The right to silence in a criminal case is a joke.  I do not know how a judge or a jury can work on presumptions.  A person should not have the right to silence.  They should be made to state their case.  How is the State going to prove that a receiver knowingly received stolen goods if the accused person remains silent?  I do not believe that anyone charged in a criminal case should have the right to silence.</P>

The object of that addendum is to put flesh on the bones of the Fine Gael motion which the Labour Party wholeheartedly supports and to spell out some of the specifics of the crisis that faces people with a mental handicap. Quite clearly that crisis exists and it is of the utmost importance that the Minister recognises that and spells out clearly to the House the steps he proposes to take to deal with those who unfortunately have a mental handicap, and those carers who are trying to look after the people so striken, whether they be family members or others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister for Health is not here because before dealing with the specifics I will refer briefly to the speech made by the Minister in this House last night.  The Minister talked at some length about the money being spent on the services for the handicapped and sought to give the impression that a huge sum was already available to ensure that the right to a full life is being delivered to all afflicted with mental handicap.  What the Minister did not say is that the sum of money he talked about included every penny spent on services for the physically handicapped as well as for the mentally handicapped, including people who are deaf, blind and handicapped in numerous other ways.  The Minister did not say that the money included allowances paid to mothers who keep their children at home or that those mothers could have their allowances removed if their child or children had to spend a period in hospital. The Minister did not say that in many cases the payment of that allowance is <Col N="562" /> dependent on an annual medical check to certify to the satisfaction of the Department that the mentally handicapped person in their care has not been cured &mdash; as if there was a cure for mental handicap.  Neither did the Minister say that the money includes the disabled persons' maintenance allowance which is paid to all handicapped and disabled people, nor that they could lose that allowance if the sheltered workshop that employs them pays out more than around £10 a week.  I am glad the Minister has arrived for the end of my comments on his speech last night.  In short, as we have come to expect from this Minister, the figures he used were misleading and incomplete but, in a sense that does not matter.  Whatever he is spending at the moment is not enough and there is ample evidence that that is a fact.  The Minister knows that as well as any other Member of this House.</P>
    <P>Last night I attended a meeting of the parents association for people with a mental handicap in the Mansion House, a few short yards from this building.  It was attended by almost 1,000 people, including quite a few Members of this House.  Those of us who were there could see the pain and hardship at first hand and we could see the anger that had driven mothers and fathers to the point where they are going to march on the streets of Dublin next Friday to demand their rights.  We could see the shame that we who call ourselves a Christian people, who often refer to the mentally handicapped as being special, should reach a stage where this group of parents find themselves reduced to street tactics in the face of indifferent and intransigent policy makers.  Words are not adequate to convey the pain and despair and the feeling of hopelessness that was expressed so eloquently by the carers and parents last night in the Mansion House.  These people felt they were a forgotten people. In organising last night's meeting the parents' association issued a press release which summed up well the anger they feel.  That press release should be read into the record and I propose to do just that.  It reads as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="563" /> People with a mental handicap are often called special.  Why?  Is it because people with a mental handicap never complain, never protest, never march? Is it because the families of people with a mental handicap are prepared to carry whatever burden the State is unwilling to share?  Is it because people with a mental handicap can be safely ignored whenever employment policy is being drawn up?  Is it because the families of people with a mental handicap cannot afford to die, because there is no provision for their children &mdash; and even find it difficult to emigrate, because there are countries that don't want to let them in?</P>
    <P>Everyone involved in the provision of services for people with a mental handicap recognises that a crisis now exists in the range and quality of service on offer to our sons and daughters. This crisis has been brought about by the failure of Government and the responsible agencies to provide and allocate the necessary financial resources to the services for our children. The absence of a planned and comprehensive programme has left us with no choice but to raise our voices in public protest.  We are determined that our children's rights will become Government priorities.</P>
    <P>Our children, who range in age from the very young to well into adulthood, face &mdash; and will continue to face &mdash; cutbacks in Education and Training, open and Sheltered Workshops, Breakaway and Crisis Intervention facilities and Residential Centres.  We are demanding urgent action on behalf of our children &mdash; the needs of people with a mental handicap must become a priority.  The Government must act now, to make available the funding necessary to end the waiting lists.</P>
    <P>Parents are angry.  We face a total lack of action &mdash; and even awareness &mdash; from our elected respresentatives. According to the most up-to-date figures available from the Eastern Health Board, a total of 328 residential places <Col N="564" /> are needed now.  In the years after 1990, a further 567 places will be needed.</P>
    <P>And residential facilities are only a part of the problem.  In the areas of training, education, and employment facilities, the crisis is growing.  In all of these areas, the rights of people with a mental handicap have taken second place to the needs of Government book-keeping.  Even now, when money is becoming available for Health, that money is being spent only in the country's general hospitals.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence of any extra current money being made available in the 1990 Health Estimate just published; the capital allocation for Health has been reduced &mdash; and the demand for new residential places for people with a mental handicap will have to compete with all sorts of other demands for a share of that reduced money; the financial allocations made for Education include no provision for alleviating the growing crisis of staffing in special national schools for people with a mental handicap.</P>
    <P>We are determined that all this must change.  We aim to generate a climate where the hardship being suffered by people with a mental handicap, and their families, will no longer be tolerated. Our goal is to place the issue of mental handicap where it belongs &mdash; at the top of the political priority list. We won't settle for less.</P>
    <P>That is more than a plea from the heart of concerned parents &mdash; it is a demand for rights, rights that are enshrined in a United Nations declaration but which have never been enshrined in any national legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said last night that legislation to give specific rights to persons with a mental handicap is being considered. I hope the Minister will not linger long in his considerations and that finally we will have rights for mentally handicapped people enshrined in legislation.</P>
    <P>Before going on to deal with those rights, it is necessary to spell out some of the specific problems that exist in this <Col N="565" /> area and which, taken together, add up to the crisis that people with a mental handicap face.</P>
    <P>The most worrying feature of the crisis in mental handicap is that there is little or no planning for the future.  A great deal of lip service is paid to the concept of planning, but the reality is that the agencies and their staffs in the fields are too busy dealing with the crisis in current services, and worrying about next year's financial allocations, to be able to look ahead.  The human hardship involved in mental handicap will get a good deal worse unless planning starts now, and the development of plans must take place in the knowledge that resources will become available.</P>
    <P>That is why it is imperative that the Minister for Finance and the Government should commit themselves now, for a period of years, to improving the funding available in the area of mental handicap. In return, the agencies in the field should come together to ensure that all extra funding is spent in a rational, planned, and co-ordinated way, in addressing the following crisis points.</P>
    <P>It has always been difficult up to now to establish exactly what the scale of the problem of residential places is.  Estimates have varied, and data about waiting lists has been difficult to assemble. Because there is a high degree of overlap between waiting lists, the mentally handicapped person in Dublin who is seeking a residential place, for example, can be named on up to five different waiting lists.  But now at last there is reliable information in the Eastern Health Board area, and while we wait for similar information to be available for the rest of the country, it is reasonable to calculate the scale of the problem by extrapolating from the Eastern Health Board area figures.</P>
    <P>According to Estimates prepared by the Eastern Health Board, 328 residential places are required for persons with a mental handicap in the Eastern Health Board area alone, and they are needed immediately, with a further 567 places needed in the years after 1990; <Col N="566" /> at least 1,000 residential places will be needed in the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Residential places are required in cases where the severity of the condition is such that the person is incapable of being cared for at home, or where parents are ill or aging.  It may seem unbelievable in this day, but many hundreds of families in Dublin alone are in the position where they are afraid to become ill, for fear of what might happen to their child.  There are now cases where mentally handicapped people are living alone; where mothers of 70 are trying to cope with 40 year old handicapped sons, where parents have not had an unbroken night's sleep in years.</P>
    <P>These are only some examples.  But what has happened in terms of the provision of new places?  Last year, in the Dublin area, between ten and 20 additional residential places became available to cope with a demand that outstripped supply by a ratio of 50:1.  One of the largest full-time residential centres in Dublin has been unable to admit a new patient for four years, and recently had to approach some of its parents asking them to take their children &mdash; aged from 12 to 40 &mdash; home for long weekends, to enable the institution to cut down on staffing costs.  The last new centre built in Dublin was opened five years ago.  If new places become available in the short term, the likelihood is that they will be used to transfer mentally handicapped people out of psychiatric institutions. Those in the community will continue to wait.</P>
    <P>That is what is happening.  If that is to be the future, then the future is very bleak.  There is an imperative need for an investment programme in new residential places.  Clearly, such centres must be purpose built, equipped and staffed to the highest levels.  For the eastern region alone, a capital programme of £10 million a year for the next five years is the minimum that is essential.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive range of services must be developed within catchment areas to deal with the needs of families who are under stress.  Day care centres, crisis intervention facilities, &ldquo;breakaway <Col N="567" /> units&rdquo; to enable families to take holidays are all desperately needed.  It is a fallacy to believe that families can always cope with cases of mental handicap without any back-up from the community.  Even though policy makers pay lip service to the need for back-up, any family who needs help finds it very difficult to find a place, even for a week.</P>
    <P>In the eastern region alone, there are 6,000 mentally handicapped people living in the community.  By and large, that means that there are 6,000 families coping with degrees of stress ranging from mild to profound.  The Eastern Health Board have outlined, for each community care area, the staffing and capital requirements necessary.  They estimated, for instance, that in 1987 a capital outlay of £8 million extra would be required to put essential mental handicap services in place.  Qualified extra staff, at an extra cost of £1 million, would be needed also.  In fact, nothing extra was spent in 1987, 1988 or 1989, and so far, nothing extra has been provided for 1990.</P>
    <P>Special schools for the mentally handicapped are staffed by teachers and teachers aides whose salaries are paid, in the main, by the Department of Education. No distinction has been made between these schools and ordinary national schools when it came to the educational cutbacks.  The consequence has been that in many if not most special schools there are now staff shortages.  Teachers and teachers aides who have left, were not replaced.</P>
    <P>The extra demands involved in teaching mentally handicapped young people to help them to maximise their potential, has given rise to the appalling possibility that many special schools are in danger of becoming child minding centres with teachers under too much stress to be able to devote the time needed to get the best from their pupils.  Surely no-one would deny that a special case can be made for protecting special schools from cutbacks? Why are they called special, and why must special people bear the same burden of financial rectitude as the rest of the community?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="568" /> A domiciliary care allowance is paid to the mother of a mentally handicapped child living at home up to the age of 16. That allowance, at present £79 a month, is intended to compensate her for the full-time care she gives her child.  Surely in this day and age it is possible to improve on this meagre and inadequate allowance. I am anxious to give some time to Deputy Garland so I will bring my own contribution to a rapid conclusion, although I have much more to say.</P>
    <P>I have listed some of the entirely legitimate demands of the community of families who serve the mentally handicapped. None of them is outrageous or unreasonable. If we call ourselves a civilised society we will recognise that people with a mental handicap have the same rights as anybody else, even if it costs more to ensure that these rights are properly delivered.</P>
    <P>I tell the Minister the parents' association for people with a mental handicap have chosen a theme, a slogan, which is &ldquo;Unlock their rights.&rdquo; The Minister has in his hand the key to unlock the rights of those mentally handicapped people and their families and I urge him tonight to use that key and unlock those rights.</P>

      <P>I would like to express my broad support for this motion and for the Labour Party amendment.  The Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, place great emphasis on community health with community participation, and in this regard mental health is no different.  We need strong Government commitment, planning and funding together with vital community involvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied from talking with the parents' association for people with a mental handicap that the level of State services in this area is totally inadequate <Col N="569" /> to provide a reasonable standard of care for the mentally handicapped.  Everyone in this House is aware of the need for restraint in the area of Government spending, nevertheless I am satisfied that the parents' association have an unanswerable case for increased State spending in this area.  After all, have they not paid their taxes over the years?  I submit that, having paid these taxes, they are entitled to reasonable services in this area.</P>
    <P>The main reason sufficient money is not readily available is the scandalous profligacy displayed by successive Governments over the last 20 years or so. Apart from anything else, there are many examples of waste, inefficiency and feather-bedding in the Estimates for Public Services for 1990, just published.  For example, the IDA are to receive £108 million for next year.  A large proportion of this enormous sum will be used to attract many totally unsuitable projects to this country.  If a small fraction of this amount were to be reallocated from the Department of Industry and Commerce to the Department of Health this problem could, to a large extent, be solved.</P>
    <P>Wexford county provides us with a good role model for the rest of the country where services for the mentally handicapped are comprehensive and co-ordinated and nearly adequate, community participation and community help being at the core of their success.  The single most important concern is for a national plan to take cognisance of the need for appropriate care.  While recognising the need for an increase in funding provided, we feel vast amounts of money are not necessarily what is required but what moneys are available should be targeted for the appropriate services, an investment in people rather than in buildings and technology.</P>
    <P>The latest report on the handicapped services shows that more than 2,000 people cared for in the community need residential care and a similar number of people in residential care could be cared for within the community if the community services were adequately developed.  A large institution with its <Col N="570" /> accompanying clinical environment is not the most suitable place for these people. People with a mental handicap have a right to normal patterns of life in the community as far as is possible.  They need to participate in and be respected as members of society.  They need to be cared for in their own homes or in substitute family type homes.</P>

      <P>I would like to express my appreciation of an opportunity to contribute to this debate and to compliment Deputy Howlin on a very forceful speech, much of which we would all agree with.  However, perhaps it is a <Col N="571" /> little unfair to be so critical of the performance of the present Government, especially the present Minister for Health, in regard to treatment of the mentally handicapped.  Unlike probably any other area of administration in the State, the Minister for Health has succeeded in ensuring that cutbacks which applied all over the place did not apply to the area of mental handicap.  He is to be complimented on that.  Perhaps it did not come across in Deputy Howlin's speech.</P>
      <P>I would like to correct Deputy Howlin. He said the Minister had misled the House last night.  This was wrong.  The £130 million is for services for mentally handicapped persons and does not include the physically handicapped or allowances for handicapped persons.  I would like to stitch that into the record.</P>
      <P>I think it is fair to say that everyone, especially the Minister for Health and the Minister for Education who are charged with this responsibility, would agree that we would all like to see more resources. Of all the areas of care probably mental handicap is one where the maximum resources possible should be provided. All politicians would agree that it touches the heart and consequently deserves the maximum possible support.  Within all the constraints this Government, and especially those two Ministers, have tried to ensure that all possible resources have been made available for the mentally handicapped.  Deputy Howlin produced a nice little phrase asking the Minister to use the key to unlock the rights of the mentally handicapped.  Let me make the point that in the education area we have to look around for quite some time to find the key following on a four-year period of the Deputy's party being in Government. I will give some examples of that in a few minutes.  It is wrong for Deputy Howlin to come in here this evening and make a speech without reference to his own party's period in Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that the speech he made was very honourable but he totally forgot about the period when he himself had an opportunity to do something about the things he talked about.</P>
      <P>My Department reject the suggestion that they provide inadequately for the education needs of the mentally handicapped. Special schools and special classes in ordinary national schools in which mentally handicapped pupils are enrolled, are generously staffed and funded.  The total expenditure by my Department for the provision of teachers, equipment, school transport and other services is about £15.6 million per annum.</P>
      <P>The Department recognise three different categories of mental handicap from an education point of view.  Firstly, there are pupils who are termed mildly mentally handicapped and are often referred to as slow learners.  Secondly, there are moderately mentally handicapped children and thirdly, the severely mentally handicapped pupils.  Obviously, the fundamental education needs of each category vary.  This is reflected in the curricula and the pupil-teacher ratio pertaining to each category.  The Department rely on a recent psychologist's report in order to establish the needs of any mentally handicapped child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until quite recently the provision for all categories of handicapped children was made predominantly in special national schools.  As a result mentally handicapped children, like other categories of handicapped pupils, were for the most part, educated in isolation from their peers and some aspects of their social development suffered as a result. Bearing this in mind and taking cognisance of the most recent findings, policy <Col N="573" /> orientation has shifted towards catering for these pupils in ordinary national schools as far as possible.  The number of children in each special class is very much smaller than in the ordinary classes in primary schools.  This reflects the additional individual attention needed by mentally handicapped children in general.</P>
    <P>The current pupil-teacher ratio pertaining to mildly mentally handicapped pupils is 16 pupils to one teacher and for moderately and severely handicapped 12 children to one teacher.  However, I must stress that the pupil-teacher ratios relating to the mentally handicapped are not as rigorously enforced as those in the ordinary national schools because of the special needs of this category of pupils. It can be appreciated readily by the House that the ability of levels of mentally handicapped children varies considerably. This factor demands that there be flexibility in order to provide facilities to cater appropriately for the individual needs of every mentally handicapped pupil.  Notwithstanding the strong policy bias that will apply in future towards integration of mentally handicapped pupils in ordinary national schools, there will always be a need for specialist educational facilities to be provided in central establishments, particularly for children with severe handicap who require a particularly large investment in staff and equipment.</P>
    <P>Submissions have been made in recent times to the Department regarding the issue, and promoting the idea, that there should be full integration of handicapped children into the mainstream of ordinary national schools.  My Department are favourably disposed towards the general trend in favour of integration and believe that the same attitude is shared by the vast majority of teachers and boards of management of ordinary national schools.</P>
    <P>I now propose to give some details on the existing facilities being provided by my Department to children with mild, moderate and severe mental handicap, to refer to the extensive school transport service which is provided and, finally, <Col N="574" /> to conclude with some analysis of the finances devoted by my Department to their education.  As previously stated, the pupils who are mildly mentally handicapped are often referred to, in everyday terms, as slow learners.  Generally, these pupils would have attained an intelligence quotient in the range of 70 to 100 when psychologically assessed.  There are currently 32 special schools employing over 250 teachers, located nationwide, catering for 3,840 pupils.  These schools were established when centralised education for the mentally handicapped was in vogue.  In addition to this and with a view to integration, my Department have established 154 special classes, employing 154 special teachers attached to ordinary national schools &mdash; 90 of the latter are situated in Dublin, while Munster accounts for 22, Ulster 14, Connacht six and the rest of Leinster, 22.  We would readily accept that there is a requirement for many more such special classes.</P>
    <P>When pupils are geographically dispersed, greater difficulties arise in establishing a special class because of transportation cost and logistics.  Special classes in ordinary national schools cater for 1,850 children.  Therefore, for the total population of 5,700 mildly mentally handicapped pupils, we can note with satisfaction that 48 per cent, or nearly half, are partly integrated into ordinary primary school facilities.</P>
    <P>The moderately mental handicap children tend to have an intelligence quotient in the range of 50 to 70.  The Department have sanctioned 33 special schools catering for 2,250 children.  As might be expected the degree of integration into the ordinary schools has been slower than that observed in the case of mildly mental handicap pupils as witnessed by the small number of special classes &mdash; nine have been established nationwide.  Only 2.6 per cent of the moderately handicapped pupils, therefore, have achieved anything like integration into the ordinary national school system.  The curriculum review board are expected to report shortly on the feasibility of achieving a greater <Col N="575" /> degree of integration.  In respect of moderately handicapped pupils, my Department recently completed a curriculum specially to cater for the needs of these people.</P>
    <P>With regard to severe mental handicap in 1985 a detailed report called, The Education and Training of Severely and Profoundly Mentally Handicapped Children in Ireland 1983, my Department established ten special classes to cater for pupils who are severely and profoundly mentally handicapped.  This was a very progressive step and placed us in the vanguard of educational provision for these children.  There are 17 classes in existence at present.  These are attached, for administrative purposes, to special schools.  However, some of these are physically located in local health centres.</P>
    <P>School transport for the mentally handicapped is another area where we have attached significant attention.  The geographical and dispersion aspect results in the average cost of providing transport for a mentally handicapped child to his or her nearest school to be significantly higher than for ordinary pupils.  On average it is about three times as expensive to transport a pupil to a special school or class as it is to transport an ordinary pupil to school.  In keeping with my Department's policy in favouring day school rather than residential facilities, every effort is made to provide daily transport, despite the long and costly distances involved.  The extra costs involved are reflected in the disproportionate amount of money on transporting mentally handicapped pupils in relation to the total allocation for school transport.  For instance, in 1988 out of £28 million allocated for school transport, over £3 million was spent on the transportation of mentally handicapped pupils.</P>
    <P>The full impact of the magnitude of this expenditure can be appreciated when it is realised that whereas the mentally handicapped receiving transport account for 11 per cent of total expenditure on the service, they only account for 4 per cent of the number of pupils in receipt of that transport.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="576" /> Finance for education of the mentally handicapped is, indeed, relatively strong and some general analysis is as follows. The special provision made by my Department in favour of children with any form of mental handicap is clearly illustrated by the expenditure levels on their education at primary level in 1988. The following clearly illustrates this point.  My Department spent over £10 million on full-time teachers in special classes and in special schools.  In addition, £1.5 million was spent on various part-time teacher services in the special schools.  My Department incurred expenditure of £3 million approximately in transporting pupils to special schools and classes.  My Department spent nearly £400,000 in the provision of child care assistants in special schools.  These child care assistants assist the special school teachers.  Despite all this, I am the first to admit that we would be much happier to be in a position to put more money into this area.  We are constantly under pressure from people and from parents of children to respond to demands for more resources.  We are particularly keen to try to provide for more child care assistants which we accept are needed in the special schools.</P>
    <P>We are particularly anxious to provide for a more comprehensive transport system than that provided.  We are conscious of a considerable amount of hardship suffered by parents of mentally handicapped children who have to travel many miles to pick up points in order to catch the special transport that is made available.  I am conscious of sad individual cases throughout the country where parents have to travel five and six miles to catch a bus and travel back in the evening to collect the child.</P>
    <P>I should like to inform the House that we are endeavouring to provide a transport system which will, as far as possible, accommodate the needs of those children and make travelling more appropriate to their needs.  This is a huge problem because of the dispersed nature of the transport.  Often a bus can travel up to 100 miles collecting children in a very <Col N="577" /> dispersed area.  However, we are reviewing this whole area and looking for further initiatives where we can be of greater assistance to parents who are under a considerable amount of pressure.</P>
    <P>In regard to the school building programme, we have laid special emphasis in the past two years on the provision of improved accommodation at our special schools.  I do not want to hark back to Deputy Howlin, but I should like to mention the example to which I referred when I talked about trying to find the key. A special school, St. Joseph's, Galway, made up of prefabricated classrooms should have been demolished at least five years ago as it was in a diabolical condition, but we are only now getting round to providing a new school there because of the lack of planning or progress in that regard.  It would not be fair to lay all the blame for the existing difficulties at the door of the Government, the Minister or myself.  We inherited some difficulties but I assure the House that we will continue to tackle those difficulties and give priority to the improvement of accommodation in special schools and to the development of more special schools where they are required.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned previously, in excess of £15.6 million of non-capital funds was expended on the mentally handicapped under all headings at primary school level during 1988.  My Department also made special teacher provision for the education of mildly mentally handicapped pupils in some secondary, vocational, community and comprehensive schools at a cost of £1 million.  The educational needs of mentally handicapped pupils are comprehensively and generously provided for by my Department and we are determined to do more.  Furthermore, the Department will continually review the present arrangements for the delivery of that educational service over future years to ensure its cost effectiveness and suitability in the light of the most up to date policies directed at assisting handicapped persons to derive the maximum benefit for their own personal development in the educational system.</P>
    <P>On the initiative of the Minister for <Col N="578" /> Education, for the first time we have put major money into sport for the mentally handicapped in the last two years.  The greatest increase in the amount of money from our sports budget in the past two years has been towards the provision of sports facilities and opportunities for the mentally handicapped, which is evidenced by the amount of money we have given to the Special Olympics in the last two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for allowing me five minutes of his time. I want to deal with one or two points which occurred to me as a general practitioner and a TD.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister and the House to consider the plight of parents of mentally handicapped people.  I use the word &ldquo;people&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;children&rdquo; because, with advances in modern medicine, the life span of the mentally handicapped is comparable to that of the general population.  Parents are worried about what will happen to their children when they pass on.  There does not seem to be a mechanism in place which will satisfactorily resolve this problem.  Their child has been brought up in a family setting and is used to the normal conduct of family life.  He or she is accepted and becomes part of the normal family but the parents' worry is that when they are gone there will not be any support mechanisms or family, other than institutional care, for their child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a difficult question to deal with because you are talking about very personal problems of care, property disposal, etc.  Will the Minister set up a working party or some other mechanism to look at the problems which will become more acute and numerous in future?  To take any person &mdash; not alone a mentally handicapped person &mdash; out of their home after 40 years or so and put them into an institution can cause them grave upset and retard their development. This problem should be looked <Col N="579" /> at with a view to leaving the mentally handicapped child in the home in which he or she was brought up and providing support services.  It is not an easy question and it will require sophistication and sensitivity in dealing with it.  I look forward to hearing the comments of Members on this point.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned my constituency and I join him in praising the nuns in St.  Vincent's who manage the best home in the country for the mentally handicapped.  They have managed, with care and sensitivity, to move many children and adults to the community and provide support services for them.</P>
    <P>I ask the board of Cheeverstown Hospital to kindly get down to business and resolve the problem which is denying care to mentally handicapped children.  It is becoming a scandal, not alone in the Eastern Health Board area, but nationally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Minister Fahey for giving me five minutes of his time, it is appreciated.  Proper development of services for the mentally handicapped have seen very little growth since 1980. Accordingly, we now have to confront the fall-out of a decade of scandalous neglect, but confront it we must.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the field of human suffering nothing can equal the anguish of middle-aged parents struggling with the problems of a mentally handicapped child, and very often left without help or hope.  They do not know where to turn or what the future holds for their child when they have passed away.  This nightmare cannot be allowed to continue.  In many instances the health boards have failed to play their part.  I will give an example in my own area.  A little over two years ago, when it became obvious to everybody that Our Lady's Hospital, Lee Road, was no longer fit for human habitation the Brothers at Upton offered to take 30 psychiatric patients and look after them in a civilised environment.  However, the health board did not provide the money to make that transfer possible.  That is a sad indictment of the priorities of some <Col N="580" /> of our health boards.  Indeed, it can be rightly said but for the extraordinary efforts of groups like the Cope Foundation, Cork, which grew out of Cork Polio, the Brothers of Charity at Lota, those who run St. Francis' Training Centre and the many excellent rehabilitation centres throughout the country, the plight of people suffering mental handicap and their parents would be infinitely worse than it is today.  It is only fit and proper that we pay tribute to those groups this evening.  Our task is not to decry what has happened in the past but to chart a course for the future.  The training for open employment is funded mainly from the EC Social Funds for a limited three year period, but despite the trojan efforts on the parts of the staff of the rehabilitation centres, it has failed to achieve its task.  Despite the best efforts of the placement officers, work is not available for the trainees of these centres and they are finding it impossible to cope with the large numbers of people who are looking for jobs in the open market.</P>
    <P>We will have to place an increased emphasis on the provision of additional sheltered workshop places for handicapped persons.  I appeal to the Minister to address this task urgently.  In addition, there is a need for a large number of places in residential care.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that provision is made for mentally handicapped persons to have short stays in residential care so as to enable their exhausted parents to get a break now and then.  If the mentally handicapped people could take a break away from home for a week or so, this would be an enormous benefit to their mothers.  This could be provided without a huge charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Education has a major role to play in the care of the handicapped, and in this respect I am glad to see that the Minister of State at the Department of Education is present.  I want to remind him again, although he has adverted to this fact himself, that the embargo on recruitment in the public service has led to the loss of a number of day care assistants in day care centres, and people who left on retirement, voluntary redundancy or whatever <Col N="581" /> were not replaced.  The Minister for Education will have to make an exception of this group and ask the Minister for Finance to lift the embargo in this instance, because an adequate number of day care assistants is vital in providing a minimum level of care in day care centres. Equally, we need to provide more speech therapists and physiotherapists in the existing centres and in the centres that will be provided.  I know that this costs a great deal of money but I do not think we can walk away from our responsibilities any longer.  Certainly I will be urging the Ministers from my own party to lend their support at the Cabinet table to the Minister for Health and Education in their efforts to secure an increased budget in order to provide a minimum decent level of service for the mentally handicapped so that the nineties do not parallel the eighties in regard to the neglect to which these people have been exposed.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for what he has said.  I urge both Minister to intensify their efforts to make proper and adequate care for mentally handicapped people a priority within the Departments of Health and Education in the decade ahead.  I am quite sure they will get support for that and I am confident that they will respond to that support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The hallmark of any civilised society is the way in which it treats the weakest and most vulnerable members &mdash; the old, the very young, the ill, the infirm and the handicapped. Judged against this yardstick, the policies of cutbacks in the health area pursued by successive Governments in recent years cast grave doubt over our right to describe ourselves as a civilised society, because it is these categories of people who have suffered most from Government economic policies.  For the past two years the Fianna Fáil Government have been listening to the economists, the stockbrokers and the bankers.  The media commentators have lavished praise on them for pruning the health budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> It is hard to think of a more vulnerable and defenceless group in society than the mentally handicapped, who are generally not in a position to defend themselves or to fight for better conditions or for medical care.  It is to our eternal shame as a society that not even the mentally handicapped have been spared from the lash of the cutbacks.</P>
    <P>We are happy to support the Fine Gael motion and, indeed, the Labour Party addendum which set out the extent of the problem and offer some suggestions for solutions.  We believe that the Government amendment, which speaks of the development of services for the mentally handicapped &ldquo;as budgetary circumstances permit&rdquo;, should be treated with utter contempt.  The message conveyed by the Government to the handicapped in this amendment is that they must wait for adequate treatment and adequate services and that as far as the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats administration is concerned, the demands of the internal bankers will take priority over the rights of the disabled. The fact that mentally handicapped people have not suffered even more has been largely due to the love and care lavished on them by their families and the trojan work done by the many voluntary organisations active in the area.  What angers and frustrates those involved voluntarily in the care of the handicapped, whether families or groups, is that the more work they do, the harder they try, the more content the Government seem to be to wash their hands of their obligations and load even more work and responsibility onto families or the voluntary sector.  The reality is, of course, that the extent of the problem is so great that families or voluntary organisations alone simply do not have the capacity or the resources to deal with the problem. The level of handicap suffered by some people is just so severe that institutional care will always be required.  Of course, the costs involved in caring for the handicapped and ensuring they get the treatment they need is enormous and requires substantial central funding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="584" /> The census of mental handicap undertaken in 1981 gives some indication of the extent of the problem. According to that census there were 12,304 persons suffering from mental handicap, ranging from moderate to profound.  In addition, there were found to be some 9,400 borderline or mildly mentally handicapped people.  What is of most concern is that, according to that census, more than 9,000, or three-quarters of the handicapped, were aged 34 or under.  The fact is that, with the improvement in medical science, people with mental handicap thankfully are living longer.  In turn that means they need care longer.  It is likely that that pattern has continued since that census was taken.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, as understanding of mental illness and mental handicap have improved, we have moved away from 19th century attitudes which saw such people as a public threat who should be locked up.  The whole trend in recent years has been away from institutional care, where such is possible and practicable, toward care in the community. The Green Paper on Services for Disabled People &mdash;<i>Towards a Full Life</i>&mdash; published in 1984, described the broad objective of services for those with physical, mental or sensorial handicap as being &ldquo;to equip them to realise their full potential and to participate to the greatest extent possible in the life of the community&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A document published by the Eastern Health Board in 1986 entitled <i>Specialist Services for the Mentally Handicapped</i> put it this way: &ldquo;a handicapped person should develop in an environment as normal as is practicable.&rdquo;  In this regard it is appropriate that mentally handicapped persons should be maintained in their homes as long as possible with appropriate support services and that facilities as near as possible to that domestic environment be available when handicapped persons can no longer be maintained at home.</P>
    <P>Of course, progress in this direction is possible only if adequate funds and resources are provided for families and <Col N="585" /> agencies endeavouring to cope with the effects of mental handicap.  According to the Commission on Health Funding the majority of the 2,000 mentally handicapped persons at present in psychiatric hospitals are suitable for transfer to community hospitals and residential centres and approximately 1,900 of the 5,000 in special residential centres require only hostel accommodation or, in some cases, day care.  What is happening is that the Government have been paying lip service to the principle of providing community care.  Institutional care is being starved of resources while community care services are not being developed to compensate.</P>
    <P>Of course, there will always be some patients who will require residential care. According to the parents association for people with a mental handicap, some 350 additional residential places are required in Dublin alone and an extra 800 places nationwide.  In addition an extra 1,000 day places are needed throughout the country.  The stark facts of their recent submission are very different from the rosy picture painted by the Minister for Health last evening and this evening by the Minister of State at the Department of Education.  Some of the points of that parents' association submission are worth quoting, amongst which are money cutbacks every year since 1982, with services being stretched to the limit, staff numbers down, skilled personnel leaving the country while children with mental handicap cannot get services; waiting lists are getting longer while lip service only is paid to community based services, leading to regression and a custodial type service.</P>
    <P>How long are the Government prepared to allow this appalling scenario to continue?  There are many facets of the problem which might be dealt with.  I want to refer specifically the lack of education for handicapped children due to insufficient places and staffing in special national schools.  All of the scientific and educational evidence shows that, in many cases, the impact of mental handicap can be lessened by proper educational stimulation.  Our Constitution contains much about education and the <Col N="586" /> rights and obligations to the State to the family.  For example, Article 42.4 states quite specifically that the State shall provide for free primary education &mdash; that means free primary education for all children; it does not exclude children with a mental handicap.  In the case of the handicapped, education delayed is education denied.  The State may well be in breach of its constitutional obligations by failing to provide proper educational facilities for mentally handicapped children.</P>
    <P>A related area is the crucial need for adequate speech therapy for those with mental handicap.  In many cases the effect of mental handicap is worsened by communication difficulties.  This is an area crying out for urgent action.  It has been estimated that approximately 20,000 people with mental handicap could benefit from speech therapy.  Yet some people must wait up to two years even to secure an appointment with a speech therapist.  To deal adequately with this problem alone would necessitate the appointment of some 400 speech therapists while the number available for such work with the handicapped is approximately 27.</P>
    <P>If the Minister or other members of the Cabinet were unaware of the extent of the problem facing the mentally handicapped and their families, in the light of this debate they can no longer make that claim.  The obligation is now clearly on the Government to act quickly and decisively. I have no doubt that if they do they will have the support of every Member of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening in the Mansion House &mdash; filled to capacity with over 800 people &mdash; a series of demands were made that the Department of Health must immediately take on board.  It is a pity the Minister was not present to hear the barely restrained anger, frustration and fears of those mothers, fathers and carers of people with a mental handicap. It is impossible to recreate, in this austere Chamber, reading from a prepared script, the heartfelt pleas summed up by a mother with a handicapped child who <Col N="587" /> spoke from the floor asking: is there anybody listening; will the politicians ever listen to our requests?  I am here this evening to ensure that their pleas have been heard.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have noted the litany of needs of people with a mental handicap. He will have heard Brother Lawrence Kearns of the Order of St. John of God and his Order's pleas on behalf of persons with a mental handicap.  The Minister will have heard the pleas of the parents association for people with a mental handicap.  He will have heard also from the Eastern Health Board who have drawn his attention to their need of 368 day service places and 328 residential service places.  Indeed, the Minister himself confirmed in the course of his remarks last evening that he is aware of the crisis.</P>
      <P>What the Order of St. John of God want to know, what the parents association for people with a mental handicap want to know, what the Eastern Health Board want to know and what I am demanding to know is, what is the Minister going to do about the crisis facing the mentally handicapped?  He is insulting their intelligence and mine by asking us this evening to vote on his amendment to the motion which reads that we should commend the efforts of the Minister for Health to improve the level of services available to mentally handicapped people.  Any person who has listened to this debate over the past two evenings who could vote to commend the Minister will be flying in the face of the demands of the carers and ignoring the plight of people with a mental handicap.  Indeed, their plight is a living indictment of the neglect of successive Governments, including the Fine Gael/Labour Coalition Government, of their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister and Cabinet to immediately address the whole range of their demands, including their educational requirements, the need for more and better training in both open and sheltered workshops, to assist, to fund and to develop breakaway and crisis intervention facilities and to ensure that people with a mental handicap are not <Col N="588" /> placed in psychiatric hospitals.  He should recognise that the needs of psychiatric patients are different from those of people with a mental handicap.</P>
    <P>I cannot over-emphasise the need for respite care and short-term crisis relief residential places.  The horrendous fears of parents who worry about pre-deceasing their handicapped children must be alleviated.  The Minister must cease to exploit the generosity of voluntary agencies, families and community volunteers by injecting sufficient money into the service so that the fear and loneliness of many, including those who are ageing prematurely from strain and worry, are alleviated.  The Minister must abolish waiting lists by providing adequate buildings and staff, estimated to cost £7 million in the Eastern Health Board area, alone, which represents one-third of our total population.</P>
    <P>While nobody would refuse funds from whatever source for this cause I should like to make a point about national lottery money being allocated to the mentally handicapped.  Adequate finance over the next three to five years to ensure the completion of the integrated development programmes I have outlined must be funded by the Exchequer, not based on the occasional crumbs from the sale of raffle tickets.  Persons with a mental handicap have their rights; they are not begging for charity.</P>
    <P>I shall sum up by saying that the Minister must introduce Supplementary Estimates in the next session, thus initiating the first step in the three to five year integrated development plan for people with a mental handicap.  There can be no more arguments advanced about the necessary resources not being available. For example, if the Government can allocate Dublin Corporation money to build the Parnell Street section of road costing £32 million per mile, along with hundreds of millions of pounds for other dubious roads schemes, then £7 million can be diverted from the requirements of the motor car to the Eastern Health Board for the care of human beings.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to record my personal thanks and appreciation to <Col N="589" /> all the carers of people with a mental handicap, but particularly to the voluntary workers at the Walkinstown association for the handicapped who do tireless work on behalf of those with a mental and physical handicap.  I must confess it was that group who introduced me initially to the plight of the mentally handicapped and I am forever grateful.  I am delighted to take this opportunity of representing their case in the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to make a few basic points.  Firstly, this should not be a party political matter.  This is a party political forum but an issue of this nature should not be party political.  I knew the Minister for a long time before I came into politics in this State.  I know him to be a humane man and I know he will deal with this matter in a way that indicates his humanity.  Secondly, I went to last night's meeting in the Mansion House attended by over 1,000 people.  I was very impressed by their restraint and their responsibility and also by their anger and militancy.  When listening to them, I understood why that was the case.  They were telling this House to do something about this issue about which they feel so impatient and so angry and I hope that message is getting across.</P>
      <P>A number of basic points were made at that meeting about the obvious concern of parents, particularly the parents of a handicapped child, as to what is to happen to that child in the future.  I share that concern as, I am sure, we all do.  The people at the meeting emphasised the importance of some statutory rights for their children and I underline that.  They talked about the fact that no education or assistance is available for their children to learn to read and write.  They pointed to the cutbacks and in particular illustrated that two and a half years had passed since one child had seen a speech therapist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="590" /> It was said that the mark of a civilised society is looking after the less well off, the poor and the deprived in that community. Traditionally I believe that this country, North and South, has much to answer for because its attitude to mental handicap has not been civilised, it has not been Catholic, it has not been Christian and it certainly has not been humane. This is not a poor country.  It is a matter of distributing the wealth that is available, and it is a matter of priorities.  The Minister should take it that Deputies on all sides of the House consider this matter to be a priority and he should act accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise the matter of mentally handicapped adults. Quite a few of these people are cared for by their parents but the situation will arise, and in many cases sooner rather than later, where parents, due to age and infirmity, will no longer be able to care for them.  Who then will take on this task? That is the question the Minister and his Department should ask themselves.  The prospect is bleak under the present setup and until the Minister provides facilities to care for the handicapped this situation will get worse.</P>
      <P>I come from a county that has one of the finest schools and care centres in the country.  Twenty-five years ago Mrs. Sylvia Dawson and other volunteers set up a committee in Longford and since then a lot of hard work and effort has gone into helping the mentally handicapped. I am glad to say that Mrs. Dawson is still involved as secretary of the Association for the Mentally Handicapped in the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The withdrawal of a child care assistant at the primary school, St. Christopher's, Leamore Park, is an example of the cutbacks in this area.  I call on the Minister for Education to immediately appoint a child care assistant at this school.  The facilities provided in Leamore Park are excellent.  Many voluntary committees throughout County Longford have raised funds over the years to help out St. Christopher's and many new facilities have <Col N="591" /> been introduced.  However, unless funding is providing on an ongoing basis, these facilities will be unable to develop.  Let the Government show they care.  Let them now, as a matter of urgency, provide the necessary funds to deal with these problems.</P>
    <P>Surely those members of our society who cannot care for themselves must now get further recognition from the State. Friends and families of the mentally handicapped throughout the country have now in public demonstrations come together to highlight the needs of those who cannot shout for themselves. However, they cannot continue to carry unaided the burden and stress of this task.</P>
    <P>Figures and budgets mean very little to the mentally handicapped.  I know the Minister has to work within certain financial guidelines in his Department, but the will must be there at the outset in order to achieve the results we all want to see.</P>
    <P>I attended the Annual General Meeting recently of the County Longford Association for the Mentally Handicapped. At that meeting the message was clear.  I pass on that message here tonight. Urgent action is needed.  Let the Members of Dáil Éireann now speak out for those who cannot speak for themselves and I say to the Minister, this is the time to show we care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy to support the motion in the name of Deputy Yates and the amendments in the name of my colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin.  This is one more shameful debate in the health area, an indication of the erosion of essential services for a most vulnerable sector.  I really should not say it is an erosion because that suggests that there was a structure there to erode.  It is a total equivocation of the needs of mentally handicapped children <Col N="592" /> and young people.  It has become abundantly clear to me that the experience of parents of mentally handicapped children and young people is a sad and sorry one. Instead of recognising the valiant role these parents play in loving and caring for their families, unfortunately they are penalised, overlooked and, above all, not listened to.</P>
      <P>As has already been referred to, last night for many of us that position was more than redressed.  We went to a meeting in the Mansion House held by the parents' association of the mentally handicapped.  There we listened to the very real difficulties of parents coping with the total care of their children, many of whom are well into adulthood.  It was not just a meeting of complaints and moaning; it was a presentation of facts &mdash; like the need for 328 places for mentally handicapped people in the Eastern Health Board area alone, there are no speech therapy facilities, no physiotherapy facilities, few training facilities, no crisis care and many old age pensioners are attempting to care for their middle-aged, seriously handicapped offspring.</P>
      <P>There were many people in the Mansion House for what was a very well organised, well run conference.  Most of us were invited and TDs of all parties attended.  One of the newly elected backbenchers was the sole representative for Fianna Fáil.  He attempted &mdash; and full marks to him for trying &mdash; to defend the position of the Minister and the Government in the face of considerable hostility. Do not imagine for one moment that those of us in Opposition who attended could feel any sense of virtue or bask in any sense of relief, because we could not. It is a poor reflection on all politicians and on previous Ministers for Health that these parents have to take the present action of bringing their handicapped children on to the streets to show how deplorable their situation is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not find a grain of comfort in the Minister's speech last night, or indeed in the speech of the Minister of State tonight, that would give any hope.  If that is the best that can be done, it is not good <Col N="593" /> enough.  I say, please go back to your books and make a start towards the justifiable requests of this group.  The one thing which is happening here, to what extent I do not know, is that some parents who can afford it are sending their children to residential care in Northern Ireland.  This can only be done out of a sense of total frustration.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the problems in regard to Cheeverstown and I think they were also mentioned tonight.  In the face of the crucial needs in this area, the petty political wrangling over board membership or whatever, is very sick. The Minister should bring forward legislation which will open the doors of this unique custom built complex.  The Minister has responsibility for this and he can take that power.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to make two requests. The Minister should take account of the voices of parents and parental representative bodies.  They have the perspective and insight into the real community, educational and residential needs of the handicapped and the Minister cannot continue to ignore them.  They not only deserve to be considered but they have a right to be considered.  Of course, the stress is great on both parents but I have to say that mothers bear a considerable amount of the stress and strain.  I want to quote from a thesis by Nuala Molony called <i>The Myth of Community Care</i> in which she takes on the perspective of mothers of mentally handicapped children. She states:</P>
    <P>When talking to the mother community care is actually care by the mother who gives of her whole life to look after the mentally handicapped person.  In many cases it means that the mother has to neglect the rest of her family to look after the handicapped child, also the cost to the mother of keeping this mentally handicapped person at home with them was very high in terms of their physical and mental health.  Some of the mothers in fact considered &ldquo;ending it all&rdquo; because of the burden this child had placed on their lives.  Mothers up until recently <Col N="594" /> felt there was some relief available in institutions if things got too bad, now this option is not there.</P>
    <P>The Minister's attention has been drawn to the need for respite beds to provide care for stressed and exhausted parents to enable them to have a break, go on holiday or even to attend a wedding or a funeral.  I ask the Minister to please make this a priority.  Such respite beds existed five years ago but because of the cutbacks they have been absorbed into the total bed allocation.</P>
    <P>Every TD will have received phone calls today from consitutents seeking support for tonight's motion.  I appeal to the Minister not to let this motion go to a vote.  We should not be divided on something so patently urgent and so deserving of right and justice.  This campaign will not go away.  The people organising it and their supporters are very serious and energetic.  I ask the Minister to concede to my request not because of last night's public meeting, the phone calls or letters and his own embarrassment, though that might go some of the way, but because it is a just and right cause which calls for our action and our co-operation.</P>

      <P>Firstly, I should like to thank all the Deputies who contributed to this informative debate.  It has accurately reflected, so far as this side of the House is concerned, the anger and frustration which is mounting on this issue.  I should like to say at the outset that we will be supporting the Labour addendum to our motion and we appreciate the support of The Workers' Party for both our motion and the addendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's speech last night was very disappointing.  Leaving aside the fact that he decided to devote four out of 11 pages of his speech to continue the public argument, which is tantamount to one washing dirty linen in public, in relation to the Cheeverstown residential centre &mdash; I do not wish to comment on the rights and wrongs of this &mdash; it is wholly inappropriate when we are seeking to try to take a major initiative which will gurantee the rights and services for the <Col N="595" /> handicapped that the Minister should in turn launch a major offensive on the people who have given a lifetime of service to the care of the mentally handicapped. I share the Minister's view that this problem should be resolved but it was totally inopportune to use this debate to launch such a vicious attack on them and it was totally out of place.</P>

      <P>The most telling point which has recurred in this debate is the position of geriatric parents who have a mentally handicapped adult son or daughter whom they have cared for all their lives but who will go to their graves with the fear and anxiety of wondering who will care for them after their death. What did the Minister say in page seven of his speech?  He said they should contact their family doctor if there is a problem. This is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>There is an acknowledged need &mdash; whether we take the Central Review Committee's figures of the Eastern Health Board or the nationally established figures, given that by and large the Eastern Health Board provide better services than the other health boards &mdash; for 800 such residential places.  Every year there are an extra 850 mentally handicapped adults but there is inadequate provision for them and they have had to depend on the crumbs from the national lottery to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality of life for those people of all ages who are mentally handicapped and living our their lives in communities is inadequate.  I am talking about the 6,000 mentally handicapped people who are living with their families in the Eastern Health Board area.  What do they have to fulfil their lives or to give them extra dignity?  They face a waiting list for non-existing day care centres and community workshops which are overburdened and cannot cope.  There is an urgent need for the Minister to put in place a national scheme with an investment plan not alone for residential centres but for day care centres so that when <Col N="596" /> professional counsellors break the news to parents that their child is mentally handicapped they will know that for the rest of their natural lives their mentally handicapped child can look forward to the basic right to be educated in a special school and to be transported to that school.  I consider what the Minister of State said tonight as the most appalling whitewash of the problem.</P>
    <P>We all know that the ratio of 12 pupils to one teacher in special schools has been augmented in the past by attendants and special care officers but they have disappeared and teachers are now in an impossible situation in their classrooms. We know that there are no transport facilities in rural areas and there are no back-up essential services for speech therapy.  We know of people who started speech therapy but had it stopped for the past two years.  Parents are bewildered as to why basic speech therapy and physiotherapy facilities are provided on a stop-go basis.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully tonight to the contributions of Deputies Fitzpatrick, Calleary and Quinn.  We have a saying in my part of the country &mdash; this is the simplest way in which to sum up my comments on their contributions &mdash; that talk is cheap.  At 8.30 tonight there will be a vote whereby we can actually do something as opposed to commending the Minister.  This is the opportunity for this House to take the initiative.  The Minister could see fit during the recent debate on the dental motion to make a paltry contribution of £300,000 for orthodontics but I regret very much that he could take no initiative whatsoever in this debate other than to put forward a self-congratulatory amendment which seeks to avoid all the crunch issues.</P>
    <P>There is no proper assessment or monitoring of the services for mentally handicapped people.  Once they reach 18 years of age they are let back into their families and the community without proper support services.  Only last night the case of an unfortunate widower who is in his eighties came to my attention.  Unfortunately, this man is without both his lower limbs and is aging.  He is faced with <Col N="597" /> the problem that he does not know what care his mentally handicapped son will receive after he has died.  This is not good enough.  We need to establish rights for handicapped people and the regrettable failure of this debate is that the parents, friends and associates of the mentally handicapped have had to take to the streets.  As a substitute for the real politics of this House we have street politics to deal with the problems of the mentally handicapped.  This is unacceptable in a modern society.  What we want is a major initiative which will give a proper system of guardianship for mentally handicapped adults whose parents have predeceased them, a proper system of education which will guarantee the specialist needs of the handicapped and genetic counselling services for parents on a regional basis.  We must ensure that those who are sufficiently mildly or moderately handicapped will have a real chance to participate in society by having proper European social funding for sheltered employment.</P>
    <P>This is not an issue of my creation and <Col N="598" /> it is not a party-political issue.  This issue is gaining momentum and is an issue about people who have suffered for a long time in a silent, voiceless and vulnerable way and who have put up with their lot. However, they now see that extra money is being allocated to the health service &mdash; an extra £111 million will be allocated next year &mdash; but the Minister did not see fit to make proper provision for the 23,000 people who are handicapped. Until the Minister makes proper provision the issue will not go away.  This is a predictable and inevitable need.  Those people live in the community and they need to be cared for.</P>
    <P>I should like to call on those Deputies who in the privacy of their clinics and at constituency meetings have given soothing words of comfort to different associations who work for the handicapped to show their true colours when the division bells ring.  They should show that they are prepared to put the handicapped before their party and vote for the motion.</P>

      <P>I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This Bill forms a key element in the Government's programme to combat water pollution.  It is designed to strengthen the controls contained in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, and the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, and, generally, to update the provisions of the 1977 Act in the light of some ten years' experience of its full operation.  Before dealing with the specific provisions of the Bill, I propose to comment on some of the background issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because Ireland was never a highly urbanised and industrialised country, water pollution did not pose a major problem until the 1960s when we experienced rapid development of industry, major growth of urban centres and the development of intensive agriculture.  In 1971, a national survey of water quality revealed that while our waters were in the main unpolluted, some 7 per cent of them were seriously polluted.  Subsequent investigations into the nature and extent of the problem and the adequacy of the existing legislative controls led to the first comprehensive legislative response to the problem in the form of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.  That Act introduced a system of licensing for effluent discharges to waters, mainly as a means of tackling the pollution problems posed by industry.  It also gave local authorities a wide range of powers to control pollution from diffuse sources &mdash; powers which have since been used extensively by local authorities and to great effect.  In particular, section 12 of the Act, which provides for the issue of notices requiring measures to be taken to prevent water pollution, has proved to <Col N="604" /> be a most useful tool in the hands of the local authorities in their on-going efforts to eliminate the problem.  However, the incidents which occurred in the summer of 1987 indicated that strengthening of the law was needed and that the controls on pollution from diffuse sources, in particular, needed to be extended.</P>
    <P>It needs to be put on the record that Ireland's waters are still amongst the cleanest in Europe.  The most recent survey of national water quality, published in 1987, revealed that 74 per cent of Irish waters were unpolluted while a mere 2 per cent were seriously polluted &mdash; down from 7 per cent in 1971.  The bathing waters monitored for compliance with our stringent national bathing water quality standards have also proved to be of exceptionally high quality in most areas.  Our major problems with regard to water pollution are the increasing incidence of a slight and moderate pollution, and the need to control once-off pollution incidents, such as fish kills. These incidents can have dramatic effects and, if not effectively tackled, could distort the overall picture in relation to water quality here, with serious consequences for tourism and our economy generally, as well as for environmental quality.</P>
    <P>I want also to refer briefly to the allegation that local authorities themselves are the biggest polluters, or that local authorities are above the law.  The facts tell a different story.  Local authorities can be and are prosecuted by the fisheries boards if they are guilty of pollution but such prosecutions have been necessary in relatively few cases.  In fact, of all the fish kills caused annually, only a small fraction are caused by local authority discharges; but even that small number is still too many. That is why we must ensure that local authority waste disposal systems are run to the highest possible standards and, where necessary, that capital investment is undertaken to remedy deficiencies in existing systems.  The need for local authorities to pay particular attention to this matter was specifically brought to their notice in 1988 and each authority was issued with guidelines and advice on the <Col N="605" /> key areas of sewage treatment to which they should give regular and detailed attention.  In addition, the local authorities have, at the Department's request, identified the individual sewage discharges which are contributing to pollution and this information is taken into account in planning the overall sanitary services programme.</P>
    <P>In recent years, there has been considerable capital investment is providing and upgrading local authority sewage treatment and disposal facilities.  Since 1980, nearly £30 million have been invested by local authorities for this purpose, using finance made available by the Government, and as a result, considerable progress has been made in eliminating pollution blackspots.  New sewage treatment plants have been provided in towns such as Portlaoise, Fermoy, Carlow, Malahide, Swords, Killarney, Ardee, Listowel, Cavan, Tullamore, Newcastlewest and Blessington, to mention but a few.  This programme of action to tackle pollution from municipal sources has borne results: as I mentioned earlier, water quality surveys show a significant reduction in serious pollution of rivers and streams since 1971 and much of this reduction is directly linked to the investment which has been made.</P>
    <P>In 1989, over £62 million was provided for the sanitary services capital programme and the allocation for 1990 has been set at £67.5 million.  The House may be assured that, in deciding on schemes to go to construction in the coming years, due weight will be given to the importance of building on the progress already made and ensuring that local authorities are enabled to play their full part in the drive against water pollution.  Schemes already released by my Department, and which should go to construction next year, include a sludge dewatering plant at Dromin, County Kerry, which will give increased protection to the River Feale, and sewerage schemes at Athlone, Baltinglass, Ballinamore and Newbridge which will contribute to improvements in water quality in the Shannon, the Slaney, the Ballinamore/Ballyconnell Canal and the Liffey at these locations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" /> The <i>National Development Plan, 1989-1993</i>, provides for substantial continuing investment in water and sewerage services over the five years to 1993.  The pattern of expenditure proposed marks a change from that which has prevailed during the eighties in that the major portion of the investment will be devoted to new sewerage schemes.  EC Structural Fund support for sanitary services will amount to £95 million over this period and there are good prospects that additional funding will become available when the reserve funds for less developed regions are allocated.</P>
    <P>In planning the investment programme for the next five years, account has been taken not only of national priorities, but also of the need to ensure full implementation of European Community's water pollution directives.  In 1988 alone, three sets of regulations were made giving full effect in Irish law to the bathing water, fresh water fish and drinking water directives. This year amending regulations increased to a total of 64 the number of beaches monitored for compliance with the national bathing water quality standards. Regulations giving effect in Irish law to the two surface water directives were made earlier this month and work is in progress on the preparation of further regulations to give effect to more recent directives.  The various sanitary services schemes selected to go to construction stage in the next five years will make a very substantial contribution to the achievement on a consistent and universal basis of the high standards of water quality set in the various EC Directives and the even higher standards to which we aspire in some cases.</P>
    <P>Looked at in the European context, we are one of the few countries lucky enough to have waters which are to a large extent unpolluted.  We must ensure that this continues to be so by pursuing an integrated approach towards the problem of water pollution and by ensuring that resources are effectively targeted on the areas in most urgent need of attention.</P>
    <P>Since 1987, a great deal of effort has been devoted to reducing pollution from diffuse agricultural sources which were <Col N="607" /> the source of a large proportion of the fish kills in that year.  The success of the integrated approach adopted in dealing with that problem is already apparent. Measures aimed at the identification of problem farms, measures to assist farmers in making their farms pollution free and activities designed to increase awareness among farmers of water pollution were adopted.  The farm surveys carried out in each county by multi-disciplinary task forces led by local authorities proved to be a very worthwhile exercise. In 1988, over 12,000 farms in high pollution risk areas were surveyed.  Of these 45 per cent were found to pose a medium to high pollution risk and the local authorities concerned are ensuring that the farmers involved take all measures necessary to make these farms risk free.</P>
    <P>To assist farmers in carrying out necessary pollution control works, the western package scheme was extended last year to cover such works.  Initially farmers in all disadvantaged areas, which comprise some 70 per cent of all land in the country, could qualify for grants of 55 per cent of the cost of slurry and silage effluent storage facilities.  Young farmers could qualify for grants of 69 per cent. The scheme of grants has now been extended to the entire country as part of the national development plan and farmers outside the disadvantaged areas can now qualify for grants of 45 per cent towards slurry and silage effluent storage facilities, with even higher rates for young farmers.  Up to the end of September 1989, 16,884 applications for such grants were received.  Of these 8,469 have been approved representing a total estimated grant of £37 million and a total estimated investment of £75 million.</P>
    <P>The activities of ACOT &mdash; and now Teagasc &mdash; have played an important role in heightening awareness of agricultural pollution among the farming community and in assisting individual farmers to design and carry through the necessary measures to avoid or eliminate pollution. The establishment of a specialised environmental advisory service was a particularly important development, as <Col N="608" /> was the environmental awareness campaign developed with the support of the local authorities and the farming organisations.</P>
    <P>Recent years have seen a more vigorous use by local authorities of the enforcement provisions of the Water Pollution Act against polluters generally. The figures for 1988 speak for themselves. In that year local authorities initiated prosecutions in over 100 cases. The number of notices issued under section 12 of the 1977 Act requiring measures to be taken to prevent pollution came to almost 1,000.  Over 9,500 advice or warning letters were issued and investigations in respect of waters and discharges to sewers were carried out in more than 16,000 cases.</P>
    <P>These statistics illustrate the generally high level of commitment by local authorities to implementing the 1977 Act, particularly during a period when the financial and manpower resources available to them were restricted.  Clearly it is unrealistic to expect that each local authority would have available to them the depth of expertise necessary to fully assess all proposals for major and complex industrial projects.  Detailed environmental impact assessments are required for such projects as part of the process of determining the conditions and controls to be applied to protect the environment.  There is a need for a fully integrated approach to air and water quality protection and waste management to ensure that proper safeguards are imposed and are seen to operate and to be effective.  For reasons such as these, the Government are committed to bringing forward separate legislation establishing an independent environmental agency which will, of course, have implications for the role of local authorities in water pollution control.  It is my intention to consult with all interests involved in developing my detailed proposals for the agency and the House will, of course, have an opportunity to consider the matter in detail when the separate legislation which I already mentioned is brought before the House in the new year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="609" /> It is still too early to say whether the programme of measures to combat pollution, undertaken since 1987, will have a lasting effect.  The dramatic drop in the number of fish kills recorded in 1988 &mdash; from 122 in the previous year to 50 &mdash; was most encouraging.  However, to date this year 108 kills have been reported. Agricultural pollution and low water levels were the two major causes giving rise to 22 and 21 kills, respectively.  A further 17 kills were the result of industrial effluent, 11 were caused by enrichment, six by sewage and 21 were attributed to other causes such as creameries, drainage works, waterworks, etc. The causes of the remaining ten kills are as yet unknown.  The reversal of the downward trend in 1989, though it was partly due to exceptionally low water levels, is a clear indication that we cannot afford to become complacent.  We must continue to give a high priority to ensuring that the number and scale of fish kills is reduced as far as possible.  In addition, we must give special attention to emerging trends in relation to the general condition of our waters.  In particular, there is a need for action to redress the insidious pollution which in recent years has seen a significant increase in the extent to which waters are affected by slight or moderate levels of pollution.  This Bill, by providing a more comprehensive and effective legislative basis for action by local authorities and fishery boards, will help to meet these needs.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in some quarters that the provisions of the Bill display a prejudice against the farming community and that they are unnecessary and unwarranted. It has been suggested also that the Bill will have the effect of bringing an otherwise law-abiding section of the community into serious conflict with the law and that the farming community as a whole will be made to pay for the negligence and misdeeds of a few.  I wish to set out my position clearly in relation to allegations of this kind.</P>
    <P>First of all, I should state for the record that the Bill is not intended to place unreasonable restrictions on the practice of modern farming.  Secondly, the Bill is <Col N="610" /> not intended to facilitate some form of witch hunt against farmers.  Thirdly, nothing in the Bill should be taken as an indictment of the farming community generally nor, of course, is the Bill intended to make criminals of Irish farmers.  Fourthly, no farmer who conducts his enterprise in accordance with the norms of good agricultural practice should have anything to fear from the provisions in the Bill.  Finally, the Bill, in so far as it relates to pollution from agricultural activities and practices, is designed to do no more than enable local authorities to take action in relation to this form of pollution which would be no more stringent nor severe in its impact than the action they would have to take against other sources of pollution.</P>
    <P>In considering the provisions of the Bill, we must remember that the concept of sustainable development is now being given central importance in the debate about development and the environment. In other words, it has come to be accepted that solid and lasting growth on the one hand, and environmental protection on the other, are interdependent. This is just as true of growth in the agricultural sector as it is in relation to other forms of development.  Indeed, more than any other sector of the economy, our agriculture and our agri-food industries are dependent for their growth and prosperity on the maintenance of a clean and healthy environment here at home, and on the maintenance abroad of the image of Ireland as a green and unpolluted land.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that we must view the implications for the environment of the shift to intensive &mdash; and in some cases almost industrial &mdash; farming which has taken place in recent decades. These new features of agriculture can pose an enormous threat to the environment. Developments in relation to animal husbandry have led to the generation and storage of enormous volumes of slurry.  The replacement of the traditional practice of hay-making by the modern practice of silage-making has led to the generation of a form of toxic effluent which was not taken into account at <Col N="611" /> all until recent years.  Developments in relation to the size, layout and functions of farm buildings, and the introduction of new practices in the interests of hygiene and efficiency have led to the generation of far greater quantities of waste water in farmyards than were the norm some years ago.</P>
    <P>These and other considerations support the contention that agriculture, as it is practised today, has a very considerable potential to pollute.  While I fully accept that the vast majority of farmers manage their enterprises so as to ensure that the risk of pollution does not become a reality, I cannot accept that the law should ignore the pollution risks, even if the full rigours of the law will never have to be invoked in relation to the vast majority of farmers.</P>
    <P>The potential of farm wastes to pollute is well illustrated by using the polluting effect of raw domestic sewage, in terms of its biochemical oxygen demand, as a yardstick.  A quantity of milk is 400 times more polluting than the same quantity of raw sewage.  Silage effluent is over 200 times more polluting than sewage and slurry over 80 times.  These figures would need to be increased by a factor of 15 if treated domestic sewage is used as the yardstick to assess the polluting effect. The potential of farming to pollute is also well illustrated by reference to a herd of 50 dairy cows which is housed over a winter period of six months.  The slurry generated would be equivalent in its polluting effect to sewage from a town with a population of over 2,200</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make one further point by way of attempting to place the pollution loadings from various sources in proper perspective.  A comparison of the generated waste loads from urban, industrial and agricultural sources has been made in a report on farm wastes and water pollution published recently by the Environmental Research Unit.  This report, copies of which are available in <Col N="612" /> the Oireachtas Library, found that agriculture accounted for almost 91 per cent of the overall total generated load, urban sources for less than 4 per cent and the industrial sector for under 6 per cent. Of course it is clear that considerable reduction of the waste loads generated in agriculture takes place by absorption on land, but even when allowance is made for this by excluding the contributions from sheep and from 50 per cent of cattle numbers, the report still ascribed 85 per cent of the total generated waste load from all sectors to agriculture.</P>
      <P>In citing these figures, it is essential to stress that the great majority of farmers act responsibly and in accordance with good farming practice when disposing of their wastes and this leads to a major reduction in the quantity of farm wastes which eventually reaches waters.  The significance of these figures is that they emphasise the size of the potential pollution problem which could arise in the absence of properly managed systems for the disposal of agricultural wastes.</P>
      <P>Many of the provisions of the Bill do not, of course, differentiate in their incidence as between farming activities and other forms of development which may cause water pollution.  The fact is, however, that the main area in which experience has shown our existing controls to be in need of improvement is the problem of diffuse sources of pollution, particularly those arising in agriculture. There are, therefore, provisions in the Bill which are designed expressly to deal with this type of problem.</P>
      <P>In considering the provisions of the Bill which will have particular application to agricultural activities, it must be remembered that the use of land for agriculture, forestry or horticulture is exempt entirely from planning control and that quite substantial agricultural structures can be erected without any need for planning permission.  Bearing in mind the tens of thousands of separate units involved, and the need to minimise bureaucratic interference in the everyday activities of the farming community, few would suggest that these provisions in planning legislation should be fundamentally altered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> It must also be remembered that the licensing provisions of the Water Pollution Act do not, in the vast majority of cases, apply to discharges of agricultural effluent because these discharges are not normally made directly to waters by way of pipelines or other apparatus.  It would, of course, be possible to amend the law so as to require that any disposal of agricultural effluent which might indirectly reach waters would require a licence, but few would accept that this course is either necessary or practicable, or that it would represent an appropriate response to the problem which the Bill is designed to address.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, we are not to proceed by way of extending the full rigours of the planning control regime to agricultural practices and if we are not to introduce a general licensing regime to cover the disposal of agricultural wastes, we must be prepared to contemplate a series of other measures which will take account of the normal operating requirements of the agricultural sector and, at the same time, allow for intervention by the local authorities where this is essential to prevent or limit water pollution.  In these circumstances, I am satisfied that the provisions which are included in the present Bill will be accepted by the House and, indeed, by the farming community as a whole, as an appropriate and balanced package of measures.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is a complex one and many of its provisions have to be read in conjunction with the corresponding provisions of the 1977 Act.  A detailed section by section commentary is not therefore appropriate at this stage, particularly as an informative explanatory memorandum has already been circulated. There will, no doubt, be detailed discussion on individual sections of the Bill on Committee Stage and I will consider very carefully any amendments which are put forward to improve the Bill at that stage.  For the present, I will confine myself to a summary of the main provisions of the Bill.  These can broadly be grouped into three categories, namely those provisions which strengthen the <Col N="614" /> penalties and sanctions for water pollution offences; those provisions which amend sections of the 1977 Act which, with experience, have been found to need amendment; and those provisions which establish new controls on particular forms of pollution.</P>
    <P>Increased sanctions and penalties form an important part of the Bill.  It is a sad fact of life that research, education and financial assistance on their own will not solve the problem of water pollution. There will always be a hardcore of polluters who will only respond to the threat of heavy penalties and sanctions. Besides, the principal idea underlying this Bill is that the polluter will pay.  To this end, the Bill provides for an increase in the maximum fine on summary conviction to £1,000, from £250, the increase to apply to both the Water Pollution and Fisheries Acts; with this increase to the summary jurisdiction limit, the provision for additional fines for the same offence where it is continued, has to be dropped; a new maximum penalty of £25,000 on conviction on indictment (increased from £5,000) and-or imprisonment for a period of up to five years instead of two years, the provisions to apply to both the Water Pollution and Fisheries Acts; the extension to any person of the right to apply to the courts for an order seeking the mitigation or remedying of the effects of a pollution incident, and making explicit provision for remedial measures such as the replacement of fish stocks and the making good of consequential losses suffered by any person or body as a result of the pollution; a new provision under which polluters will have a civil liability for any damage caused by the pollution; and specific provision allowing the courts to grant both costs and expenses to local authorities and fisheries boards against convicted pollution offenders.</P>
    <P>In summary, these provisions should have a strong deterrent effect.  Where the polluter previously ran the risk of prosecution by local authority and fishery board personnel, he or she will in the future also be liable to be proceeded against for damages by an injured party.</P>
    <P>Many of the provisions of the Bill are <Col N="615" /> designed to amend or expand existing provisions of the Water Pollution Act. Among these are: an extension of the grounds on which a High Court order may be sought to cover situations involving a risk of water pollution; clarification of a local authority's power to serve notices under section 12 of the 1977 Act regulating practices, such as silage making and slurry spreading, which, in its opinion, could result in water pollution; conferring on local and sanitary authorities power to obtain information on water abstractions, discharges to waters, and activities or practices which are relevant to their pollution prevention functions.</P>
    <P>Most of these provisions are fine-tuning provisions, or provisions designed to fill gaps in the 1977 Act which only experience of its operation could have revealed.</P>
    <P>Another group of provisions will enable specific sources of pollution to be controlled more effectively.  Three provisions, in particular, are worthy of note.</P>
    <P>First, local authorities are being empowered under section 21 to draft by-laws regulating or prohibiting specified agricultural activities in their functional areas, or any part thereof, where they consider it necessary to do so in order to eliminate or prevent water pollution.  The making of the by-laws will be subject to approval by the Minister, who may approve or refuse to approve by-laws, or direct that they be amended in a specified manner.  The Minister may require a local authority to draft such by-laws where he believes them to be necessary.</P>
    <P>As I noted earlier, the use of land for horticultural and agricultural activities is exempted from planning control and it would be quite unrealistic to alter this situation on a general basis.  However, the new provisions will give the local authority or the Minister power to regulate agricultural activities in a specified area if this is necessary to eliminate or prevent water pollution.  This measure will be used where the nature and extent of certain agricultural practices and the preservation of the aquatic environment <Col N="616" /> of the locality in which they are carried out are clearly incompatible.  I might mention also that controls of this kind are likely to be necessary in certain areas if a draft EC Directive on the control of pollution caused by nitrates is agreed by the Council of Environment Ministers.</P>
    <P>The second provision I wish to mention is section 22 which will empower local or sanitary authorities to treat each discharge of trade effluent into a private combined drain as a discharge to a sewer for the purposes of the Act.  Up to now, only the combined effluent from the drain could be licensed under the Act and this has led to difficulties in identifying the origin of the particular effluent responsible for a pollution incident and applying the necessary specific controls.</P>
    <P>I think provision which is worthy of note is contained in sections 5 and 13 which will greatly increase the powers of local authorities to carry out reviews of trade effluent discharge licences.  At present, these licences cannot be reviewed within three years of their being granted unless the discharge endangers public health.  The new provisions will allow local authorities to review licences in any case where the discharge could adversely affect any beneficial uses of the water.</P>
    <P>I will be proposing some amendments to the Bill, mainly of a technical nature, on Committee Stage.  First, I will be proposing that the &ldquo;good defence&rdquo; provision in the 1977 Act should be retained, but expanded to include a requirement to provide, use and maintain suitable facilities to prevent pollution.  In effect, the amendment that is in mind will carry into the Water Pollution code a provision on the lines of the &ldquo;best practicable means&rdquo; concept that is enshrined in the more modern Air Pollution Act.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I will be proposing that the Bill be amended so as to clarify that only a party from whose premises or lands the cause of the pollution originated will be liable for damages under section 20.  On a literal interpretation of the Bill, as worded at present, a person who is not in any way responsible for pollution could <Col N="617" /> be held liable for it and this was clearly never the intention.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I will be bringing forward an amendment to section 21 which concerns by-laws prohibiting or regulating agricultural activities in specified areas.  The amendment will relate to procedural matters only.  It will ensure that by-laws will not come into effect until approved by the Minister who would also have power to refuse to approve by-laws, or to require their amendment in a specified manner.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the views of individual Deputies on this very important topic.  I am confident that the House will agree that the Bill is a good one and that its passage into law at an early date is very desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Fine Gael agree with its broad thrust.  We have, however, reservations on a number of aspects of the Bill and have made detailed and constructive suggestions on how to improve it well in advance of this debate.</P>
      <P>Before I make specific reference to the terms of the Bill, it is important to remind ourselves that, as consumers, we are all entitled to a clean, healthy and pleasant environment.  We are trustees of our environment and we all have a contribution to make in protecting it for this and future generations.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael are committed to a dynamic environmental policy and we recognise the importance of our environmental heritage.  We know that if we do not treat our domestic environment with respect we will not be taken seriously when we speak out on important international environmental issues in which we have a legitimate interest.  We also recognise that one of the crucial factors on which our tourist industry depends is an attractive and clean environment.</P>
      <P>Protected by our island status, our small population and our late industrial development from the worst ravages of environmental destruction, we complacently believed that we could preserve the beauty of our natural habitat without taking any special measures to protect it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> In our cities and towns we have been blind to the urban dereliction in our midst, and in our search for industry and job creation we have too frequently ignored the environmental impact of industrial and chemical pollutants and waste.  In our anxiety to maximise profits in the industrial and agricultural sectors we have, for too long, turned a blind eye to the pollution of our lakes and rivers.</P>
    <P>As a member of the European Community, instead of taking a position of leadership and showing the way to our European partners on environmental issues, we have regularly sought derogations and extra time to implement basic environmental legislation designed to preserve our national heritage and to protect our health.  Too frequently, at home and abroad, we have paid scant attention to environmental concerns and failed to take positive legislative and administrative action.</P>
    <P>Within Government Departments, too often the promotion of economic development has been received as being incompatible with a commitment to environmental protection and nature conservation.  We have only taken action when forced to do so by EC legislation. It has taken us too long to understand the essential linkage between environmental protection and industrial development. Conservation of our environment cannot succeed without economic growth and development which cannot be sustained without environmental protection.</P>
    <P>Concern about the environment, expressed at national level, has not always been matched by the necessary Government action.  The international dimension to environmental issues has, however, awakened public consciousness as has a number of domestic environmental difficulties.  Pollution of all types has been very much in the news in recent times.  People generally have become conscious of the dangers of pollution to our countryside, waterways and seas.  It is good that public awareness has been generated and that most of us have woken up to the obvious &mdash; and hidden &mdash; dangers of pollution.</P>
    <P>Let me reduce it to its simplest form.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="619" /> Prevention of pollution is each individual making sure that he or she does not by any act of carelessness do or cause anything to pollute streams, rivers, lakes or seas.  If everybody looks after their own area there will not be any pollution. Every farmer, industrialist, house owner, local authority and Government Department must play their part in avoiding the dangers of pollution.  If every individual is determined to avoid pollution of any kind in his own locality, river, lake or sea, we will have pollution free waters.</P>
    <P>Despite the enactment of the Water Pollution Act, 1977, the number of rivers unaffected by pollution fell from 84 per cent in 1974 to 74 per cent in the mid-eighties, more than ten years after the passing of the Act.  At present one quarter of our rivers and one third of our lakes are affected by pollution.  The greater part of this pollution is due to the waste discharged directly into rivers in towns by industries, with farm effluent making an increased contribution in 1986 and 1987.</P>
    <P>Although all local authorities have the statutory duty to enforce the Water Pollution Act they have been the principal offenders on occasions.  In this regard I should like to take issue with the comment of the Minister because it is evident that lack of funding, resources and personnel mean that every local authority are culpable in one way or another.  I could give numerous instances in my own constituency of north Tipperary where local authorities are polluting the area to an enormous degree.</P>
    <P>I accept that a minority of farmers are offenders but I am concerned at the prevailing public perception that agriculture is the principal contributor to pollution of our waterways.  This is leading to unnecessary farmer bashing.  Because of the bad weather in 1985 and 1986 the loss of fish stocks due to water pollution reached a new awareness in 1987 which, in turn, showed farmers in a very bad light regarding fish kills.  This was despite the fact that the report of the body which replaced An Foras Forbartha categorised river pollution as follows: 70 per cent is <Col N="620" /> attributable to urban and industrial, 20 per cent is attributable to agriculture and 10 per cent is attributable to other sources.</P>
    <P>Farm organisations responded positively to this by operating, in conjunction with Teagasc, an awareness campaign. Numerous meetings and seminars were held which resulted in a highly significant fall-off in fish kills in 1988.  To be precise, 82 fish kills were attributable to farmers in 1987 compared with 20 in 1988, a drop of 78 per cent.  In 1989 agriculture was responsible for 23 out of 121 fish kills, which is 19 per cent.  This is a considerable improvement on 1988, especially if you take into account the extremely dry and hot year.</P>
    <P>Research shows that in the last 18 months farmers have invested £200 million in pollution control facilties.  As this is a clear indication of the commitment of the farming sector to the environment it should be acknowledged and appreciated.</P>
    <P>I should now like to formally outline the reasons for the proposed Fine Gael amendments to specific sections of the Bill.  The amendment to section 2 amends the definition of &ldquo;water&rdquo; contained in the Water Pollution Act, 1977, and deletes the reference to &ldquo;contiguous areas&rdquo;. Concern has been expressed that, in the absence of such an amendment, ordinary and everyday farming practices could be placed at risk and result in unjustifiable prosecutions being brought.</P>
    <P>In section 3 concern has been expressed that the amendment made to the 1977 Act by removing the &ldquo;good defence&rdquo; provision could result in persons being wrongly convicted for causing water pollution in circumstances in which they foresaw the possibility of the pollution occurring and took all reasonable care to prevent such pollution.  The proposed amendment will ensure that where a person acted responsibly and has taken reasonable care to prevent pollution, and where pollution occurs without their being at fault, they will have a good defence.  I welcome the Minister's response to the Fine Gael initiative in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="621" /> Section 20 imposes a civil liability for pollution in a variety of circumstances which will result in farmers, as well as others, being liable for damages. However, it excludes from civil liability polluting matter entering waters from certain specified non-agricultural activity.  Fine Gael believe that this anti-farmer bias should be removed from the legislation and it is proposed that this exclusion be deleted from the Bill.  If I understood the Minister correctly, she said that only those who cause pollution can be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>Section 21 lays down extensive provisions for local authorities to make by-laws that could directly impinge in a dramatic way on the ordinary running of a farm.  By-laws can become legally binding and render a person liable to criminal prosecution and conviction without any consultative process having to be engaged in as regards the context of the by-laws. Detailed amendments proposed to this section provide for the making of draft by-laws which must be published for public comment.  Sixty days after their publication by-laws can be approved by the Minister for the Environment or approved by him subject to amendments following his considering the representations made to him and any comments made by the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  Following the approval of the draft by-laws, the amendment then requires that they be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that they do not become operative unless approved by each House.  This would radically change the provisions contained in the present Bill and provide considerable protection for the agricultural community, not contained in the Bill, as published.</P>
    <P>Section 30 proposes to abolish the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  A deletion of the reference to section 2 of the 1977 Act from the 1989 Bill would preserve in existence the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  Fine Gael believe that the council can play an important ongoing role in dealing with the problems of water pollution and in providing and publishing independent reports.  The council <Col N="622" /> have not been operating since 1986 as the then Government and the present Government have failed to nominate new members to the council.  The Minister for the Environment is currently in breach of the provisions of section 2 of the 1977 Act, which requires him to make appointments to the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  We will be pressing in the Dáil for the Minister to appoint members to the council without delay.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that whereas the Bill substantially increases the fines that can be imposd on polluters by prosecution on indictment, such prosecutions which can render a person liable to a fine not exceeding £25,000 or imprisonment not exceeding five years, or both, can only be brought on the instigation of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Local authorities will be able to prosecute summary proceedings through the District Court only.  It has been suggested that convictions could result from inspections carried out by untrained personnel with no knowledge and background in agriculture and this could pose a serious threat to the farming community.  Any prosecution would have to be properly processed through the courts and it is highly unlikely any conviction could be secured on the evidence of an untrained individual, where such an individual would be cross-examined in the courts. The amendments being proposed to section 3(3) with regard to what is known as &ldquo;the good defence&rdquo; will provide additional protection against wrongful convictions.</P>
    <P>It should be further noted that section 7 allows any person to make a court application against an alleged polluter in relation to the mitigation and remedy of the effects of pollution.  Concern has been expressed that where neighbours are not on good terms, this provision could be used by one neighbour to take vexatious court proceedings against the other.  It should be noted that in the provisions contained in section 7, the court is authorised to &ldquo;make such order as to the costs of the parties to, or to the persons heard by the court in proceedings relating to an application for an order under this section <Col N="623" /> as it considers appropriate&rdquo;.  It would be normal legal procedure that a person who has instituted such legal proceedings and failed to be successful in such proceedings would be required to pay the costs of the person against whom the action was brought.  If necessary, a specific amendment along these lines will be tabled on Committee Stage.  Amendments will also be tabled by Fine Gael to provide for split sampling and for a clear definition in the Bill of &ldquo;water pollution&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would like to articulate the views of the Irish Farmers' Association and their concern regarding bounty hunting as specified in section 24.  They are concerned that local authorities in addition to being prosecutors are also benefactors of any fines imposed by the courts.  The IFA strongly oppose this amendment to the Bill as they contend it will lead to confrontation rather than co-operation between farmers and local authorities; that it would be an unfair carrot for local authorities to abuse the legislation; that it takes power away from the Judiciary in that they have no authority to decide where the fines go.  The local authority have to apply to the courts for the fines and they then have to be paid to them.</P>
    <P>The IFA are also critical of the Department of the Environment for the lack of education on pollution control and also for the lack of guidelines as to what exactly constitutes pollution.  The IFA, with the help of Teagasc, carried out a survey during 1988 and their findings suggest that many hundreds of millions of pounds will have to be spent by farmers in controlling pollution.  They have pointed out to the Minister for the Environment that realistic grants, taking into account the present cost of building construction, should be made available to farmers.  For generations farmers have extended the hand of friendship and have had an open gate approach to all and sundry who wish to enter their lands. Nowhere else in Europe are such facilities afforded.  It would be most regrettable if farmers, through the rigours of this Bill, should find it impractical to continue to <Col N="624" /> extend the céad mile fáilte to all, nationals and non-nationals alike.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael are anxious to expedite the implementation of this Bill in amended form.  Our party spokesperson, Deputy Shatter, took the usual step of circulating amendments to the Bill prior to the Second Stage debate in the Dáil.  Fine Gael recognise the need to update our water pollution legislation so as to ensure that we have a modern legal framework to prevent water pollution and protect our natural resources in the interests of the entire community.  Fine Gael regret that the Bill contains a number of provisions which appear unnecessarily oppressive in the manner in which they may affect the farming community and regret that the Minister for the Environmnent and the Minister of State have not yet adequately responded to the worries that have arisen.</P>

      <P>We recognise the tremendous efforts that have been made by farmers in recent years to tackle the problem of agricultural pollution and fully accept that the farming community generally have a vested interest in the conservation of the environment.</P>
      <P>New legislation must strike a proper balance.  While we must ensure that we eliminate the problem of water pollution and provide legal teeth to enforce our laws, we must also ensure at the same time that persons are not wrongly convicted or wrongly penalised where water pollution occurs in circumstances for which they cannot be held responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael published some initial amendments to the Bill in order to put the Government on notice about some of our concerns in this area and to elicit a response on these amendments during <Col N="625" /> the Second Stage debate.  We are anxious at an early date to ensure that a reasonable solution is found to the concerns expressed by farmers and farming organisations. Further amendments to the Bill will be tabled by Fine Gael prior to Committee Stage after we have studied in detail tonight's response by the Minister of State.  I acknowledge that the Minister has conceded to our proposals in a number of areas and I hope that on Committee Stage further progress can be made in facilitating our legitimate concerns.</P>

      <P>The Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Bill, 1989, has features which are to be welcomed and, essentially, the Labour Party agree with its provisions.  However, we will be seeking to amend the Bill on Committee Stage in areas which we feel will make for the more efficient operation of its provisions.</P>
      <P>We are greatly concerned about the level of penalty imposed on convicted polluters in the District Court and the apparent inconsistencies in fines imposed by district justices in what are apparently similar convictions.  The low level of fines can prove to be a major disincentive to the pollution control officers of local authorities in the implementation of the Water Pollution Bill.  The pollution control officers are entitled to the support of the courts in their extremely important work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Waterford there was an incident in recent years where a conviction was obtained following the discharge of several thousand gallons of animal blood into the Clodagh river, which is a feeder river to the East Waterford water supply and which supplies Waterford city, Tramore and Dunmore East among other areas.  The conviction was obtained through the vigilance of a member of the staff of the Adamstown water treatment plant who was on a day's leave at the time.  His vigilant action led to the deposit of animal blood into the river being detected at an early stage so that the contaminated water did not get <Col N="626" /> into the main water supply.  I might add that, had the animal blood got into the water supply system, the treatment plant would not have eliminated the virus from the contaminated water resulting in possible frightening health consequences over a wide area.  Yet a fine of £100 only was imposed in that instance.  The pollution control officers in that case performed a great public service but did not receive the support of the court with such a trivial penalty being imposed.</P>
    <P>Another illustration of this, again in County Waterford, was the successful prosecution of an industrial concern for having contravened on two separate dates the conditions attaching to a licence issued under section 4 of the Water Pollution Act, 1977.  The toxic effluent was so high in that case that the South Eastern Health Board advised people not to consume shellfish from the harbour into which the effluent was discharging.  One of the toxic effluent parameters was found to be one thousand times the permitted discharge limit.  The district justice imposed fines of £20 and £50 in relation to those prosecutions.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason the Labour Party will be seeking minimum penalties in the Bill.  As a general rule we will be seeking minimum fines of ten per cent of the maximum fines.  We welcome the fact that maximum fines are to be increased from £250 under the provisions of the Water Pollution Act, 1977, and from £500 under the provisions of the Fisheries Act, 1959, to £1,000 on summary conviction and from £5,000 to £25,000 and a period of imprisonment up to five years, from two years on indictment.  But we will be seeking that the minimum fine on summary conviction will be £100 and, on indictment, £2,500.</P>
    <P>In recent years the chairman of the Environmental Health Officers Association stated that in quite a significant proportion of the country up to 50 per cent of wells and small group domestic water schemes are contaminated.  He went on to state that these are not being <Col N="627" /> monitored in any proper way at present. In County Waterford some eight years ago a water supply servicing some 200 people had to be abandoned.  The major problem here is that when ground water is contaminated it will take many years, perhaps hundreds of years, to recover. The water quality of a river polluted in a once-off way may recover within hours or days but that is not the case with ground water.  Contaminated drinking water can result in a range of viral infections such as polio and hepatitis or in a range of bacterial infections such as typhoid, dysentry and Weil's disease.</P>
    <P>In Britain it is estimated that approximately four million people drink water which breaches the EC nitrate limits set to guard against the risk that chemicals may cause cancer.  These numbers are expected to increase as nitrates &mdash; the main source of which is agricultural fertilisers &mdash; build up in ground water.  The presence of aluminium in drinking water is another major cause of concern. Indeed there is a possible link between Alzheimer's disease &mdash; which is a form of pre-senile dementia &mdash; and the aluminium content of water.  In Britain up to 3.5 million people drink water which exceeds the EC limits.  Indeed it has been alleged that the drinking water in half of all homes in Dublin contains four times the Community guidelines limits on aluminium. I am glad to say that in Waterford we are within the Community limit regarding the level of aluminium.  Nonetheless a rather worrying feature did emerge following tests carried out at the Adamstown water laboratory in County Waterford, which was that while the water was within EC guidelines, when boiled in an aluminium vessel it was found that its aluminium content increased fifty-fold.  This would suggest there is a need to examine our cooking utensils in the light of that information.</P>
    <P>I have cited the problems being experienced in Britain in the hope that we would not make the same mistakes here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> Although this Bill is to be welcomed we should not delude ourselves into thinking that all aspects of water pollution can be dealt with effectively if the State does not provide the resources to identify potential pollution sources, to police and monitor them and act in a preventative way rather than, as we do at present, in terms of crisis management.</P>
    <P>Cutbacks in local authority finances in recent years, together with the voluntary redundancy-early retirement job losses have had the effect of further reducing the capacity to deal effectively with all aspects of pollution and its control.</P>
    <P>The proposals drafted by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment regarding the new environmental protection agency which I understand will shortly be the subject of a Government decision would raise considerable doubts in my mind.  If, as reported, the agency will have an initial budget of £500,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be presenting further legislation.  I am glad the Minister has decided to consult all interests before the legislation is brought forward and that we shall have an opportunity of debating it in this House.  I hope there will be no attempts to use this Bill to diminish, on a cost-saving basis, the role of local authorities.  This whole area of pollution requires resources rather than their withdrawal.  At this stage if <Col N="629" /> that figure of £500,000 is the real one, I cannot envisage the agency having any real effect.</P>
      <P>I fully support the establishment of national standards.  Indeed the updating of the water quality guidelines, memorandum No. 1, issued by the technical committee on effluent and water quality standards of the Minister's Department in April, 1978 is long overdue.</P>
      <P>Another area of major concern, a fairly technical one, is the issuing of notices under section 12 of the 1977 Act to farmers who are potential polluters. We have heard from the Fine Gael side of the House that farmers will be disadvantaged by the provisions in this Bill.  Nobody on this side of the House wants to victimise in any way or show any bias towards farmers but it has to be acknowledged that there is a big problem to be resolved with an increasing level of nitrates in our drinking water.  There is the problem of those nitrates entering rivers and, through their estuaries, the sea, the problem being compounded by ordinary household sewage entering into the sea which would appear to have played some role in the fact that in 1988 we had algae phaeophyceae which showed up right along the south coast. Luckily this was not one of the toxic algae like the red tide which caused fairly major fish kills in the North Sea.  Obviously something is causing this type of algae &mdash; which multiplies at a crazy rate when certain light conditions prevail&mdash;but also when the water is rich in nutrients.  Those nurients must be coming from somewhere. There is strong reason to believe that our agricultural nutrients are getting out through our rivers and estuaries to the sea.  This is something else to which we must apply ourselves, if not from a tourism point of view, certainly in terms of those people who use our beaches because it is most important that we maintain our beaches to the highest possible standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stress there is no bias towards farmers but there is a problem obtaining with <Col N="630" /> regard to section 12 notices.  In the past Waterford County Council have written to potential &mdash; I stress potential &mdash; polluters requesting written proposals for the elimination of pollution.  The type of information required would be building drawings, details of animal numbers, tonnage of silage made in relation to the provision of tanks and so on to deal with the potential problem.  This was a very fair approach because it allowed the farmer the opportunity of consulting the Teagasc or other advisers before the proposals were presented to the county council.  The county council could, under section 12, direct the farmer to carry out whatever works they deemed fit.  The council would prefer to agree the proposals in co-operation with the farmer but the Department have advised the council that they are not entitled to seek information under section 12.</P>
    <P>Section 23 allows the council to require written details from an actual polluter but does not allow for the obtaining of such information from potential polluters. In terms of the proper operation of this Bill, that is a very big flaw and one that needs to be addressed.  We will be seeking to address it by way of amendment to section 12 when we come to Committee Stage.  Local authorities, by way of a section 12 notice, should be able to get full information from potential polluters.  The local authorities should have a policing role rather than their role in relation to fire brigade action.  We need to identify potential problems before they happen rather than react to the problems after they have happened as is the case now.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect relating to planning which compounds the problem of section 12 notices.  Development carried out in compliance with section 12 notices is exempt under the Local Government (Planning and Development) (Exempted Development and Amendment) Regulations, 1984, Statutory Instrument No. 348 of 1984.  Under a section 12 notice a local authority may specify the size of tanks required but not <Col N="631" /> their construction and structural design. What this means is that in complying with a section 12 notice, a construction which would be exempted from the requirement of planning permission could, from an aesthetic point of view, be totally undesirable.  Obviously that statutory instrument relates to planning and the requirement for the provision of information in relation to section 12 notices would give the local authority much more effective control in terms of the aesthetic acceptability of the type of construction that was carried out in response to a section 12 notice.  We must try to ensure that scenic areas are not destroyed or damaged from a visual point of view by a construction over which there is no planning control.  The statutory instrument is desirable in as much as it allows for prompt action, but its possible abuse to the detriment of the visual environment must be prevented.  We believe this is central to the effectiveness of local authorities in relation to their pollution and planning role.</P>
    <P>I must again return to what I believe is the central aspect of pollution control and that is the provision of sufficient staff to carry out an effective policing role.  The Clodagh river in County Waterford was chosen for a detailed survey in terms of potential pollution sources.  An examination of 270 potential pollution sources was carried out and 117 of them proved to be in the high or medium risk categories. That was just one small river in a relatively large county.  To effectively survey a farm or a pollution source, it would be possible for an engineer to do only three inspections per day.  The extent of the problem is fairly visible from those figures. Excellent engineers with local authorities are constantly reacting to incidents of pollution.  They are vigorous in their pursuit of providing the best possible environment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lowry said that under the amended Bill the local authorities would be the prosecutors and beneficiaries of <Col N="632" /> legal action.  That seemed to imply that officials of local authorities would act irresponsibly, which is very far from the case.  The approach of the officials of Waterford County Council in relation to the section 12 notices is a very good example of this.  The officials of local authorities and, I am sure, the Minister and her Department are only too anxious to work in co-operation with all sectors, be they industrial, farming or whatever, to eliminate pollution and risks of pollution. To imply that local authorities would be the beneficiaries of fines when polluters are found guilty by the court indicates that they would in some way act irresponsibly, and I find it difficult to go along with that.</P>
    <P>There are essentially agricultural and industrial polluters.  The purpose of this Bill, and the intention of the Labour Party, is not to put unreasonable restrictions on anyone.  Indeed, as regards industrial development there is a balance to be struck.  The country needs industrial development and we very badly need jobs, but good environmental control and industrial development are not necessarily, nor should they be, mutually exclusive.  This new environmental agency is not being used to lessen the role of local authorities.  We should have national standards so that when by-laws are introduced, one local authority, in the interests of attracting industry into its functional area, should not set fines lower than in other areas.  There must be equity throughout the country and national standards and guidelines are very important. The fundamental role rests with local authorities but because of cutbacks they have not got the wherewithal to do their job properly.  There is a need to lift the embargo on the employment of staff in local authorities so that we can effectively come to grips with the growing problem of pollution.  Local authorities must be given the resources and the legal and judicial support to carry out their job effectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party I would like, in general terms, to welcome the Bill and the opportunity it gives us, albeit slightly out of season, to debate the issue of water pollution.  The Workers' Party will be tabling a number of amendments on Committee Stage with a view to strengthening the Bill which has been passed by the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The Bill originated in the summer of 1987, which was the famous fish kill summer, in much the same way as the Air Pollution Act was introduced after a lot of talk about smog and the need for amending the legislation in that area. There was much public concern at the time; there were comments in the media and photographs of dead fish.  The political response from the Government at the time was that they were going to introduce a new, updated, amended Water Pollution Bill.  That was two and a half years ago.  It is a measure of the lack of seriousness on the Government's part to bring in effective measures to combat pollution that, after all the hype about water pollution, we are now only on the Second Stage of the Dáil debate on the new Water Pollution Bill.</P>
      <P>During the first nine months of this year alone the Department of the Marine recorded 108 fish kills in our rivers.  The Department estimate that a total of 35,000 fish were killed in our rivers during those months.  To date they have been unable to put a cost on the restocking of the rivers.  All summer we saw photographs and heard stories about fish kills. I suppose in a way one could say that fish kills are the summer equivalent of smog. I think the public want to know if the Bill we are now debating will stop fish being killed in our rivers as a result of pollution, protect our drinking water and restore the pollution-free nature of our rivers, lakes and coasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the number of dead fish were mounting up over the summer, the Minister of State told us that new tough laws were to be introduced which would force <Col N="634" /> a polluter to pay, in much the same way as she has now promised legislation to deal with air pollution and to ban bituminous coal because of the smog problems. She said that the new legislation will give local authorities the power to introduce new regulations to prohibit certain agricultural and horticultural activities in areas where it is believed that such activities might cause water pollution. That is a little bit different from what we heard tonight and it is certainly different from the public statements made during the course of the summer by the Irish Farmers' Association who said they had succeeded in extracting significant concessions from the Government in the Water Pollution Bill presented to us.  In May of this year the leadership of the IFA said they had got these concessions and described them as somewhat of a victory on their part.</P>
    <P>In the last two pages of her script the Minister referred very briefly to amendments which she will be bringing in on Committee Stage.  We need to have some clarification as to whether or not an agreement has been reached with the IFA to water down the provisions of the Bill as originally presented.  With regard to the introduction of regulations, the Minister spoke about amendments relating to procedural matters only and said that the by-laws will not come into effect until approved by the Minister.  The Minister will have the power to approve or refuse them.  This seems to be a fairly significant procedural change from the original amendment and to be very much in line with the statements made by the IFA that they had secured significant concessions from the Government.</P>
    <P>I want to ask this: is the Bill we are looking at on Second Stage the real Water Pollution Bill?  Is the Bill going to be significantly changed on Committee Stage and has the extent to which it is going to be changed already been agreed with the IFA?  It would appear from what Deputy Lowry said that Fine Gael are taking the IFA position on the Bill.  I <Col N="635" /> hope Deputy Shatter comes back into the House during the course of this debate because I would be interested to hear to what extent he concurs with the views expressed by Deputy Lowry this evening which do not seem to sit very easily with the green mantle Deputy Shatter has wrapped himself in during the past year or so.  I look forward to hearing his views on this.</P>
    <P>If we are talking about a watered-down version of this Bill then I very much doubt that the Government's answer to water pollution, which was stated clearly by the Minister of State during the summer months, will effectively tackle the problem of water pollution and prevent the spectacle of dead fish on the banks of rivers.</P>
    <P>Of course, no amount of legislation will solve the problem.  As Deputy O'Shea said earlier, there is the question of the enforcement and implementation of the legislation.  It is fair to say that the Water Pollution Act, 1977, has had a fairly bad record so far as its implementation is concerned.  For example, one of its provisions would have enabled local authorities to draw up water quality management plans in respect of different rivers.  To date, water quality management plans have been drawn up for only four rivers and so far as I am aware there has been no case where the Minister has given a direction to a local authority to draw up a water quality management plan.  If an enabling provision of the 1977 Act was not acted upon and the Minister did not give directions to local authorities to act upon it, what confidence can he have that the enabling provisions in this Bill will actually be acted upon and put into effect?</P>
    <P>There is also the question of public confidence.  Much of the public controversy which has arisen in regard to the whole environmental area has to do with the fact that the public do not have confidence in the monitoring and implementation of effective pollution control <Col N="636" /> measures.  It has been pointed out that there is a degree of industrial pollution. In 1980 there was a spillage of PCBs into the Breagagh and Nore rivers from a local brewery.  In a recent reply to me the Minister for the Marine said that there were no fish mortalities and suggested that all was now fine in those rivers.  Yet a letter from his Department to the Southern Regional Fisheries Board in May 1987 stated that the most recent results available to them concluded that these levels of PCBs were still high and gave cause for serious concern.  They went on to say that they had written to the South-Eastern Health Board and Kilkenny County Council strongly recommending that a complete prohibition should exist on the taking of fish for human consumption in the Breagagh and Nore rivers for a distance of one mile up-stream of the weir and three miles down-stream.  They wrote that letter in the middle of 1987 and last week the Minister said there was no problem with eating fish out of them.  Yet we know that PCBs are annex one materials which are long lived, persistent and bio-accumulable and I find it very difficult to believe that during that relatively short space of time, having survived since 1980, they would suddenly disappear.  There is the serious question about public confidence. How can the public be sure that there is effective control of pollution?</P>
    <P>There is great emphasis in the Bill &mdash; this was also stressed by the Minister in her speech &mdash; on the importance to catch polluters and a new section has been inserted giving an aggrieved party power to take legal action against a polluter.  I was interested to learn that Fine Gael believe this will give rise to troublesome neighbourly relations between farmers. The problem is, how does one catch and identify polluters?  There have been very few prosecutions for water pollution.  We are all aware of the problem in relation to staffing.  This was highlighted by Deputy O'Shea.  For example, each of the regional fishery boards have but one <Col N="637" /> water pollution officer although it must be stated that their record is quite good. The Northern Regional Fisheries Board, for example, last year had more prosecutions on their own than all the local authorities together.  That is not a reflection on local authority staff who are responsible for this work; it is more a reflection on the type of political culture in which we live and the way in which the whole question of pollution control is dealt with.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have difficulty in trying to catch polluters.  First, the onus of proof provision makes it difficult to get a conviction.  It is possible to put up a good defence because of the loopholes that exist in the Act and I am glad that the Bill contains new provisions to close those loopholes.  It is my hope that they will not be watered down although the Minister's brief comment does cause me a degree of concern.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem in that before an officer from a local authority returns to his office or laboratory after taking a sample from a farm or an enterprise some Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil councillor, or perhaps a TD, will have made representations by telephone not to proceed with a prosecution.  Local authorities, and the regional fisheries boards, are bombarded with political representations not to pursue with pollution prosecutions.  That is the political culture in which we live.  Up to the time that the whole question of the environment took centre stage in the political agenda the dominant political approach was to put the matter on the back burner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of her speech the Minister referred to the need to minimise bureaucratic interference in the everyday activities of the farming community but there is a phenomenon that is well-known to the Revenue Commissioners.  It must be heartbreaking for them to find that many of the small farmers who have liability <Col N="638" /> for tax are quite prepared to pay a lot of money to an accountant to tell them that they have no liability for tax but are not prepared to allow the man from the Department into the yard.  That has been a big problem and it will continue to be. It is what is at the back of the considerable representations that have been made by the IFA in particular in relation to the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of what happens in particular areas.  For example, at a recent Bord Pleanála hearing about Kerry Milk Products of Listowel, concerned with the issuing of a licence under the Water Pollution Act, an officer from Kerry County Council gave evidence of his experience at that plant which was to the effect that on each occasion he turned up to take a sample he was delayed at the gate.  He was told he would have to put on protective clothing and so on.  He suspected that he was being deliberately delayed at the gate in order that the contents of the sump could be diluted.  In evidence he said he hid on a bank overlooking the plant, sent a colleague to the gate, the colleague was duly delayed and as a result of a telephone call between the gate and a control centre there was a flurry of activity in the yard.  That confirmed his suspicion that the contents of the sump were being diluted.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that various means are being used to try to avoid inspections, sampling and so on.  In the course of his contribution Deputy Lowry made big play of his belief that agriculture was not the main cause of water pollution. I tend to concur with what the Minister had to say about the extent to which agriculture contributes to water pollution.  If agriculture contributes so little to water pollution why is it that we have been told that the EC are providing £140 million in anti-pollution grants for farmers aimed at covering unauthorised spillages into rivers and lakes?  That is an extraordinary amount of public money to spend on the problem of pollution which we are told does not exist or, if it does, <Col N="639" /> is of a minor nature.  The irony is that those grants are to be used to deal with various tanks, pits and so on on farms which were grant-aided.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was first published there was an hysterical and sustained attack on it by the farming lobby, and by the IFA in particular.  For example, the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> devoted its pages week after week to attacking many of the provisions of the Bill and they published what can only be described as a misleading analysis of the Bill by some lawyers. Having whipped the farmers of the country into a state of frenzy about the Bill the IFA then set about lobbying the different political parties.  The result is that the Bill, which in our view needs to be strengthened, is to be made weaker.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned that the Government have capitulated to this lobby.  The IFA have reported to their members that a number of significant concessions have been made following their lobbying.  We will have to wait for the Minister's amendments before the extent of that will be known.  It is worth bearing in mind that since the Bill was published there has been a considerable amount of public debate about the environment.  It would be very unwise of the Government to concede to the farming lobby in the way that was announced earlier this year having regard to the degree of public concern about the environment.  Since June we have had many fine sounding statements about what is to be done about water pollution but we need to be told what has been agreed with the IFA.  The Minister should clarify this when replying. She should clarify what exactly has been agreed with the IFA, if there has been a cave in by the Government to the hysterical campaign whipped up about this Bill and if the amendments she is proposing to introduce are similar to the amendments Deputy Lowry's party intend introducing.</P>

      <P>Ten years ago over 1,200 people were employed in the tanning industry.  Today the number is barely 100, despite a huge increase in cattle slaughtering resulting from the phasing out of live exports.  In addition, the quality of hides nowadays is far superior because of advanced skinning techniques and the virtual elimination of the warble fly.  The Government proposed to create jobs using native raw material wherever possible, but the reality is very much the reverse where tannery jobs are concerned. The traditional tannery towns of Carrick-on-Suir and Portlaw have been devastated by unemployment.  I challenge any Member of this House to tell me that there is a town in their constituency which has a higher rate of unemployment than either Carrick-on-Suir or Portlaw.  I could virtually say that Portlaw is a ghost town because of the collapse of the tanning industry there, which was better known as Irish Leathers.  Carrick-on-Suir is not much better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own town of Dungarvan there was an announcement this week that the 55 jobs in the local tannery are going to be reduced by 15.  Even at that it is still the largest tanning enterprises in the country.  I am aware that there is also some tanning of leather going on in Clonmel by the Ronan family, but it is all very minor in comparison with what we had. The extent of the treatment of hides is not what it should be.  I am not criticising those doing it, but there is enormous scope for further value added in this sphere.  Instead of having 100 jobs we <Col N="641" /> could have several thousand jobs if we processed the raw material to its ultimate value.  If the full value added product, that is finished leather and leather goods, such as shoes and clothes, were manufactured in Ireland we could have thousands of extra jobs.</P>
    <P>The related meat industry has gone ahead in leaps and bounds while the processing of the by-product &mdash; the hide &mdash; has virtually stopped.  The vast majority of hides are exported and we then buy them back as the finished product at a multiple of the original cost.  We may get a measly few million pounds for the hides we export, but more than likely we buy back leather clothes, shoes and handbags for hundreds of millions of pounds.  These products are manufactured in countries such as Germany and Italy and fetch premium prices.  It is absolutely incomprehensible and extraordinary that we cannot have a tanning industry which will bring the raw material to the final stage for manufacturing purposes and that manufacturing itself is not carried out in this country.  As I said, seeing that the meat industry, a related industry, has advanced so far, it is hard to believe that the tanning industry has gone backwards.</P>
    <P>We are long overdue a new tannery to provide badly needed jobs to complement advance processing in the beef industry.  It will have to be a green field operation; there is no doubt about this. The fact is that tanning is very harmful to the environment.  There is a very high environmental risk involved, and I can foresee problems setting up a new tanning industry.  It has caused problems and with a growing awareness of the value of a clean environment it is going to be extraordinarily difficult to set up a tanning industry which will satisfy the environmentalists, but it has to be done.  It should have been done years ago.  As I say, it is ten years since the industry first got into serious trouble.  I am not criticising anybody because previous Governments as well as this one have had to face the same problems in attaching foreign <Col N="642" /> investment and I am aware that the IDA have been trying hard, although I sometimes wonder if they have been trying hard enough.</P>
    <P>From time to time we have heard that German or Italian industrialists are coming to this country to set up a tanning industry.  More recently there have been stories that an Australian concern is coming to Ireland to set up such an industry. I hope this latest story is true because people in Dungarvan, Carrick-on-Suir and Portlaw no longer believe politicians when they say an industry is coming.  I would like the Minister this evening to give some assurance that there is a definite proposal on the table.  It is extremely badly needed and we would be very gratified if he could give us such an assurance.</P>
    <P>I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to allow the remainder of my time to be divided between Deputy Davern and Deputy Ferris who have asked me to allow them speak on this subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deasy for sharing some of his precious time with Deputy Davern and me to enable us to speak on what is a very important subject for all of us in the constituencies of Waterford and South Tipperary.  Deputy Deasy has referred to his worries about Portlaw.  All of us in this House, including yourself, a Cheann Comhairle, share the concerns of the people living in Carrick-on-Suir, who feel really hard done by because of the closure of the major tannery industries there, Plunder and Pollock and Irish Leathers.  The co-operative movement in the town, comprising the employees of the companies I have referred to, tried to raise funds through the trade union movement, industrialists, shopkeepers, chambers of commerce and others put together a package which was approved by the Government and the IDA following a feasibility study.  Indeed, <Col N="643" /> a predecessor of the Minister, Deputy Smith, announced the sanction of 25 jobs with the co-operative movement in Carrick-on-Suir. However, nothing happened despite tremendous publicity.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Deasy said, many people are unhappy with our efforts because they have not come to fruition.  As Deputy Deasy also said, there was an announcement recently that an Australian enterprise would be coming to this country, but I would like to see a full bovine tanning industry in Carrick-on-Suir where there is a tragically high level of unemployment.  I feel the National Development Corporation, the IDA, the Government and the co-operative movement would be prepared to fully support such an industry which was native to Carrick-on-Suir and which provided tremendous employment. There is a market for that product, a by-product of the bovine industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deasy for sharing his time with me.  I think he got to the kernel of this issue, the environmental aspect.  The time to strike is when the iron is hot.  Last week people from Australia came here to take a look at the tanning industry.  It is vital that the IDA act on this, but the longer they take the harder it will be to attract a tanning industry to this area.  An old saying in Carrick was that there was no smell off the money, that there was good money out of it.  The smell, unfortunately, may be a problem in the future and there will be a major problem in relation to river pollution as well.  Now is the time to get working while people appreciate that there is need for the jobs and can remember what the old institute was like, and how tolerant of it people were because of the jobs that had been created.  Any modern industry however, would have to take much more care in regard to air pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disgraceful that while we are exporting so much meat, we are not using the added value of the hide.  I urge the <Col N="644" /> Minister to give an assurance that the IDA are doing everything possible to have the industry placed in Carrick-on-Suir where there are skills and the knowledge needed for it.  The factory would also serve Deputy Deasy's constituency down there.</P>

I urge both the Government and the Minister to do all in their power to rectify the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to the mid-seventies there was a strong leather industry in Ireland.  It centred around the activities of the Irish Leather Group which had plants processing bovine and sheep hides into leather in locations such as Portlaw, Gorey, Carrick-on-Suir, Dungarvan and Carlow.  At peak it employed 1,200 persons and in 1977 had a turnover of £25 million.  The mainstay of its market was the supply of shoe leather primarily to local but also to UK manufacturers.  Since then, in common with major portions of the tanning industry in developed countries it fell into serious decline and the Irish Leather Group closed in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="645" /> The past 15 years have seen the rapid growth of the East Asian and South American leather industry and the rapid contraction of the industry in Northern Europe and North America.  The significant rise in cheap footwear from developing countries to Northern Europe and North America has eroded the market since of the local footwear manufacturers in these markets.  This in turn has impacted on the tanneries in the developed countries forcing many to close.</P>
    <P>Those declining shoe producers have resorted increasingly to imported, cheaper leathers and footwear components in order to hold down their costs. The overall result has been a great increase in international trade in raw hides, leather and leather footwear and the severing of the traditional link between a tanner and his local footwear producers.</P>
    <P>It has long been recognised that Ireland has strengths in the area of hide quality and availability which could potentially form the basis of a competitive integrated leather industry.  The hides are large, healthy, warble free and are available in high volume in a small geographic area where hide ownership is concentrated. Irish hides are in the main suitable for high quality uses, for example, upholstery.  Industry experts who have recently examined the sector predict a worldwide growth of demand for all main types of leather up to the year 2000.  The biggest increase in demand is predicted to occur in the upholstery area where the average growth rate is put at approximately 16 per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>It would appear therefore that the opportunity for Ireland lies in the high growth upholstery and miscellaneous sectors for which the quality and characteristics of Irish hides are particularly suitable.</P>
    <P>Given the high percentage of hides being exported unprocessed from this country the IDA have extensively investigated the international bovine leather <Col N="646" /> industry to determine the feasibility of developing integrated leather processing in Ireland.  This work involved visits to a cross section of leading tanneries, as well as industry associations and equipment suppliers in the UK, Germany and Italy. Market investigations were undertaken in conjunction with CTT into certain European and Japanese niche markets.</P>
    <P>The IDA have concluded from these investigations that Ireland can support immediately two modern integrated tanneries. The Authority have been actively promoting the development of new tanning projects for some time and are currently engaged in discussions with a number of promoters towards this end.  I am happy to be able to say that firm proposals for the establishment of an integrated bovine tannery are expected from two of these promoters.  The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to give any further details concerning these discussions at this stage.</P>
    <P>While Ireland has undoubted strengths as regards quality of hide availability, access to and expertise in the latest leather processing technology and in marketing will be crucial to the success of any new venture that emerges.  While I would be hopeful that a project will emerge from the discussions just referred to I would point out that the IDA have already approved grant assistance to Carrick-on-Suir Co-operative for the development of a finished leather processing project which could lead to the creation of 25 new jobs.  This project has not yet got off the ground.</P>
    <P>What I have had to say so far relates mainly to the bovine leather industry. However I would like to point out that the development of processing in the ovine leather sector is also being actively promoted. Indeed, I am happy to say that the IDA are at present finalising discussions on a project for the finished processing of sheep skins.  This project could lead to the creation of 40 new jobs at full production.  The Deputy will appreciate <Col N="647" /> in this case also that I am unable to give any further details.</P>
    <P>Overall, I want to assure the Deputies and the House that everything possible is being done to increase substantially on the level of hide and skin processing activity.  In view of the very competitive and ever-changing nature of the finished leather market-place, it is vital that we secure promoters with the necessary production-technical and marketing expertise and a fair bit of financial clout behind them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the urgency of the future of Irish Steel.  Grave doubts have been expressed by the unions and the workforce regarding the security of the 640 jobs directly involved and the other 500 jobs dependent on the steel plant.  The loss of such a huge number of jobs in the greater Cork area will have a devastating effect not alone on the city and county but on the country as a whole.  Since 1985 workers and management have made a magnificant effort in turning Irish Steel around.  It is vital now that the Minister give a guarantee that any deal by the German Korf KG Company will specifically copperfasten the future of the plant. The proposed £60 million deal has now been scrapped because the banks could <Col N="648" /> not guarantee the money and the workers are now completely in the dark about any new deal which might have been drafted by the Minister and the German interests.  The Minister has a duty to spell out in the House tonight what this new deal involves for the workers and the future of Irish Steel particularly in view of the reply given to the Dáil this week by Deputy Des O'Malley, Minister for Industry and Commerce when he said that the reason for the delay was that the purchaser had not met a number of his contractual obligations.  Are the Minister and the Government now saying that these contractual obligations have been met and workers who were guaranteed protection for seven years under the old agreement have nothing to fear under the new agreement?  The workers and management had responded positively to the proposed original deal.  There is an onus on the Minister to outline what action he has taken and what guarantees he has received.  Fears are being expressed by responsible trade union negotiators, responsible shop stewards and by a responsible workforce who now view the Irish Steel deal with a certain amount of apprehension and suspicion. It was suspected that Irish Steel would be privatised so that the assets could be sold off.  The events of the last two days have done nothing to dispel those fears.  The Minister tonight should once and for all clear the air and make a statement to allay the fears of the hundreds of workers and their families who depend on Irish Steel for their livelihoods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan for sharing his time with me.  Up to the end of 1987 Irish Steel received financial backing by way of shareholders' share capital to the amount of £125 million.  They received Government loans of £18 million, Government grants of £2.7 million and guarantees over loans and leasing facilities and bank advances totalling £20.1 million.  The <Col N="649" /> extent of this investment has my full support, as I felt that if this country was ever to enlarge its heavy industrial base Irish Steel would have to play a central role in its development.</P>
      <P>Since 1985, when EC rules prohibited further State aid to European steel manufacturers, Irish Steel met the challenge head on.  There were considerable sacrifices on the part of the workforce.  Since the restructuring of Irish Steel in 1985 one-fifth of the workforce has been made redundant.  The remaining workers had to accept a wage freeze, the first pay freeze ever in the Irish public sector.  This is something the chief executive officer of Irish Steel, Mr. Liam Coughlan, acknowledged when he said that no other public sector company introduced that kind of draconian measure.  Adding to the problems of the company was the cost of energy.  The Irish Steel furnace is the largest single user of electricity in the ESB national grid.  The ESB bills amount to on average £6 million annually, which is approximately £1 million higher than the average cost to other European plants.  In 1987 when the Minister, Deputy Albert Reynolds, stated that there was no question of further Government financing of losses for Irish Steel, despite the warning by the Minister, the company chairman, Mr. Hugh O'Connor, said that at that time the objectives of the company to return to profitability in a period of three to four years was on line.</P>
      <P>The fortunes of Irish Steel must be linked to the fortunes of the construction industry.  When things are looking brighter for the Irish construction industry it is not very considerate to taxpayers to hand over Irish Steel into private hands, particularly when the taxpayers carried it through difficult years.  More buoyancy in the construction industry will certainly bring more home-based trade for Irish Steel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can one blame the workers now for expressing their fears to their trade unions about their future?  Having made <Col N="650" /> sacrifices to ensure that the company would survive they are now told that the original £6 million escrow proposals are being stopped and that the latest proposals are in no way adequate to ensure the survival in Irish Steel of 640 jobs.  As late as 26 October this year, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions had a meeting with representatives of Korf and posed some very important questions to them regarding the future of the jobs at Irish Steel.  The unions requested sight of the feasibility business study.  They were told that the business plan was of a highly confidential nature but that an engineer would be made available to the unions to discuss the matter.  I would like to know if this offer is still open under the new plan.  The union also put to the representatives of this company the question of whether all existing agreements would be honoured and continued.  They were told that agreements reached would be honoured. I would like to know if this is still the case.</P>
    <P>The company were then asked specifically if the existing workforce of 640 to 650 workers would be guaranteed for seven years.  A guarantee was given that not alone would the workforce continue at that level but that it would be increased to 720 when the company was up and running. The unions then asked if the job guarantees would be under-written and it was explained at some length that the best guarantee for the future of Irish Steel would be the infusion of new investment and that as the investment came from Korf no futher commitment would be needed.  In view of the drastic reduction in the amount of the investment now proposed, do these guarantees stand? The question of the continuity of service and whether it would be specifically guaranteed was also raised.  That guarantee was given.  The unions asked about the question of training in the company. At that time, as late as 26 October, there was a guarantee given that training would continue.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied that this very <Col N="651" /> valuable asset is not going to be sold for a peppercorn, as the new agreement would now suggest?  The lives of too many people depend on it.  There are 640 people directly involved and there are the ancillary industries in the greater Cork area which are dependent on activity in this very valuable asset.  Is it to be sold for something far short of what the country and its taxpayers' have invested in it?</P>

      <P>Having worked in the company for several years I am in a different <Col N="652" /> situation from most others.  I would have more knowledge of the company.  I would like to see the original agreement adhered to.  I am <i>au fait</i> with what was proposed and would support it totally, as would the workforce.  Our three major concerns were allowed to die in the 1984-85 period.  I refer to Verolme Dockyard, Dunlops and Fords.  We would ask the Minister to ensure that Irish Steel does not suffer a similar fate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Steel, based at Haulbowline, County Cork, employ approximately 640 people in what is by international standards a small mill.  They produce approximately 280,000 tonnes of mainly structural sections which generated a turnover in the year ended 30 June 1989 of £80 million.</P>
      <P>Until this year, however, profitability had been a persistent problem, with sizeable losses being the general rule.  The primary reason for the upturn in the year ended 30 June 1989 was the exceptionally high demand for structural steel throughout Europe.  The £80 million turnover achieved in 1988-89 represented an increase of 40 per cent on their 1987-88 turnover of £58 million.  It is not, however, possible to predict for how long, or if, demand will remain at present levels and already there are some signs of softening in the market.  Indeed, the product range produced by Irish Steel Limited is in the commodity area and is particularly susceptible to price and volume movements arising from changes in the level of overall demand.</P>
      <P>Over the years Irish Steel Limited have received total Government support amounting to roughly £190 million made up of equity, grants, repayable advances and State guarantees.  Of this, £143 million has been advanced since 1982 and cumulative losses as at 30 June 1989 amounted to £97.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Needless to say, company losses and State advances of this magnitude were not sustainable and the realism of that situation was reinforced in 1985 by the <Col N="653" /> adoption at European Community level of rules prohibiting State aid for European steel manufacturers.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, it was made repeatedly clear to Irish Steel Limited that it was up to them to review the whole range of their operations with a view to containing costs and ensuring that the company were in a position to generate the funds needed for ongoing investment. This was the reason the company had, since 1985, been engaged in a search for a suitable foreign company which could be of assistance in this regard, unfortunately without success.</P>
    <P>It was against this background that the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, in the course of 1988, had been seeking to identify a commercial partner that would ensure the future viability of Irish Steel.  The Korf proposal, which is the subject of the current motion, appeared to offer substantial benefits to Irish Steel, including the following: development of higher quality product lines with access to new specialist markets; installation of new or improved technology, including the possibility of an energy optimising furnace, which would improve productivity and overcome the problems associated with the power demands of Irish Steel Limited's present electric arc furnace; and development of an iron smelting plant on the Shannon Estuary which would provide Irish Steel Limited with a secure source of pig iron at relatively stable prices.</P>
    <P>In essence, the Korf proposal envisaged a thorough upgrading of ISL operations by switching from vulnerable, low priced highly competitive commodity products of the present structure to special higher grade products which are not as susceptible to cyclical fluctuations in price and demand.  The plan also envisaged a significant reduction in the cost per tonne of steel produced, an increase in the volume of production by bringing the existing facilities into full capacity utilisation, and an increase in the quality through the production of special steel.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" /> To achieve these objectives, a sizeable investment programme was promised, involving substantial expenditure at Haulbowline, the Shannon Estuary and in respect of a steel finishing plant in south-west Germany, which would be a subsidiary of ISL and service the local market in high quality steels.</P>
    <P>While the general outline of the Korf plan had been formulated before the end of 1988, it was not until after signature of the acquisition agreement in May of this year that the proposed purchaser began preparation of a comprehensive assessment of the plant as part of a feasibility study for the overall project.  This formed the basis for the submission of a full business plan on 13 September which, however, only contained very broad proposals in relation to the Shannon aspect of the project.</P>
    <P>Consultants had already been retained by the Department of Industry and Commerce and their interim report on the Korf business plan was received in the beginning of October.  The intervening period has been taken up with attempts to address those areas of concern identified in the consultants' report and with efforts to ensure that the undertakings of the purchaser will, in fact, be complied with.  In this regard, I should say, in response to queries about the reason for the continuing delays and deferral of deadlines, that this is at least in part attributable to changes which have been made by the purchaser in respect of elements of his proposed financing.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Government's concern is to secure the future of Irish Steel and their workforce without further State subvention.  The current relatively prosperous state of the steel market is only a temporary reprieve from a situation in which, as Irish Steel readily acknowledge, there is a need for some form of association with a foreign joint venture partner who can bring much needed finance and marketing and technological resources.</P>
    <P>The Korf proposal has the potential to <Col N="655" /> satisfy these needs, to the extent &mdash; and I want to stress this &mdash; that it can be adequately demonstrated that it will fulfil the various promises made.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I do not consider the deferral of deadlines as wasteful delays but rather as the carrying out of a due diligence exercise on behalf of the company, their employees and the taxpayers of this country.  There is nothing to be gained by allowing a deal to go through that does not represent the best deal possible for the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" /> I want to assure the Deputy and the House, however, that there is no question of a sale proceeding unless the Minister and the Government are fully satisfied that the purchaser's plans represent the best technical, marketing and financial option for the company, that the resources are available to implement that option, and that the investment proposals promised by the purchaser will be carried out in full.</P>

    <P>Great Southern Hotels have recorded increasing profits over the past few years, <Col N="463" /> moving from a loss of £206,000 in 1984 to a nett profit of £732,000 in 1988 with a further significant increase projected in 1989.</P>
    <P>The Board of Great Southern Hotels are of the view &mdash; which I share &mdash; that if the group are to further improve their performance and make the maximum possible contribution to the development of tourism they must obtain additional capital beyond what they could generate from their own resources.  Deputies will be aware that several offers for the purchase of the group were received last year which were not successful.</P>
    <P>Since then, further approaches have been made to the board.  A number of private interests have also approached me directly in this matter but, in all cases, I have referred them to the board.  The board are currently considering these and other possibilities for the injection into the company of the additional capital necessary for continued success.  I expect to receive the board's considered views on the various possibilities in the near future.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years the main unions concerned have been kept informed of developments.  It is my intention to ensure that workers in the group will continue to be advised as appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the reason the long-term unemployed, of which there are 100,000, are not benefiting from the increase in job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with the contention in the Deputy's question that the long-term unemployed are not benefiting at all from increased job creation.  The impact of enhanced employment prospects on the long-term unemployed, however, is less than on other categories on the labour market.  This situation is a central preoccupation of employment policy and adjustments have been made which aim to facilitate and encourage employers to recruit from those without work for in excess of one year.</P>
      <P>The most recent figure for long-term unemployment relates to April of this year.  At that stage, there were 104,500 people on the live register for over a year. This was a reduction of 6,500 on the number of long-term unemployed in April 1987.</P>
      <P>Over the two year period, male long-term unemployed fell by 8,000.  There was a slight rise in long-term unemployed among women, due in part to changes in the regulations affecting women's entitlement to unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>Frequently the problems which the long-term unemployed face in efforts to re-enter employment are more intractable than apply to others.  Skill and educational deficiencies, motivation and opportunity awareness considerations can reinforce difficulties in getting access to available employment openings.</P>
      <P>An aspect which causes me considerable concern, is the attitude of some employers to recruiting those out of work for more than one year.  While employers clearly have the right to recruit those whom they consider to be the most suitable for the jobs on offer, a bias against the long-term job seeker is often a silent feature of recruitment policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Policy measures have been put in place <Col N="465" /> to rectify these deficiencies.  Special training provision is available to this category of worker and incentives to employers to recruit the long-term unemployed, have been provided.  In addition, there is the social employment scheme where the recruitment targets have been revised upwards by 1,000 over the next 12 months.  Increased Structural Funds provision in the period immediately ahead should also have a positive impact on the employment opportunities available to this grouping.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that these interventions, some of which have been very recently introduced, will result in more employment opportunities for this section of the unemployed.  I fully share the Deputy's concern at the gravity of this problem and I will continue to keep the situation under review.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that I intend to make the problem of the long-term unemployed the major item on the agenda of the Irish Presidency of the EC in the Social Affairs area.</P>

      <P>While the provision and control of pre-school services is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Health, I understand that some semi-State bodies and private sector companies do provide crèches and/or child care facilities for their employees.  Due to the fact that at present there is no statutory registration or supervision of pre-school services, no official record of the number of organisations providing these facilities are kept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Child Care Bill, 1988 (Part VI) aims to provide for the compulsory registration and supervision of all pre-school services.  The new legislation, when in place, will put the onus on any <Col N="466" /> person proposing to carry on a pre-school service to notify the relevant health board, which will be empowered to undertake inspections periodically.  The health boards will then have an official record of all pre-school services including those operated by semi-State bodies and companies.</P>

      <P>The present position is that the employment regulation order made by the Catering Joint Labour Committee covers part-time and full-time workers in most of the catering and fast food industry throughout the State, except the county boroughs of Dublin and Cork and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>The ERO made under the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, fixes statutory rates of pay and regulates statutory conditions of employment in establishments who are engaged in the preparation of food or drink or the service of food or drink or in work incidental to the preparation and service of food in a catering establishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" /> It is open to any trade union or organisation claiming to be representative of any class, type or group of workers to apply to the Labour Court to have the employment regulation order with respect to the catering industry extended to those areas currently excluded.</P>
    <P>There are at present no joint labour committees for the retail trade.  However, a registered employment agreement exists in this area which covers wholesale or retail establishments in Dublin and Dún Laoghaire whose business is the sale of footwear, clothing, headgear, drapery or haberdashery.  This registered employment agreement sets out minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment of workers in establishments affected by the agreement.</P>
    <P>Parties to an employment agreement who are substantially representative of the appropriate workers and employers can apply to the Labour Court to have that employment agreement registered with the court.

It is open to any trade union or organisation <Col N="468" /> claiming to be representative of any class, type or group of workers to apply to the Labour Court for the establishment of new joint labour committees.</P>
      <P>In hairdressing establishments located outside these areas pay and other conditions of employment of workers are a matter for negotiation between employers and workers or trade unions acting on their behalf.  Under the Industrial Relations Acts disputes in relation to pay, hours of work or annual leave may be referred to a Rights Commissioner in cases where a small number of workers is involved, or to the Labour Court where a group of workers is involved.</P>

      <P>The legal provision, whereby a minimum of 75 per cent of the European Social Fund was earmarked for operations for young persons, expires on 31 December 1989.  Under the new regulations governing the ESF from 1 January 1990, there is no specific distinction in the budget of the Fund between young persons and adults.</P>
      <P>The provision earmarking 75 per cent for young persons was adopted by the Council in 1983, when youth unemployment was a growing phenomenon throughout the Community.  In recent years, however, it has become clear that adult unemployment, and especially adult long-term unemployment, merited a higher priority and the provision in favour of under-25s has, therefore, been revoked.  Youth unemployment still remains a priority category for ESF purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1989, a sum of £500,000 was included in my Department's Vote for the payment of grants for the provision of advisory services for emigrants.  This <Col N="474" /> compared with a sum of £155,000 which was provided in 1986.</P>
      <P>In the context of the increased allocation, DÍON decided to undertake a reevaluation of the basic strategy which should underlie their recommendations on future funding for voluntary emigrant welfare bodies.  In the course of this exercise, DÍON reviewed the existing provision for emigrant welfare in Britain and considered the best means of identifying currently unmet needs.</P>
      <P>As a result DÍON specified a range of priority concerns on which they proposed to focus their attention in evaluating applications and submissions from voluntary organisations.  These priorities were determined on the basis of consultations with a wide range of Irish community organisations in Britain. Advertisements were published in the Irish community press featuring information on the grant application process and outlining the committee's key priorities, as follows: front-line advice services for emigrants; outreach services for unemployed youths, travellers, women and children in temporary accommodation; day care centre for the elderly; and special projects to assist the unemployed.</P>
      <P>Applicant bodies had to complete a detailed application form whose comprehensiveness was designed, in the main, to limit or obviate the need for having meetings or discussions with representatives of the various emigrant welfare organisations.  In some cases, meetings were necessary to examine how previous grants had been applied or where the applicant was unknown to the Committee.</P>
      <P>In all, 46 completed applications were received by the committee.  Interim payments totalling £294,506 were made last July.  The remainder of the grant, amounting to £205,494, will be paid out during the coming month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The processing of the increased number of applications imposed a heavy burden on DÍON, involving a total of 14 meetings of the committee to date this year.  On this basis DÍON met a large number of organisations, both statutory <Col N="475" /> and voluntary, involved in the welfare of Irish emigrants in Britain.  I would like to pay tribute and express my appreciation to the DÍON Committee for the excellent work they are doing in relation to emigrant welfare.  The membership of the committee is mostly voluntary and involves a major commitment of time and effort.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I do not consider it would be proper for me to impose further on DÍON for the purpose of obtaining a list of all the groups with which they have had contacts in 1989, nor do I think it would serve any useful purpose to disclose such information even if it were readily available.</P>

      <P>The package of measures for employment creation announced by me on 27 September 1989 takes account of the Government's desire to initiate special measures in urban disadvantaged areas as outlined in the <i>Programme for Government.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures in the package and details on the present position, where appropriate, are as follows: expansion of the social employment scheme whereby an extra 1,000 people will be recruited from urban disadvantaged areas over the next 12 months.  Since end September, 356 people have joined the scheme from disadvantaged areas; provision of £500,000 from national lottery funds in 1990 to provide assistance towards the cost of materials for community youth training programme projects in urban disadvantaged areas.  My Department are at present considering guidelines prepared by FÁS; establishment by FÁS on pilot <Col N="476" /> basis of a special programme for older long-term unemployed who left school without qualifications.  A number of training workshops are to be included in the pilot exercise in which 50 people will be catered for initially; a suitable curriculum is being prepared at present by FÁS; grants of up to £20,000 under the community enterprise programme towards the cost of establishing work-spaces in disadvantaged areas generally. My Department are considering guidelines prepared by FÁS and potential projects are being identified by FÁS; and FÁS to take a lead role in organising and encouraging community projects and in getting sponsors, etc, for Teamwork, SES, CYTP, etc, in the disadvantaged areas.  FÁS are encouraging local groups to undertake projects by liaising with community leaders, promotiong projects through local media and giving resources for training in project management skills.</P>
    <P>The package also included a number of other measures which will benefit disadvantaged persons generally including: payment of a training bonus of £10 per week to trainees with dependants; revamping and redirecting the employment incentive scheme towards the long-term unemployed, early school leavers and other disadvantaged persons and increasing the overall grant payable to employers to recruit additional workers.</P>
    <P>The package also provided for a change in the payment system under the enterprise scheme whereby the weekly payment would be increased and paid over a shorter period in order to give greater assistance at the start up phase of the enterprise.</P>
    <P>The training bonus and the increased payments under the enterprise scheme and the employment incentive scheme have been payable since 30 October 1989.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the provision of more detailed information would be a day to day matter for FÁS.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>

      <P>On examination by a medical referee she was again considered capable of work.  Payment of disability benefit was therefore refused.  She was notified on 21 November 1989 of this decision and of her right to appeal.  It is the practice, in cases with a background similar to this one, to reserve payment until the claimant has been examined by one of the Department's medical referees.

His means were last assessed in 1984, for unemployment assistance purposes and they have increased since that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport, with regard to many of the locomotives and carriages in the Iarnród Éireann fleet, in view of their poor condition and old age, their tendency to failure, the gross over-crowding on some provincial services at weekends and in the interests of safety, if he intends to provide Iarnród Éireann with sufficient funds in 1990 to replace obsolete stock; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 123 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The funding of Iarnród Éireann's capital <Col N="504" /> programme is a matter for the company as capital grants are not given to the CIE group.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann have recently completed their carriage building programme at Inchicore and provision has been made in their capital programme for 1990 for the acquisition of further rolling stock. The company have assured me that every effort is made, within the resources available to them, to provide an efficient and reliable rail transport service.</P>
    <P>With regard to over-crowding on trains and safety on the railway, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 200 on 7 November 1989 in which I explained the position about these matters.</P>
