      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 4, 3, 8, 9, and 10.  It is also proposed that No. 4 and all Stages of No. 3 shall be taken without debate.  It is further proposed that the proceedings on Committee Stage of No. 8, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments include only amendments set down by the Minister for Justice.  It is further proposed that the Dáil shall meet tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4 p.m.</P>

      <P>I want to put the questions on the Order of Business.  Are the proposals for dealing with Nos. 4 and 3 agreed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not agreed. I want to raise two issues.  Before The Workers' Party agree to item No. 4 being taken without debate we seek clarification from the Taoiseach on the position of the Ombudsman.  There is no provision in the Order of Business for today for taking a motion to reappoint the Ombudsman.  We want to get an <Col N="1550" /> assurance from the Taoiseach that this matter will be dealt with before the Dáil adjourns tomorrow.  We will not agree to item No. 4 being taken without debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply seeking clarification of the position of the Ombudsman before we agree to taking item No. 4 without debate.  Will the issue of the Ombudsman be dealt with before this Dáil rises for the Christmas recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I raised this matter on Tuesday and Wednesday and I will probably have to raise it again tomorrow morning.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would intervene at this stage and give the House an assurance that the necessary resolution will be brought before the House.  There has been no consultation between the Whips and if the order is not made by 4 p.m. tomorrow there will not be an Ombudsman on 1 January.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will take this opportunity to clarify the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, a Cheann Comhairle, if the Taoiseach does not indicate at this stage that a resolution will be on the Order of Business for tomorrow, which I believe is now impossible, obviously he is not going to reappoint the Ombudsman.  In that event we will oppose the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are doing now is ordering business for today and tomorrow. The concerns expressed by Deputy Spring and Deputy McCartan are very real and I think the Taoiseach should say whether the order for today or tomorrow can include anything more than is set out here.  There is another matter I should like to raise when we have dealt with this one.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the motion for the Committee of Public Accounts which has nothing to do with the Ombudsman.  It has been agreed by the Whips, and I think this procedure by the Opposition parties is totally out of order.</P>

      <P>I thank you, Sir.  I take it that in ordering the business for today it is now impossible for the Government to bring in a resolution confirming an Ombudsman for 1 January.  If we agree to this now the business will be set for tomorrow.  As agreed between the Whips, an Adjournment debate will take place tomorrow and no other resolution will be discussed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  For the purposes specified in subsection (I) of this section, `property' shall be deemed to include information.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this amendment I repeat what I said throughout the passage of this Bill through the House.  The Bill could be improved greatly if we accept modern circumstances of crime.  So far as we can see the Bill fails to accept that we are living in an age of modern technology and modern methods of doing everything and of being able to commit crime by using every technology and device such as we discussed under another section last night.  Types of larceny that obtain now did not exist even ten year ago and certainly not when the 1916 Act was <Col N="1569" /> brought in.  In this respect I am trying to put some ideas into the Minister's head that will improve this Bill and make it fit conditions, not just for now but for years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Bill lacks a great deal in not recognising that the crime bosses are the ones making a great deal of money from larceny but they never come to notice.  We have tried to home in on these people by means of the Bill.  In my view the Bill confines itself to physical handling.  It should provide for the crimes of stealing information and the disposal of such information.  If one illegally listens in to a commercial meeting and steals the information so gathered the dissemination of such information should become a crime of unlawful handling.  A company's plans, information or research and development material can be stolen and sold for very large sums of money on the international market to other companies in the same business.  This is carried on by seemingly reputable companies.  It is particularly a fact of life in the pharmaceutical industry.  Many of the large pharmaceutical concerns have branches in this country and they spend £millions.  While I hold no brief for multinationals in that respect, I know people steal such information and make huge profits from selling it on international markets.  A Bill such as this should provide for penalties against such action.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to provide that the Bill deals not only with manual handling and stealing of goods from a shop, a house or a car and trying to sell them somewhere else, I would like to see the scope of the Bill widened to take into account the type of larceny commited today which fetches perhaps great returns for the person who commits the crime and even more so for the person behind the scenes who has the contacts to whom he can sell the information or the research material.  I hope that the Minister will take up this suggestion.  If he feels it is inadequate I hope he will put down an amendment of his own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh has raised a very important point on <Col N="1570" /> which legislative action is needed. Whether this is the best way of dealing with it I am not sure.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's detailed response on this point.  I would like to comment on it later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I also am very interested in hearing the Minister's response to the points Deputy Kavanagh raised.  The year 1916 was a very long time ago.  If this Bill is to stand the test of time in an era when information can be a much more valuable commodity than personal property, serious consideration should be given to the points raised by Deputy Kavanagh.  I am not sure that this is the manner in which to give effect to the concerns he has raised but I should like to hear the Minister's response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is layman's language to speak of information being &ldquo;stolen&rdquo;, in the context of industrial espionage or computer hacking for instance, the plain fact is that information as such is not stolen in the literal and legal sense.  It is possible to steal, say, documents or computer discs which contain information.  There is something tangible stolen which is missing from the owner and is clearly property which could legitimately be the subject of a handling charge.</P>
      <P>Let us be clear, however, about the difference between property, which is larcenable, and information which can perhaps be revealed to or shared with unauthorised persons but cannot in any except a metaphorical sense be said to be stealable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, for example, an employee of Telecom Éireann communicates orally an exdirectory telephone number to someone who should not know it and does so for cash, how can that be said to be stolen property?  A search of Telecom's premises will show that nothing is missing. Similarily the person whose number has been communicated can show nothing missing.  It is not possible to take back the telephone number from the person who paid because he still has the knowledge of it.  Knowledge is not like <Col N="1571" /> property; it cannot be stolen as such and it cannot be restored to its rightful owner.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of information in the definition of &ldquo;property&rdquo; is wholly inappropriate. Handling can only relate to tangible property.  Any change in this law would be a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce who has responsibility for copyright and patent law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only be disappointed with that reply.  I thought we were looking seriously at the amendment. If someone steals computer software which contains information and sells it, I believe that is a crime of handling. We are not talking here about telephone numbers or conversations which may give information.  I am referring to information stored by modern methods. Technology is now so far advanced that a person can make money by passing on information which a company or a person may have.  It has a value and can be transmitted through software, recording or the use of plastic technology of one kind or another.</P>
      <P>If this Bill relates only to the mechanical handling of goods and property it will be of very little use in the fight against crime.  I have tried on other occasions to introduce the necessary changes to the Bill.  The copyright and patent laws are out of date due to modern technology and the recording of other people's works is quite common.  I accept that it is a matter with which the Minister for Industry and Commerce will have to deal.</P>
      <P>We should be dealing in this Bill with a problem that is expanding at an alarming rate.  The Minister told me at an earlier stage that he could interpret &ldquo;believing&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;thinking&rdquo;.  This being the case he should also be able to accept that property is information contained on a floppy disc or something of that nature. I am not stretching my imagination any further than the Minister when he told me that if I believed something I could be considered as thinking it.  The Minister's reply does not satisfy me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1572" />
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to Deputy Kavanagh and the Minister.  Looking at the issue objectively and dispassionately, Deputy Kavanagh's point is well made.  There is need for a legislative response to the stealing of information.  The old saying that information is power is very true, especially in the political and business sense.  Anybody who knows anything about computers knows the modern crime of computer hacking, gaining access to someone else's computer information.  This has raised enormous scandals in other countries but I am not sure if it is prevalent here.  I hope it will not become prevalent, but our experience to date suggests that we will not be immune from the spread of new unlawful acts.  I noticed recently that the United Kingdom were proposing a legislative response to the problem of computer hacking.</P>
      <P>I am worried that the Minister's reply does not indicate any intention whatever to respond to the legitimate points raised by Deputy Kavanagh.  The Minister has made it clear that it is a very complex subject.  He has also made clear why a change should not be made in the context of the present Bill.  He has acted like Pontius Pilate, washing his hands of it, and has made vague references to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. That is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister could make a reasonable case that the specific wording of Deputy Kavanagh's amendment may not be the best way of handling the problem, which is fair enough.  However, if he accepts there is a serious difficulty, he should be able to tell us what the Government are doing about this difficulty.  He has not done this.  We had a similar problem in regard to the Video Recording Bill. Everybody agreed that the Bill was only a partial solution to the problem of video nasties and that changes in the Copyright Bill would also need to be made.  On checking the Official Report we were able to find that 12 months ago there were proposals to change the copyright legislation &mdash; I think the Bill was supposed to be introduced in December 1988 &mdash; but nothing has happened.  When the present <Col N="1573" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce was questioned on the issue on the Order of Business a few weeks ago, he seemed to know nothing about it.</P>
    <P>Changes in the copyright legislation may be a partial solution to the problem raised by Deputy Kavanagh, but it is very unsatisfactory from the Opposition's point of view to be left in limbo.  When a legitimate problem is aired and it is accepted that a legislative response is needed it is unsatisfactory to be told it is the responsibility of another Minister and that something might be done.  I feel strongly that the very minimum Deputy Kavanagh is entitled to expect is a clear commitment that the Government will deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>If the problem is so complex that it needs to be examined by the Law Reform Commission, the Minister should go ahead and do it.  The work the Department of Industry and Commerce have done on the Copyright Bill may be a solution but if so, the Minister should tell us.  I believe he should give a more positive response to the point raised by Deputy Kavanagh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be as helpful as I can.  I fully appreciate the remarks of Deputy Kavanagh and Deputy O'Keeffe.  Stolen property, such as a tape or a disc, can be dealt with under this law but knowledge or information is a different matter.  I gave an example in regard to the information Telecom Éireann are transmitting.  The Law Reform Commission are considering changes in this area and they are the appropriate body to look seriously at this proposal.  I am prepared to put the Deputy's views to the Law Reform Commission as a matter of urgency.  I hope that will be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that everybody who spoke in this House last night or today wants to make the Bill as effective as <Col N="1574" /> possible.  Deputies will appreciate that difficulties will arise in court because of different interpretations of the law. There is no need for me as a layman to go into that as the legal people are well informed on this issue.</P>
    <P>I wish to repeat that I am prepared to take the matter up immediately with the Law Reform Commission to see that appropriate changes can be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister has moved from his position of outright rejection and is now prepared to make some concessions on the point I have raised.  I would be far happier if the Minister were to take action rather than refer the matter to the Law Reform Commission, because the issue of receiving stolen property was referred to the Law Reform Commission as far back as late 1986 or early 1987 and it has taken until now to bring the published report into legislative form.  It could possibly take another two years before we see a new Bill before this House.</P>
      <P>In rejecting my suggestion earlier, the Minister said as it dealt with copyright and patents it was a matter more relevant to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I am glad he is beginning to see the point I was making.  I was not referring to stealing information but to stealing information while it is being transmitted on tape, which makes the tape extremely valuable.  If there was no information on the disc or tape it would be worth about a pound or two but the information contained on the disc or tape makes it extremely valuable.</P>
      <P>In order that the Minister is fully aware that I am serious about the amendment, I will not withdraw it and wish to put the matter to a vote.  I hope the Minister will understand that we are very serious about this proposal.</P>

      <P>I am moving this amendment in the name of my colleague Deputy McCartan.  As you know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I did not get a great deal of notice that the Deputy would not be here to ask questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to <Col N="1577" /> insert a new subsection at the end of section 7 and it is really a provision in ease of the prosecution.  It would simplify the task of the prosecution in a receiving charge.  What is at issue is essentially a technical point on which I should like to hear the Minister.  How an indictment is now framed is obviously dictated by current law and, under current law, in order to prove an indictment it would be necessary to prove how the goods were stolen.  If the law is changed as proposed here, presumably the form of an indictment will require consequential changes and that essentially is the point on which I am seeking clarification from the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Minister needs to fully clarify the point raised by Deputy Rabbitte.  Indeed, there are two points, the first is the reference to goods unlawfully obtained which is a separate issue from goods being stolen, which we debated on Committee Stage and the second point deals with what goes into the indictment.  It is important to ensure that we do not create an escape hatch for an accused person.  We are changing the law and I understand that there are settled procedures in regard to the manner in which the indictment is framed.  The question then arises whether we should provide for a change in those procedures so that we can be sure that the prosecution will not find that the charges are thrown out because the indictment is not properly framed and does not take account of the changes in the law.  If the Minister can satisfy me in that regard we will all feel much happier about the situation.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission suggested that the offence of handling would be committed in respect of goods unlawfully obtained.  They also stated very clearly that it should not be necessary, on a charge or indictment for the offence, to specify how the goods were unlawfully obtained.</P>

      <P>We welcome the thrust and the change in section 7 which means that property stolen in England, Scotland <Col N="1578" /> or Wales, which was not an offence under the previous Larceny Bill, is now covered.  I should like the Minister to say whether he considers that this is a general amendment which should apply to the whole Bill and not just to this section.  I believe it should apply to the whole Bill. I hope the Minister will accept this point.</P>

      <P>This amendment would give partial effect to section 7 in the scheme of a Bill appended to the report of the Law Reform Commission.  This was carefully considered during the drafting of the Bill and the Director of Public Prosecutions was consulted.  He indicated that he is satisfied there is no need for a provision of this nature.  Accordingly, no such provision has been incorporated in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The precise drawing of an indictment will always depend on the facts in each case and that is well known. There may be cases in which, in order to do justice to the accused, it will be necessary to show in the indictment how exactly the property, the subject of the change, came within the definition of &ldquo;stolen property&rdquo;. I hope I have explained that adequately.  I must point out that the Minister did consult the Director of Public Prosecutions in the drafting of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said.  However, I do not know whether he is saying that the Director of Public Prosecutions was consulted with regard to this specific amendment. Essentially its provision is in ease of the prosecution.  Deputy O'Keeffe raised the question of a possible escape hatch purely because of some technical omission in the manner in which the indictment is framed.  In that sense the intention of this additional subsection was to guard against that eventuality.  I am not sure that the Minister has dealt with that point.</P>

From all the information and advice available to me I am satisfied in this respect.  I want to emphasise that the Director of Public Prosecutions was fully consulted and he envisages no need for Deputy McCartan's amendment.  He is quite happy that the relevant section is satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point in relation to this section on which I should like to get some assurance from the Minister. I am focusing on section 7 (2) which replaces section 46 (1) of the 1916 Act.  Essentially it deals with the proceeds of theft.  It is very clear, when we talk about receiving or handling stolen property, that we must cover the circumstances in which such property would have been laundered or changed, say, money having been changed into different denominations, so that there can be a change between the actual item or items stolen and what actually comes into the hands of a receiver or handler.  I am advised by people who have experience in criminal matters that the provisions of section 46 (1) gave rise to many difficulties, that is the provision being replaced.  The Law Reform Commission did examine this issue.  I supose, to some degree, one could contend they handled it with a long fork.  For example, they referred to the provision in the English Theft Act, 1968 and suggested that a new provision, drafted on the lines of section <Col N="1580" /> 24 (2) of the English Theft Act be considered, that that would constitute a useful reform.  As far as I can ascertain that recommendation has been followed. Can the Minister now assure me that the complexities, as highlighted by the Law Reform Commission are resolved or is he satisfied that this new provision has been drafted in the most effective way to ensure that the proceeds of the crime, even if laundered or changed, can be followed through to the receiver or handler so that they be brought to book even where the proceeds of the theft have been laundered in the manner I have described?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This section makes clear what is intended by the expression &ldquo;stolen property&rdquo; in relation to the new offence of handling stolen property provided for in section 3.  In relation to &ldquo;stolen property&rdquo;, whether stolen in the State or elsewhere I should say that section 7 (1) removes an apparent anomaly regarding the receiving in this country or property stolen abroad.  At present section 33 (4) of the 1916 Act provides for the offences of receiving and of possession of property stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained outside the United Kingdom.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supreme Court has held that, owing to a provision in the adaption of the Enactments Act 1922 the provisions of that subsection do not apply to property stolen in England, Scotland or Wales though they do apply to property stolen anywhere else in the world including Northern Ireland.  If he wishes I can give the Deputy additional explanatory information.  I should say that, in this section, we are following the proposal of the Law Reform Commission for change.</P>

Indeed it is a very obvious change that should have been effected &mdash; that property stolen abroad should come <Col N="1581" /> within the ambit of the Bill.  It was subsection (2) on which I was focusing.  Is the Minister now satisfied that that is drafted in a way which will ensure that if goods or money are laundered we can still get at their receiver or handler?</P>

      <P>I anticipated that the Minister might make some reference to the additional subsection (7) our amendment sought to include.  Specifically I was curious about his response to seeking to put a construction on the words &ldquo;unlawfully obtained&rdquo; that could include offences, for example, such as smuggling or various tax avoidance mechanisms; in other words where a person had received what one might call a tax-avoided good, that person would be deemed to be guilty. I had expected some clarification from the Minister on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>

      <P>Section 7(3) refers to property that is restored to lawful possession or custody.  This subsection states:</P>
      <P>For the purposes specified in subsection (1) of this section, no property shall be regarded as having continued to be stolen property after it has been restored to the person for whom it was stolen or to other lawful possession or custody, or after that person and any other person claiming through him have otherwise ceased, as regards that property, to have any right to restitution in respect of the theft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the last part of that subsection imply that the person who is the victim <Col N="1582" /> of the theft has no right to claim for restitution in a civil court?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise with the Minister the question as to how the burden of proof would operate in respect of the offence under this section.  If a person is found in possession of stolen property, does he have to give an explanation as to how he got it or is it a matter for the prosecution to establish his degree of connection with those goods or that property?  Does the fact that the property is stolen put the burden of proof as to how he got those goods on to the person in whose possession the goods were found?  Subsection (1) states: &ldquo;provided that the stealing amounted to an offence&rdquo;.  How could a stealing not amount to an offence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>That was dealt with under section 3 of the Bill and we went into great detail on it.  I think Deputy Taylor will realise that an offence has to be proved.  As he knows, when a person or persons are prosecuted for stealing goods, that has to be proved by the courts.  The provisions are included in section 3 of the Bill to take that person or persons to court.  Maybe the Chair will rule me out of order if I go back on that section and I do not want to create that difficulty.</P>

      <P>I would like to be as helpful as I possibly can to Deputy Taylor.  It would be far from me to be offensive to him.  This whole issue was dealt with in great detail under section 3. As a layman, I think the person or persons who will be brought before the courts will be safeguarded because it has to be proved that they stole the goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be difficult <Col N="1583" /> about this with the Minister of State for whom I have a great regard, as he knows. I am raising a very simple question.  It may well have been dealt with under section 3 &mdash; I am sorry I was not here when that section was taken &mdash; but it is equally relevant to section 7 which deals with the scope of the offence relating to stolen property.  I am asking a simple question and I just want a simple answer. I am not being critical; I am just looking for information.  All I want to know is if a person is found in possession of stolen goods, is the onus of proof thereafter shifted from the prosecution, where of course it normally lies, to the defence? In other words, is it sufficient under this Bill, of which this is a key operative section, for the prosecution to say that the person was found with the goods in his possession and he must say how he got them whether innocently or otherwise, or does the prosecution still have to prove that there was a guilty frame of mind on the part of that person when he got the goods?  I just want guidance from the Minister as to what the position is under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, it is shifted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>My interpretation of the law, as a simple layman, is that in any court today the accused must defend with his counsel but the law is there to protect him as well.  I would refer the Deputy to subsection (4) of this section which refers to this matter.  Deputy Taylor will accept that I have the best legal information at my disposal.  He will appreciate that when this Bill becomes law, any item in it can be contested constitutionally.  When drafting the legislation we received legal advice and this is the opinion of all concerned but I appreciate the points raised by Deputy Taylor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that if <Col N="1584" /> any difficulty arises it can be tested constitutionally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course they can and that is their constitutional right but our function in this House is to try to ensure as far as we can that that does not happen. It is quite relevant, having regard to that subject matter introduced by the Minister, to refer to the fact that the night before last we discussed a Supplementary Estimate for the Office of the Attorney General, introduced by the Minister for Finance.  The sum of money sought in that Estimate was massive and when we asked the Minister what it was for, we were told it was based on the grounds that the State had been taken to the High Court and the Supreme Court many times on these constitutonal actions, which result in huge debts.  There is a limit to what we can do but we must ensure that, in so far as we can, we iron out these difficulties here and not have the State and the taxpayer embroiled in funding the coffers of the legal people by fruitful constitutional actions.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us that he has used the best legal brains at his disposal and I am sure he has.  I do not doubt that for a moment but the legal expertise which has been forthcoming on occasions in the past has proven to be wanting.  It has not always proven to be correct.  There was at least one occasion during my period in the Dáil when some Members expressed reservations about legislation we were debating.  The Minister for Justice assured us that the advice of the best legal brains had been taken, that the Act was A1, and that it was fine but when it was tested in the High Court and the Supreme Court it was not fine.  It was found to be unconstitutional and new procedures had to be brought in speedily.  It do not want to go into the deails now, but if someone wants me to I will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not sufficient for a Minister to come into this House and give a block answer saying &ldquo;Everything if fine.  I have consulted the legal people and you need <Col N="1585" /> not trouble yourself about it any further and that is the end of the matter.&rdquo;  That is not our function here.  The Minister may consult whom he wishes but we are dealing with the matter afresh in this House and we have to use our knowledge and experience as best we can.  All of us have some contribution to make on different aspects.  That is what this House and democracy are all about.  I do not think we should be waved away with the general encompassing statement &ldquo;We have the best legal advice so forget about it, Deputies.  You need not bother about it any further&rdquo;.  When questions are raised that sort of answer should not be given.  We should discuss any points raised on their merits.</P>

      <P>I want to raise a matter with the Minister under section 7 (3) which states:</P>
      <P>For the purposes specified in subsection (1) of this section, no property shall be regarded as having continued to be stolen property after it has been restored to the person from whom it was stolen or to other lawful possession or custody....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1586" /> If the Garda find property which is readily identified and give it back to its rightful owner, could this subsection have the effect of deeming that the goods were no longer stolen property?  Could this affect a prosecution in any way because the Garda restored the property to the possession of the rightful owner?  Is that what section 7 (3) says?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Stolen property ceases to be stolen when it is restored to the owner.  Section 7 (3) provides that so far as the offence of handling is concerned, property ceases to be stolen property when it has been restored to the owner or to other lawful possession or custody, for example, where it has been recovered by the Garda Síochána, or after the owner or anyone claiming through him has otherwise ceased to have any right to restitution in respect of the theft.

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 6, in column (2) of the Table, to delete &ldquo;ten years&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;fourteen years&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Essentially what I am proposing is that the same maximum penalty of 14 years, which is proposed for the receiving or handling of goods, should apply for larceny also.  I want to have the same penalty for both offences.  As drafted the Bill proposes a maximum penalty of 14 years for receiving goods and a maximum penalty of ten years for larceny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that there is an obvious need to indicate how seriously we view the offence of receiving or handling by providing for a substantial maximum penalty but we will be going overboard if we <Col N="1588" /> do not provide at the same time that the person who committed the original crime by stealing the goods should be liable to the same maximum penalty.  The Law Reform Commission stated clearly that the same sentences should apply for larceny and handling.  This proposal which is specifically set forth in paragraph 151 on page 110 of the Law Reform Commission Report makes sense.  While it might be good for the public relations section of the Department to hear the Minister say how seriously he views the offence of receiving and is providing a special maximum penalty for this offence, and even more for larceny, it does not make common sense.  The offence of receiving or handling stolen goods should be considered in the very serious category of offence and this is provided for in the Bill with the maximum penalty of 14 years.  However, we should not go overboard about this.  We should not forget that stealing, particularly grand larceny, can be a serious offence. If goods were not stolen they could not be received or handled unlawfully.  Larceny is the primary offence.</P>
    <P>To restore the balance we should have the same maximum penalty for larceny and receiving and it should be a 14 year maximum.  I am not saying that that penalty should apply for petty larcenies or for minor charges for receiving or handling.  I am suggesting that the maximum penalty for stealing and larceny should be increased from ten years to 14 years. If that suggestion is adopted we will be accepting the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe must be aware that his proposal is a matter of pure academic interest.  During the 30-plus years that I have been watching the results of criminal cases I have yet to see a penalty of ten years imprisonment being imposed by any court for any larceny, receiving or embezzlement charge.  The maximum penalties bear little relation to the everyday enforcement of the law in the courts.  In the UK they operate on <Col N="1589" /> different principles when imposing penalties, and they have the notion of preventative detention for habitual criminals, something that has never been adopted by the courts here, and probably, rightly so.  A penalty of five years or seven years' imprisonment for any of the offences mentioned represent a heavy penalty in terms of those imposed by our courts.  Increasing the maximum penalties from ten to 14 years does not bear much relationship to what goes on in our courts daily.</P>
      <P>The amendment does not tackle the nub of the problems that arise in regard to the imposition of prison terms for such offences.  In my view the major problem is that the penalties imposed for broadly similar offences vary between different judges and justices.  It is well known that judges and justices hold different views on the severity of the sentences that should be imposed.  Some judges and justices take a lenient view and others are known as hanging judges and hanging justices because of the serious view they take for roughly comparable offences.</P>
      <P>A court in Dublin will adopt a certain approach on a regular basis while a court in Cork or Limerick will take a different view.  It depends on the attitude of judges and justices to offences.  Frequently, judges and justices get the notion that they will crack down on a particular offence and announce that they intend imposing heavy penalties for those offences notwithstanding the fact that their colleagues in the next county may be applying the Probation of Offenders Act hand over fist for similar offences. We ought to tackle that problem although I am not saying that we should do so in the Bill.  I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a missing element in the administration of justice here in that discussions do not take place between judges and justices.  As far as I am aware they are never brought together for a seminar to be addressed by senior law officers or senior judges of the High Court or the Supreme Court.  They are never brought together to discuss broad guidelines on sentencing policy.  That is <Col N="1590" /> in marked contrast to what happens in the UK, much as I hate to hold up the UK as an example as far as the administration of criminal justice is concerned. However, on this issue the UK operate a worthwhile system.</P>
    <P>The Lord Chancellor on a regular basis calls the magistrates and junior judges, who carry the major responsibility for sentencing policy, together and puts forward suggested guidelines.  He listens to their views on how the courts operate in their areas.  Broad parameters are discussed for different offences, and that must be good.  At least this introduces into the country as a whole a measure of consistency in sentencing policy.  It is completely untenable that we should have a judge or justice in one part of the country giving the defendant the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act for a shoplifting offence, for example, while their colleagues in a different county regard such offences as serious and impose sentences of 12 months in prison. I am not going into the question of which decision is the correct one but we ought to have consistency in regard to sentencing.</P>
    <P>I accept that no two cases are the same, that all cases differ, but we should have a set of guidelines for the different offences taking into consideration the circumstances of the person charged with the offence.  I would welcome an announcement by the Minister of State that he would ask the Minister for Justice to consider bringing judges and justices together to consider a sentencing policy.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of sentencing policy that is relevant is the attitude adopted by some judges and justices in regard to certain offences.  For example, a district justice may adopt a certain line in regard to people found driving without insurance cover.  That is a serious offence and, unless a good explanation is forthcoming, warrants an appropriate penalty. However, judges and justices often announce in their courts that they regard such offences as serious and that their penalty will be £500.  They carry that policy into effect irrespective of the circumstances of the defendant.  They do <Col N="1591" /> not take into consideration such mitigating circumstances as the person charged not having been before the court on a previous occasion for a similar offence or the financial circumstances of the defendant.  We should have reservations about such a policy.  The means of a person on whom a fine is imposed should be taken into consideration.  A fine of £500 to a company director is a matter of little consequence because he is in a position to write a cheque for that amount but for another person such a fine for an identical offence could be the equivalent of a sentence to 12 months in prison.  That person may not have any hope of raising that money.  It would be a waste of time imposing such a fine on that person and the court would be better to sentence the person to 12 months in prison and have done with the matter.</P>
    <P>The sentencing policy of judges and justices should be exercising the minds of the Minister, and the House, rather than seeking, as Deputy O'Keeffe is in his amendment, an increase in the maximum penalty for an offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the motives behind moving this amendment.  There would be no sense in applying different sentences for the primary offence and the offence of receiving, but I wonder if Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment seeks to do much more than introduce a note of symmetry into the administration of criminal justice in this jurisdiction.  As has been pointed out, this would be largely academic as the maximum term of imprisonment of ten years would rarely be imposed for the habitual type of offence we are talking about.  After all, in the case of criminal offences involving violence the maximum sentence as suggested here would rarely be imposed and very rarely exceeded.  For crimes such as kidnapping a sentence of 14 years would be considered severe and I would have thought, other than for reasons of symmetry and commonsense, it probably would not have very real application.  I do not dispute what the Law Reform Commission have said.  It would make <Col N="1592" /> much more sense if similar sentences for the crimes of larceny and handling were applied.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor has raised an issue which is a source of concern for a great many people, that is, the lack of uniformity in sentencing policy.  Practising criminal lawyers and indeed practising petty criminals could tell us about the major discrepancies in sentences imposed as between one court and another and one judge and another.  I do not think this amendment addresses that problem.  Although I understand the reasons behind moving it I do not consider that it would have a great deal of real application.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer briefly to Deputy Taylor's comments.  I have first hand experience and knowledge of the system in the United Kingdom.  I am not criticising Deputy Taylor's suggestion.  It is a good one and perhaps the Minister of State should consider taking it on board.  I do not know if Deputy Taylor is aware of this or not, but in the United Kingdom where the system he has mentioned is operated there has been a great deal of disquiet in recent years about the problem he has raised, the lack of uniformity in sentencing.  There has also been a great deal of media comment on this problem in recent times.  So far as I am aware, I am speaking from memory now and open to correction, the Lord Chancellor's Office in the United Kingdom examined this problem in the recent past, but nothing concrete came out of their deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read most of the media comment, and suggestions, on this problem in the United Kingdom and unfortunately, I have come to the conclusion that it is not possible to find a solution to it.  As Deputy Taylor readily accepted, we cannot have a system of mandatory sentencing, and mandatory sentences for certain crimes, as the circumstances of each case vary. While I welcome Deputy Taylor's suggestion and support it, I am pessimistic about our chances of finding a solution to this <Col N="1593" /> elusive problem.  In relation to the amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Taylor is aware, if we were to take the English system, county by county, his arguments could be applied but it has not worked there.  If I had anticipated Deputy Taylor raising this point I could have brought in some local English publications which show that this problem is being experienced in different regions.  This problem <Col N="1594" /> gets more media attention when it occurs in a small region.</P>
      <P>In relation to the amendment, as has been rightly said by Deputies Taylor and Rabbitte, it would be largely academic as only in very rare circumstances would the full sentence be handed down.  I am trying to figure out the Minister's thinking behind having different maximum sentences for the crimes of larceny and receiving.  His objective, I think, is to send out a signal that the Government regard receiving as a particularly heinous crime.  In criminal law debates in this House, various justifications have been advanced for ordinary crime, such as sociological and economic problems.  No such justification can be advanced for the crime of receiving.  The people involved in receiving and handling stolen property are in it for the money.  To a large extent, they are middle class, wealthy and organised people.  It is right that the Government should send out this signal although, as has been said, this will be largely academic as only very rarely would the maximum sentence be handed down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government take the view that ten years' imprisonment pitches at about the right level the maximum for larceny and for the other crimes of dishonesty covered by section 9 of the Bill.  This level is in the context of: a maximum of ten years at present for a second or subsequent conviction for simple larceny; a maximum of 14 years for burglary, which as well as possibly including an act of larceny, involves an additional element of entering as a trespasser; a maximum of life imprisonment for robbery, which involves larceny with the additional element of violence or the threat of violence; and a proposed maximum of 14 years for handling, which I regard as generally being a more serious offence than simple larceny.</P>
      <P>I would also remind Deputies that the Law Reform Commission recommended, effectively, a ten-year maximum for larceny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the maximum for larceny is to be increased to 14 years, how is one then to <Col N="1595" /> reflect the more serious nature of burglary offences, unless it is by increasing the maximum for those to, say, 18 or 20 years?  It becomes difficult to comprehend the reality of such extremely long periods; and in any event, to talk in terms of such lengths of sentence raises issues of a much wider nature than it would be in order for us to debate on this Bill.</P>
    <P>The proposed differential between the maximum for larceny and that for handling reflects the present position as between larceny other than on first conviction and felonious receiving.  That differential is designed to reflect the more serious view which society must take of the handling offence, since handlers create a demand for stolen property.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that the maximum sentence for any offence is designed to cater for the most heinous instance of that offence.  Judges have a wide discretion up to the maximum, and when passing sentence they take into account all the circumstances.  Given all that, I am satisfied that the sentence provisions of the Bill as they stand are appropriate, and that the amendment proposed is inappropriate.  I have spelled that out pretty well.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor referred to the Judiciary.  I dealt with the circumstances of the offences and it is a matter for the Judiciary then to decide on sentence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the various points raised but we must bear in mind that the Bill before the House under section 3 provides for a penalty not exceeding 14 years for the offence of handling stolen goods.  The Minister put in the 14 years in relation to handling stolen goods.  The Law Reform Commission were quite clear and explicit in that the same sentence should apply to larceny and to the handling of stolen goods.  I accept the Law Reform Commission said that consideration might be given to applying a period of ten years for both offences, but the basic point was that the same sentence should be applied to both crimes.  That makes sense.  My <Col N="1596" /> amendment seeks to provide the same sentence as that provided for larceny. The Minister having included a 14 year penalty for receiving or handling under section 3 and I am providing for 14 years for larceny and related offences under section 9.</P>
      <P>We are not talking about minor offences here.  Minor offences would be dealt with summarily before the District Court.  He we are talking about a maximum penalty on indictment before judge and jury and we are covering a whole series of larceny offences covered by the 1916 Act.  We are also covering offences like embezzlement fraudulent conversion, obtaining property by false pretences and blackmail.  Those offences can be very serious indeed.  I have come across cases covered by this provision which have been as serious as any charge of receiving or handling that I can think of.  I take the point that we are talking about a maximum sentence and that it can be academic in most cases, but there are situations which would merit the maximum sentence.  From that point of view we as legislators should provide the maximum sentence and then the judge can decide how far he wants to go.</P>
      <P>A number of other points were raised but they are not actually appropriate to the point at issue here.  Deputy Taylor talked about the sentencing policy and perhaps at some stage we should have a full debate here on the question of sentencing policy and penal reform.  It cannot be encapsulated within this debate on the amendment.  I, for instance, have very strong views on alternatives to custody in many instances.  I have strong views in regard to jail not being there for people just because they are poor and cannot pay instalments or whatever. Many changes need to be made but that is a separate question with which I will not get involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point which should be decided by a vote of the House is, are we prepared to follow the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission that the same sentence should be provided for larceny and for handling?  If we are, I seek support for <Col N="1597" /> my amendment.  Are we also prepared to take into account the fact that the offences covered in section 9 can be very serious, for instance, grand larceny, a great train robbery such as that which occurred in the UK, fraudulent conversion and blackmail?  I see no reason a maximum penalty of 14 years should not also be provided here.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept my amendment I will put it to a vote.</P>
    <P>The Bill touches on the close connection between stealing and receiving.  Section 8 refers to alternative verdicts because in some instances there is a blurring of the line as to whether the person before the court was actually a robber or a receiver, and the Bill rightly covers the point that there can be alternative verdicts.  It has to go so far that is somebody is charged with stealing and ultimately it turns out that the person handled the property he can be so convicted, but because of the anomaly of having only ten years for larceny he cannot then be sentenced up to the maximum penalty, he can be sentenced only up to the ten years.  We are creating an anomaly in this Bill by not having consistency.  Whether you go on the basis of consistency or symmetry or whether you are more impressed by the force and logic of my arguments, I ask that we do not create this anomaly, that we have the same maximum penalty.  On that basis I am pushing my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the different categories of offence, is it right to have the same maximum sentence for, say, stealing a dog as for blackmail?  We have provided in section 9 of the Bill a single maximum sentence for a number of offences under the Larceny Act.  First, the maximum sentence for some of the offences under the Act are far too low. Secondly, a single maximum sentence of sufficient severity for all offences of larceny leaves the courts a wide discretion to take into account particular factors relating to an individual offence before imposing an appropriate penalty for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposal is, I believe, in keeping with recent thinking on sentencing policy <Col N="1598" /> in general.  It simplifies the law of larceny in a way which would not have been possible unless the varying penalty approach in relation to the different larceny offences reflected in the relevant sections was abandoned.  Moreover, a person may even at present be sentenced to ten years' imprisonment on a second or subsequent conviction for larceny.  I do not believe, by the way, that this proposal should result in any general increase in sentences for larceny offences, except perhaps in a few cases where the present maximum penalty is on any view far too low.</P>
    <P>I instanced offences under section 31, threatening to publish with intent to exhort, as an example of such an anomaly.  This offence is simply a form of vicious blackmail, yet it carries a maximum penalty of only two years' imprisonment under the present law. This apparently derives from the Victorian attitude that it was good enough for the victim of that offence because he had something to hide from the public. Similarly it is inconsistent, to say the least, that the present maximum penalty for stealing a dog under section 5 of the Larceny Act is 18 months even if the dog is Master McGrath or his modern equivalent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;yet theft of a single sheep under section 3 can render the offender liable to a 14 year jail sentence.</P>
      <P>The most important thing to remember in the context of this section however, is that the maximum sentence for any offence is designed to cater for the most heinous occurrence of that offence. Judges have a wide discretion up to the maximum and when passing sentence they take into account all the circumstances of the case in applying, in a somewhat more sober context, W.S. Gilbert's injunction to, &ldquo;let the punishment fit the crime&rdquo;.  The Judiciary, generally speaking, I think we all agree, are independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the wider question of sentencing <Col N="1599" /> policy, though not strictly under the Bill, it may interest Deputies to know that the Law Reform Commission have already been asked to look at the matter.  We lay down in this Bill the maximum sentence which can be imposed by the courts but the judges have discretion having regard to the type of crime committed and its circumstances, so far as I can understand, for those who are deviously involved in this racket, if I may so call it, of removing stolen goods and receiving, the punishment should fit that offence.  I have no doubt that is what every member of this House wants to happen under the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal in what the Minister says in regard to judges and so on.  I agree with him totally, but that is not really relevant to the point. I think we all accept the independence of the Judiciary and that their powers are propery exercised, but that is not the issue.  The issue here is whether we give the Law Reform Commission another kick in the teeth.  They have made this positive proposal here.  They have made many positive proposals.  Most of them were rejected and here they have a positive proposal that it be the same sentence. I say we should have the same maximum sentence for larceny and receiving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You can take examples.  Consider the <i>Les Miserables</i> type of offence where an impressionable young fellow sees a child stealing a bit of bread when he is starving in the streets of Paris.  You would say that it is an offence but perhaps it is justified <Col N="1600" /> in the circumstances.  You can take a most extreme case under section 9 of some frightful blackmailer exercising ferocious pressure on his victim.  We need not have to think of the range of the cases where we might see some justification for what we would consider minor.  We could have the same range in regard to receiving Somebody might be in court for receiving a 2p piece or a bottle of Guinness. Obviously that is different from receiving huge consignments of goods.</P>
    <P>I will not delay the House further on this issue.  We should follow the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission that there should be the same maximum sentence.  On that basis I am pressing my amendments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 6, after line 50, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) In addition to, or in lieu of, any penalty imposed by a court under subsection (1) of this section on any person, the court may order such <Col N="1603" /> person to pay such compensation as it considers appropriate to the person (if any) considered by the court to be the victim of the offence.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want the court to be in a position to order the payment of compensation in addition to imposing a fine or prison sentence. I feel very strongly about this issue but when we discussed the matter earlier, the Minister was not prepared to accept our approach.  We voted on it earlier and I do not intend to put it to a further vote at this stage.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, to make our very strong views known to the Minister for Justice regarding the fact that there should be a statutory provision whereby the courts could order compensation to be paid to the victim of the crime.  I do not intend to let up on the very strong views I hold and I will be pressing the Government to introduce changes not only in relation to offences under this Bill but all offences, and to provide a statutory basis whereby the court can order that compensation be paid to the victim of the crime.</P>
    <P>Before I formally withdraw the amendment, will the Minister confirm that he will make my views known to the Minister for Justice?</P>

      <P>I do not know how much time we have left to discuss the section, but I wish to raise the point of introducing an amendment to the Post Office Act, 1908.  How can we pick out one semi-State body which had its legislation passed under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, and change penalties in regard to it?  It is not now within the ambit of the Department and I find that the various changes made in that Act which included in the Schedule very widespread amendments to the Post Office Act, 1908&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned on <Col N="1605" /> the previous day, I was discussing the meaning of the term &ldquo;lawful authority&rdquo; in section 8 (1) and (2).  It appears that the &ldquo;lawful authority&rdquo; must constitute public duty in the narrowest possible sense.  If seems, for example, that an employer cannot authorise his employees to carry offensive weapons simply by getting them to contract to do so.  The other defence contained in section 8 (1) and (2) is the defence of reasonable excuse.  The defence of reasonable excuse is one that is readily understandable and can be appreciated by most people.  The criterion for a reasonable excuse is whether a reasonable man would think it excuseable to carry a weapon in the circumstances. That is the circumstances. That is the criterion for the test of reasonable excuse.  Presumably &mdash; and we can only anticipate what will happen &mdash; the courts will construe this term as it was construed in the United Kingdom.  It may not be enough that the intentions of the accused were lawful.  The question that will arise in most cases is whether self defence is a reasonable excuse.</P>
      <P>In the United Kingdom case of Evans <i>v.</i> Hughes in 1972 it was held that self defence will be a reasonable excuse where, in the words of the courts, there is an eminent particular threat affecting the circumstances in which the weapon was carried.  The question then arises as to whether there is a distinction between a person being under constant threat and a person who is threatened intermittently. Questions will arise about such people as security guards who are armed with batons or say, taxi drivers who carry weapons for their own protection.  Perhaps the Minister, when replying to the Second Stage debate, will advert to how this defence will apply to those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few other points I want to raise briefly before I conclude.  In section 8 (2) (b), in relation to a weapon which is &ldquo;made or adapted&rdquo; for causing injury, there are examples of cases in the neighbouring jurisdiction where a weapon which was not made for the purpose of causing offence to somebody is accidentally adapted in such a way that it would fall within that category.  The <Col N="1606" /> example has been given of a bottle which is accidentally broken.  Do the words &ldquo;made or adapted&rdquo; include a situation where a weapon is in somebody's possession which has been accidentally adapted for use to injure, incapacitate etc?  Terminology which runs through various sections of the Bill is that a person has with him a weapon of offence.  I presume that the term &ldquo;with him&rdquo; means he knowingly has it with him.  There is United Kingdom case law which I will not go into&mdash;I will reserve my comments until we are on Committee Stage &mdash; which would suggest that there is some doubt about this.  I presume that the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; will be interpreted in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;public place&rdquo; is very widely defined in section 8 (1).  It is specifically designed to include various events such as a discotheque, football match, bazaar, carnival etc. Deputy McCartan raised the point that there would be a difficulty of interpretation about what constitutes a carnival, a bazaar, etc.  I do not share Deputy McCartan's pessimism on that score because the section goes on to say &ldquo;or other similar place&rdquo;.  If something does not fall exactly within the category of the place described it will fall within the terminology of &ldquo;or other similar place&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is correct to distinguish between public places, <i>per se</i>, and public places such as carnivals, football matches, etc. where people are congregated for the purpose of entertainment.  The only point I would query is what types of weapon should a person be allowed to carry into a crowded situation.  I am not happy that the knife or other pointed weapon which a person is prohibited from carrying under section 8 (1) is sufficient.  That should be extended to any type of weapon because any type of weapon can cause injury.  I have already dealt with that point in some detail and I do not want to go back over it again.</P>
    <P>I also share Deputy McCartan's views on the question of the folding pocket knife.  I am not happy that the folding pocket knife should be excluded from the category of weapons which are included in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (3) deals with the case of a <Col N="1607" /> person who is carrying a weapon which has an innocent origin and which does not have a destructive use.  If a person is carrying such a weapon in a public place he must carry it with the intention to injure, incapacitate, intimidate etc.  I take it from the wording of the section that the intention must be to incapacitate, injure, etc. at some time in the future. That can give rise to unexpected and anomalous results.  Take, for example, a case of a person from Limerick who is convinced that he is owed money by somebody in Dublin.  He leaves Limerick by train &mdash; a train is a public place for the purposes of the legislation &mdash; carrying a pocket knife or a butcher's knife with the intention of intimidating the person in Dublin so as to secure what he feels he is owed.  On the way from Limerick to Dublin he is guilty of an offence under this section.  If he meets the man in Dublin, gets the money, does not have to produce the knife and he is on the way home with the knife, at that stage, he is not guilty of an offence, unless the knife happens to be a flick knife, as defined in the Bill, in which case he is guilty both on the way to Dublin and on the way back.  I accept we cannot write legislation to cover every eventuality.  Some Deputies have made the suggestion that perhaps we should adopt a simpler approach to this whole matter and ban the carrying of all weapons of offence in all situations except where the person carrying the weapon can establish lawful authority or reasonable excuse.  I would not go that far but I am giving that example to illustrate the interpretation which the courts put on this legislation and which can give rise to anomalous situations in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with a situation where a person, while committing or appearing to be about to commit an offence, or in the course of a dispute or fight, produces a weapon.  Does the word &ldquo;produce&rdquo; cover the situation where that person picks a weapon off the floor or accepts a weapon handed to him by somebody else?  Does he need to have the weapon on him and <Col N="1608" /> then produce it in the sense in which the word is normally used?</P>
    <P>As I said, under section 10 if a person has a weapon with him he is already guilty if he is intent in a public place on causing injury, incapacitating, etc.  However, if it is impossible for the prosecution to establish that intent and he produces the weapon in the circumstances outlined in section 10, he can also commit an offence.  Consequently, section 10 is welcome in that it is designed to close a possible gap in the law.  However, I ask the Minister to comment when replying to Second Stage on why the section states that in order to be convicted, the accused will have to produce the weapon in a manner likely unlawfully to intimidate another person.  It appears to me that if a person produces a weapon by committing, or appearing to be about to commit, an offence or in the course of a fight or dispute, he should be guilty.  I am not happy that the wording &ldquo;in a manner likely unlawfully to intimidate another person&rdquo; will do anything except to provide loopholes, which I know is not the Minister's intention.</P>
    <P>I also query the part of the section which says that he will be guilty of an offence if he produces the weapon in the course of a fight or a dispute.  It should also cover the situation where he produces the weapon in anticipation of a fight or dispute.  The Minister will probably make the point that this is covered in section 8 but I should like him to comment further.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 and 15 of the Bill give powers to the Garda to arrest and search. Section 13 allows a garda to arrest without warrant anybody he reasonably suspects to be in the act of committing an offence under sections 8, 9 or 10.  Section 8 concerns possession of weapons in various circumstances.  Section 9 covers a person in possession of a weapon while trespassing.  However, section 10 concerns a person producing a weapon and, consequently, the question must arise as to whether that terminology is suitable for cases covered by it.  It is just a drafting point and perhaps the Minister will examine it between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1609" /> Section 15 allows a member of the Garda Síochána to search a person if he suspects that that person has a weapon covered by section 8 in his possession in certain circumstances.  This will apply where a breach of the peace is occurring. Secondly, he has such power where he has reasonable grounds for believing that a breach of the peace may occur. Thirdly, he has that power where he has reasonable grounds for believing that a breach of the peace has occured. However, as I interpret the section, a garda will have that power only where a number of people are congregated at one of the places mentioned in section 8(1) (a) such as a discotheque, cinema, etc. and the breach of the peace has occurred, is occurring or may occur, in the place while the people were congregated there. At what stage does the garda cease to have this power?  For example, if people have gone home from a football match and the terraces are empty, but if something happened earlier at the match and the garda suspects a certain individual whom he wants to search later in the evening, does the section cover that person?  In the case of breach of the peace before the match takes place and before people begin to congregate, does a garda have the power to search anyone he suspects will engage in conduct likely to lead to a breach of the peace?  Whatever about extending the power of search indefinitely, it should be wide enough to cover a situation where a garda anticipates a breach of the peace and is able to apprehend the person before the event to which the section relates takes place.</P>
    <P>I should also like guidance on the question of &ldquo;a number of people&rdquo;.  Would it be as few as two people and would the term &ldquo;congregated&rdquo; be appropriate to just two people?  These points should be discussed on Committee Stage and I do not want to labour them now.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the question of the terminology in the different sections in relation to a person having a weapon with him.  If a person goes to a disco or a football match and knows he can readily lay his hands on a weapon, is it covered by the Bill?  Does he have to be carrying <Col N="1610" /> the weapon?  Will the Minister reply to that point?  Section 7 deals with a situation where a person discharges a firearm being reckless as to whether it leads to certain consequences.  We had a long discussion on &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo; in the debate on the Larcency Bill.  I made the point &mdash; and I do not want to repeat it at any length &mdash; that there is no such thing as &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo;<i>per se</i>.  The courts have interpreted &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo; in various ways. Broadly, it falls into two categories, subjective and objective.  It is subjective when the person has to advert to a situation and objective when the person does not necessarily have to advert to any danger.  Nothing has to enter his mind but he will be guilty if a reasonable man would not have acted in that way in those circumstances.  The English courts have divided quite dramatically on the question of whether &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo; in criminal legislation means subjective or objective recklessness.  I do not want that sort of division in Irish law and I suggest that the Minister insert another subsection to section 7 containing a definition of &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo; which will make it quite clear whether he is talking about subjective or objective recklessness.  If he is including such a definition, I ask him to make the definition subjective as I am opposed to the idea of importing civil law concepts to criminal law.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to section 14 at some length.  The controversial part of the section is the provision that gives a peace commissioner the right to issue a warrant to the Garda to enter a person's property, by force if necessary.  The section states that if a justice of the District Court or a peace commissioner is satisfied on the sworn information of a member of the Garda Síochána that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence ... etc.  There may be constitutional difficulties in giving a peace commissioner that sort of power.  The Minister will be aware that the courts have reserved judicial functions under the Constitution in interpreting various situations as to whether the power being exercised by any administrative authority is judicial. They have jealously guarded their own <Col N="1611" /> powers and exclusive rights in this regard. It might solve the problem and get away from all the constitutional argument if the section were to read &ldquo;if a justice of the District Court, or if he is unavailable, a peace commissioner&rdquo;.  The onus should be on the Garda to seek a mandate to enter a person's property from a justice of the District Court in the first instance. If the Justice of the District Court is unavailable and the matter is urgent, then &mdash; and only then &mdash; can he refer to a peace commissioner.</P>
    <P>I spoke at length on this legislation the last day it was debated in the House and I do not want to go over the same ground as some of my colleagues want to speak.  I have raised various points, some of them might have been more appropriate on Committee Stage, but I look forward to a comprehensive reply from the Minister at the end of Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of making a brief contribution on this simple but nontheless important Bill which, as has already been said, simply extends the definition of &ldquo;firearms&rdquo; to include crossbows and stun guns.  It also makes it an offence to carry offensive weapons, affording greater powers of search, arrest, and confiscation to the Garda.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to go over the same ground dealt with here following the Minister's Second Stage introductory remarks and the extensive debate that took place in the Seanad in recent months.  The amendments taken on board in the course of the Seanad discussion have added considerable weight to the provisions of this Bill.  Nonetheless there are specific provisions which can be examined between now and Committee Stage in the hope of tightening them up even further in order to deal with the ever-increasing crime problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there is little or no restriction on possession of a dangerous implement, be that a knife, hatchet or bayonet, no matter of what type, length or the circumstances in which such may <Col N="1612" /> be used.  I am delighted to note that their usage is addressed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The stun gun is something of a new phenomenon in Irish society.  In recent years it has come on the Irish market, it must be said, to assist in the commission of burglaries and is used effectively by criminals to carry out muggings and other serious crimes against persons and property. It is important that the House realise that the discharge of a stun gun can deliver an immediate shock of up to 70,000 volts.  Some Members speaking on Second Stage contended that it would take in the region of two to three minutes for the effect of its discharge to deliver its lethal message to its victim.  My understanding is that its effect is immediate, that it is an immediate shock.  Perhaps our medical colleague on the opposite benches might clarify that point in the course of his remarks.  My understanding is that the discharge of a stun gun has the immediate effect of attacking the central nervous system rendering its victim immediately helpless.  Not so long ago stun guns were banned in Britain.  Since then it has emerged that Ireland has become something of a dumping ground for such weapons following the implementation of a prohibition order in Britain.  Indeed British dealers, having anticipated the recent controls imposed there, have been engaging in the business of offering stun guns at reduced, attractive rates to interested parties here.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the crossbow, an extremely lethal weapon, is available for sale here on the open market particularly in sports-hobies shops.  It is important to emphasise that in the main the proprietors of such stores are law abiding citizens.  Certainly they are not in the business of promoting or advertising such weapons or engaging in any type of publicity that might induce people to purchase them because of their attractiveness for purposes other than sporting. The simple, stark fact remains that if a teenager or anybody else, even a child, walks into a sports or hobbies shop that deals in crossbows, they can be purchased without any questions being asked or any restrictions being imposed, assuming that <Col N="1613" /> the potential purchaser has the wherewithal in terms of finance to pay.  Therefore, it is indeed time that a provision to prohibit crossbows be introduced.</P>
    <P>I might add that there have been a number of incidents here in which personal injury has been inflicted by the use of crossbows.  Something of a public discussion on their usage took place following an incident in County Kerry in November 1985 in which a member of the Garda Síochána was injured when struck by a crossbow arrow.  Luckily that injury was not serious.  However, it had the effect of alarming the Garda authorities to the fact that crossbows were being used for other than sporting purposes. A survey was undertaken in the aftermath of that incident to ascertain what other incidents there had been involving the use of these weapons.  The result of that survey drew attention to a number of unsavoury reports &mdash; for example, that deer had been injured in the Phoenix Park when struck by cross-bows, reports of their usage to shoot pheasants on a wide scale throughout the country, reports of animals such as dogs and horses having been injured either accidentally or deliberately by their usage, etc.  Therefore, it is indeed welcome that the provisions of this Bill go some way toward outlawing the crossbow.</P>
    <P>The importatation of stun guns and cross-bows will be rendered illegal except by licence granted by the Minister for Justice under the provisions of section 4 of this Bill.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on the lawful use of such implements as stun guns and crossbows. Under the provisions of section 4 it will be necessary for an applicant for a licence to provide a certificate of fitness to the effect that he or she can use a stun gun or crossbow.  Perhaps the Minister would inform the House to whom it is envisaged such certificates will be issued.  My contention would be that the only lawful purpose to which a crossbow can ever be put or be intended for use is in the sport of archery.  If I am wrong perhaps the Minister would enlighten me.  Indeed, it might well be important that we consider <Col N="1614" /> an appropriate amendment to ensure that there are no other purposes to which a crossbow might be put.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged under the provisions of the Bill that, in certain circumstances, stun guns will become legal.  Otherwise I would ask the Minister why he did not consider a total ban on their usage.  For example, is it envisaged that a certificate to hold a stun gun will be granted to people in the security trade, to women who may profess a need to equip themselves with a stun gun travelling late at night, or anybody who might be fearful from time to time of an attack on their person?  Will such people be entitled to receive a certificate of fitness from their local District Court to the effect that they are entitled to use a stun gun?  I would have grave reservations about that.</P>
    <P>In the course of Committee Stage &mdash; when we come to deal with the specific provisions of section 4 &mdash; I would hope we can thrash out the Minister's intentions with regard to the issue of such licences. The Garda will have power to issue such a certificate and we must assume that there will be certain circumstances in which certificates will be issued. Assuming that certificates will be issued for the use of crossbows, I put it to the Minister that a certain tightening of the provisions of this Bill is necessary to ensure that a crossbow will not be used, for example, to kill a wild animal or bird, or domestic animal and that a firearms certificate issued to anybody for the use of a crossbow will have to carry a number of attendant conditions.</P>
    <P>Considering that the crossbow will be legally owned by the person once he has the certificate, it is important that conditions as to its use are addressed.  I would urge the Minister to consider an appropriate amendment to deal with the circumstances where a certificate has issued so that it will be unlawful for a person holding a licence to use the crossbow other than for sporting purposes.  I wonder why the legislation refers only to crossbows.  I would be somewhat fearful of longbows or staightbows and I see no <Col N="1615" /> reason they cannot be included in section 4 (1) (c) also.</P>
    <P>I am again seeking information from the Minister on his reasoning behind section 4 (1) (c) which refers to a crossbow with a draw weight of at least 1.4 kg.  I imagine every crossbow, no matter what strength or size, is a dangerous and lethal weapon.  I would ask the Minister why he draws a line at 1.4 kg and perhaps he might allay my fears in that regard.  I have mentioned the longbow or straightbow. The slingshot or catapult are other fairly offensive weapons that the Minister might address on Committee Stage.  I will certainly be pressing for the inclusion of an appropriate amendment to cater for these fairly vicious and lethal weapons. When introducing Second Stage to this House, the Minister said he will be bringing forward some amendments so far as football matches and crowd control are concerned, which would be relevant to this legislation.  He said he was waiting for a report on interim recommendations by the Committee on Public Safety.  I hope, having regard to the fact that the Minister will be introducing these amendments on Committee Stage, he will consider circulating them at the earliest opportunity to give everybody an idea of what is intended well in advance of the legislation proceeding through Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This question is perhaps one that we cannot address at this stage because we do not know the Minister's intentions.  I hope he will consider including weapons which, by definition, may not be inherently offensive.  I can recall being in Páirc an Chrócaigh on one occasion in the late seventies when a couple of people not too far from me had weapons which had every appearance of a sink pipe.  A sink pipe in a kitchen or in a carpenter's work bag is not an offensive weapon but at the back of the Hogan Stand in Croke Park it is a completely different weapon.  I hope due consideration will be given to including weapons in public places, such as concerts and football matches, which are, by definition, innocuous but by virtue of their circumstances, without <Col N="1616" /> being adapted, sharpened or cut, can be offensive.  In those circumstances, the holder of such a piece of lead pipe cannot be in a position to provide a lawful excuse for what he was doing.  We will have to wait for further discussion until we see the amendments promised by the Minister.</P>
    <P>As well as dealing with crossbows and stun guns, the other main purpose of the Bill is to prohibit the carrying of knives and offensive weapons in certain places. Considerable alarm must be shown towards a recent spate of fairly violent stabbings throughout the country involving knives and other offensive and dangerous weapons.  It is high time we addressed this problem.  Almost every weekend there appears to be a report in the national media of an unsavoury incident involving knives, particularly at late night dances and disco venues.  There is a feeling in certain quarters that the carrying of a knife or an offensive weapon to a dance or a disco or when going out on a Friday or Saturday night is almost an appendage to dress.  I am quite confident that the section contained in the Bill will adequately deal with this difficulty and in that regard I hope the legislation will move through the House as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>A recent report has shown a very disturbing trend as far as many of these incidents involving stabbings and knives are concerned.  While robbery appears to be a substantial motive in most of these cases, hospitals and Garda stations regularly report incidents of serious assaults on people, with no particular motive other than to inflict nasty injuries.  It is alarming that people are being stabbed with knives and other sharp instruments for no other reason than that the person wishes to pick a row with somebody and inflict a serious injury, not in furtherance of a robbery or of any crime against property.  That is disturbing and it is important that we address ourselves to the matter.</P>
    <P>Knives of a fairly reprehensible type are openly available in shops not alone in this city but throughout the country. There is a certain aspect which has not been addressed in the legislation and that <Col N="1617" /> is the proliferation in the last five to ten years of a store entitled the Army Surplus Store.  These stores are situated in Dublin, Cork and Galway and recently one opened in Kilkenny.  I wonder about the activities of these stores or what army surplus are we talking about.  We are living in a state that spends 1.4 per cent of our gross national product on defence, the lowest in Europe apart from perhaps Switzerland.  For a country with such a low spending on defence, we appear to have a very large number of army surplus stores, stores that are readily selling over the counter a range of knives, hatchets and swords, particularly Swedish army byonets, at varying prices.  I would ask the Minister to consider addressing this matter.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that at present these stores are not licensed.  There is a great need for them to be licensed and for the type of merchandise displayed and offered for sale to be restricted.  I cannot understand why people would be anxious to purchase Swedish army surplus bayonets, but nevertheless they are on sale and are being purchased.  There is no valid justification for using a bayonet other than to inflict injury on somebody. A bayonet does not have to be adapted or shortened, and by definition it is used to inflict injury on people.  The Army Surplus Stores sell combat jackets, flak jackets, balaclavas, helmets and implements which can be used to break into houses.  The Minister should seriously consider broadening the terms of reference of this Bill to include the registration and regulation of the merchandise being sold through Army Surplus Stores and the regulation of the operation of these stores.  Not half a mile from this House a fairly vicious array of lethal weapons are being advertised as Christmas presents in Army Surplus Stores, and we wonder why there is an increase in crime and why so many of the young people who attend dances, concerts and football matches are armed with knives and other implements.</P>
    <P>I want to leave any detailed discussion on the finer points of the Bill to Committee Stage.  As Deputy O'Keeffe stated <Col N="1618" /> earlier, we will be putting down amendments which I hope the Minister will consider favourably.  I welcome this Bill. Even though it was examined fairly thoroughly in the Seanad and subsequently amended, there is still room for improvement.  I look forward to a thorough examination of the details of the legislation on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many Members I welcome the opportunity to congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this legislation. It is regrettable that we need to introduce such a measure to deal with the ever-increasing range of offensive weapons which are being used at present. I am particularly glad the Minister has seen fit to deal with the potential problems associated with the use of stun guns and crossbows before they become the next fad.  Thankfully, the Minister will have dealt with this problem before many people have the chance to see a stun gun, let alone use one.  I recognise the valuable contribution made by the Garda in the initiation of this legislation.  I am heartened at the positive attitude of the general public and Members of this House to the Minister's initiative.  Our colleagues in the Seanad also received this Bill with great relish earlier in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However glad I am to welcome this legislation, I am nonetheless saddened at the range of weapons currently available on the streets, particularly in the hands of young people.  Flick knives, knuckle-dusters and martial art weapons were once the sole province of television, the cinema and comics and they seemed very abstract and remote from real life.  God be with the days when innocent children came home from the cinema on a Saturday afternoon burdened with the weight of imaginary weapons of all sorts with which they could save the world from the enemy, whoever he was, or exhibiting extraordinary fencing skills in support of Zorro or the Three Musketeers.  They were all innocent then.  Today we must awaken to the reality of life dealing with the consequences of the infiltration by evil influences in our society, the exposure of our children to films which <Col N="1619" /> portray the most horrific scenes of violence and television which shows the realities of war and other atrocities in many parts of the world.</P>
    <P>The Minister must deal with those realities in this Bill.  However, there are other aspects of society which contribute to this reality and which must also be addressed.  We must seriously consider the censorship of films and videos which portray such violence and the contribution they make to the ever-increasing levels of serious crime which society and the Garda have to deal with.  I know this is a different matter but this Bill must lay down markers on issues which have to be addressed in other ways and in other legislation.  Indeed the Minister recently introduced such appropriate legislation in the House.</P>
    <P>We, and more important, our children, are being conditioned to accept the annual round of Rambo or similar films which are followed in quick succession by the flooding of shops at Christmas of miniature models of these characters and their ever-increasing arsenals of offensive weapons.  In the past we could excuse our innocence when we purchased guns, holsters and cowboy hats but we have no excuse for continuing to support multimillion dollar industries which annually condition our children to accept violence as a normal fact of life.  If the case has not been made sufficiently in the past we must again exhort parents and adults everywhere to think carefully before they spend vast sums of money on replica guns and other symbols of violence this Christmas.  I know that when the Minister had the question of replica guns and the like referred to him before he indicated that this Bill was not the appropriate vehicle for dealing with the matter but he shared the general concern about the proliferation of such items.</P>
    <P>I should like to re-echo the sentiments expressed elsewhere in regard to the sale of these goods and to encourage the Minister to pursue any solution to this problem. If it is a violent act to threaten another then it is despicable to use replica guns which are indistinguisable from real <Col N="1620" /> weapons to threaten an innocent person who could not be expected to know the difference.  I know the Minister is anxious to deal with this problem in whatever way he can and I believe he will receive the fullest support possible from Members of this House in doing so.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that some types of stun guns shall not be imported by a person if he does not have a licence issued by the Minister and their sale or ownership shall be unlawful without a fire arms certificate issued by the Garda Síochána.  This is the correct approach and I cannot conceive of any reason which would justify a licence being given.  By all accounts, the only reason one would have such a weapon would be to harm or incapacitate another person.  I do not believe that such a weapon would be used for legitimate purposes.  I ask the Minister to indicate how it is proposed to deal with such weapons currently held and whether details of their importation or sale are known to him and the Garda.</P>
    <P>I accept that crossbows can be used for legitimate purposes, for example, archery, but I agree that because of their potential use as an offence weapon they merit inclusion in this Bill.  I have not noted a reference to a long-bow in the Bill.  While I know these bows are very different from cross-bows, I should like the Minister to indicate how and in what circumstances they are dealt with in the Bill, if at all.</P>
    <P>I know other offensive weapons such as flick knives and the like present a very serious problem for the Garda and that is made more difficult by the capacity of those possessing them to conceal them. The media report many instances, and not just in large cities, where scuffles between youths using knives and other weapons have led to tragedy.  I remember some years ago concern was expressed about the sale of steel combs which had long sharp handles.  The Garda face great difficulties in trying to come to terms with this problem.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on the balanced and realistic approach he has adopted.</P>
    <P>Carrying knives and other weapons can become a habit for many youths.  The <Col N="1621" /> initial intention may be harmless enough but it is the breaking of that habit that underlies the provisions of the Bill.  We want to avoid circumstances where such weapons may be used.  Equally, it is necessary to give the Garda the right to search for such weapons when there is a suspicion that they may be held or concealed. While there may be difficulty in some circumstances as to the definition of an offensive weapon or the legitimate possession of other items which might be used to harm another, I agree with the approach adopted by the Minister of putting the onus on the person holding those weapons to justify having them in his or her possession.  Society must strike a balance between the rights of the individual and the need to maintain law and order.  Equally, we must not lose sight of the innocence of ordinary people who have various items in their possession legitimately when challenged or searched.  That balance will emerge over time as more effort goes into publicising the need for care and attention and the danger of carrying any potentially dangerous item.  If necessary, the courts will ensure that all citizens receive fair and just treatment.</P>
    <P>In County Wicklow it is a pleasure to see so many young people fishing along river banks and the seashore.  They usually have in their possession various items which in other circumstances would be considered offensive weapons.  We are capable of making an adult judgment in regard to those items.  I suggest that nobody is more capable of or more experienced in doing so than the Garda.  We must educate our people that there are circumstances in which it is right to carry or hold such items and when it is not justified to do so.  There are places such as discos, football grounds and so on where, however innocently such items may be held, it is not acceptable to do so.  It is a matter of educating people and of breaking the habit.  Having done that it is legitimate to call on any person found in possession of such items to justify having them in their possession.  In that regard I support the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Wicklow, because of its great beauty, <Col N="1622" /> its mountains and valleys, attracts many visitors, particularly from the adjacent city of Dublin.  Those people like to use the mountains, the valleys and forest trails.  They enjoy walking, fishing and so on.  Many of them, particularly the young people, carry knives as part of their equipment.  They consider the knife to be as important as the shorts or the walking boots they wear.  At the end of their day of adventure or walking many of those young people adjourn to local hostelries to enjoy a drink.  I am in the booze business and I regularly cater for such people in my licensed premises.  They are most welcome.  I note that most of those young people carry knives in a scabbard.  Some of the knives are of enormous proportions and are frightening.  I have had occasion to approach those young people and ask them to check in those knives before they have a drink.  To date my requests have not been refused and the knives have been left behind the bar.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a widely held perception that acts of violence, often perpetrated with the assistance of some of the instruments referred to in the Bill are confined solely to our cities.  I should like to assure the House that that perception is grossly inaccurate.  Those occurrences take place in rural Ireland, in our towns and villages, in our rural pubs, hotels, discos and on the streets.  As a public representative I have had complaints from decent and concerned citizens in my constituency.  I have had complaints from Arklow, Wicklow, Blessington and its environs.  Even in my home town to Rathdrum the decent and concerned local residents considered it necessary to call public meetings to discuss and highlight the increasing incidents of violence and general lawlessness. I have brought those complaints to the attention of gardaí at the appropriate level and to the attention of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>I hasten to add that the gardaí in County Wicklow, within the resources available to them, do a magnificent job in combating and containing this lawlessness but we continue to have difficulties. The Bill will be wholeheartedly <Col N="1623" /> welcomed by the Garda and will assist them enormously in their arduous task.  I am pleased to note that the Minister has dealt with the paraphernalia attached to firearms such as silencers which will be deemed to be component parts of firearms. Like other Members, I can find no reason, other than the most seriously offensive one, why any person should have a silencer in his or her possession.  I can understand the concern of the gardaí to have that item included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on putting the Bill forward.  I am happy that such sensible and responsible steps are being taken in regard to such items as stun guns and cross-bows.  The Bill reflects very well on the Minister, his Department and the Garda Síochána. The vigilance evident in the Bill is, unfortunately, a necessity today.  We must do all we can to stem the tide against the use of offensive weapons of all sorts while at the same time maintaining a balance.  The Bill has such a balance and its application will prove that.  I look forward to the remainder of the debate on the Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy O'Sullivan for permitting me to make a contribution at this stage.  Deir-tear gurb é an scéal gearr an scéal is fearr. I welcome the Bill as one step in an effort to curb violence on our streets.  However, what we are doing is trying to cure the effect rather than getting at the root causes.  What are the causes?  Why will a young man attack another with a knife? Why will a thief resort to unnecessary violence?  Why will gangs of youths indulge in violence apparently for its own sake?  I do not know the answers to those questions but it is a fact that that behaviour is common on the streets of many of our cities.  There is some data on the probable causes in the United States.  In the past, society has been able to control aggressive impulses through its basic institutions, the home, schools and the churches.  In the United States they say that those moral pillars are crumbling. How do we see ours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we pass the Bill without concerning <Col N="1624" /> ourselves with the causes of violence we will be doing less than our duty.  What can we do?  I should like to give my recommendations.  We should carry out a psychological study on young people in prison, people who have been convicted of violent offences, and produce a report to the Minister.  We should consult psychologists and educationalists and produce a film or video for schools and youth clubs that will help young people understand the reasons for violence and how to combat it.  We should ensure that the danger signals of psychological disturbance are noticed in the school, just as physical problems are noticed, and institute corrective action.  We should encourage parents groups, and support them, to discourage violence and sex on TV at prime viewing times and have a coding for records and tapes that include songs with sex and violence as subjects. The entertainment media here and all over the world play a big part in establishing young people's moral and cultural values.  We hear a lot about causes.  Here is a real one.  Let us find out what the causes of juvenile violence are and set out to remove them.</P>

      <P>Four advertising agencies were invited to submit proposals in respect of a public information campaign dealing with smoke control and, of these, Arks Limited was chosen for the campaign, which has a proposed budget of almost £120,000 plus VAT.  It is too early to assess the impact of this campaign.  However, the public and media response has been favourable, and I am confident that the campaign has heightened public awareness of the need for individual voluntary action to reduce smoke pollution and has served to inform the public as to available options.  I am hopeful that the campaign will lead to a substantial switch to smokeless and low smoke fuels this winter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State accept that it was an outrageous waste of public money to spend £120,000 on urging members of the general public to become smogbusters?  Is the Minister of State aware that most members of the general public could not see the posters in Dublin as they drove past them and that other people who received these posters and leaflets through their doors thought they were a neat way of advertising the <i>Ghostbusters II</i> movie which is on in town rather than representing a serious attempt to tackle the smog problem? Would the Minister of State not agree that it would have been far better to use those funds to allow people on social welfare payments to purchase the more expensive smoke-free fuels?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Shatter.  There is a duty on us to inform the public of the options available. The public in Dublin have the choice, if they want to exercise it on a voluntary basis, to burn low smoke fuels.  We sought in this campaign to urge them to do so. There is a responsibility on us to make them aware of how smog is caused, what the options are and what the ratings for the different fuels as established by Eolas are.  That is what we sought to do in this campaign.  It is too early to say what the outcome of the campaign has been but Bord na Móna have informed me that the sales of peat briquettes already this winter are up 50 per cent in the Dublin area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State accept that the sale of peat briquettes is up due to Bord na Móna's own campaign in this area and would she not accept that this entire advertising campaign was little short of a charade and made no impact on the appalling smog problem we have suffered from in Dublin during the past four and a half weeks?</P>

Such measures might include urging people to use Bord na Móna peat briquettes which, despite what the Minister of State said in her previous reply, account for only 12 per cent of the solid fuel market.

      <P>My supplementary question relates to the measures the Minister of State may take in an effort to alleviate the problem in areas where the permitted levels have been exceeded.  I am merely asking if the Minister of State would not be prepared to consider making conversion grants available to people in areas which perhaps may have been designated by the local authorities but which have not as yet been confirmed by the Minister in view of the fact that the amount of money paid out to date, £125,000, is the <Col N="1630" /> same as the amount of money the Minister of State has paid out to an advertising agency in connection with the smogbusters campaign?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first part of the question, I am not aware of the levels having been exceeded outside the Dublin area.  In response to the other part, the Government will make available £3 million in 1990 for the two special control areas order that I recently confirmed. In addition to the £1 million which was made available for Ballyfermot area A, that is a total of £4 million. Applications are being processed as a matter of urgency by the local authority and I hope that that money will be taken up during the early part of 1990.  The people have six months to comply with the orders.</P>
      <P>In relation to urging people to switch to low smoke fuel, I have done that by way of the information campaign and many public statements.  I reiterate my appeal and would urge other Deputies to urge the public to co-operate on a voluntary basis in bringing down smoke levels.  We are aiming as a matter of urgency to ensure that we deal with the smog problem in Dublin as fast as possible, but at the latest by the middle of 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 4 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>I intend that a number of significant environmental proposals will be considered by the Council of Environment Ministers during the Irish Presidency of the European Communities.  As President-in-Office of the Council, I will be working to secure the adoption of proposals relating to the European Environment Agency, water quality, waste management strategy, protection of habitats and access to information on the environment and to advance proposals relating to the treatment of municipal waste water, hazardous waste and vehicle emissions.  The Community, and the Irish Presidency, will also play a lead role in the radical revision of the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer and in the continuing work in the areas of climate change, sustainable development and environmental aid to Eastern Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have three supplementary questions.  First, did the Minister speak to the Taoiseach prior to the <Col N="1632" /> Taoiseach's announcement and the declaration that we would have a Green Presidency?  Secondly, has a draft environmental charter been prepared by the Department, presumably initiated by the Minister?  Thirdly, are the Commission aware of such a proposal and do they have a draft environmental green charter that will be promulgated hopefully in Dublin Castle next June?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first question is yes, to the second, we are working on it and to the third, no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If in late December the Government have not spoken to the Commission about such a proposal and therefore to any of the member states, if there is no finalised charter as is clearly indicated, and since the Taoiseach has indulged in unbelievable political hype, will the Minister ensure that the potential damage that could be done to this nation will be mitigated by his own courageous intervention at this point?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no argument.  If I misled the Deputy I regret it.  I have spoken to the Commissioner of the Council of Environmental Ministers about what we propose doing during the Presidency and I have spoken to some of my opposites as well about what we propose trying to achieve during our Presidency. I took an opportunity in the recent past at one of the meetings in Japan to speak on matters of a global nature.  I may have misled the Deputy, but we have formulated our policy and what we hope to achieve.  In fact, the Taoiseach only reiterated what the Minister for the Environment hoped he would say and asked him to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

I am responding to a pronouncement by the Taoiseach in relation to a green charter that would hopefully be proclaimed in Dublin Castle in June.  Will the Minister say yea or nay to the following questions? Is there a draft of such a charter in the Department of the Environment?  Has that draft been signalled or conveyed to the Commission?  Are any of the member states aware of such an initiative?</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that that is considerably fewer than the number of house starts projected to start in 1989, which the House was told would be 587 in a Parliamentary Question earlier this year?  Does the Minister not accept that this number of house starts is totally inadequate in view of the long <Col N="1634" /> waiting lists in almost every local authority and the critical housing situation being faced by many families who cannot get local authority housing, which is putting stress on family life?  When will the Minister approve the building of new local authority housing?</P>

I understand from the Minister's statement that they are now being faced with a waiting time of between five and seven years.  Has the Minister anything to offer to those people in view of, by his own admission, his <Col N="1637" /> failure to build more than 300 houses, 600 fewer than was hoped?

Is there any possibility that in these schemes a number of local authorities, because of their knowledge of the employment figures and the fact that they occasionally employ temporary staff, will be allowed more leeway to get on with the schemes rather than waiting for other agencies to be involved as well?</P>

      <P>It could be considered.  I cannot remember the exact figures but between the Department of the Environment and the Department of Education there are about 3,500 applications in hand at the moment and they have all been returned to the local authorities. To satisfy all would require about £130 million or £140 million, and I have £5.5 million to satisfy the demand.  Following these submissions from the local authorities, it is not going to be easy to satisfy everybody.

The emphasis in the housing area is in favour of the better off. The property market is running wild and putting the price of houses in the private sector beyond the means of most young <Col N="1642" /> couples, while at the same time there is no adequate local authority housing programme.

      <P>I have already announced that, pending the enactment of the legislation, it is proposed to put arrangements in place so that some aspects of the work of the agency can be progressed as soon as possible. I have in mind, for example, that work would be undertaken in relation to development of information and computer systems, the preparation of proposals in relation to laboratory facilities and other equipment needs, the development of organisational arrangements and staff structures, and so on.

      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's analysis of the statement of 5 December.  With the exception of Members of this House, that statement was widely applauded by all the environmental groups.  I wish Deputies would support the agency as proposed by the Government.  The practice of publishing proposals initially approved by the Government is unusual and it has been done to give the maximum information to Members of this House and to the public generally.  It is not true that the agency's budget will be £500,000.  In the 1990 Estimates £500,000 has been provided for the initial start-up costs but additional money will be made available. Many of the staff will be recruited from the State sector.  We do not want to duplicate. Where we have good staff we will take them in to work for the agency and if necessary additional staff will be recruited elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's plans for the overall improvement of the environment and the plans to encourage and support local authorities in this regard are generally set out in the <i>Programme for Government, 1989-1993</i> and the <i>National Development Plan, 1989-1993,</i> which was submitted to the Commission of the European Communities in the context of the EC Structural Funds. Many of my Department's programmes and most local authorities' activities are either directly or indirectly related to the improvement of environmental conditions. It would not be feasible to go into all of these in this reply but I will refer briefly to some of the more recent developments.</P>
      <P>As already indicated by the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, an office for the protection and improvement of the environment under a separate Minister of State has been established.  Legislation to set up an independent Environmental Protection Agency is currently being prepared and I expect the agency to be in operation next year.  Details of the proposals for the agency were published on 5 December but one of its functions will be to provide support, back up and advice to local authorities on environmental matters.</P>
      <P>An integrated programme of measures to combat water pollution was adopted by the Government in 1987 and included the carrying out of farm surveys, a review of licences to discharge trade effluents, an awareness and education programme, a review of controls on agricultural development under the planning Acts and the amendment of the Water Pollution Act, 1977, to strengthen the powers available and to provide for civil liability for pollution damages and remedial measures at the polluters' expense.  The Bill has already passed all stages in the Seanad and is at present being debated in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The substantial programme of investment in sanitary and other local services will be continued in order to achieve and maintain proper quality standards for water supplies, to prevent pollution, to <Col N="1649" /> ensure that services necessary for industry, agriculture and other developments are available, and to assist in the protection of water resources for amenity and recreational uses.</P>
    <P>In relation to waste, it is proposed to continue the scheme of financial assistance for waste recycling projects including paper, glass, cans and plastics in 1990. Special emphasis is being placed on eliminating farmyard pollution and solving the related problems of basic animal housing and fodder storage.</P>
    <P>The Air Pollution Act, 1987, has provided the powers to tackle air pollution problems and there has been a significant increase of activity by local authorities on this matter.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will continue to be encouraged and supported by providing the necessary legislative framework for their environmental activities and by advice, guidelines or directives as appropriate.  I would refer the Deputy to the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 199 of 14 November 1989 in relation to the additional resources being made available to local authorities for environmental protection.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will outline the effective working relationship between his Department, the local authorities and the National Roads Authority; the work carried out by the National Roads Authority to date; the additional skills, if any, which it has brought to the existing organisations; the cost to the taxpayer <Col N="1650" /> involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to introduce a comprehensive Roads Bill in the next session which will include provision for the setting up of a National Roads Authority on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>Pending the enactment of the legislation, the interim authority has a significant role to play in the operation of the national roads programme.  It can carry out the following functions: supervision of the development programme for national roads; annual review of road development programmes; making of recommendations to the Minister on the annual State road grant allocations for the improvement and maintenance of national roads; promotion of private sector investment in tolled roads; the preparation and submission (for approval) of future medium-term plans for the development of the network of national roads, subject to financial guidelines by the Minister; and the promotion of the case for future EC financial assistance for national roads with the relevant EC agencies.  Fifteen administrative staff and 13 professional staff of the Department of the Environment are providing services to the interim authority pending its establishment on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>The Minister has overall responsibility for policy, finance and legislation relating to national roads.  Local authorities continue to have a major role in the development of the national road network.  It is envisaged that they will normally act on behalf of the Authority in relation to design work and contracts.  They will also continue to be responsible for the maintenance of national roads.</P>
      <P>Specific documents prepared by the Authority include a submission containing its views on a draft document on a medium to long-term strategy for road development prepared by the Department and the Authority's recommendations as to the content of legislation to establish it on a statutory basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding skills, the membership of the Authority was outlined in the press <Col N="1651" /> statement I issued at the launching of the Authority.</P>
    <P>Grants totalling £48,000 have been made available from the Department's Vote to meet the general expenses of the Authority in 1988 and 1989.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the sum of £48,000, which has been transferred virtually in its entirety to the Confederation of Irish Industry, the employer of the Chairman of the National Roads Interim Authority, has been a direct subsidy to private sector interests for skills and expertise which were already resident within the Department? Would the Minister also agree that his failure, as witnessed by his reply two days ago, to have the heads of a Bill to establish the National Roads Authority circulated to Government at this stage is a gross dereliction of duty?  Can the Minister explain to the House why after his two and a half years in office this authority has not been established?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Browne is unable to be present may I ask the Minister if, in view of the fact that it is becoming commonplace that drivers are subjected to headlights from oncoming cars, lights which literally would cut the eyes out of one's head, and in view of the fact that it is acknowledged, within the garage trade, that Ireland is becoming increasingly a dumping ground for a cheap variety of headlights from Eastern bloc countries, that there is a need to do something about this problem.  The problem arises from the fact that these headlights are designed for left-hand drive cars.  Any expert in the focusing of lights would acknowledge that it is almost impossible to focus them in accordance with our driving standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, we have had no representations in this matter. Should it come to light that there is dumping at below cost prices from third countries, that is, countries outside the EC, as suggested by Deputy Higgins, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has power to restrict any such dumping.  The <Col N="1655" /> Deputy is right when he says there is a road traffic regulation dealing with this matter.  That is article 48 (2) (b) of the Road Traffic Lighting of Vehicles Regulations, 1963.  The article stipulates that dipped headlamps on a vehicle should be so fitted and constructed as to be incapable of dazzling a person who is on the same horizontal plane as the vehicle at a greater distance distance than 25 feet from the land and whose eye level is not less than 3 foot 6 inches above the plain. There is a maximum fine on conviction for a breach of that regulation of £150 for a first offence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the reason the proportion of motorcycle fatalities on Irish roads has been steadily increasing since 1978, despite the compulsory wearing of helmets, the voluntary use of daytime headlights and the drop in the sale of motor cycles; and if he has considered recent research (details supplied) which suggests that the use of daytime headlights may be contributing to motorcycle accidents; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1656" />
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>During the period 1978 to 1988, the number of motorcyclists killed in road accidents in Ireland, expressed as a proportion of total road fatalities, was as follows: 1978, 9.2 per cent; 1979, 7.5 per cent; 1980, 8.5 per cent; 1981, 10.8 per cent; 1982, 11.3 per cent; 1983, 11.4 per cent; 1984, 12.7 per cent; 1985, 12.2 per cent; 1986, 12.9 per cent; 1987, 15.2 per cent and 1988, 11.4 per cent.</P>
      <P>The rate of motorcycle fatalities is disproportionately high.  In 1987, this rate was broadly in line with the average in EC member states.  In Ireland, there was a welcome drop in the number of such fatalities from 70 in 1987 to an estimated 53 in 1988.</P>
      <P>The research to which the Deputy refers was carried out in April-May 1985.  While the research was worthwhile, it was not conclusive.  The daytime use of motor cycle headlights is compulsory in a number of countries including Denmark, France, Norway, Sweden and some federal states in the USA.  The position relating to the voluntary and compulsory use of such headlights during the daytime will be kept under review, in consultation with the organisations concerned.</P>
      <P>The reasons for the high number of motor cycle fatalities are not clear.  In the interests of reducing the rate of such fatalities, I announced the following two measures on 9 November 1989 in conjunction with the introduction of a Euro-style driving licence in Ireland: (1) a motorcyclist with a provisional licence must not carry a passenger, (2) a person must now spend at least two years driving a motorcycle of up to 125cc capacity with a full licence before being permitted to hold a licence for a more powerful motorcycle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in order to take action to reduce the level of fatalities among motor cyclists it is necessary to be clear about the causes of motorcycle accidents? Would he not accept that, as the number of motorcycle sales has halved since 1975 and as helmets have now become compulsory, there are grounds for believing that the use of daytime headlights, as is <Col N="1657" /> suggested in the research carried out in Trinity College, may be contributing to the level of accidents and fatalities and would he agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be happy to do anything that would lead to a reduction in the type of horrific accidents that occur in motorcycle accidents.  We will have to accept that motorcyclists are a very high risk category of road user.  Relative to their numbers, they are involved in a disproportionately high level of fatal road accidents.  The number of motorcyclists constitutes about 3 per cent of the total number of licensed vehicles, some 25,000 out of 980,000 in all, yet they accounted for 11.4 per cent of all road deaths in 1988 and 15.2 per cent in 1987.  The figures were 31,000 in 1987 which means there has been a reduction.  We have a very high record by comparison with other EC member states in terms of motorcycles alone.  I would be happy to discuss the matter quite openly either with the Deputy or with the Irish motorcyclists association or to do anything that would help in any way to reduce the number of injuries and fatalities involving motorcyclists.  There was nothing conclusive in the report to which I referred today.  The measures I have mentioned will be of some assistance and if the Deputy wishes to raise the issue later I will be happy to do what I can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 47 together.  The urban renewal programme has been very successful. It has generated considerable redevelopment in the designated areas excluding the Customs House Docks Development, some £30 million of work has been completed, and projects under construction and in planning amount in value to some £110 million and £170 million respectively.</P>
      <P>In addition, I allocated the £2 million in grants during 1989 towards works by local authorities designed to upgrade the environment of the designated areas and to complement private sector activity.  A further £2 million will be provided for this purpose in 1990.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated the proposal to extend designation for urban renewal to a number of new areas in Dublin city, north and south, and to parts of eight new urban areas outside Dublin.  Details of this proposal are being finalised with a view to completing the necessary orders under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to join with the Minister in recognising that the designated areas concept has been a success, however slow it was to get off the ground.  In respect of the Minister's reply may I ask him when he will be in a position to convey to the eight new urban areas the announcement that they will be included, for the first time, as designated <Col N="1659" /> areas and when the new extended areas in relation to the Dublin city region &mdash; and perhaps other regions as well of which I am not aware &mdash; will be announced?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The extension of the present deadline to May 1991 is one of the difficulties in relation to this matter. As the Deputy is aware, the deadline was extended for the five county boroughs in 1987.  I want to have the right sort of balance and I do not want people to think they have a longer time available and that they need not hurry the development.  It is my intention to carefully consider what we can do to assist those who are contemplating starting now and who might not be in a position to finish by the deadline, thereby causing us to lose the investment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that will happen because the lines are drawn by the local authorities and the local representatives have a very keen interest in the matter.  Inevitably they want a bigger area than it is possible to incorporate in that designated area but we must keep the principle of regenerating derelict areas in existing cities and towns in mind.  There has been good co-operation in this regard and I should like local representative involvement to be maintained in the whole question of renewal.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that I have a hang-up about CDL and their products.  It is not my intention or wish to promote the products of any company. The Department of the Environment wish to inform people of the facts and that is what we sought to do in the information leaflets which were distributed to every house in Dublin.  I had a meeting this week with representatives of Bord na Móna and I should like to encourage people in the Dublin area to use their products and those of other companies which have a low bituminous content.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the committee should report as soon as possible.  They were given a three months' deadline and, as they are in existence for one month, they will be reporting towards the end of February.  Of course it is my wish to promote an Irish product as opposed to a foreign product, but the information which was distributed by my Department on the basis of the Eolas report into the different solid fuel options found that Coalite had an emission of 1.8 grammes per hour an average as against peat briquettes which had an emission of 14.8 grammes.  It would be wrong of me not to give such information.</P>

For example, in Britain there is a limit of £4,000 per candidate.  Does the Minister think that such a limit would be a good idea in Ireland to equalise the playing field?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in the United Kingdom the law places a limit on candidates' expenses and requires returns to be furnished after the election. However, the expenses controlled in this way bear little relation to the total cost of an election campaign because in the UK no account is taken of expenditure at national level by political parties or sponsoring organisations, trade unions, employer bodies or anything of that kind, or indeed of the news media.  I bring to the Deputy's attention that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Electoral Law stated that the idea was obsolete, and useless, and I am inclined to agree with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the limited extent of the Minister's reply. Surely he and the other members of the Government would agree that the objective in setting up the present Seanad, through the 1937 initiative of the then Taoiseach and later President de Valera, has now been undermined, particularly in regard to the vocational aspect?  Why does the Minister not give some serious consideration to the Seanad Electoral Law Committee which reported in 1960? That committee suggested that instead of the present system, which has been undermined by political interests, the vocational interests which President de Valera wished to be represented in the Seanad should now be given an opportunity to elect their own representatives directly.  Has the Minister any views or is <Col N="1666" /> he prepared to take any initiative on that matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated, under the Constitution, as the Deputy well knows, the Seanad is an integral part of the Oireachtas and its powers are set out in the Constitution.  It is the wish of the Government that the input of the Seanad should be a vigorous one and it should be as effective as possible.  I understand the matter was considered by the Seanad itself on 13 December 1989 and perhaps we will wait and see what transpires as a result of that.</P>

Initially I put down questions regarding both Houses but the question as regards the Dáil was disallowed because apparently there is a select committee from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges looking into the reform of the Dáil at present.  Surely the reform of the Seanad is a matter for the Government.  The Seanad itself is not capable of reforming the manner in which its Members are elected.

As far as reform within the framework of the Constitution is concerned, such matters as the composition of the Seanad, the numbers to be elected from panels and university constituencies, the number to be nominated by the Taoiseach and also the powers of the Seanad in relation to legislation, are set out in the Constitution.

      <P>There are a number of ways open to Members of this House of raising matters and the Chair permitted questions on this issue.  I wrote to you this morning, Sir, indicating that it was my intention under the provisions of Standing Order 143 to move the suspension of Standing Orders so that a motion could be discussed.  My office received a reply from your office to the effect that Standing Order 143 could not be used in this case because it relates only to Private Members' Time. We have had this discussion in the House before and I am bound to say, with the utmost humility and without wishing to raise a row, that it is my considered opinion that your ruling is not quite accurate. There is nothing in Standing Order 143 which relates in any way, however remotely, to Private Members' Time.  I wish to remind you, Sir, that I previously told you it was my intention to have that matter clarified by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges because that ruling represents a totally unjustified interference with the rights of Members of this House.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Col N="1765" />
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my pleasure to offer a few words of welcome to this Bill since I was one of the first people to raise this question in this House by way of parliamentary questions some five or six years ago when weapons such as cross-bows and various prehistoric weapons were being introduced into the country, firstly, in the pursuit of sport and, secondly, by young people who wanted to be seen to be macho and tough, and part of a new era and a bygone era.  They felt they had to possess such weapons which were used on occasions in violent incidents.  For that reason I should like to compliment the Minister on introducing the Bill because we cannot ignore such incidents.</P>
      <P>We cannot allow the use of offensive weapons to continue.  That is not acceptable to our citizens.  We cannot give the impression that such offensive weapons are acceptable.  Their use should not go unchallenged.  There is great concern among all citizens about the growth in the use and carrying of those offensive weapons.  Old people are frightened and young people have been the victims of threats by people carrying such weapons. Timid teenagers who are not part of the &ldquo;in gangs&rdquo; or the macho image feel vulnerable to attack and intimidation from young people carrying knives and other weapons.  People in my constituency have expressed concern about the existence of crossbows and other offensive weapons. They have asked if the Government intend introducing legislation to regulate the manufacture and sale of such weapons.  I am sure those people will welcome the Bill.</P>
      <P>In the course of his speech the Minister referred to crossbows and the developments that have taken place in the production of such weapons in recent years. One never knows if a Bill of this type will be able to deal with further developments in the production of such weapons.  The Minister should try to cover any developments that will take place.  There is a fear that at some stage in the future similar weapons will be outside the scope of the Bill.  Legislation should be thorough and cater for all eventualities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1766" /> There is a reference in the Bill to the carrying of offensive weapons with intent to cause injury.  A weapon may be carried for defensive or offensive purposes.  However, a person who carries a defensive weapon indirectly is encouraging his or her peers to do the same.  Some young people going to a dance may feel intimidated and decide to carry a flick knife but that cannot be tolerated.  If we did we would be encouraging others to carry them.  We would not know where that would end.  In the heat of an argument such offensive weapons could be used with disastrous consequences.  The only way to deal with them is to prohibit them. There is no reason a person should carry a knuckleduster or a flick knife that has four or five variations.  There is no reason a person should have a crossbow and arrows in the boot of a car or on a motorbike.</P>
    <P>However, it is important to emphasise that it is the duty of the State to protect all members of the public, young and old. People walking down the street of any town or city during the day or at night should be free to do so without fear of an attack from any quarter.  I was astonished to read in recent days of an horrific attack on a young person in this city.  The newspaper described it as a vicious and unprovoked attack.  The unfortunate young person was maimed in that attack.  It may be said that if that young person was carrying a defensive weapon he would have suffered greater injury, but we must condemn such a savage attack in broad daylight by other young people.  His attackers, who had malicious intent, were carrying offensive weapons and they caused serious injury to the young boy. If I was the parent of such a young person I would be slow to permit him to go outside the house on his own.</P>
    <P>Where will it all end?  We must ensure that we have a sufficient number of gardaí to prevent such incidents.  We must eliminate the marauders and the predators. The sooner we do that the better.  The best way to do it is to ensure that there is a Garda presence in all our streets.  It is the Garda who can intimidate such young hooligans out of business.  Those <Col N="1767" /> violent young people have no function on our streets.  They roam with the intention of intimidating people, snatching handbags, knocking people down, opening car boots, breaking car windows or breaking into houses.  They try to intimidate as many people as possible and we should not tolerate that.</P>
    <P>The Firearms Act covers air guns and so on.  The Minister should keep in mind that there is a possibility that weapons may be developed which will fall outside the scope of that Act and the Bill under discussion.  We should ensure that there is no latitude for young thugs to carry out their acts of terrorism.  The ownership of offensive weapons is an important element of the Bill.  We should not tolerate the operation of a brokerage or people who make available to hooligans and professional or amateur criminals any offensive weapons.  We should not tolerate those who manufacture, sell or hire offensive weapons.  It is most reassuring that the Bill makes an attempt to put such people out of business and I hope it will be permanent.  The only place where those weapons should be on display, with the exception of those places where they are used under supervision for sporting purposes, is in a museum and other such similar places where we go to see the weapons used by our forefathers when fighting wars in bygone years.</P>
    <P>I have made reference to the supposed need to carry weapons.  In my view there is no need to carry weapons and there is a responsibility on the State to ensure that the Garda Síochána are sufficiently well equipped to deal with them.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I would like to refer to, even though it does not relate directly to the Bill.  Let me say this, and I hope some legislation will be introduced on this one also in the not too distant future, that some very large dogs are now being used by gangs of young people to intimidate other young people and the elderly in the pursuit of crimes of whatever kind.  The time is fast approaching when we will have to seriously consider introducing legislation in an effort to curtail such activities.  There are those who <Col N="1768" /> will say that certain species of dogs, such as guard dogs, are bred for a specific purpose and that these do not present a threat to nor interfere with people in their day to day lives.  I am aware of a number of recent cases where young people carrying weapons had with them the type of mastiff I have in mind and used these animals with the sole purpose of achieving their objective which was to maim or cause injury, rob and intimidate the people they were after.</P>
    <P>We will have to seriously consider whether we should introduce strict and rigid controls on who may own, lend or deal in such animals.  It may be said that these are fine animals and are used for legitimate purposes but so are lions, tigers and various other animals.  At one time I heard the ridiculous suggestion, I presume it was of a frivolous nature, that a pet lion be kept in a certain area.  If we head down that road, of people wanting to be totally ridiculous, we will eventually go from the sublime to the ridiculous. The Minister might consider at a later stage introducing legislation in this area encompassing such controls.</P>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister rightly said that the public should not be allowed to take the law into their own hands nor should they, in my opinion, consider it necessary to do so.  Be that as it may, the number of break-ins and attempts to intimidate are obviously on the increase. Whether we like it or not, and this may be open to contradiction, the general public feel that if they are being intimidated in their own homes or subjected to a breakin by a marauder, they have the right to protect themselves.  I am aware that this does not relate directly to the Bill but while on the one hand, I accept that the public cannot take the law into their own hands, at the same time I believe that any member of the public has the right to defend himself when under attack.  This should be kept in mind in cases &mdash; this has been referred to by Deputy O'Dea &mdash; where the person under suspicion may be able to prove that he or she was simply trying to defend himself or herself.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, a whole range of sprays and stun guns are now available on the <Col N="1769" /> market which could be regarded as either offensive or defensive weapons depending on the way they are used.  Reference is made to these in the Bill.  Technological developments proceed at a very fast pace and in order for us to control the use of these items it may be necessary to be far more specific on Committee Stage and to clearly define how far the Minister should go in limiting the use of these items.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, this Bill is timely and is to be welcomed by all of us in this House. I hope it is sufficiently far-reaching to ensure it will still be effective some years hence and does not go out of date within a short period for the very reasons I have stated.  There is a number of items we can deal with on Committee Stage but I hope we will reach the position following the enactment of this Bill where young people will be able to convene in a public place in the knowledge that no member of the group has access to weapons which are not acceptable in our society and that they can frequent such places without the fear and underlying worry of an unnecessary or unprovoked attack similar to the one I have referred as having taken place in this city during the past few weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I also welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Burke, and his predecessor, Deputy Collins, who is now Minister for Foreign Affairs, for the work they have done in updating our criminal law.</P>
      <P>This Bill has a two-fold purpose, namely, to bring crossbows and stun guns within the definition of firearm and to make it unlawful in specified circumstances to carry, or trade in, other dangerous and offensive weapons.  In considering the criminal law, it is necessary to look at the position of the serious criminal on the one hand, the one who deliberately arms himself for the purpose of committing a serious offence, be it armed robbery, drug trafficking or personal assault, and on the other, the general need to control and have a body of legislation which regulates behaviour in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1770" /> This Bill is not, with perhaps rare exceptions, aimed at the serious criminal. It is designed to update and modernise an area of criminal law and introduce new safeguards which are becoming increasingly necessary in modern society.  The vast majority of people go about their daily business without any involvement in serious criminal activity.  It is suggested from time to time that we are a lawless society but these are totally unfounded. Crime is not out of control but despite this we have an average number of 30 cases per week of assault causing injury.</P>
    <P>The crime figures as reported in the Garda Commissioner's annual report highlight a wide range of criminal activity.  One area in particular needs to be referred to put these figures in perspective. Out of a total of 90,000 indictable crimes, some involve the unlawful taking of motor vehicles or the taking of items from motor vehicles.  I understand the number of cases involving the taking of items amounts to 20,000.  The amount of Garda time devoted to solving these crimes is enormous.  Yet, what steps do motorists take to protect their vehicles and their valuables?  One can go down any of our streets and see valuables left on display in cars, encouraging offenders. We do not insist on good quality locks on cars and almost any car key can open any car door in seconds.  Car alarms frequently do not work or owners forget that they are switched on and alarms ring for a long time to such an extent that people now ignore them.  This is an area that should be looked at with a view to saving the time of the Garda.  We should play a more active role in reducing opportunities for crime, and we could do so in this area.  This would give the Garda more time for basic policing duties and they could have a more visible role on the streets.</P>
    <P>This Bill is very important in the context of recent developments at public events.  It is refreshing that we are introducing these controls not having waited for a major disaster to occur first.  This legislation is designed to prevent outbreaks of hooliganism similar to what <Col N="1771" /> occurred at events in Europe and America.</P>
    <P>There is an acceptance that the law should be tightened to limit the availability, use and possession of offensive and potentially dangerous weapons. There has been a growing use of knives and other weapons in recent years to cause injury and death.  We must reverse this trend before it grows to serious proportions.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill deals with the extension of the definition of firearms to include an air gun, a crossbow and a stun gun.  I am concerned that this extended definition may soon be inadequate.  A stun gun is a weapon which inflicts an electric shock.  Because of the speed of developments in modern technology there could soon be instruments available to cause other types of shock.  Will the Minister consider whether he can take power under this Bill to extend the definition to cover offensive weapons which may come on the market in the future?  Deputy Durkan also referred to this.</P>
    <P>A crossbow is a dangerous weapon which can have legitimate sporting uses. I am not clear why there has to be a weight requirement.  If the crossbow is offensive, why is there a restriction on its offensiveness by reference to weight? There must be some other way of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>Are long bows excluded from the scope of the Bill because they have not been used in modern times in criminal activity? while they would be difficult to conceal and may be awkward in most situations they could be used in certain circumstances to intimidate people.  While I do not want to see an extension of licensing beyond what is reasonable, could they not be included within the meaning of offensive weapons under section 8 of the Bill?  Will the Minister consider if anything can be done to reduce the possibility of using the long bow illegally to intimidate people?  It obviously will not be used in carrying out robberies as it is too awkward, but it could be used where there is time and <Col N="1772" /> space.  The list of weapons which can be offensive in certain circumstances should be as comprehensive as possible and it should be possible for the Minister to add to it by the Minister making regulations as circumstances change.</P>
    <P>Section 8 makes the possession of knives and other articles unlawful and subsection (2) refers to any other article made or adapted to cause injury or incapacity to a person, and the possession of such an item in any public place shall be an offence.  There is no reference to otherwise lawful objects which may not be adapted in any way which could be used for unlawful purposes.  What is the position where one or more of a gang of youths out at night have a lump hammer or a screw driver, implements which can be very offensive in certain circumstances? Indeed, a screwdriver is the most frequently used item used to secure unlawful entry to motor cars, yet the Garda can do nothing even when they know a person is carrying a screwdriver. Will this Bill change anything?  I would like to hear the Minister's comments.</P>
    <P>The question of imprisonment on conviction should concern all of us.  It costs something in the region of £30,000 per annum to keep a person in prison, yet there are many in prison for activities which could hardly be regarded as posing a threat to the community, for example, for the non-payment of fines or debts.  I am concerned about the release of prisoners whose sentences have not been fully served.  While I would like to see a greater use of community service orders for instance I am not happy about prisoners being released without serving their sentences.  I congratulate the Minister on his recent announcement that Wheatfield Prison will open next year.  The opening of the prison will create an extra 200 jobs in the prison service and will provide 300 extra prison places.  It will do a lot to allay public concern and worry about prisoners convicted of serious crimes being released without serving their sentences. We must get our priorities right.  Some people are being detained for minor offences while people convicted of serious offences are being released early. <Col N="1773" /> It is important that the public are made aware that people who commit crime will have to face the full rigours of the law and serve their sentences.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas regularly introduces new legislation providing for new criminal offences.  If the laws are to prove effective the criminal justice system must be capable of handling the volume of work.  I am glad the Minister is taking urgent action to increase the presence of gardaí on the street.  This is essential if the people are to have confidence in the system of law and order and know that the Government are concerned with the safety of the people.  I welcome the decision to employ 250 clerical assistants to release trained gardaí for outdoor duties.</P>
    <P>While the Minister has made considerable progress in introducing new legislation, there is still a lot of work to be done.  I have spoken before of the need for a Dáil committee to revise criminal law.  There is a large volume of criminal legislation dating back to the middle of the last century which needs to be updated, simplified and brought into line with current monetary values.  A Dáil committee with adequate support staff would be an ideal vehicle for updating these laws.  I realise that because of financial constraints it is not possible for the Minister to do what I wish, but he should keep the proposition under review.  I compliment the Minister on the excellent job he is doing and for the way in which he is deciding his priorities for the good of the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like other speakers, wholeheartedly welcome this Bill.  It is a measure that is long overdue. Unfortunately it is a necessary measure. In society today violence is glamourised on the television screens, in the cinemas and in every magazine whether directed towards adults or children.  Legislation is long overdue and I congratulate the Minister on taking the initiative in coming up with a measure to ban stun guns, crossbows and other offensive weapons. &ldquo;Other offensive weapons&rdquo; covers a multitude. On Committee Stage this Bill will <Col N="1774" /> be given very close scrutiny because it is important that &ldquo;other offensive weapons&rdquo; should be looked at in detail.  Violence has escalated in urban areas.  Not only are lethal weapons &mdash; stun guns, crossbows and knives of all shapes and sizes &mdash; freely available, but the humble catapult which many of us as young people used innocently, has been defined as a deadly weapon when used with ballbearings, supposedly to kill vermin but it can be used very viciously.</P>
      <P>Army surplus stores have been referred to this evening.  They have proliferated. It is wrong to have balaclava helmets hanging outside shops for sale. Balaclavas are associated with the underworld and crime in general and it is incomprehensible that shops in our main streets sell these goods.  The legitimate army surplus trade is fairly extensive. Many people buy army surplus for legitimate reasons such as camping and caravanning. However, side by side with such items, we see dangerous knives and weapons which should be completely banned from retail sale, or wholesale for that matter.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that this Bill will get a speedy passage through the Dáil, having been scrutinised carefully by Members first.  Public representatives have been aware for some time of the problems in this regard.  Committees have been set up in various areas in an effort to combat crime, but it is very difficult for any public representative or anyone in authority to curb crime if weapons of this nature are glamorised on our streets or in our cinemas.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides wide powers of examination and arrest for the Garda.  This provision must be examined.  In fairness to the Garda, they take tremendous risks when they apprehend anyone because not alone are the weapons we see in shops available, but screwdrivers, steel combs and so on are used by the common criminal and the garda takes his life in his hands when he tries to apprehend such persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill contains positive elements which I welcome and support.  Some parts <Col N="1775" /> of it require careful scrutiny, but generally I have to congratulate the Minister on introducing it.  Our innocence is long gone and the Bill is a reaction to the society in which we live.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Bill, 1989, as most timely legislation the main purpose of which is to bring crossbows and stun guns within the definition of &ldquo;firearms&rdquo; in the context of the Firearms Acts, 1925 to 1971, and to make it unlawful in certain specified circumstances to carry or trade in other dangerous or offensive weapons.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the society emerging is one where there is an increasing preponderance of carrying or owning firearms or offensive weapons.  Of course, I do not refer specifically to firearms held under the appropriate licence arising out of the Firearms Acts, but for a variety of reasons individuals are to some extent arming themselves with offensive weapons in the belief that they are somehow safer or in a better position to defend themselves.  For some time people have felt insecure about their personal safety or the safety and security of their own homes.  This is very regrettable and needs to be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy that in this Bill the present Government are tackling coherently at last the whole area of crime and lawlessness. For example, in 1990 it will cost £36.8 million to run the Garda and Prison Service.  At this stage I compliment the Minister for Justice on his recently announced major crime fighting package for 1990.  I welcome the fact that 250 civilian clerical staff are to be appointed to release gardaí from office work to work on crime prevention and detection.  Very often as we go about our business as public representatives meeting with community organisations and other interested groups and discussing crime and lawlessness, remarks are made about the major waste of the valuable time of gardaí in dealing with clerical duties.  The Minister's decision to appoint 250 clerical staff is a response to the calls that he has received from various groups around the <Col N="1776" /> country who raised the issue with all of us.  It is well that our gardaí, who are trained and equipped to deal with crime prevention and detection, spend as much of their time in pursuit of that activity as possible rather than dealing with clerical work which can be dealt with efficiently by the sort of person the Minister now proposes to appoint.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Minister's move in this regard extended to the courts where, I am advised, the time of gardaí is taken up to a very great extent waiting for various cases in which they are involved to be called.  If we achieve what the Minister is now clearly setting out to achieve in regard to the clerical duties of gardaí, we would release more gardaí for duty in the area they are best equipped to serve, that is, crime prevention and protection.  The new training regime for Garda recruits is welcome.  I am convinced it will enhance further the effectiveness of the gardaí serving their communities.</P>
    <P>I would not like this opportunity to pass without complimenting sincerely all the members of the Garda Síochána for their outstanding contribution to crime prevention and detection.  I am sure we all agree that their outstanding dedication to what is very often a difficult, onerous and sometimes dangerous task is evident and that the community at large owe a great deal to the continued commitment of the members of the Garda Síochána to their role and duty in serving the community.</P>
    <P>The morale of the Garda Síochána is extremely important.  This Bill is an indication of the Government's intent to strengthen as much as possible the hand of the Garda in dealing with difficulties and dangers.  Its purpose is to impose legislation that will allow the gardaí to deal effectively with the type of circumstances it seeks to redress.</P>
    <P>To some extent it is quite extraordinary that it has taken so long for legislation of this kind to reach the House.  From all the contributions it is obvious that the Bill is long overdue, and recognised to be so.  The Minister pointed out in his opening address that while the law has <Col N="1777" /> been strict about the possession of guns, there have been very few controls on the carrying of other offensive weapons such as knives and other dangerous articles. The Bill sets out to rectify this serious omission and must therefore be welcomed. The community at large will be safer because of it and the Bill will strengthen the hands of the gardaí.  It is extraordinary to see the array of knives and other offensive weapons which are freely available to anyone who wishes to acquire them.  These included knives, stun guns, machetes and electrical shock-transmitting devices of various kinds.  All these weapons are fairly new arrivals but the problem is that they are so widely available.  This legislation will tighten matters considerably.  This is essential if we are to come to grips with this very serious problem in regard to personal safety.</P>
    <P>There has been a tendency over the years, but particularly in recent times, for people to take the law into their own hands.  To some extent one can understand their frustration in adopting this course which is due to the breakdown in some areas of law and order.  It is not, however, a development that any of us here can welcome.  I do not believe it is the proper solution to the maintenance of law and order.  It is not right that people should arm themselves as a group and thereby seek to provide law and order for their community.</P>
    <P>We have seen examples of this type of development in the recent past especially in some of the major urban areas.  Laudable as the intention of these organisations may appear to be, very quickly they descend to lawlessness themselves. On occasion self-appointed groups who set out to take the law into their own hands have found themselves in court having broken the law.  Our confidence must be placed in the gardaí whose duty it is to implement the law.  No other self-appointed group of individuals ought to be allowed usurp the powers of the gardaí in this most important area.  We can have no confidence in such groups and they should not be tolerated.  Frequently they break the very law they set out to defend.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1778" /> It is extraordinary to see so many young people carrying offensive weapons, not necessarily with the intention of using them.  Once they are available, however, some incident or problem will arise which will invariably mean that the knife or other weapon will be used, often with tragic consequences.  I am glad the Minister is dealing with this problem and taking account of the widespread worry among parents, teachers, social workers and other interested individuals and organisations.  We have to deal with the problem where anybody can walk into certain shops and purchase these instruments, with no good intent in mind.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on some other areas of the Bill.  Section 4 of Part II involves an extension of the legislation to include crossbows and stun guns.  These implements are clearly defined but developments in these areas are rapid and legislation which seeks to name specific offensive weapons can soon be superseded by new inventions.  I agree that the Minister should take to himself power to make regulations to include new weapons which may come on the market.  The slingshot was like the catapult, but some very advanced designs of this type of weapon are available which are lethal when accurately used.  There have been reports in other countries of the use of these weapons to devastating effect, frequently in breach of the law.  The regulations should be framed in such a way as to include such weapons as they are developed.</P>
    <P>Section 4 refers to the fact that there are many different types of crossbow. The old crossbow was a very simple affair and, unless very accurately used, not very dangerous.  The type of crossbow now available varies in design and power and would hardly be recognised as a crossbow. In some situations it is as lethal as a deadly firearm and can be used with the same degree of accuracy because of its design and telescopic sights.  Some are not crossbows in the strict sense since they are pistol-controlled.  I wonder if this type of weapon is covered under section 4 and I bring the matter to the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1779" /> I now turn to the person who has an authorised firearm.  Under section 7 the reckless discharge of firearms is referred to.  This is most important because up to recent times those who held firearms by licence were inclined to feel that they had the right to use those firearms in their own defence or to make a point.  I welcome the fact that section 7 deals with this matter.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill sets out to deal with offensive weapons and the possession of knives and other articles.  Reference is made to the folding pocket knife.  As in the case of the crossbow, many different types of pocket knife are available.  There will be great difficulty in achieving a precise definition of a folding pocket knife, because to my mind it is quite probable that unscrupulous manufacturers and others will try to circumvent the legislation by so designing a weapon as to fit within the terms of a folding pocket knife but still be lethal.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I pay tribute to the Minister for bringing it forward.  At the opening of the debate, the Minister indicated he was amenable to reasonable suggestions for improving the Bill and said he looked forward to co-operation with all interested parties and organisations.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank all Deputies who have contributed to the debate.  The general reaction of Members on all sides has been to welcome the Bill.  Some of the points that have been raised can be more usefully teased out on Committee Stage. However, I will endeavour to reply now to some of the more general points made.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe raised a number of points.  First, he said that the definition of stun gun in the Bill is too narrow, and he gave some example of items, which might be used like a stun gun, and which might not be covered by the present definition.  I recognise that there may be validity in that argument.  The Minister for Justice will have the matter further examined before Committee Stage. Second, the Deputy, as well as Deputy O'Dea, asked whether imitation firearms could be dealt with in the Bill?  The difficulty with this suggestion &mdash; and Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned it himself &mdash; is that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish between an imitation firearm and a toy gun for the purposes of legal definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third, Deputy O'Keeffe felt that there should be a definition of &ldquo;lawful authority&rdquo; and &ldquo;reasonable excuse&rdquo; in the Bill.  It simply would not be possible to specify all the situations in which these defences could be raised legitimately, and ultimately it must be a matter for the courts to determine on the basis of the particular circumstances of the case whether such a defence has been established. Any attempt to confine these terms in the Bill would cause confusion. <Col N="1781" /> In the circumstances it is best left to the courts.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe questioned whether the search power in section 15 is adequate?  I think it is, given that there is a power of arrest and given that searches for knives and other weapons will generally consist of simply frisking people, which is something that can be done on the spot.</P>
    <P>Deputy Liam Kavanagh asked why crossbows with a draw weight of less than 1.4 kilogrammes are not being brought within the scope of the Firearms Acts. This point was also raised by Deputy McCartan and other speakers.  The answer to these questions is that a crossbow with a draw weight of less than 1.4 kilogrammes would be a toy, which would not present any danger to the public.  I understand that the draw weight of a serious crossbow would range from 20 kilogrammes upward.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan commented that in many cases it would be appropriate that the courts should make community service orders where a person has been convicted under the Bill.  I agree with him that such orders could be made in appropriate cases.  However, I do not believe it is wise to be seen to water down the penalties, which are provided in the Bill. I think it best that the courts be left to decide whether the circumstances of a case merit the imposition of non-custodial penalty.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the question of control on martial arts clubs.  I have noted his comments on this matter but, as he will appreciate, it is outside the scope of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McCartan when he says the Vagrancy Act, 1824, should be repealed in its entirety.  However, this will have to wait until other more urgent legislative priorities have been disposed of.  As the Deputy is not doubt aware, the most undesirable provision of that Act, a provision which punished homelessness, was repealed by the Housing Act, 1988.</P>
    <P>Deputies McCartan, Flanagan and others proposed that longbows should be controlled under the Bill.  There have been no reports of serious problems <Col N="1782" /> regarding longbows.  They do not share the characteristics which make the crossbow particularly dangerous, that is, they cannot be cocked and kept ready to fire; they require skill to use and they are more cumbersome.  However, should a problem arise with them the matter can then be considered again.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan and Deputy O'Dea asked why pocket knives are being exempted from the general prohibition on the carrying of knives etc. in places of public entertainment or resort.  The reason for this exemption is that a pocket knife is something a person &mdash; for example, a pipe smoker &mdash; could carry habitually.  It is reasonable therefore that it should be exempted from the general prohibition.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan mentioned that he found section 8 unnecessarily confusing. I appreciate his quest for simplicity of expression.  Unfortunately, in the context of drafting legislation this is not always possible.  I am satisfied that the format of the section is sufficiently clear and is what is needed to deal with the carrying of knives and other dangerous articles. However, we can look at this point in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Both Deputies McCartan and Deenihan questioned whether it is appropriate that peace commissioners should be permitted to issue search warrants under the Bill.  The position is that in a case which was decided in July 1987 the High Court held that the issuing of search warrants by peace commissioners is not contrary to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the need to cover &ldquo;repair&rdquo; in section 11.  The Deputy will find that this has been done by way of amendment in the Seanad and is covered in the latest text of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan expressed concern that the Bill could create difficulties for cutlery manufacturers.  The Deputy can be assured that neither the Bill nor the regulations will adversely affect them.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea referred to the need to review the question of an appeal procedure where a Garda superintendent refuses a firearms certificate and I have noted this point for future reference. <Col N="1783" /> Deputy O'Dea also referred to the definition of firearm in section 4 (1) (a) and asked for clarification as to whether it might be interpreted to include longbows, catapults etc.  Section 4 (1) (a) is merely a repetition of the definition contained in the 1975 Act.  The interpretation he suggests has not been taken by our courts down through the years.  Deputy O'Dea also mentioned an English case, where a firearm without a firing pin was held to be an imitation firearm.  I will certainly look into this case.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea queried the use of the term &ldquo;unlawfully&rdquo; in section 8 (3).  This term is intended to cover members of the security forces &mdash; for example, a garda who might carry a baton.  Deputy O'Dea also suggested some amendments to section 8 to deal with articles not covered, such as a hammer or an iron bar.  I will look at this but I think we may get into difficulties with definitions.  Towards the end of this contribution the Deputy also raised questions on the wording used in certain sections, but these are matters we can examine in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan asked about the necessary arrangements to be made for the issue of firearm certificates for stun guns and crossbows.  As the only use to which a stun gun can be put is to incapacitate another person, it is not envisaged that any firearm certificates would be issued for these weapons.  Crossbows will be permitted for legitimate sporting and recreational use only.  Deputy Flanagan suggested that crossbows should not be permitted for hunting.  As the Deputy knows the killing of a wild bird or animal with a crossbow is an offence under the Wildlife Acts for which I had some responsibility during the period of the last Government.  Deputy Flanagan and Deputy O'Sullivan, among others suggested there should be some controls on Army surplus shops selling dangerous weapons.  This will be covered by the regulations to be made under section 12.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan also queried the position where a person brings a length of pipe or other dangerous article to a <Col N="1784" /> football match or other sporting occasion.  This is the type of situation that will be covered by amendments which the Minister for Justice will bring forward on Committee Stage to implement the recommendations of the committee on public safety and crowd control.</P>
    <P>Deputy Joe Jacob asked what will happen to stun guns already in the country when the Bill is enacted.  I want to assure the House that these stun guns will then be treated as firearms and it will be an offence for a person to have one of them in his or her possession or control. Deputy Jacob appealed that something should be done about replica guns.  It should be mentioned that our law already provides severe penalties for the use of imitation firearms in the commission of crimes, including up to 14 years imprisonment for possession of an imitation firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence.  This is the way to deal with persons who misuse imitation firearms.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dermot Fitzpatrick asked that dangerous offensive weapons be prohibited. This will be done under section 11 of the Bill, which gives the Minister for Justice power to make regulations banning such weapons.  The Deputy also asked that the Minister should take account of possible future developments in the definition of firearms.  I wish to assure my colleagues that this will be examined before Committee Stage. Deputy Fitzpatrick also requested that controls should be introduced on dangerous dogs.  I can well understand that a person who represents the Phoenix Park area is interested in this problem.  I know that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has an interest in this area and will also share his concern.  I share the Deputy's concern in this matter but he will appreciate that it is outside the scope of the Bill which we are presently debating.  Deputy Fitzpatrick and others queried the position about aerosol weapons.  There is no need to deal separately with spray weapons because any weapon which is designed for the discharge of noxious liquid or gas is already covered by the Firearms Acts.</P>
    <P>Excellent contributions were also <Col N="1785" /> made by Deputies Durkan, Wallace and Flood.  Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan asked whether catapults and other dangerous articles should be controlled or banned altogether.  This will be looked at, but the Deputy will appreciate that catapults have legitimate uses.  Deputy Flood, in an excellent contribution, asked if pistol crossbows were covered by the Bill.  I assure the House that they are most definitely included.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Deputies who have made positive and sincere contributions to this Second Stage debate. The Minister for Justice looks forward to the Committee Stage debate and I am confident that, with the broad consensus in the House on the Bill, a very worthwhile Act will emerge thereafter.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>By the Minister's own admission in the Seanad yesterday we are facing the worst `flu epidemic in 14 years. We now find ourselves chasing all over Europe for vaccine for our young people <Col N="1786" /> and our elderly.  The World Health Organisation indicated earlier this year that an epidemic was on its way.  That epidemic has been raging in Britain for a number of weeks.  We all know it was certain to spread to this country especially with the number of people who will be travelling between both countries during the next few weeks.  We are in a position of total confusion at present with the epidemic hitting this country.  Instead of the health boards and the Department of Health working in a cohesive manner to help out the less fortunate in our community we have seen the health boards, the Department of Health and the Minister almost working against each other. This is just another example of the ongoing conflict between the health boards and the Department of Health.  Along with this problem we have the Department of Health and the doctor's organisation arguing about who pays whom when the priority should be that elderly and young people should be protected.</P>
      <P>There is a grave responsibility on the Minister and his Department to eliminate the problems of bad planning, delays, indecision and conflict.  One of the above issues might be a source of danger to our elderly population, especially those who are ill, but all of these together could be a death sentence for some of our elderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the Minister's lengthy answer in the Seanad yesterday he did not deal with the issues that were raised.  I would like the Minister to deal with some specific issues and questions which I will now put.  First, the Minister must give clear-cut assurances to this House that adequate doses of vaccine will be available for all our elderly and young people in the weeks ahead.  Second, he must give assurances that the dispute between himself and the doctors' organisation about payment be clarified once and for all.  Third, he must ensure that enough beds are available in our depleted hospital services to cater for the almost certain increase in demand in the weeks ahead.  We do not need glib answers such as we got in the House yesterday, for example, if there are empty beds there will always be people to go into them. <Col N="1787" /> The evidence in recent weeks, from answers in the House, is that we have waiting lists in each health board area.  If there are beds available there are sick people to fill them.</P>
    <P>What discussions have taken place between the Department of Health, the acute hospital services and the primary care teams concerning the problem that is now arising.  Unless the Minister gives clear-cut answers I submit that he is being negligent in his duties as Minister, that the health services are in a shambles, and here we have an issue which has shown him to be inept in the performance of his duties.</P>
    <P>In regard to the elderly people in this community, I do not think we should overstate the danger in relation to the epidemic.  The dangers can be adequately dealt with if the Minister gets his act together.  I would like clear-cut answers to the fairly clear-cut questions put here this evening.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Allen for giving me the opportunity to speak on the unprecedented blunder by the Minister and his secret advisers in not making, once again, provision for the health of the people of Ireland.  Sadly, one has come to expect this under the present two-tiered health system begotten under the most uncaring and unchristian administration this country has ever had.  The Minister's dirty tricks department, which all doctors know is in existence in the Custom House, and The Workers' Party have now introduced a red herring into the equation in that GPs are charging medical card patients £5 for the 'flu vaccine.  This is true in part but it is totally taken out of context.  What the Department have omitted to say is that some GPs had already purchased and had in stock the 'flu vaccine.  The Department <Col N="1788" /> was not in a position, because of incompetence, to have this vaccine in stock.</P>
      <P>Should the doctors pay for the vaccine which under the Health Act the Minister should provide?  In other words the doctors had the foresight which the Minister and his secret advisers had not.  The Minister's dirty tricks department and his secret advisers have allowed this smoke-screen to cloud the issue.  The Minister had deliberately fuelled this dastardly rumour.  His dirty tricks department and his advisers are endeavouring to deflect, to deviate, to confuse, to abscond in the smog which he has created and away from the fact that his Department are totally incompetent and totally out of touch with the people who run the primary health care system which the Minister has created.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my appreciation to Deputy Allen for allowing me to share his time.  Since I first raised this matter, by way of Private Notice Question on Tuesday, the confusion has grown and the conflicting statements have expanded.  I have here the unrevised text of the Minister's answer to my questions in which I raised the question of the adequacy of the 'flu vaccine supplies.  We found a statement about one hour earlier from the Eastern Health Board to the effect that the 'flu vaccine supplies would be exhausted within a matter of hours.</P>
      <P>On the question of the charge for administering the vaccine to medical card holders the Minister said:</P>
      <P>I am unaware of any decision of the Eastern Health Board to allow doctors to charge a fee of £5 for the vaccination and I would be interested in getting the details from Deputy Rabbitte.  I will bring up the question of the £5 fee because I believe the Eastern Health Board would not charge a £5 fee to medical card holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within hours of that statement by the Minister his officials were quoted in the <Col N="1789" /><i>Evening Press</i> of 12 December to the effect that the doctors are entitled to charge a fee for administering it, that is the vaccine shot.  This kind of confusion has continued.  I supplied the Minister with the details he requested.  I supplied him with the particular circumstances of a mother &mdash; a medical card holder in my constitutency &mdash; who attended her local GP with three asthmatic children requiring the operation.  When a demand was made for £15 to administer that injection the woman was not able to avail of it.  As a result the three asthmatic children were not vaccinated.  There are other examples.  I provided those details &mdash; names and address &mdash; in confidence to the Minister.  The latest position this morning, according to <i>The Irish Times</i> report, following research with the Department, is that:</P>
    <P>The question of whether doctors are entitled to charge medical card holders a £5 fee for administering the vaccine remains unresolved.</P>
    <P>Dr. Joe Currie of the IMO Ethics Committee told <i>The Irish Times</i> that it was up to the Department of Health to resolve the situation.  The Minister conceded that the 'flu epidemic has hit this country and it is too serious to be overshadowed by the lack of clarity and the confusion which has been the hallmark of the situation over the last few days.</P>
    <P>Medical card holders, in the categories which Deputy Allen mentioned, must have this vaccine available to them and must not be expected to put their hands in their pockets to pay for their children or aged relatives.</P>
    <P>People argued very strongly that no one should have to pay £15 for a rod licence but, when it comes to a matter of life and death, there are conflicting statements from the health boards, the Department and the Minister.  In the conditions in the city at present, particularly in relation to the smog problem and the fact that the Minister has conceded that the worst epidemic in the last 13 to 15 years has hit Ireland, there is an obligation on him to ensure that there are <Col N="1790" /> adequate supplies of vaccine for the categories mentioned by Deputy Allen and that no medical card holder will be obliged to pay for the necessary vaccine to protect their families.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to deal with the points raised in five minutes but I will dispose of the £5 first.  I did not mislead the House on Tuesday and I stand over everything I said.  After Deputy Rabbitte drew my attention to the fact that charges were being levied, I communicated with the Eastern Health Board and the Southern Health Board &mdash; in which it was alleged this was happening &mdash; but neither of them was aware that patients were being charged.  I did not receive correspondence from Deputy Rabbitte and my officials informed me that they have not received correspondence about the particular case but I will be glad to talk to him afterwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not supplied to me or my officials and the Eastern Health Board are also unaware of it.  I made it clear to the health boards that medical card holders should not be charged for the vaccine and that it should be made available to those at risk.  I envy people like Deputy Allen who knew there would be a major epidemic this year because he and Senator O'Reilly are the only people who knew it.</P>

      <P>The vaccine is prepared by manufacturers on the basis of the demand for the coming season and the number of doses supplied in this country was 125,000, the same as for the last ten years; 105,000 people had the vaccine in September or October, the appropriate time to avail of it.  I am surprised at Deputy Lee, who is a doctor, telling us that vaccine is the answer to the 'flu when we are in the middle of the epidemic.  We <Col N="1791" /> have gone past that stage now and the 'flu is managed in a totally different and common-sense way.  A person who has the 'flu should go to bed and take paracetamol and a hot drink.</P>

      <P>It is not a question of mass vaccination and it was never recommended that this should be the case as an answer to the 'flu epidemic.  The vaccine is not available because the manufactures, on the basis of the demands, decided that they would not make vaccine which they would hold until next year when there might be a different 'flu strain and they would have to throw the whole lot out.  The manufacturers decide, on the basis of demand, and nobody can foretell the years in which there will be a 'flu epidemic.  We are not surprised that there is an epidemic this year because, each year, we anticipate that there might be one.  However, we do not go in for a mass vaccination programme and neither does any other country.  Vaccine is not in supply for any country in Europe at present, nevertheless, we succeeded in securing 20,000 extra doses of vaccine which will be available tomorrow.  There will be 5,000 extra doses available at the beginning of next week, free of charge to people at risk, the elderly and those suffering from chronic illness, kidney disease and diabetes, chest and heart disease and so on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to the other questions raised by Deputy Allen, I assure the House that we are monitoring the situation and if <Col N="1792" /> beds are needed for victims of 'flu they will be supplied.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  It should be addressed by the Minister at the earliest possible date in case other companies or organisations pursue the course taken by the Bank of Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that such a profitable company should increase their profits still further by violating the law of the country in which they have their roots and where they make a large share of their profits. The House should not underestimate the gravity of what has happened.  I will refer to the relevant sections of the Act to illustrate what I mean.  Section 63 (1) states:</P>
      <P>The company shall, subject to the provisions of this section, have the exclusive privilege in respect of the conveyance of postal packets within, to and from the State and the offering and performance of the services of receiving, collecting despatching and delivering postal packets.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) (a) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>in view of its primary purpose of providing a national postal service and <Col N="1793" /> of the general duty imposed on it by section 13, to provide a service at the cheapest possible rate and (b) in recognition of the fact that a privilege of this kind is appropriate having regard to the area and population of the State and the present state of development of postal technology, and (c) because a viable national postal system involves subsidisation of some loss-making services by profit-making services.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) states:</P>
    <P>a postal packet originating within the State shall not be taken or sent outside the State with a view to having the packet posted from outside the State to an address within the State for the purpose of evading the exclusive privilege of the company.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) states:</P>
    <P>A person who breaches the exclusive privilege granted by this section, or who attempts to breach that privilege or who aids, abets, counsels or procures such a breach, or who conspires with, solicits or incites any other person to breach that privilege, shall be guilty of an offence.  In any proceeding in relation to that offence it shall lie upon the person proceeded against to prove that the act or omission in respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed was done in conformity with this section.</P>
    <P>It was necessary to quote these subsections to illustrate the effect which the actions of the Bank of Ireland are likely to have on An Post, a company who stand to lose £3.9 million in the current year. This loss should be measured against the latest returns of the Bank of Ireland.  My concern arises from the actions of the bank when, for some reason best known to themselves, they chose to circulate letters to their Access customers in this country from Southend-on-Sea rather than have a Dublin postmark on them. This is unprecedented and resulted in a substantial loss to An Post.  I am of the opinion that this action was in breach of section 63 on several counts.  It has been suggested to me that this action is not <Col N="1794" /> illegal on the basis that the Act specifically refers to a postal packet and that, in this case, no postal packet was actually transmitted.  Granted there was no solid matter, as such, transmitted from one State to the other.  Perhaps we have no proof of that.  Under the provisions of that Act the onus is on the company to prove that this did not happen.  However, I would suggest that the onus is on the Bank of Ireland to prove their innocence in this case.  The provisions of section 63 (6) are very clear in this respect.</P>
    <P>In addition to the loss occasioned by the initial action there was a further cost factor involved for An Post.  Having been deprived of the fee per item they were then asked to return the letter, if undelivered, to a box number in Dublin; if one is to be specific the box number in this case was Dublin 1102.  That is most unusual as the normal practice, if a letter is not deliverable, is that it is returned to the office of origin.  That office either returns it to the sender, if there is a name and address to which they can forward it, or disposes of the packet by way of a procedure which has been in operation for many years.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I fear this will lead to a loss on two counts.  Should any other company or companies follow the example of the Bank of Ireland I have no doubt but that the continued viability of An Post as a national postal service would be endangered.  I have received information in recent days that An Post are endeavouring to make a deal with their British counterparts which would allow for such action on a reciprocal basis.  I would suggest that any such arrangement would warrant amending legislation and that, there has been a very definite breach under existing legislation.  There is no doubt that that action violates all existing legislation.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to give the House an assurance that he will take the necessary action to ensure that the law of this country is upheld in the interests of its people.</P>

      <P>I have seen press reports to the effect indicated in the question.</P>
      <P>All the relevant fire authorities have major emergency plans to deal with a comprehensive range of emergencies. These plans, which are based on a model plan and extensive guidelines issued by my Department, have been periodically tested by exercises.  In this regard, detailed guidance was issued by my Department earlier this year on the planning and organisation of emergency exercises to test the plans and different scenarios and types of exercises were outlined in this guidance document.</P>
      <P>It is a matter in the first instance for each individual fire authority to ensure that it has arrangements in place which will enable it to properly discharge its responsibilities for dealing with any emergencies which may occur.  The fire brigade is, of course, one of the pivotal services which responds to such emergencies. Fire authorities have carried out assessments of their needs and have programmes of capital investment based on those needs.  The programmes are updated through discussions with my Department and during visits to the local authorities by my Department's fire advisory staff.  Capital investment in the fire service since 1981 has been of the order of £49 million in new stations, new fire appliances, modern communications equipment, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to this substantial capital <Col N="1686" /> expenditure, operational fire service personnel undertake training on a continuous basis at local level.  That training is supplemented by courses at central level provided by the Fire Services Council on a wide variety of subjects.  The courses include command courses, fire safety engineering courses, hazardous materials courses, courses in pre-fire planning for first attendance officers, etc. Since January 1987, the council has run 37 such training courses together with a symposium, attended by representatives from all fire authorities, on recent major disasters including the King's Cross fire, the Lockerbie aircraft explosion, the Sheffield football crowd disaster, the Bradford City stand fire and the Zee-brugge ship disaster.</P>

In the case of the Cavan County Council, these grants total £2.4 million, including a supplementary grant of £500,000 for improvement works, in recognition of the special needs of the county.  The 1990 grant represents an increase of £872,000, or 57 per cent, compared with the equivalent grants to the local authority in 1989 and is almost four times the level of equivalent grants paid to the authority in 1985.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 46 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>Action has been taken on a number of fronts to encourage the use of unleaded petrol by Irish motorists.</P>
      <P>The tax on unleaded petrol has been reduced by 9p per gallon over two budgets to allow it to sell at 5p per gallon less than premium leaded petrol.  The effect of these concessions in excise duty has been exploited to the full and publicity and information campaigns to promote unleaded have been in operation for over a year.  A nationwide outdoor poster campaign which began last July has just concluded and about a quarter of a million car window stickers and information leaflets have been circulated to motorists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While these measures are designed to raise public awareness on the need to change to unleaded, it is essential that State and semi-State sectors should give a lead in the national campaign.  Therefore since June 1989, all vehicles assigned to Garda headquarters have been using unleaded.  This includes cars in the ministerial fleet which are capable of doing so, and the Garda authorities are making arrangements to facilitate the use of unleaded in the remainder of the fleet where <Col N="1689" /> this is practicable.  Local authorities and other bodies under the aegis of my Department have also been requested to support the campaign by ensuring that existing petrol driven vehicle fleets use unleaded petrol where possible and that all new petrol driven vehicles to be purchased be capable of using unleaded. Other Ministers have been taking similar action in relation to bodies under their aegis.</P>
    <P>The number of outlets selling unleaded petrol has been rising rapidly over the past 12 months and now stands at over 1,200, or over 40 per cent of the total number of outlets in the country.  As these outlets are mainly in high volume sites accounting for over 80 per cent of total petrol sales, availability is much greater than even the figure of 40 per cent would suggest.  At least 1,350 stations will be retailing unleaded by the end of the year, and with regular petrol being phased out, I expect that unleaded outlets will increase further in 1990.  All major towns, most small towns and many villages now have unleaded available, and sales are rising at about 1 per cent per month.  Sales of unleaded are now running at about 11 per cent of total petrol sales, and there is every indication that these figures are set to increase.  My Department will continue to monitor progress on this matter over the months to come, and I will take whatever further steps may be necessary to encourage more motorists to use unleaded petrol.</P>

An oral hearing in relation to this order will commence on 9 January 1990.  Objections to the order in respect of Clondalkin Area No. 1 were received from Coal Distributors Limited on the same grounds as are outlined above; Anthony Haughan and Company Limited which has not to date cited the reasons for the objection; Rheinbraun Fuel Trading Ireland Limited, on the grounds that Union Coal nuggets/briketts were excluded from the specified list of fuels approved for use in the special control area; The Green Party, on the grounds that the order included the CDL full burning fire; and an individual resident of the special control area, on the grounds of (a) the cost of conversion to an approved heating system; (b) the impracticability of monitoring fuel use in the special control area; (c) the likely levels of grant aid; (d) transboundary <Col N="1691" /> smoke pollution; (e) the discriminatory nature of the order; and (f) the absence of a mains gas supply.  I would refer the Deputy to the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 132 of Tuesday, 21 November 1989, in which I outlined the position regarding an oral hearing in relation to this order.</P>
    <P>Objections to the order made for Crumlin Area A were received from Coal Distributors Limited, on the grounds, <i>inter alia</i>, that Dublin Corporation failed to comply with the provisions of section 39 of the Air Pollution Act, 1987; Anthony Haughan and Company Limited, which has not to date cited the reasons for the objection; and an individual on grounds relating to the cost of conversion.

The main provisions of the Act regarding homeless persons have been in force since 1 January 1989. The implementation of these provisions is a matter for each housing authority in the light of local circumstances. However, the guidelines which I issued on the implementation of these provisions stated that housing authorities should, among other things, establish effective liaison arrangements with voluntary organisations working in the area on behalf of homeless persons.  Therefore, I would expect that such organisations would in the first instance raise issues of concern to them with the relevant housing authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations adopted by the European Council in 1988 for the operation of the increased Structural Funds require that assistance should be provided primarily in the form of multi-annual operational programmes.  The programme approach was adopted to ensure the best possible co-ordination of measures to obtain the maximum benefit from the increased funds.  A further reason for moving to a programme approach was that the EC Commission were having to deal with an increasing volume of projects and wanted to move to a more manageable coherent approach.</P>
      <P>Thus the applications for EC assistance and advances of aid under the <i>National Development Plan</i> and <i>Community Support Framework</i> will be in the form of and on foot of operational programmes so the issue of individual agencies and bodies making direct application to the Commission no longer arises.</P>
      <P>The local authorities will of course have a major part to play in the implementation of the <i>National Development Plan</i> and operational programmes. Where they are involved in measures such as road works and sanitary services which are funded by the Exchequer, the arrangment is that the full cost of the measures involved are provided in the annual Exchequer grants and the Exchequer recoups the related aid when received.  In the case of measures where the domestic input is provided from the authorities' own resources, related EC aid will be channelled to them on receipt.</P>

      <P>The operation of the deposit interest retention tax has been kept under review.  No change has been found necessary in its operation except for the introduction of a provision &mdash; Section 7 &mdash; in the Finance Act, 1987, to counter arrangements introduced by certain financial institutions which would otherwise have resulted in less than a full year's yield being obtained from the tax in 1987. As the Deputy will be aware, the rate at which the tax applies was reduced to 32 per cent in line with the reduction of the standard rate of income tax which I announced in this year's budget; further reductions will be made in line with the Government's commitment to further reduce the standard rate of income tax to 25 per cent by 1993.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will outline the work done by his predecessor to implement the promises made in the 1987 Fianna Fáil Election Manifesto to (a) establish a Product Identification Centre, (b) simplify export documentation and (c) encourage export marketing activity through personal tax incentives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibilities for establishing a product identification centre, to assist in bringing forward new products with good export potential, have been considered as part of the ongoing review of the effectiveness of the State's export development services.</P>
      <P>To date, however, it has been felt that the objectives of such a centre are adequately catered for through the range of support services provided by existing agencies.  Examples of these services are the advanced products programme introduced by Coras Tráchtála in 1988 and the IDA's international linkage programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal action taken to simplify export documentation was the decision to create a computerised system for all customs entries, both import and export. The system is scheduled to become fully operational in January 1991.  Following discussions initiated by my predecessor, <Col N="1710" /> the Central Bank revised its requirements for the completion of the Declaration A form for exchange control purposes in connection with export shipments. This documentation is no longer required for exports below a value of £50,000.  This revision benefits smaller exporting companies.  Procedures within my Department were also improved and most export licence applications are now dealt with within 48 hours.</P>
    <P>In addition, of course, the introduction of the single administrative document throughout the EC in January 1988 made a major contribution to this area.  This single form is now used in substitution for 15 separate forms which existed prior to its introduction.</P>
    <P>As far as tax incentives are concerned, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the special trading houses scheme launched in March 1988.  The specific objective of this scheme was to encourage people with export marketing expertise to apply this expertise to the sale abroad of Irish products.  As an incentive towards the development of the trading house concept, investments in such companies were made eligible for the tax relief available under the business expansion scheme.  In addition, licensed trading houses qualify for a 10 per cent rate of corporation profits tax.  These incentives constitute a significant encouragement to those involved in the export marketing area.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that taxpayers in general have benefited from the substantial income tax reliefs introduced in recent years.</P>

      <P>Although the person concerned exhausted 11 days of her 12 days holiday entitlement from 10 July to 21 July 1989, it has been decided, following a review of the reasons for her failure to prove unemployment for the period 23 November to 4 December, to allow her to sign the unemployed register retrospectively for this period.  The arrears due to her will be paid next week.</P>

    <P>*Total oral plus written questions.</P>
    <P>It can be seen that there is a significant reduction in the numbers of parliamentary questions over the period 1985 to <Col N="1715" /> 1989.  This reduction is due largely to the introduction in the general benefits section of a direct telephone inquiry service for Deputies which provides quick responses to queries on matters related to sickness and related benefits, unemployment assistance and benefit and pensions. Some 8,000 to 10,000 inquiries are dealt with annually by this service.  In addition, a number of questions concerning individual cases are withdrawn each year before being tabled either because the matter has already been resolved or a satisfactory reply has issued.</P>
    <P>The value of the telephone inquiry service has been the subject of favourable comment by Deputies.  It provides a means by which Deputies can receive prompt answers to their inquiries and representations without the need to place parliamentary questions.  It is planned to provide a similar service at the pensions services office in Sligo in 1990.</P>

      <P>Under the standardised national fuel scheme which I introduced in 1988, <Col N="1716" /> eligibility is determined where practicable at the same time as eligibility for the basic pensions to which the person is entitled.  Otherwise information leaflets and application forms are sent by the Department to new pension claimants or made available at health board offices and my Department's local offices for clients of these offices.  Claim forms and leaflets are also available at community information centres.  In this way there are procedures to reach all categories who may qualify under the national fuel scheme.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, there should be little demand at post offices for forms, etc., relating to this scheme.  Nevertheless, arrangements have been made with An Post for the distribution to their offices of the general information leaflets and application forms for pensioners. Forms for health board and local office clients will continue to be available locally from the office dealing with the client.</P>

The Garda authorities have been advancing this concept through their crime prevention advisory service which offers advice to the public on crime prevention and by promoting the highly <Col N="1719" /> successful neighbourhood watch schemes.  The concept is also being very successfully applied by way of the neighbourhood policing scheme.  This scheme is designed specifically to service the needs of the community, by making the gardaí available in a particular locality at hours of greatest public activity and by providing a very accessible and open communication channel between the Garda and the community.  I am pleased to say that I announced yesterday a substantial extension of the neighbourhood policing scheme throughout the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>(3)  The advisory group will consider individual cases by reference to the very reasonable and long-established criteria which apply to the existing review procedure.  Among those criteria are an assessment of whether a release would constitute a threat to the community and whether it would be reasonable to grant a release at a particular stage in view of the nature of the crime committed and the offender's previous criminal record.</P>

Qualifications awarded by certain professional associations which are recognised in a special form by a member state also come within the scope of the Directive.</P>
      <P>The implications of the Directive are that members of a regulated profession in Ireland would be entitled, subject generally to the terms of the Directive, to practice their professions in any other member state which regulates the profession concerned.  Similarly members of regulated professions in other member states would be entitled to practice regulated professions here.</P>

      <P>The provision of a major extension to Dunkineely national school, County Donegal, was approved by my Department in 1982 but it was not possible for the project to proceed because of the cost which would have been involved.</P>
      <P>In March 1983 the school authorities were authorised to engage their own architect to prepare plans for the project. A site extension was offered in June 1984 which was approved in July 1984.  Planning permission was received by the school authorities in October 1986.</P>
      <P>Grants have been paid to the chairman of the board of management of the school in respect of the professional fees incurred on the project.  Payment was made in two instalments in February 1989 and August 1989.  It is not the practice to divulge the financial details in these instances because of the need to preserve a bond of confidentiality between the Department and the school authorities.</P>
      <P>I have arranged for my Department's professional advisers to make a full report on the condition of the existing prefabricated classrooms and to put forward proposals for any necessary improvements. I will communicate with the Deputy in this respect at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following EC educational pilot projects are co-financed by the Department of Education and the European Commission: (1) PETRA; (2) <Col N="1736" /> Prolog and knowledge bases in schools; (3) HELIOS; (4) Action research project designed to stimulate the interest and encourage the participation of girls in school activities related to the new technologies and (5) Action research programme on integrating equal opportunities in the curriculum of teacher education.</P>
      <P>Details of these projects are as follows: A Council decision of 1 December 1987, adopted a decision on vocational training of young people and their preparation for adult and working life.  The programme is known as PETRA.  Overall responsibility for the programme in Ireland rests with the Departments of Education and Labour.  Executive assistance is provided by the Youth Exchange Bureau.</P>
      <P>Aims/Objectives: The main objectives are to raise the standards and quality of vocational training, and improve the preparation of young people for adult life, work and continuing training; to diversify the range of vocational training available for young people with different kinds of ability, and ensuring that it leads to recognised qualifications; and to enhance the capacity of vocational training systems to adapt to economic, technological and social change.  Duration: Five years from 1 January 1988.</P>
      <P>Cost: The Community directly funds approved projects for the European dimension of the project.  In the case of the five educational projects this Department provide some funding for activities at national level.  In 1988 and in 1989 the cost of the latter was £137,214.21. Further provision for national activities will be made for the duration of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assessment: Within the terms of the council decision of 1 December 1987, the Commission &ldquo;shall present an interim report and, before the end of 1993, a final report, on the implementation of this programme to the Council and the European Parliament, as well as to the Advisory Committee on Vocational Training and to the Education Committee&rdquo;.  The Commission has arranged for assessment of the programme at community level.  Each of the two Departments has appointed <Col N="1737" /> a national policy co-ordinator who has responsibility for monitoring and assessing the programme at national level.</P>
    <P>As regards Prolog and knowledge bases in schools, three countries &mdash; Spain, Portugal and England &mdash; are taking part in the project which is managed by Ireland.  The general aims of the project are to explore the effectiveness of PROLOG in constructing and using knowledge bases in schools; to explore the nature of the contribution that knowledge bases can make to educational interactions; to examine the role of a knowledge base as a teaching tool and to examine the role of a knowledge base as a learning tool.</P>
    <P>The educational objectives of the project are knowledge of specifics e.g. facts, formulae, people, events, dates, etc, knowledge of conventions, knowledge of trends, knowledge of classifications and categories, knowledge of criteria, comprehension of relationships and techniques, analysis and question asking skills, hypothesis formation and conjectural skills and evaluation skills.</P>
    <P>The duration of the project is two years from 5 November 1988.  The project cost is 60,000 ECUs.  The end product of the project will be three pieces of courseware on history, mathematics and the humanities. Spanish, Portuguese and English versions will be available.  These course-were packages will be field tested first in the host country and then in the other two.</P>
    <P>The overall progress of the project is overseen by a steering committee which consists of one member from each of the countries Ireland, Federal Republic of Germany and Denmark.  The fourth member of the committee represents the European Commission.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Helios Project is to promote the welfare and participation of people with handicaps in open society. It is a three-fold project involving education, social integration and economic aspects.</P>
    <P>Each member state has been asked to set up a social model activity which illustrates good practice which is of value in the country of origin and which has <Col N="1738" /> aspects which can be of interest throughout the Community.  Ireland has identified as its local model activity (LMA) nine educational establishments which exemplify good practice in the education of pupils with disabilities: (1) Bishopstown community school, Cork &mdash; hearing disabilities; (2) Rosmini community school, Dublin &mdash; pupils with visual and/or physical disabilities; (3) Ballinteer community school, Dublin &mdash; pupils with physical disabilities; (4) St. Patrick's national school Drumcondra, Dublin &mdash; pupils with mild mental handicap and pupils with specific language difficulties; (5) Holy Child national school, Ballycane, Naas &mdash; pupils with mild mental handicap; (6) Presentation Convent national school, Bandon &mdash; pupils with moderate mental handicap; (7) Presentation Convent/CBS national school, Mitchelstown &mdash; pupils with mild mental handicap; (8) Central Remedial Clinic, Clontarf &mdash; microelectronics centre and comprehensive facilities for children with physical disabilities and (9) Thomond College, Limerick &mdash; modules in teacher training dealing with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The EC pays the cost of the European dimension, i.e. inter-change of personnel on short study visits.  Local costs are all borne by individual countries.  The cost of the project to the Department is approximately £1,200 in 1989 and £2,000 for each of two successive years.  These costs are for local seminars and meetings.</P>
    <P>Evaluation is at Community and national level and is by way of reports of visitors and ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the activities in the chosen schools.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the action research project designed to stimulate the interest and encourage the participation of girls in school activities related to the new technologies are as follows (i) to develop girls' confidence and competence in technology; (ii) to heighten students' awareness of gender stereotyping in work and in society; (iii) to encourage students to re-appraise traditional subject/career choices and (iv) to encourage active participation in planning and decision making, i.e. problem solving.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1739" /> The project began in January 1987 and it is intended that it will continue until the end of the 1990-1991 academic year. The costs incurred in 1987-88 were £57,000.00 and in 1988-89 £62,000.00.</P>
    <P>An external evaluator was appointed to the project.  The procedures used by the evaluator for assessing the project included both quantitative and qualitative methods of evaluation &mdash; these included pre and post-test questionnaires, an evaluation questionnaire, interview schedules and observation.</P>
    <P>The action research programme on integrating equal opportunities in the curriculum of teacher education was launched in 1988 by the Commission of the European Communities under the terms of the Resolution of the Council and of the Minister for Education meeting within the Council of 3 June 1985.</P>
    <P>Arising from this the Minister for Education undertook to support six action research projects at national level under the auspices of the following bodies: St. Patrick's College of Education, Drumcondra (pre-service primary teacher education); Curriculum Unit, Department of Education, Primary Branch (in-service primary education); Thomond College of Education, Limerick (pre-service and in-service second level teacher education); Education Department, University College, Dublin (pre-service second level teacher education); Teachers Union of Ireland (in-service second level public sector teacher education) and Association of Guidance Counsellor of Ireland (in-service second level teacher education).</P>
    <P>At a European level the action research programme has as its goal the implementation of an equal opportunities curriculum in teacher education in all teacher education institutions in member countries, in order that the aims of the resolutions of the Council of Ministers can be achieved.  At a national level, the goal is that each of the projects develop an area of the curriculum rather than the whole.</P>
    <P>The specific objectives of the project include the following: to raise the level <Col N="1740" /> of awareness of equality issues among teachers; to prepare a set of practical guidelines and resource materials for teachers; to develop a module for in-service education; to design and assess materials for use in primary classrooms to promote awareness of equality of opportunity for each gender; to increase an awareness and understanding among second level student teachers of gender inequalities in education; to raise an awareness among teachers of the need to promote equal opportunities for boys and girls in education; to promote non-traditional subject choices and career choices by girls and boys and to develop guidelines on school time-tabling to avoid discrimination on the grounds of sex.</P>
    <P>The working phase of the action research programme commenced in September 1988 and will conclude in September 1990.  This will be followed by a one year dissemination phase.  The cost of the projects in 1988-89 was £42,000 approximately.  This represents 50 per cent approximately of the costs of the projects in 1988-89.</P>
    <P>A national evaluator has been appointed to externally evaluate all of the projects.  The projects have also been internally assessed by the projects directors and teams.  Ongoing monitoring by the national co-ordinator and the European co-ordinator culminating in end of year reports is also a feature of assessment.</P>
    <P>Eurotecnet is a European Community action programme aimed at the development of the potential of new information technologies in vocational training. Activities are identified in each member state and are incorporated into a network of demonstration projects known as &ldquo;Eurotecnet&rdquo;.  This network examines the ways in which experts in different educational training and industrial settings address common new technology training needs, and provides a forum for exchange of information, ideas and new techniques.</P>
    <P>Ireland has three Eurotecnet projects which are outlined as follows: (a) The Industry Linked Control Technology <Col N="1741" /> pilot project provides training for selected participants in the vocational preparation and training programme in second level schools in the application of computer control to the production and distribution of goods and services, the development of software packages and the introduction of computer control into enterprises which operated on traditional lines hitherto.  The project is due to run for three years from 1 January 1988 to 31 December 1990 at a total cost of £1,084,000.  Fifty-five per cent aid from the European Social Fund towards the cost of the project has been approved. The programme aims to establish a close correspondence between the experience provided in the training centres and the reality of a high technology working environment.  (b) The database information technology pilot project is intended to train selected participants in the vocational preparation and training programme in second level schools to set up an educational database with links with Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom and an other EC member state and with interaction with local and national industrial enterprises.  The programme is intended to run for two years (1988 and 1989) at a cost of £815,333.  Fifty-five per cent aid from the European Social Fund towards the cost has been approved.  The project aims to provide trainees with direct experience of (i) the selection and organisation of data for inclusion in a database, (ii) the establishment of a database, (iii) the processes involved in the networking of a database to a group of centres, and the monitoring and management of such a network, and (iv) interaction with industrial enterprises using advanced technologies.  The transmission of quality data through a fast networked communication system is now central to competitive trading.  The operation will test the effectiveness of the network approach to the enhancement of learning opportunities for pupils.  (c) A training of trainers pilot project has been approved for the period 1 June 1989 to 31 May 1990 to equip the training staff within selected regional technical colleges and colleges of technology with the <Col N="1742" /> knowledge and skills necessary to develop appropriate training methodologies in the area of computer integrated manufacture &mdash; the application of computerised technologies related to the totality of design, manufacture, production, control and management information systems.  The cost of the project is £415,331 and 55 per cent aid from the European Social Fund has been approved.</P>
    <P>Each project is being monitored by a team representing the project leaders in each centre and a co-ordinating inspector from my Department.  Overall Eurotecnet activity is overseen by a Eurotecnet Planning Group within my Department.</P>
    <P>The product development project aims to provide specific training in innovation and enterprise for technically skilled persons so that they can make a significant contribution towards the establishment of new enterprises and the development of local industry.  The main areas of training are in product development skills, but training in microcomputing skills and the use of spreadsheet packages for financial modelling in general management applications is also provided.  Trainees are shown how to use their technical expertise complied with additional business skills acquired on the programme to develop new products and processes. Through the trainees engaged on the programme there will be increased interaction for the Dublin Institute of Technology (Bolton St.) with local industry. The project is due to run for three years, from July 1987 to 30 June 1990, and is being evaluated by external consultants. The total cost is £812,780 and 55 per cent aid from the European Social Fund has been approved.</P>
    <P>Two educational pilot projects in primary education are being sponsored by my Department of Education at present. These are (i) development education in Irish primary schools and (ii) Scéim Phiolotach sa Ghaeilge.  The aims of the projects are as follows: (i) Development Education: this project is being organised in conjunction with the Development Education Support Centre (DESC) to <Col N="1743" /> pilot a whole school approach to introducing development education into the primary curriculum in a variety of primary schools; and to examine the outcomes of the project with a view to making a proposal to the Department of Education on the integration of development education into the primary school curriculum.  (ii) Scéim Phiolotach sa Ghaeilge: A pilot scheme to promote a more effective use of oral Irish in primary and post-primary schools has been established in a north Dublin urban district. The objectives of the scheme are to further emphasise the importance of oral Irish; to ensure continuity between first level and second level schools in the learning of Irish; and to ensure the active support of parents in promoting the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Duration and cost are as follows: (i) Development Education: Resourced by DESC.  £2,000 (ii) Scéim Phiolotach sa Ghaeilge: This scheme is being funded jointly by Bord na Gaeilge and the Department of Education and will cost £15,000 per annum.  The scheme will last two years.</P>
    <P>As regards procedures for assessment and monitoring of the projects: (i) in Development Education the work done in the schools has been evaluated by the inspectors and by DESC personnel.  A report is being compiled for the Department; (ii) in Scéim Phiolotach sa Ghaeilge, an organiser has been appointed to co-ordinate the scheme and to monitor its progress.  It is also intended that Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann will have a role in the assessment procedure.</P>
    <P>Three educational pilot projects in post-primary education are being sponsored by my Department at present.</P>
    <P>These are: (1) the development of educational resource materials on AIDS. The objective is the development of educational resource materials on AIDS in relation to pupils aged 14-18 years.</P>
    <P>The duration of the pilot phase is the first term of the 1989/90 school year.</P>
    <P>The cost to the Department of Education will be £8,000 approximately.  The project is sponsored by the Department <Col N="1744" /> of Education and the Department of Health and it is being monitored by both those Departments;</P>
    <P>(2)  the junior certificate course in technology. The objective is to provide technology as an optional subject for pupils in post-primary schools.  Some £330,000 in grants and inservice training costs is being made available for the project in the current financial year.  The programme is being introduced on a phased basis to permit its orderly implementation and monitoring of its development by the inspectorate of the Department of Education.  For the 1989/90 school year the programme is restricted to 62 schools.</P>
    <P>(3)  In the humanities/SESP programmes there are two projects &mdash; the humanities programme under the City of Dublin VEC Curriculum Development Unit and the Social and Environmental Studies Programme (SESP) operated by Shannon Curriculum Development Centre &mdash; which have been in operation in a number of post-primary schools.  The new junior certificate syllabuses owe much to the experience gained through such projects.  The object is to ensure that needs identified through the pilot projects in those areas are addressed with special reference to the needs of weaker students.  People who began humanities/SESP programmes in September 1989 have been given the option of transferring to standard junior certificate syllabuses in English, history and geography and of sitting the standard junior certificate examination in 1992. For this reason definitive costs are not readily available.</P>

      <P>My Department organise summer in-service courses and one day courses during school term designed for principal teachers in primary schools. The duration of the summer in-service courses is one week each year over two years, that is, a two week course.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these courses is to develop the knowledge, skills and attitudes which principals need to carry out their duties more effectively.  The content of the courses cover five main areas, namely, leadership, management, assessment, planning and curriculum topics. This training is not mandatory.</P>
      <P>The summer in-service courses for principals are of recent origin and the proportion of principals who would have attended to date would be small.  I would point out, however, that the one day in-service courses are organised at district level and all principals are invited to these.</P>

The quality and efficiency of the Irish educational system is such that it gives young people the skills, motivation and knowledge they <Col N="1751" /> need in order to live in a world that is interdependent and marked by cultural diversity and rapid and constant social change.  The training given to teachers and teacher trainers is of decisive importance here.</P>

    <P>1.  Education and Culture: Language learning and training of language teachers; &ldquo;Language for European Citizenship&rdquo;; Teacher Bursaries Scheme; Training Teachers and Teacher Trainers; Adult Education and Social Change; School Education; Pupil Mobility and Exchanges; New Educational Contents; Europe at School &mdash; European Schools Day Competition; European Studies; Educational Research and Documentation EUDISED; European University Co-operation; Major European University Problems.</P>
    <P>2.  Sport: (1) Promoting European and national policies designed to meet the increasing demand for sport and its consequences: the challenge of sport for all; (2)  European and national action to promote the values of sport and to resolve problems arising from its continual development; (3) Strengthening the European dimension in sport; (4) Developing contacts with other Regional and International Sports Bodies.</P>
    <P>3.  Youth: (1) Involving young people in European unification; (2) International understanding and solidarity among young people; (3) Intergovernmental co-operation on behalf of the Young: improving the life and prospects of young people and promoting fair participation in society at all levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>Since the establishment of the National Council for Curriculum and assessment in autumn 1987 it has performed its duties to an exceptionally high standard.  It has been able to fulfil its central role of advising the Minister on all matters relating to the school curriculum by not being encoumbered with the responsibility for organising certificate examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that this <Col N="1761" /> matter was discussed at some length in Dáil Éireann in November 1987.  As I explained at the time and also as replied to a previous question from the Deputy on 1 December 1988 I decided that the interim Curriculum and Examinations Board should be reconstituted as the NCCA mainly because I did not see how the main function of the council would be enhanced in any way by making it a statutory body.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if she has introduced a special course on the family in society in the curricula of all post-primary schools, as promised in the 1987 Fianna Fáil Election Manifesto, designed to ensure that young people grow up with a clear understanding of the nature of marriage; and the consultations she has had in regard to the course to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department issued guidelines to post-primary schools in 1987 on the development of sex/relationships education.  These pointed out that the development of such programmes were matters for each individual school in support of the primary responsibility of parents.  Inter alia the circular expressed confidence that schools would inculcate in students a commitment to the strengthening of marriage and the family in society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if her attention has been drawn to the fact that in the State of Queensland, Australia, results in tertiary entrance subjects are based entirely on school assessment with a State-wide monitoring and review system; and if she will ask the Higher Education Authority and the Irish third level institutions to examine the merits of such a system for Ireland from the point of view of the social mix, academic ability and breadth of skills of third level entrants.</P>

      <P>The entry requirements for third-level institutions generally and the specific requirements for particular courses are matters for the appropriate authorities in the institutions.</P>
      <P>In general, the order of selection of students for entry to third level is determined by reference to leaving certificate results, matriculation examination results and combinations of the results obtained in both examinations.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of school-based assessment in the State certificate examinations, I have already informed the Deputy that this is a matter to be considered in conjunction with recommendations from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if her attention has been drawn to the fact that the Australian Government decided in 1986 to allow Australian educational institutions to develop and market full fee courses on a full cost recovery basis to overseas students; if she is in favour of such a system operating in this country; and if she will allow the institutions to retain any income thus derived without any reference to their subsequent entitlement to normal State supports.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of my Department to encourage third-level institutions to attract overseas other than EC students on a full cost recovery basis subject to necessary safeguards in relation to the availability of places for Irish and EC students.</P>
      <P>A working group comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Finance, the Higher Education Authority and the Heads of universities is currently reviewing existing mechanisms and controls for university funding.

      <P>The scheme for the employment of secretarial staff in national and secondary schools administered by my Department is being phased out as posts fall vacant.  In line with Government policy on reducing public sector employee numbers, there are at present no plans to permit any new appointments under this scheme.</P>
      <P>Boards of management of national schools may employ secretaries under the social employment scheme which is administered by FÁS.</P>
      <P>Under existing arrangements in the vocational sector, it is a matter for each vocational educational committee to deploy clerical staff to carry out the duties involved in school secretary work, as it sees fit and in the manner best suited to meet the needs of the committee's pupils and schools.  I have no plans to change these arrangements.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to community and comprehensive schools currently is that there is a school secretary (clerical) employed on a full-time basis at each of these schools.</P>
      <P>Appointments of school secretaries (clerical) are made by the board of management and each appointment is made subject to conditions of service prescribed by my Department.  The question of filling a vacancy in this category is subject to the current conditions arising from the official embargo on recruitment to the public service.</P>
