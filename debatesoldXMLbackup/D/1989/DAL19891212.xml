      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is satisfied with the level of co-operation between the National Library and the libraries of Trinity College, Dublin, University College, Dublin, and other third level education institutions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>There is considerable co-operation and exchange of information and expertise between the libraries on a day-to-day working basis. Modern information technology is further enhancing the potential for this.  Co-operation is also facilitated through the director's membership of the committee of national and university librarians.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the whole problem of cataloguing in the various libraries could be substantially overcome if they were linked by a common computer system?  Having regard to the fact that they are now likely to embark on individual computerised systems to store and retrieve their information will the Taoiseach agree that it is in the interests of all concerned &mdash; particularly the taxpayer &mdash; to have a common system or at least compatible systems?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to the findings of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General for 1988 which showed that cataloguing of books, periodicals and magazines in the National Library was at least two years behind; that no stocktaking on a regular systematic basis has been carried out in the library since 1974; if, in view of the importance of the documents in the possession of the National Library, it is intended to provide additional staff and resources to allow this work to be brought up to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The additional staff resources now being made available to the National Library, essentially through the redeployment of staff from elsewhere in the public service and with the agreement of the unions, will enable cataloguing and stocktaking to be speeded up.  The new director proposes to assign some of the additional staff to priority needs in cataloguing and stocktaking.  It is also proposed in future, in accordance with standard practices in other such libraries, to close the library annually to the public for one month to enable all staff resources to be devoted to stocktaking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that it is close to, if not a national scandal, that our premier library should be so far out of date and behind with its cataloguing?  Will he further agree that it is not a satisfactory solution to close the National Library for one month on an annual basis simply to facilitate work that should be kept up to date?  How long does the Taoiseach anticipate it will be necessary to engage in the practice of closing for one month?  Which month is it envisaged closing the library?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to the findings of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General for 1988 which showed that, during a local audit carried out by his staff in the Irish Antiquities Division and the Art and Industrial Division of the National Museum, while stocktaking commenced in early 1988 in the Irish Antiquities Division only a small proportion of the objects had been verified against the records at the time of audit and that no other overall stocktaking on a regular or systematic basis had been carried out in either division prior to that; the steps it is intended to take to deal with this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the reference in question in the report for 1988 of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>The response of my Department on the issues raised is also included in that report.  It is pointed out that, in recent years, substantial additional storage and display space has been provided for the museum.  In addition, the quality of its existing storage space has been improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional temporary professional <Col N="857" /> staff have been assigned to the museum and work was begun on a comprehensive listing of its collections.  Computer equipment has already been acquired and is being augmented.  It is hoped, subject to the exigencies of the public finances, to provide additional staff and equipment on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>The director is at present finalising a work plan to ensure that greater attention is given in future to the stocktaking and cataloguing of the museum's collections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>How long have the Taoiseach and his Department known that there has not been any stocktaking in the National Museum apart from the small amount embarked upon in 1988?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These matters were neglected for many years but in the case of the National Museum, the National Library and our other cultural institutions, we are getting around to catching up in dealing with these outstanding matters. Staff and resources are being laid on to get matters into a satisfactory condition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that we learned recently that items were stolen from the National Museum and that the report of the Visitors to the National Museum in 1987 indicated damage caused to property because of poor storage, can the Taoiseach indicate how soon full facilities will be made available to the museum to ensure the full cataloguing and safety of the property and items there?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Progress has been slow due principally to the sheer size of the collections and indeed the poor quality of the documentation that exists but the director is getting on with the task.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will outline the purpose of his meeting with the chief executives of commercial State-sponsored companies on 4 December 1989; if he issued any new instructions or advice to the chief executives; if any new job creation initiatives are planned as a result of this meeting; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the statement issued after the meeting I had on 4 December 1989, with the chief executives of State-sponsored bodies, copies of which were placed in the Oireachtas Library on 5 December 1989.</P>
      <P>The meeting reviewed the job creation achievements and proposals of the commercial State-sponsored bodies under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  As the appendix to the statement makes clear, these cover a total of over 7,000 new jobs.</P>
      <P>I assured the chief executives at the meeting of the full support of the Government for their efforts.  The chief executives expressed their appreciation of the positive and encouraging attitude being taken by the Government towards their development proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other matters considered at the meeting included (a) development co-operation between agencies; (b) management assistance to community bodies; (c) the concept of an Ireland House in capitals <Col N="860" /> abroad; (d) the need for cost-effective services by the bodies to the economy as a whole; (e) the scope for training and management programmes in eastern Europe and (f) contributions by the State-sponsored bodies to events and activities during our EC Presidency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that if commercial State-sponsored bodies are to play a real part in job creation a way must be found to afford them the necessary investment capital? Would the Taoiseach say whether he has any proposals to privatise any of these State-sponsored bodies either by way of minority shareholding or in any other manner he may feel to be necessary? Would the Taoiseach also agree that if we are to expect commercial State-sponsored bodies to operate on a totally commercial basis it would be necessary to review the manner in which their executives and staff are remunerated, for example, offering the going rate for the job as chief executive in addition to possible participation in profits or bonus schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any great problem of capital in the case of most of the State bodies; certainly at the meeting to which I referred they did not put that forward to me as constituting a problem.  Of course, they are encouraged to engage in joint ventures and from many points of view, that would be the most satisfactory approach.  Again, I would have to say they did not raise with me the question of restrictions on remuneration.  I am not sure that is the same sort of problem as it was at one time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that in other countries where commercial State bodies have been extremely successful the level of remuneration of their staff, in particular, by way of profit sharing, bonus schemes, and in some cases share participation, has led to a vibrant commercial State sector? Would he agree that tremendous opportunities obtain here if we got our act <Col N="861" /> together in relation to all our commercial State bodies becoming totally commercially-minded so that their staff could see they would get a slice of the profit if success ensued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to take issue with the Deputy on the general thrust of his question because a number of our semi-State bodies are as successful as those anywhere in the world.  In fact, a number of them have now gone abroad, are performing brilliantly abroad and achieving very satisfactory results on the international scene.  Therefore, I do not think we need hold up the semi-State sector in any other country as a model for ours to follow because, by and large, they are doing very well.  Of course the Deputy knows that the whole history of remuneration in semi-State bodies is a complex one.  When the semi-State concept was put forward, the original idea was that one of the advantages they would have would be that they would be freed from the restrictions normally applicable to the public service.  That went through many convolutions of policy over the years.  At one time there was a very determined effort made to bring them right back within the ambit of public service pay régimes.  We have now loosened that policy again in that there is now a fair amount of freedom in the semi-State sector in regard to remuneration but if the position warrants it I will certainly be prepared to consider any improvements that might appear necessary. I have a great deal of admiration for a number of our State bodies on the way they are at present performing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the major issue about which we are talking here is what contribution State companies can make to job creation and whether any additional opportunities have been identified whereby major State companies could diversify?  In this respect would the Taoiseach say whether, on reflection, he does not consider that the point raised by Deputy Barrett about additional capital could be an obstacle; and whether, in any circumstances, he <Col N="862" /> might be prepared to look at the example followed in Telecom Éireann where&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy did not mention eastern Europe; I was afraid he was going to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should be patient; he has promised to mention it a great deal himself over the next six months.  Perhaps we could remain with the point in hand &mdash; whether the telecommunication investments bank established by Telecom Éireann as a vehicle to raise capital for investment in the company might be something that could be considered in the context of some of the other semi-State companies or perhaps centrally for a group of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That idea for Bord Telecom Éireann was brought forward and implemented by my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  We are well aware of that particular mechanism.  If a similar mechanism is needed in the case of any of the other State companies, certainly that can be considered but, as of now, I am not aware that any of them are in dire need of additional capital.  Certainly they did not make that point to me in the course of our recent meeting, which was a long, constructive and very satisfactory one.  I might point out to the Deputy, for instance, that in the course of a recent major development undertaken by Aer Lingus they had access to IDA grants in the implementation of that project. Therefore, the Deputy will see there are a variety of ways in which State companies can have access to any capital they need for diversification of their efforts.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that, having regard to the apparent collapse of the Goodman-IDA venture, <Col N="863" /> if a company like the Sugar Company were to diversify into the food industry, then capital would be a problem and it would have to be raised in alternative ways?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no suggestion from the Sugar Company that they have any problem about capital.  In fact, they are very actively pursuing all sorts of projects at present, and some are by way of joint venture.  They certainly have not indicated that they have any problem with regard to capitalising these ventures but if they have it can be considered.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to the public concern about the success of the City of Culture 1991 project; whether a sufficient number of private sponsors have been identified and have agreed to provide sufficient finance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach the financial provisions which have been made in the present Estimates for the Dublin European Cultural Capital Committee for their preliminary work during the coming year; and the instructions or guidelines which have been given to the committee regarding the direct Government funds which will be available for the cultural capital activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>Any concern about the success of the Dublin City of Culture 1991 project is unjustified.  The Dublin Promotions Organisation Limited, which so successfully organised the Dublin Millennium, are charged with the same responsibility for the City of Culture programme.  The Government have already allocated a sum of £250,000 to the organisation for their immediate costs.  As in the case of the Dublin Millennium, it is expected that a substantial amount of commercial sponsorship will be secured for the programme.</P>
      <P>I have informed the Dublin Promotions Organisation Limited that the level of State assistance generally for the programme will be determined in the light of the proposals formulated by them and I envisage that a number of major publicly funded projects will form part of the City of Culture programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that there was more advance notice for the Dublin Millennium project than there is for the City of Culture project, that the amount of money that was made available to the Dublin Promotions Organisation Limited &mdash; approximately <Col N="866" /> £700,000 &mdash; is nearly three times what is available on current form to the new company and the new director, and that at this stage, having regard to the nature of the project, no commercial private sponsors have been identified because there is no programme that could be presented to them?  Would he not agree that there is a need to be concerned about the success of this project because the alternative &mdash; that is, failure &mdash; will reflect very badly upon the tourism prospects for this city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think there is any need for alarm.  The project has been entrusted to this organisation which have a good track record.  A director has been appointed and seed money has been made available and we will be glad to assist in any other way possible or necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that for the Glasgow cultural year of 1990, the regional and district councils have made a sum of £30 million available, the local development authority have made available a sum of £7 million and there is a further £3.5 million available to the organisation, with a staff of 40?  In view of those facts, irrespective of how large the manifestations are going to be in Dublin, would the Taoiseach not agree that the sum of £250,000, even as seed money for the preliminary year, is puny? In view of that would he not consider asking the Minister for Tourism and Transport to provide the unused £2 million that is being handed back now to help out in the cultural capital project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would regard anything in the nature of £30 million as being totally wasteful and out of the question in our circumstances.  You can throw any amount of money you like at any project, but this Government have to have regard to the exigencies of the prudent management of the public finances.  I am sick and tired of hearing people telling us what other cities and countries are doing.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he accepts that long term recipients of disability benefit are seriously discriminated against in relation to other long term social welfare recipients in that their level of benefit is lower and they receive none of the following benefits available to other social welfare categories: (a) butter vouchers (b) free fuel allowances (c) the Christmas bonus and (d) EC hand-outs; and if he has any plans to deal with this situation.</P>

      <P>Disability benefit is essentially a short term payment in respect of temporary incapacity for work.  It is similar to other short term benefits, such as unemployment benefit, in terms of the rate payable and entitlement to additional benefits.</P>
      <P>Persons who have been on disability benefit for a year or longer, and who satisfy the medical and contribution conditions, are entitled to claim invalidity pension.  Contribution conditions for invalidity pension are similar to those applying to receipt of disability benefit for longer than 12 months.  This pension is paid at a higher rate than many other social welfare payments &mdash; it is, for example, £4.50 per week more than long-term unemployment assistance for a single person.  Invalidity pensioners can qualify for free fuel allowances and the Christmas bonus, as well as other benefits such as free travel.</P>
      <P>In view of these facts I trust that it is clear that recipients of disability benefit are not discriminated against in relation to other social welfare recipients.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that that is far from clear.  The question of invalidity pensions has no relevance to the 34,000 people who are on long term disability benefit. I should like the Minister to repeat to the House the figures he gave us last month on this issue.  Would he confirm that the <Col N="876" /> 34,000 people who have been on long term disability benefit are, as I outlined in my question, being discriminated against?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined very clearly in my reply what the position is.  I accept that quite often there is confusion in regard to this issue but when disability benefit is paid for longer than a year anyone who is entitled to disability benefit on contribution conditions is entitled to apply for an invalidity pension.  The reality is that many of those who are on long-term disability benefit do not wish to apply for an invalidity pension.  There are various reasons for this.  One reason is that an invalidity pension is taxable whereas disability benefit is not taxable because it is a short-term payment. About 40 per cent of clients who are invited by the Department to transfer from disability benefit to invalidity pension opt to stay on disability pension.  I can only guess as to the reason for this but it seems fairly clear to me that in most cases it is because a spouse is working and this would affect his tax position. Consequently they consider it is preferable in the circumstances which exist at present to continue on disability benefit. By taking that choice they, therefore, decide not to have the extras which go with the invalidity pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's figure that 40 to 50 per cent of families may have another income coming into their households but can he say how many of the 34,000 families who, according to statistics from his Department, have been on disability benefit from 15 months to five years have no other income?  On that basis will the Minister agree that those people are seriously discriminated against and that they will face a winter of hardship?  They will not receive a Christmas bonus or any assistance towards the cost of fuel.  Will the Minister agree to consider those cases through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme?  Many of those people are looking to the Minister to offer them some help this winter.  Is the Minister aware <Col N="877" /> that at least 17,000 families are totally dependent on disability benefit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if, in view of the severe difficulties and additional expenses faced by low income families with school-going children at the resumption of the school year each September, he will consider introducing a special payment to assist such families; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I introduced a variety of measures in this year's Social Welfare Act which gave low income families substantial increases in income over the full year.</P>
      <P>In addition to introducing a minimum child dependant allowance of £10 per week, the personal rate for the long term unemployed was increased by 12 per cent which, when added to the increase of 11 per cent given in July 1988 brought the total increase since last year to almost 25 per cent.  In the same period, a long term unemployed husband with a dependent wife and five children received an extra £26.80 per week bringing their total, including child benefit, to £145.90 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the social welfare package, the Government also tackled the problem faced by families of workers on low incomes through a special scheme of tax exemption, together with improvements <Col N="879" /> in child benefit and family income supplement.</P>
    <P>In addition, for the first time ever, the Government recognised the special difficulties of widowers and deserted husbands with children, on low incomes by introducing an allowance scheme for them.  The cost of the overall package is £71 million in 1989 and an estimated £155 million in a full year, including the tax exemption for low paid workers.</P>
    <P>Assistance is available under the exceptional needs provisions of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and the footwear scheme to meet the additional expenses faced by low income families with school-going children at the resumption of the school year.  The amount paid for exceptional needs provisions relating to children's clothing, including school uniforms, is expected to be £0.5 million in 1989, covering 20,000 children.  A further £1.8 million, covering 157,000 children, was provided for the footwear scheme.</P>
    <P>The question of any further additional payments is a matter to be considered in the context of the budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that some increases have been paid during the year but I should like to ask the Minister if he is aware of the report prepared by Mary Daly which indicates that parents preparing their children for school in the month of September go through extreme stress.  Is he aware that mothers make extreme sacrifices for their children at that time and that often they go hungry so as to provide for their children?  Will the Minister accept that parents must face a massive outlay at that time of the year? Is he aware it is estimated that at least £50 per child is required in that week in September?  For parents with four children and on a low income the figure of £200 is outside their reach.</P>

The Government who followed us decided to stop that allowance and they had their own reasons for doing so.  I will have to give further consideration to the best way to help such people at that time.  The Deputy will be aware that the provision of clothing is a great difficulty at that time and I will have to consider how best to target resources to deal with that expenditure in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

Will he accept that for those on social welfare benefits he should double the dole payment in that month?

      <P>The payment of a clothing allowance is important, particularly in the month of September.  With regard to the Deputy's suggestion that we should use the child benefit scheme, I should like to tell him that it is an extremely broadly based scheme and that I do not consider it to be the most suitable mechanism for making that payment.  I have had meetings with community welfare officers and <Col N="881" /> they indicated to me that the greatest problem such people face is the provision of clothing for their children.  They welcomed the steps I took to rationalise the footwear scheme throughout the country.  People in the different categories are now aware of their entitlements under that scheme.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Under present legislation social welfare payments can except in special circumstances only be paid to the person entitled to the payment and there are no arrangements whereby my Department can make deductions from social welfare payments in respect of third parties, such as local authorities.</P>
      <P>A substantial project in computerising unemployment payments is under way and this very large task, involving the extension of computer systems to a total of 130 offices, will take several years to complete and will absorb available computer resources during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In parallel I am continuing to examine ways of expanding the one-stop-shop concept.  This would enable my Department to deal with potential requirements such as direct debiting of local authority rents.  Because, however, of the fundamental and complex changes in the existing systems which this type of development would involve, substantial progress must await completion of the project to computerisation of unemployment payments.  Furthermore, if this facility were provided it would also have <Col N="882" /> to be available for other regular household expenses.  I hope to complete the first phase of computerising the unemployment payment systems within 2-3 years and to begin to introduce additional features from 1991 onwards.

Despite the best efforts of local authorities and county sheriffs, the Minister's Department have refused, even in cases where the recipients have given their permission to do so, to pay this sum directly.  This would prevent evictions, some of which have taken place recently. It is going to take time to computerise the system and implement all the other magnificent programmes the Minister speaks about.  People are being put out on the street as they are incapable of using the limited resources they receive from the Department of Social Welfare in paying their rent.  I do not believe any member of a local authority, any manager or sheriff wants to put people out on the road&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When we deliver we deliver everywhere throughout the country through a system which is increasingly being computerised. One way of getting ahead of much of this development would be to use the one-stop-shop concept as far as possible.  The computerisation of unemployment payments will facilitate this.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 138 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social employment scheme, SES, is aimed at providing part time employment to assist unemployed people, <Col N="884" /> particularly the long term unemployed, to re-enter the labour market.  The purpose of the family income supplement scheme, FIS, on the other hand, is to create an incentive for full time workers with families, who are in low paid employment, to remain at work.  Its purpose is essentially different from the SES and to extend entitlement to FIS to persons on the SES would involve fundamental changes in the FIS scheme.</P>
    <P>Allowances under the SES scheme are payable at a standard rate of £65 for a single person and £92 for a person with an adult dependant.  Improvements to the scheme, which were announced recently, have extended a dependant allowance of up to £10 per child to SES participants. As a result of this change, all SES participants now receive a payment which is in excess of their entitlements under the unemployment assistance scheme.  For example, an SES participant with an adult dependant and three child dependants will now receive a total allowance of £122 per week, as against an entitlement under long term unemployment assistance of £107 per week.  This represents a substantial improvement in the situation of SES participants with two or more child dependants, who previously received less than their UA entitlement.</P>
    <P>In addition, SES participants are free to engage in other work or activities during their time off.  Such earnings have no effect on their payment from the SES.</P>
    <P>In the light of the improved situation of SES participants with families, the payment of FIS, in addition to child dependant allowances is not considered necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his reply indicated that the main purpose of the family income supplement scheme is to keep people in work.  In his report to the Minister's Department, Dr. Blackwell indicated that when social welfare incomes get very close people tend to opt for social welfare.  Would the Minister not accept that a person in any employment on an income of £65 or £92 per week, plus allowances for dependants, and engaged in the same number of hours <Col N="885" /> of work as a person on the social employment scheme would qualify for family income supplement on every other grounds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This question was examined by the Government fairly recently. As a result of this examination, it was considered that the most appropriate thing to do, which would be of most benefit to the family, would be to provide £10 per child to people on the social employment scheme.  This decision was arrived at by the ministerial committee on employment.  I am aware it was announced following the tabling of the Deputy's question but I think the Deputy would agree that this goes a long way towards meeting the basic requirement as seen by the Deputy.  This would be a more efficient and effective way of dealing with that problem.  It is a major step and it will have a big influence on social employment scheme participants as we head towards next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the decision announced by the Minister for Labour represents an improvement in the scheme but is it not the case that the groups representing the unemployed did not seek that kind of improvement but rather inclusion in the family income supplement scheme?  The arguments they put are relevant.  In every way under the terms of the scheme, apart from the fact they are on a social employment scheme, they qualify for the family income supplement. Would he not consider bridging the gap and allow them qualify for family income supplement in view of the fact that they pay tax and PRSI just like any other worker?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained to the Deputy the decision which has been taken.  It is a major step.  It was arrived at following the deliberations of the ministerial committee at which different Ministers looked at the matter to identify the best step that could be taken at this time. It was felt that this decision would go towards meeting the situation.  I believe it does and will prove very beneficial.  As <Col N="886" /> a matter of interest, both moves were recommended by different groups of people.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that people going on these SES schemes or courses believe for all intents and purposes they are taking up a serious job and that many people are ignorant of the fact that the FIS scheme does not apply to them?  Even with the payment of £10 per child, they are still at a marked disadvantage. The only real solution would be to give those on SES schemes and those on FÁS courses the same benefits which are given to low income groups. Finally, is the Minister aware that not only are they ineligible for the FIS supplement but many of them have lost their medical cards?  For example, a single man is allowed to earn £65 under the SES scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This control is exercised through medical referees to whom claimants are referred from time to time for examination for the purpose of obtaining second medical opinions as to incapacity for work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Without going into detail I will give the history.  It is a fact that the person concerned has been found variously capable and incapable at different stages.  When a medical examiner makes a note to have the person re-examined in so many months, that is one of the factors <Col N="889" /> that contributes to a person being re-examined.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned has been on invalidity pension from June 1986 and is currently in receipt of pension at the rate appropriate to a married man with three qualified child dependants.  He applied for a transfer from disability benefit to invalidity pension on 11 June 1986 and at that stage a medical referee said he was not permanently incapable of work and decided not to award him invalidity pension.  He appealed against this and was re-examined on 30 January 1987 by a different medical referee who also expressed the opinion that he was not permanently incapable of work and requested that he be referred for a further examination in six months time.  That is quite normal.  When a year from the date of the original application had elapsed it was considered that he satisfied the permanently incapacitated condition as set out in SI 218 of 1970 and he was awarded invalidity pension from 12 June 1986.  Regular medical reviews have been carried out since he was awarded invalidity pension and he was found capable of work by a medical referee on 2 October 1989 and was disallowed from 26 October.  He appealed again against that decision.  Most of the examinations as the Deputy will see are as a result of appeals.  He appealed again and was examined by a second medical referee who at that stage expressed the opinion that he was incapable of work and requested that he be referred for examination in a further two months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the extent of the medical examination which takes place, whether there is a general examination, a superficial examination or if an examination takes place in all cases where persons have been referred to the medical referee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The examination is a professional matter for the medical referee in question who will normally have information presented by the person or his GP as to the nature of the incapacity.  Deputy O'Connell raised a question about the kind of information that is used at an appeal.  I have found that people may not go in particularly well prepared to the medical referee and, on appeal, will ensure that there is fuller documentation on the illnes and win the appeal.  There are also letters from the doctors which are very brief, and even getting a more comprehensive letter from the doctor may change the position.</P>
      <P>Two medical referees can differ in their opinion.  If a second medical referee is called there will obviously be a more comprehensive examination at that stage because the decision is being appealed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 27, 38 and 156 together.</P>
      <P>The number of active dentists on my Department's dental panel at present is approximately 670, of whom 222 (33 per cent) have signed agreements covering dependent spouses of insured persons.</P>
      <P>It is important for Deputies to note that admission to my Department's panel is open to all qualified registered dentists. The number of dentists on this panel in any given area does not necessarily reflect the numbers required to meet the needs of claimants under the dental benefit scheme.  Although some dependent spouses may have to travel outside their immediate area to obtain treatment, the overall number of dentists treating this category is considerable and provides a service in most parts of the country.  The scheme is operating well and to date, 54,200 dependent spouses, mainly women working in the home, have applied to my Department for approval of treatment.</P>
      <P>From the outset, I arranged to have details of dentists who have signed agreements covering dependent spouses made available at local offices of my Department. Any person who requires dental treatment can obtain details of their nearest participating dentists from these offices or by telephoning my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some dentists are refusing to provide certain items of treatment under the scheme and their situation is under review.  I would prefer to see a resolution of the dispute in the context of the Irish <Col N="894" /> Dental Association agreeing to full participation in the extended scheme.  I recently wrote to the president of the association reiterating my willingness to discuss new proposals and inviting the association to meet me to establish if there is a basis on which we can overcome the present difficulties.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, however, I would again advise patients who are being asked to pay inappropriate fees, to refuse to pay them and to report the matter to my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that this is a very patchy scheme with limited services available to people?  Is it not another example of the Minister's announcement of schemes without adequate arrangement with the bodies involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.  I thought the Deputy would have noted that there are now 220 dentists who have signed to operate the extended scheme.  A relatively short time ago when there was last a question on this issue, there were 150 dentists, so the number of dentists operating the extended scheme is growing all the time.  Two extra dentists came in in the last couple of days.  Dentists are coming on to the scheme continuously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that those figures are very low, only a third of the 670 dentists.  That means quite a substantial number of people requiring dental services having to search out the correct dentist.  On the one hand, I would like to congratulate the Minister for taking on the vested interests in the dental profession.  At the same time, I have to argue that he cannot stand up here today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and say that the scheme is working well.  Would the Minister not agree that the scheme is not working well and that PRSI workers and <Col N="895" /> their spouses are at a disadvantage by virtue of the fact that the Minister has not arrived at a satisfactory agreement with the Irish Dental Association?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, 54,200 dependent spouses have already applied under the scheme.  My Department estimated at the outset that 150 dentists would be sufficient to deal with the extended scheme if they were properly distributed.  We have 220 dentists who have signed the agreement to operate the scheme.  The problem, however, is one of distribution of dentists.  I have written to the president of the association inviting him to meet with me for further discussions with a view to finally settling this matter.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the 'flu epidemic has hit this country.  There is a vaccination programme in place each year which is available free to those at risk, particularly the elderly.  The same has been the situation in the current year.  In the Eastern Health Board area, 13,000 people have been vaccinated.</P>
      <P>I am unaware of any decision of the Eastern Health Board to allow doctors to charge a fee of £5 for the vaccination and I would be interested in getting the details from Deputy Rabbitte.  There is no decision to have a mass vaccination programme at this stage.  There is a time lag between the vaccination and the antibodies developing which takes approximately a month.  One would doubt the value of a mass vaccination programme at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Minister's reply that he is not aware that the Chief Medical Officer for the Eastern Health Board confirmed to queries on behalf of medical card holders that doctors had a discretion to charge a £5 administration fee.  Further, let me ask the Minister if it is not precisely because there is a time lag that there ought to be now a mass vaccination programme for those at risk, the old, people suffering from asthma or other respiratory problems. Is the Minister aware of the Eastern Health Board's statement today that they have already run out of vaccine?  Can he assure this House that his Department are in a position to secure adequate supplies of vaccine especially for our citizens potentially at risk?</P>

I bring up the question of the £5 fee because I believe the Eastern Health Board would not charge a £5 fee to medical card holders.  I will certainly bring that point up with them.</P>

It is also proposed that the Dáil shall sit later than 9 p.m. today and business shall be interrupted at 11.30 p.m.  It is further proposed that Nos. 4 and 4a shall be taken without debate.  It is further proposed that notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders all Stages of No. 1, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 5 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for the Environment.</P>

      <P>On the arrangements under No. 4a in respect of Supplementary Estimates, I have a simple proposal for amendment of the allocation of time which I seek to move at this stage: That the time 10 p.m. as allowed be changed to 10.30 p.m. in respect of Vote 43, the Energy Supplementary Estimate.  I am proposing that that extra half hour be taken from the Estimate in respect of the Attorney General.  The purpose of the amendment, which I hope will have the support of the House, is that the Energy Supplementary Estimate deals with a proposal for the payment of a substantial fee to the consultants who recommended the sale of our interest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The procedure for the alteration of a borough boundary is set out in the Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order, 1989, and the Local Government Ireland Act, 1898.  Under the relevant provisions Clonmel Corporation made representation to me, as Minister for the Environment, to extend the boundary.  As required by law a local inquiry was held at which both Clonmel Corporation and Tipperary South Riding County Council were represented and all other interested parties were afforded an opportunity to express their views on the proposal.  Having considered the report and recommendations of the inspector who held the inquiry, I decided to approve the extension without modification and accordingly made the Borough of Clonmel (Alteration of Boundary) Provisional Order, 1989 on 24 November last.  The proposed extension had been agreed between both local authorities.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the Provisional Order, made by me on 24 November.  The order provides for the extension of the Borough of Clonmel so as to take in an area of Tipperary South Riding comprising 1,537 acres approximately with a population of 3,058 based on the 1986 census.  The order is provisional only and has no effect until confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas; hence this Bill to confirm the order which is set out in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The order which forms the Schedule to the Bill contains a number of provisions which are consequential on the extension. These are along the usual lines for boundary alteration and provide for the preparation of official maps of the extended borough area; the continuation in effect of by-laws, resolutions and orders in relation to the transferred area; consequential adjustment of county electoral areas, polling districts and the continuation in office of borough councillors; adjustment of property, rights <Col N="1033" /> and liabilities and continuation of the development plan.</P>
    <P>As I explained in the Seanad, Clonmel has a long history in local government terms: From 1371 A.D. to 1608 A.D. Clonmel was governed by a &ldquo;Sovereign&rdquo; which office was established at the behest of the Duke of Ormond.  The mayoralty was established by Royal Charter of 1608 A.D. and the mayoral roll is unbroken from that time to the present with the exception of the period 1650 to 1656 when it was under a military governor after the town's eventual surrender to Cromwell.</P>
    <P>Clonmel held its status as a Municipal Borough with the passing of the Municipal Corporation (Ireland) Act, 1840. Under that Act, Clonmel retained its corporate status with the title of the corporate body changing from the mayor, free burgesses and commonalty of the Town of Clonmel to its present title of the mayor aldermen and burgesses of Clonmel.  The borough council has a membership of 12 including the mayor and four aldermen.</P>
    <P>The boundaries of the Borough of Clonmel were last extended by the Clonmel Corporation Act, 1895, which in effect altered the county boundary of Waterford and Tipperary to bring that part of the Borough in County Waterford within the South Riding of Tipperary.  It will be apparent therefore that it is not far short of a hundred years since the boundary was last altered.  The current boundary extension as well as taking in development that has overspilled the old boundary will ensure that sufficient development land will be available to the borough for some time to come to cater for future expansion.  The Clonmel development plan which was prepared jointly by both authorities already includes the area proposed for transfer.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to have the present legislation enacted before the Christmas recess so that the boundary extension will come into force as from 1 January 1990 to coincide, for obvious administrative, accounting and practical reasons, with the start of the financial year and thereby avoid inconvenience to all affected by the boundary change.  The Bill received a <Col N="1034" /> warm welcome in the Seanad and all Stages of the Bill were taken in the Upper House on 7 December.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I would like to ask for the co-operation of Deputies in ensuring that it will have a speedy passage so that the boundary extension can become effective on 1 January next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement of the extension of the boundary of the Borough of Clonmel following representations by Clonmel Corporation and the subsequent holding of a public inquiry and in agreement with Tipperary South Riding County Council.</P>
      <P>Clonmel is situated in the scenic Suir Valley in South Tipperary.  As well as being the largest inland town, Clonmel is the principal town in our constituency.  It is administered by a borough council.  It has a population of approximately 12,000 people.  It is an historic town, still possessing many remnants of the past and parts of the medieval walls have been restored.  Clonmel is a thriving shopping and commercial centre.  Its main industries are: Digital International, Showerings, Schissers, Medite of Europe and Clonmel Chemicals.  A wide range of smaller industries also operate in the town and play a vital role in providing economic and employment spin-offs.</P>
      <P>For a period, Clonmel appeared to be unaffected by the economic recession but over the past 12 months it has suffered to an undesirable extent from an economic decline.  This is evident from the closure of Burkes Bacon Factory, Currans and the replacement of Clonmel Foods by Master Meats which now employs a reduced workforce.  A similar outcome now appears to be the result of the dispute at Barlo Heating Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was against this background that an application was made to the Department of the Environment for an extension to the borough boundary.  The reasons for seeking such an extension were fourfold; first, the town of Clonmel physically extends very substantially beyond the borough boundary and, as a consequence, no further land was available <Col N="1035" /> to Clonmel Corporation for any new housing development within their own borough.  The last three housing schemes built by Clonmel Corporation were erected outside the borough because they did not have any lands within their own boundary.  Indeed, the present boundary intersects various housing schemes, corporation and private, resulting in a different provision of services and a different charge for services to neighbouring houses within one scheme.  The boundary was illogical and in total conflict with the natural, visible and acceptable distinctions between urban and rural.</P>
    <P>It was necessary &mdash; indeed compelling &mdash; for Clonmel Corporation to apply for such an extension in order to provide the capacity and the freedom to develop housing and other developments within their own borough.  The second reason for the application for the extension lies in the fact that the main drainage scheme, the northern Suir, was to a large extent located outside the borough boundary and, therefore, gave rise to numerous difficulties, some of which I will refer to later.</P>
    <P>A further reason for the application of the borough extension lies with the problems that arose in drawing up a town development plan which, once again, involved Clonmel Corporation and South Tipperary County Council.  A good, cohesive and workable development plan is best drawn up by one local authority, not two.  As a result, unfortunately, two rather unsuccessful development plans were produced and the main reason for their lack of success was the problem with the borough boundary.</P>
    <P>The area recommended for inclusion in the borough is very much part and parcel of Clonmel town.  The residents are part of the town but not of the town. They, rightly and justifiably, demanded to be within the borough as they wanted to have a voice in the day-to-day running of the town and a say in the future development of Clonmel.  They felt isolated and separated by an unnatural, illogical and unacceptable boundary fence. Therefore, I welcome the announcement <Col N="1036" /> by the Minister which will involve the inclusion of 926 houses, bringing the total boundary area to 1,087 hectares, giving a population to Clonmel of 15,472.</P>
    <P>However, I must remind the Minister that the extension of the borough boundary is only a part of the whole plan for the future development and prosperity of Clonmel.  Equally important is the awaited official announcement of Clonmel being designated under the Urban Renewal Act.  We have heard many rumours and promises have been made but it is regrettable that the Minister did not use this occasion to announce, alongside the extension of the borough boundary, the designation of Clonmel for urban renewal.  Both are intrinsically intertwined with the future of this town which has a vast potential.</P>
    <P>I wish to impress on the Minister the great importance of Clonmel being designated under the Urban Renewal Act. It is an old town and many of the buildings in its centre have become dilapidated and derelict, which has a depressing effect on the town centre trade.  However, I congratulate Clonmel Corporation in acquiring substantial redevelopment sites by agreement and compulsory purchase orders over the past ten years or more. The corporation have invested £1 million in these acquisitions and the servicing of this investment at a time of financial constraint has become a severe burden on their revenues.  Clonmel Corporation have acquired 55 acres of industrial land for development within their new boundaries. Unfortunately, the recession militated against development but now, due to the financial burden as a result of such development, designation under the Urban Renewal Act is urgently needed.</P>
    <P>The fact that Clonmel Corporation acquired an amount of land for development proved the enormous commitment to generate major urban renewal.  The financial burden they are prepared to undertake to sustain this effort also proves they are absolutely committed to urban renewal.  Few, if any, urban authorities in the country have undertaken such an expensive involvement in a development plan. <Col N="1037" /> I also wish to point out to the Minister that the preservation and restoration of areas of Clonmel, like the Main Guard, are of paramount importance to the historical and architectural aspect of the town in general.  In spite of the enormous efforts made by Clonmel Corporation to entice developers to the town, they have been totally unrewarded by virtue of the fact that designated areas are in a ring round Clonmel, for example, Wexford, Waterford, Kilkenny and Tralee.  If the Minister gives Clonmel the green light, as a result of all the negotiations in the past there are developers prepared to move immediately into the site to proceed with such development.  If designated, Clonmel Corporation will justify the Government's policy of designation as an effective measure to achieve urban renewal and redevelopment.  I appeal to the Minister to include Clonmel under the Urban Renewal Act as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the main drainage scheme, the northern Suir, as one of the reasons for the extension of the Clonmel boundary.  We are extremely conscious of our environment, and rightly so, yet while we monitor and criticise industry and while we pressurise farmers to provide proper facilities for farm pollution control, the River Suir in Clonmel is receiving raw, untreated sewage. Recent surveys show that the BOD level is approaching a level causing much concern. Furthermore, it is projected that, by the year 2001, if we do not have any further domestic or industrial treatment, the BOD level will rise to the alarming figure of seven.  The case for the provision of a treatment plant in Clonmel is unquestionable and indeed a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The costings of such a plan are estimated to be approximately £3 million to £4 million on figures almost two years old. Clonmel Corporation have submitted a plan and designs to the Minister's Department and I appeal to him to give the provision of a treatment plant in Clonmel the priority it deserves.</P>
    <P>While the basic infrastructure of our town is good, many problems have been avoided because Clonmel Corporation <Col N="1038" /> have succeeded in providing many car parks in the town centre and shopping areas.  Nevertheless, due to the non-completion of the inner relief road, the bulk of all heavy traffic and motorists still go through the town.  Apart from the inconvenience, this has a negative impact on the character of our town centre.  I consider it of vital importance to have the inner relief road completed as quickly as possible.  However, such completion depends totally on finance provided by the Department.  Therefore, I request the Minister to favourably consider the request to allocate finance in 1990 for the completion of the inner relief road.</P>
    <P>Our problems with transport do not end there.  One of the real disadvantages in Clonmel is the absence of a proper rail service but this could be easily corrected by providing an adequate feeder service to Limerick Junction which has a very good service.  At the moment it is virtually impossible to travel by rail from Clonmel to Dublin.  We are extremely conscious of this inadequacy and we call for a realistic and worthwhile rail service for Clonmel.</P>
    <P>I also wish to inform the Minister of the recent and sudden closure of Clonmel swimming pool and I should like to inform him of the local efforts being made at present to reopen it as quickly as possible.  This swimming pool was built in 1973 with funds raised by local people along with contributions from Clonmel Corporation and Tipperary South Riding County Council.  This was a much utilised amenity, of major importance not only to the town but also to the people of the hinterland, due principally to our remoteness from any other seaside resort. Unfortunately, due to the oil crisis in 1979 measures were taken to conserve energy which contributed in part to the condensation which eventually forced the closure of this swimming pool some five months ago.  While a major effort is being undertaken locally to raise £300,000 for the requisite repair and reconstruction work that task cannot be realistically completed without an input from the Department of the Environment.  A commitment on the part of the Minister to <Col N="1039" /> meet part of the financial demands necessary for the reopening of this pool would be reassuring, in turn sustaining the enthusiasm of the people of the town for its reopening.</P>
    <P>The consequences of the closure of this swimming pool have been many.  For example, schools can no longer include swimming instruction on their curricula with the River Suir &mdash; which can be potentially dangerous &mdash; being used for bathing during the summer months having its list of unfortunate accidents. Of equal importance, people suffering various illnesses and the mentally handicapped can no longer use this amenity in their recuperation to full health while others are denied a source of enjoyment and recreation once available to them.  I urge the Minister to carefully consider the application lodged by the swimming pool committee for funding from his Department.  I hope he will find it possible to give them some encouragement in their efforts to have the swimming pool reopened.</P>
    <P>Clonmel has enormous potential as a tourist centre but, unfortunately, it needs to be revitalised.  The town lies in an area of high amenity value and, as such, provides a very attractive environment for residents and tourists alike.  The significant landscape features of the River Suir Valley, with the backdrop of the Comeragh Mountains to the south, render Clonmel rich in scenic terms.  The centre of the town is of particular historic and architectural merit which has not, as yet, been fully realised or exploited.  The protection of these amenities and the improvement of the town centre are of paramount importance and must be given priority.  The very existence of such amenities is a major factor in enticing further industrial and residential development in the area.  Evidence of the town's pleasant environment is illustrated by the fact that Clonmel was chosen to represent Ireland in the international <i>Entente Chorale</i> competition in 1987.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the town of Clonmel as a tourist centre, allocating us the means <Col N="1040" /> with which its potential can be fully exploited.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the borough boundary of Clonmel.  However, this is only part of a plan necessary for the future development and prosperity of the town.  For example, we depend enormously on the town's designation under the Urban Renewal Act.  If the Minister intends making such announcement I would ask him to do so without delay so that we can realistically plan the future of our town, in that way ensuring that the nineties will represent the decade that will give birth to a revitalised dynamic Clonmel from which its people will reap the benefits of its full development and prosperity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome this Bill whose main purpose is to extend the boundary of the Borough of Clonmel to take in an additional 1,537 acres of land, property and businesses which to date fell within the rating district of Tipperary South Riding County Council.  Speaking as a member of that county council I know there is general welcome from all sides for the provision of this Bill.</P>
      <P>At the estimates meetings of Clonmel Corporation and Tipperary South Riding County Council questions were asked with regard to the financial implications for each of those authorities.  Under the County Management Act Mr. Séamus Hayes is the manager of Clonmel Corporation and also of Clonmel County Council.  In response to a question posed by a colleague of Deputy Ahearn, Mr. Hayes expressed the view that the gains and losses would be balanced between the two local authorities.  When replying, the Minister might give some indication of the level of changes contemplated in the rating, particularly of factories, that will now fall within the administrative control of the Borough of Clonmel as opposed to the Clonmel electoral area of Tipperary South Riding County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The town of Clonmel has been correctly described by Deputy Ahearn as of special significance.  It is a most picturesque town, being located in between <Col N="1041" /> Slievenamon and the Knockmealdowns. It is a town steeped in history going back &mdash; as the Minister said &mdash; to the year 1300 when it was governed by a sovereign.  It is appropriate that we have today in the Visitors Gallery people who represent that sovereign state which originally governed the town of Clonmel.  The town has other significant attributes.  For example, it is the town in which the Labour Party was founded in 1911 by James Connolly, from whose town hall the Minister, many of his Cabinet colleagues and others have been extended a warm civic welcome.  Clonmel Corporation's mayor, burgesses, aldermen and councillors have always extended a warm welcome to our President, Taoisigh, Government Ministers, members of other political parties and other dignatories, always demonstrating tremendous pride in their town.  They have proved to be most progressive in their housing programme which now extends into the county electoral area &mdash; developments like the Wilderness and other large housing estates provided by Clonmel Corporation which, because of scarcity of land, had to be built on county council land.  Therefore, it is appropriate that the provisions of this Bill and its confirmation order recognise the corporation's efforts in their administrative area.</P>
    <P>It is my hope that the original walls of the town of Clonmel be preserved under amenity orders, ensuring their incorporation in any development plans.  That is also the wish of the vast majority of its people.  Clonmel also initiated the concept of public transport under the auspices of Bianconi.  Bianconi's centenary was celebrated this year when Clonmel was twinned with a town in northern Italy, Costa Mosaga, his home town.  To mark that event a street in that town in northern Italy was renamed Via Clonmel. It is most unusual for a continental town to recognise the contribution of somebody like Bianconi to the transport system in the south of Ireland, an expertise subsequently recognised by Governments here when he was co-opted on to our major transport authorities.</P>
    <P>Clonmel has a history it is proud of <Col N="1042" /> and it is appropriate that the town would evolve into a larger area.  It is the largest inland town in Ireland.  The Minister, in having this legislation passed swiftly through the House, should consider an increase in the number of members on the corporation so that these 3,000 people would be better represented.</P>
    <P>The town of Clonmel &mdash; Cluain Meala, the valley of honey &mdash; is appropriately named.  It has a shopping list of needs which have been identified by Deputy Therese Ahearn and I will not reiterate it.  In identifying the town for expansion and development, the Minister should understand that these needs have a specific bearing on his Department, particularly the swimming pool.  I put down a parliamentary question on that matter to the Minister and I consider his reply to be positive; he said that he will look favourably at the request that has been made to him, not alone by Clonmel Corporation but by the swimming pool committee.</P>
    <P>The beautiful River Suir which is one of our major salmon and trout rivers, second only to the Blackwater, should be preserved.  Sufficient funds should be made available to Clonmel Corporation to proceed with their major sewage treatment plant.  Also in reply to a parliamentary question I put down, the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, promised that the order giving urban renewal approval would be forthcoming before Christmas, and that is on the record of the House.  I am disappointed that the Minister frowns at that promise but that is exactly what his colleague in the Department of the Environment confirmed to me on the floor of this House a short number of weeks ago.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will have regard to the fact that my party leader and colleague, Deputy Spring, considered Clonmel to be important enough to ensure that the natural gas grid was extended to the town.  That has permitted the town to be progressive in its provision of energy. The natural gas grid was recently extended to Tipperary Crystal on the periphery of the town of Clonmel.  The provision of this tremendous amenity will <Col N="1043" /> mean a 30 per cent reduction in energy costs for that industry and hopefully, energy costs for the swimming pool will also be much lower in future.</P>
    <P>There is an active Earthwatch committee in Clonmel.  They report on pollution of the environment by industry, CFCs, the local authorities and so on.  If it were not for a group like Earthwatch we would be inclined to neglect some of the areas for which we all have responsibility. The town has also recently launched its own radio, Suirland Radio, which broadcasts voices the local people recognise.  This town has made a major contribution to the economic development not alone of County Tipperary, but the adjoining counties of Waterford and Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>Like my colleague Deputy Ahearn, I am concerned about the lack of employment opportunities in Clonmel and the surrounding areas.  There have been major job losses there in recent times, particularly the loss of 156 jobs in the Barlo industry.  I am sorry to record that today the Labour Court talks to resolve this dispute have broken down again.  The future development of the town will depend on all of us.  We should assist in every way possible in extending the boundary of the town and ensuring that the mayor and the corporation can give an excellent service, as they have done in the past.  Clonmel and South Tipperary should be seen as an area with job opportunities and should not be cursed with emigration and unemployment which sadly is the case at present.  The unemployment figures for towns in the county are twice the national average.</P>
    <P>We all have responsibilities.  We cannot sit back on our laurels and say we are making marvellous progress and that there is an improvement in the economy. The only real proof of an improvement in the economy is increased job creation. That responsibility rests not alone with Government but also with the private sector which I hope will respond to this positive scheme of the extension of the county boundary.</P>
    <P>I hope that the problems <i>vis-à-vis</i> the <Col N="1044" /> rating structure and the differences in water charges, with which the county is still cursed between one authority and another will be overcome.  The anomalies where the people in the Clonmel Corporation area pay less in water and service charges than their country cousins should be addressed by the Minister by way of increased block grants and increased Government contributions. We should ensure that local authorities are not totally dependent on shops and industry, water charges, sanitary service charges and planning charges for their finances.  The Minister should ensure that they are properly funded in the future.</P>
    <P>Hopefully this new challenge facing the Borough of Clonmel will be met positively by the Minister for the Environment and the Government who hold the purse strings which allow local authorities to develop and provide better services for their people.  I have no doubt that the elected representatives in Clonmel Corporation will meet this challenge and they will be looking for a positive response from the Minister for the Environment. Funds should be provided so that progress can be made in the town, particularly for the inner relief road, further local authority housing and the major sewerage scheme which, according to every expert and all the research that has been done, is required.</P>
    <P>The River Suir which flows through Clonmel town is polluted from industry upstream and in the town.  I hope the Minister will be positive in his response to Clonmel Corporation and their demands, which are not unreasonable.  I welcome the Bill and the Labour Party will support any efforts the Minister makes in this regard.</P>

      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party I should like to welcome this Bill which proposes the extension of the borough boundary of Clonmel.  I should also like to congratulate Clonmel Corporation on the extension of this boundary.  Unfortunately the extension of a borough boundary is an all too rare occurrence.  Over the past few decades we have seen the urbanisation of this country with the suburbs of the major cities and provincial towns growing in size and population.  Unfortunately this growth has not been matched by corresponding changes in local authority boundaries or in the status of the urban authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 14 November last the Minister of State told me that since 1978 the boundaries of only five urban authorities &mdash; Athy, Bray, Ennis, Longford and Tralee &mdash; have been extended.  Anyone who is familiar in any way with our towns will find it difficult to understand, with the degree of urban growth we have seen, why only five urban districts have been expanded in the past 11 years and why it has taken 100 years to revise the boundaries of Clonmel Borough.  The boundaries of many towns are 100 years out of date and, as a result, local democracy suffers.  In many areas the urban population whose taxes pay for local government are seriously under-represented <Col N="1046" /> and the population of the real towns are not represented on their local authorities. The idea that one could have taxation without representation was sufficient to cause a revolution in one country 200 years ago.  There are serious anomalies in this area because urban councils do not have jurisdiction over the suburbs of many towns that have grown over the years.  The result of this is that county councils act as planning authorities for the suburbs of towns, many of the people who live in the suburbs feel alienated and boundaries are seriously out of date.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that where extensions have been given this has occurred after growth has taken place.  There is a strong case to be made for the extension of boundaries to be considered at an earlier stage so as to enable towns and urban authorities to plan for those extended boundaries.  There is also a need to simplify and update the legislation and procedures for the extension of urban boundaries.  It is ridiculous that the legislation which governs this area dates from the last century and is totally out of touch with the needs of the latter part of this century.</P>
    <P>A number of towns are still waiting for the revision of their boundaries and I should like the Minister to address these as a matter of urgency.  No doubt he will tell us those areas will be considered in the context of the committee that is being established to examine local government. I believe the discussion on this Bill will afford the Minister an opportunity to clarify the exact position in regard to this committee.  We have been told it is to be established and to report within a year. This committee is not yet established and even if it is established now it is unlikely to have reported before the end of 1990. Where will that leave the local elections which are due to be held next June?  Is it the Minister's intention to proceed with the local elections before this committee has carried out its work and reported?  If it is not his intention to do that, will he clarify when local elections are likely to be held?  When I raised this matter at Question Time some weeks ago the Minister of State gave a very flippant answer. <Col N="1047" /> In the interests of local democracy the Minister should clarify the position as to when local elections will be held and if they will be held before the committee has reported.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank the officials of the county council and corporation for the tremendous efforts they made in this area.  The council and the corporation met in order to reach agreement as to where exactly the borough boundary should be.  I should also like to thank the Minister for bringing this Bill forward so speedily. However, there is one point which worries me in regard to this Bill.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that part of the Clonmel area was taken into the Cahir electoral area during the last election because of a surplus of votes in the county council area, I am concerned that a seat will be lost in the Cahir electoral area in future elections.  I think it is within the Minister's power to ensure that there will be no seat lost so that Cahir will continue to have adequate representation on the council.  It would be remiss of me if I did not mention this point here today.  I hope the Cahir councillors will continue to adequately represent the Cahir area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Clonmel area should extend back into the Comeragh mountains and not the foothills of the Knockmealdown mountains, as Deputy Ferris said.  Clonmel is surrounded by the Comeragh and Slievenamon mountains and not the Knockmealdown mountains.  Housing in the Clonmel area extends right to the Comeragh mountains.  I know the inclusion of part of another county in our borough area is a major problem but it is essential for those people to be included so that they can have a say on environmental matters in their areas.  I hope when another borough extension is being considered for this area it will be easier to expand to the south and south-west over the old bridge to Scouthea and up to the mountain road.  All those areas should be included in the Clonmel area. The old bridge was included on another occasion and I know it is much more <Col N="1048" /> difficult on this occasion because of the county boundaries.  I understand there are major problems in many parts of the country where boundary extensions are needed.</P>
    <P>Like other speakers I welcome the announcement by the Minister last summer that Clonmel will be included in the urban renewal scheme.  I was delighted with that announcement and I want to thank the Minister publicly for it.  I know he has discussed the details of this proposal and I believe that when it is announced it will be welcomed by all the people in Clonmel who will respond by taking action immediately.  Negotiations are well advanced with many firms who will contribute to the improvement of the town.</P>
    <P>I want again to thank the Minister for the speed with which he brought this Bill forward.  It will enable my council area to be brought into the urban area and this will help them in their planning for the year 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank all the Deputies for their very constructive contributions on the Bill and their co-operation in enabling it to be passed speedily through the House so that the boundary can take effect from 1 January. The designation under the Urban Renewal Act was raised by all Deputies. I think there is on the record of the House a commitment to do this but if it is not I want to put it on the record now by saying it is my intention to designate some eight other provincial centres for urban renewal in the not too distant future. Clonmel will be one of those towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not take place before Christmas.  This is not because of any tardiness on the part of the Minister or the Minister of State but because of matters which have arisen in regard to the finalisation of the maps.  I have to say this does not apply to Clonmel.  These areas <Col N="1049" /> will be designated as quickly as possible in the near future.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ahearn made a strong case for Clonmel.  Not alone will we be encouraged to visit the area but we will be conscious of the needs of the town and the corporation area.  The financial implications were referred to by Deputy Ferris and I should like to tell him, giving an overview, that they are almost neutral. The financial adjustments that have to take place because of the variations in the rate support grants and commercial rates involvement have been thrashed out and agreed between the two authorities involved.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore expressed concern about the lack of effort as far as extensions are concerned and I should like to tell him that the initiative for promoting extensions must by law come from the local authorities involved.  I do not have any power to intervene in these matters but I will support any applications that came before me to be dealt with in that way.  I agree that the legislation is somewhat out of date and that there is a need to extend and revise some of the boundaries.</P>
      <P>I should like to tell Deputy Gilmore, in regard to local elections, that they are due to take place in 1990 and any alteration in that has to be agreed by Oireachtas Éireann.  Deputy Davern was always to the fore in so far as the designation of Clonmel for urban status was concerned and I am sure he is pleased at today's decision.  I share his hope, as do his colleagues, that the development we all look forward to in Clonmel will take place.  However, I must point out that while we have had considerable development in the other designated areas, not all of them have been successful.  About £130 million worth of development is in construction at present with a possible £137 million at planning stage but out of the 14 other areas there are one or two disappointments.  Hopefully, Clonmel will not be in that category.</P>

I was asked about the proposed select committee on local government and I should like to tell the House that that committee will examine the whole question of local authority funding, structures and functions.  It is intended that the committee will report within one year.  The House has given a strong welcome to the Bill and accommodated me greatly for which I am grateful.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £5,700,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1989, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Office of the Minister for Education, for certain service administered by that office, and for payment of certain grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>I am seeking the approval of the House for three Supplementary Estimates amounting to £14.322 million as follows: £9.251 million for the Vote for Second Level and Further Education; £5.07 million for the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Education; and a token £1,000 for the Vote for Third Level and Further Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional expenditure arises mainly from the provision of additional funding for second level schools in respect of the introduction of the junior certificate programmes, the expansion of services aided by the EC Structural Funds <Col N="1052" /> and the provision of an additional £5 million for the school transport service.</P>
    <P>In 1989 additional expenditure on ESF-aided programmes generated additional Appropriations-in-Aid.  An extra £16 million was approved for payment in 1989.  However, due to a delay in processing the payment of this aid, it is unlikely that it will be received in full before the end of the year and this has been reflected in the Supplementary Estimates.  While this will mean an extra charge on the Exchequer in 1989, the delayed aid, when received in 1990, will be in addition to the amount provided for in the abridged Estimate volume and will further reduce the charge to the Exchequer in 1990.  Over the two years, therefore, the charges will balance out.</P>
    <P>The additional amount sought for the Vote for second level and further education is £9.251 million.  A total of £1 million is being provided to assist schools in the introduction and implementation of the new junior certificate programme.  The amount for each school will be related to the number of new entrants with a minimum grant based on 30 pupils.  The programme started in schools last September and will be examined and assessed for the first time in June 1992.</P>
    <P>The junior certificate programme replaces the intermediate certificate and day vocational (group) certificate programmes. It represents a major reform of the junior cycle post-primary programme and marks the commencement of a phased programme of curricular development. The new programme is a positive response to the changing needs of society and will have a great impact on the quality of education available in our schools to our young people.</P>
    <P>A further £310,000 is being provided for an additional resource grant of £5,000 for each of the 62 schools which have proffered and been approved to offer and develop the new junior certificate technology syllabus which is being introduced on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the syllabus will be carefully monitored and its content and methodology will be reviewed, <Col N="1053" /> amended and developed.  The introduction of this new subject is of extreme importance.  As we enter the nineties and prepare our young people to become responsible citizens, who will spend most of their adult life in the next century, it is imperative that their basic education will prepare them for a world where technology will play an important role.</P>
    <P>The new vocational leaving certificate programme was launched in September 1989 and is eligible for ESF funding.  A sum of £690,000 is being provided for an additional resource grant to each of the schools concerned.  This will be paid on a <i>per capita</i> basis with a minimum of £3,000 per school.</P>
    <P>A further £5 million is being provided in respect of building and equipment grants for second level schools.  Of this, £2.5 million is for liabilities which have matured under the capital building programme mainly because nine major construction projects proceeded faster than expected due to unprecedented fine weather conditions.  Expenditure on emergency works has also been greater than the contingency sum provided and £900,000 is for payment of equipment grants to secondary schools, £600,000 for minor capital works of an exceptionally urgent nature and £1 million for payment in respect of final accounts for capital works.</P>
    <P>We give priority to areas where there is agreed rationalisation, where there are stand-alone schools, where there is a need for a replacement or extension or where population projections are quite clear.  Rationalisation and cost-effectiveness are principal features of my policy on the provision of second level schools. My Department are committed to promoting and encouraging co-operation between educational interests.  The beneficial results accruing from these policies will be substantial.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the issue of rationalisation can cause apprehension but we have had many discussions and harmonious agreements have been reached in nine cases during the current year. It is my intention to continue with the <Col N="1054" /> consultative process to facilitate further developments in this area.</P>
    <P>A supplementary allocation of £568,000 is being provided for the cost of examinations.  The number of candidates was higher than expected &mdash; this year there was an increase of 5.6 per cent in the number of candidates for the leaving certificate examination.  There were increases in the number of centres, the number of superintendents and attendants and the cost of materials.  All of that led to the increase needed there.</P>
    <P>There is need for £1,000 by way of a Supplementary Estimate for third level and further education.</P>
    <P>An additional £3.090 million is being provided for grants in support of trainees on ESF-aided programmes other than the vocational preparation and training programme. This results from the expansion of the programme of courses eligible for ESF aid.  An additional £68,000 is provided for the grant in aid for general expenses of the HEA.  It is a transfer of funds.</P>
    <P>The additional amounts sought for grants-in-aid of institutions funded through the HEA is £1.655 million.  An additional £1 million is being provided for building grants and capital costs of regional and other technical and specialist colleges under vocational education committees, to meet contractual commitments.</P>
    <P>There are offsetting savings of £1.6 million as the amount required for recoupment to local authorities in respect of expenditure incurred by them in 1988 on higher education grants is less than expected.</P>
    <P>There will also be surplus appropriations-in-aid of £4.8 million as a result of the expansion of ESF-aided courses, particularly the introduction of two new programmes, the higher technical and business skills programme in the regional technical colleges and the advanced technical skills programme in the HEA institutions. Consequently, a token Supplementary Estimate only is required as the surplus receipts exceed the additional expenditure.</P>
    <P>We need £170,00 for office machinery <Col N="1055" /> and other office supplies for the further advance of the computerisation system. Computerisation is not just required for getting out results; it is also needed in order to collect the immense amount of data that will be required to enable us to plan satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>We need an additional £5 million for the school transport service.  The Government have been concerned at the high cost of providing this service and have sought to have it reduced, as did previous Governments.  Despite the additional moneys needed the school bus service continues to give a very high satisfaction rate.  The care with which large numbers of children are taken to school by the various contractors and subcontractors augurs well for the system.</P>
    <P>I wish I had more time and could speak more informally but the nature of the submission of Estimates to this House requires a Minister to speak more formally than he or she would wish to speak on other occasions.  The issues raised in this debate are worthy of more detailed debate than any of us would have the time for here this evening, but the contributions will point the way to further exploratory and developmental-type debates.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that we have been able to get the junior certificate off the ground with the goodwill of all the various parties involved in the school system.  The results so far are very pleasing. There are wide issues which still remain to be addressed in the whole system of second level education and I hope there will be further debates on those issues as time and occasion permits.</P>
    <P>Since we are referring mainly to second level education I would make a passing reference, particularly in view of something I heard on a radio programme the other day.  There is a view abroad that in the second level system there is only a five-year cycle available to pupils.  That is not so.  Across the broad range of the transition year, the repeat year and the provision of vocational and preparation training courses, now a great majority of all second level schools offer a six-year <Col N="1056" /> cycle in one shape or another in line with the programme for action in Government which proposed a diversity of choice rather than requiring every school to have a transition year or a vocational preparation and training course.  There is a range of options available to schools and many pupils are availing of these options. There are now options thanks to the European programmes and the matching moneys which the national Government provides for education.  There is a huge explosion of demand and the demand is being met in the VPTP schemes at various levels throughout the schools system.</P>
    <P>I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the House and in the five minutes which will be left at the end I will endeavour to answer many of the points which will arise.</P>

      <P>Was last year's Estimate for school transport a genuine one, or was it just a token cut put in for the optics, or are the Minister's advisers bad at arithmetic?  It is five months since I became my party's spokesman on education but what struck me most forcibly is the extent to which debate on education here is confined to a small group, those professionally involved in education. This is unhealthy.  Irish education will never prosper until it engages the interest of the broad mass of people.  Education should be the central issue in Irish politics. Indeed, it is one of the few things that Dáil Éireann still controls, but it is not one of the central issues of Irish politics.  My ambition, as spokesman for the main Opposition party, is to initiate a thorough audit of Irish education to <Col N="1057" /> establish a sound basis for future investment. This is something I would like to see done over the summer months, and I will return to it in a few weeks time.</P>
      <P>Educational debate here concerns itself almost exclusively with the quantity of the inputs and rarely ever with the quality of the output.  Do we ever ask why Ireland, for instance, came third last in a recent international study of attainment in science amongst 13 years olds? Why do we fare even worse than Britain in overall attainment in continental languages? Why do Irish young people make such excellent employees and so rarely become entrepreneurs when they go to work abroad?  Most importantly, why do so many leave school without any qualifications, condemned to joblessness for life?  We do not ask these questions because we do not collect the data which would prompt such questions.  This is something we complacently leave to others.  Such statistical information as we have is published incompletely and far too late.  The year 1992 is about competition and our educational system like other areas in our society will be in direct competition with the other European countries after 1992.</P>
      <P>Irish education needs more investment. It probably needs more tax to be paid to finance it, as borrowing is not an option, but it will not get the necessary investment from our people unless the general public as distinct from the in set in education are told and understand that the money is necessary to raise standards for all, especially the weak, in comparison with levels in other European countries.  If the money is actually spent as recommended it will achieve the stated results and there will be a method in place for monitoring the results to ensure that the extra resources bring about an improvement rather than simply absorb more cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education made a huge error when she reduced the basic second level education period to five years.  The cuts in primary education which she initiated were extremely shortsighted. She will make another mistake if she allows financial considerations to <Col N="1058" /> preserve an oppressive system of written examinations which will constrict the new junior certificate.  She was especially foolish in the discriminatory increases in the pupil-teacher ratio that she imposed in vocational schools.</P>
    <P>These are my beliefs but they are not things that I can prove because we do not have the necessary objective data on the comparative performance and the results of Irish education by reference to those achieved in other countries.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to arrange with our fellow EC Ministers to finance a comparative attainment study of the education systems of the 12 member states as between one another and as against other developed countries with whom we are in competition; to introduce a system of external examiners from other countries each year to examine the results of Irish education as displayed in the junior and leaving certificate examination results and publish an annual report showing where we are strong, where we are weak and where there are gaps in our system in comparison with those in other countries. Those involved in Irish education would have everything to gain and nothing to lose from the publication of such data.  It would strengthen the case for the informed and intelligent application of additional financial resources and would, above all, justify a major and continuing investment in in-service education of teachers, probably the most neglected of all aspects of Irish education.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to a related subject, the new junior certificate.  As the House knows, I favour awarding 10 to 15 per cent of the marks in the junior certificate on the basis of continuous assessment.  I am glad that this proposal of mine has elicited a lively discussion.  As a next step I will be inviting the teachers' unions and the parents to discuss the proposal with me.  I have already discussed it with one of the teacher unions and I propose to discuss it in greater detail with the others. I will then publish a detailed paper on the subject.</P>
    <P>There are five arguments I will be putting to those concerned on this matter: (1) The marking system for the new <Col N="1059" /> junior certificate is about to be introduced. If provision for assessment is not included at this stage there is a real danger that this opportunity will be lost for years to come.  We will not pass this particular crossroads again; (2) Sole reliance on written examination tends to narrow the curriculum and reward characteristics that are not the only useful ones in life.  Rote learning, not creativity and entrepreneurial flair, are what written examinations encourage; (3) A student can do poorly in written examinations due to illness or emotional disturbance. Assessment throughout the year would provide a method of compensating for this; (4) Teacher assessment procedures exist in virtually every country in the English speaking world already.  Employees in countries to which Irish students may emigrate are likely to expect teacher assessments to be included in the curriculum vitae.  In Australia, the whole trend is towards teacher assessment.  In Italy assessment is replacing written examinations in their junior certificate; and (5) Teachers are already informally assessing pupils as part of their normal class work.  There are problems.  Favouritism is one, but it can be overcome if there is a proper system of external moderation.  The relationships between teachers and students need not be adversely affected.  One is, after all, relying on people who have a well-established code of professionalism and professional ethics.</P>
    <P>There were a number of disturbing revelations about the state of education in Ireland in response to some written questions I put to the Minister in the Dáil recently: (1) Teachers in community schools have no contracts of employment. The Minister says they are supposed to teach between 21 and 23 hours a week but this is nowhere specified in a contract.  This lack of a contract makes the managerial role of community school principals extremely difficult.  Meanwhile 23 of the community schools are themselves operating without any legal basis because the deeds of trust have not been agreed; and (2) The Department of <Col N="1060" /> Education is breaking the law by its failure to publish its own annual report within three months at the end of each year.  Printing the report actually takes six months.  This is a direct breach of the Minister's statutory duty.</P>
    <P>In regard to the deeds of trust, it is very much of concern that the VEC seems to be holding this up.  I am particularly worried also that they are preventing new schools being provided in some areas because they are insisting on a comprehensive school rather than a community school.  A community school, is, of its nature, a compromise between a secondary school and a vocational school and it was designed as such.  I believe it is a fair compromise.  I believe that in the case of the town of Trim, which needs a new secondary school for boys, it is wrong that the VEC in Navan is holding that up because it will not agree to a community school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just two points to make in two minutes.  The first is &mdash; and I hope the Minister will take note of this &mdash; I am very worried about this Youthreach programme.  It sounds like a great idea to help early school leavers. However, they are being paid if they go on a Youthreach programme but not if they stay on at school.  What is happening? People who would otherwise stay at school are leaving to go on a Youthreach programme, which is supposed to prevent them from leaving school.  In many cases they would be better off staying at school, but the money attracts them.  I know that is not the intention of the Minister.  It has been said to me by a community school principal &mdash; and I can give the Minister the name afterwards if she wants it &mdash; that this is happening in his school; he is losing students who would be better off staying at school because they are going off on a Youthreach programme. That is an example of how the EC is distorting Irish education, by giving money for one thing and not for another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" /> We have a further example in the case of third level education where the EC is giving money to subsidise accountancy firms to put their trainees on courses in university because that is described as training.  The EC refuse to fund primary education and ordinary third level education but is funding the most exclusive and the least in need of subsidisation, namely, accountants.  That is another distortion introduced by the EC.  The sooner we change the Treaty of Rome and allow the EC to assist education as well as training the better for Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is bringing in a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is about the weakest defence.  We all knew they would stay running.  We also knew the Minister's figures were wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing I would like to clarify before I start.  I had some difficulty with the Supplementary Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Education, subhead B.2.  The original Estimate is shown as £26.194 million.  The additional sum required is shown as £5 million.  The revised Estimate is shown as £31.937 million.  There seems to be a discrepancy of £743,000.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Seanad in 1988 and again in 1989 I raised the question of school transport and said that this Supplementary Estimate would be necessary at the end of the year.  The Minister has told us £5 million is being provided.  That means there is a shortfall of £.8 million once again and that, after a £1.5 million shortfall in 1988, Bus Éireann has suffered losses to the tune of £2.3 million in the <Col N="1062" /> past two years in spite of the Supplementary Estimate.  Both the Minister for Education and the Minister of State were at great pains in the Seanad to talk about the excellent service Bus Éireann provides.  It is about time Bus Éireann was left alone.  There were efforts made in 1988 to introduce pilot projects which were not successful and the Minister withdrew them.  Next year Bus Éireann are left short another £1 million in the new Estimates so, taking into account the last three years, we are talking about a shortfall of £3.3 million, and the £1.5 million from 1988 is a debt that Bus Éireann is carrying.  Efforts have been made to find savings in Bus Éireann and I would suggest that the investigations by the Department have not come up with evidence that there is any fat on the Estimate. The Labour Party will be opposing this Estimate on the basis that Bus Éireann have been left short £1.5 million in 1988 and £0.8 million this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also providing for the junior certificate in these Supplementary Estimates, a fact we welcome.  With regard to the mathematics provision, I welcome the fact that there is a three level certification in intermediate certificate mathematics, or junior certificate mathematics as it will be now.  In the intermediate certificate mathematics there was a failure rate of something like 20-30 per cent, which I think we all agree is totally unacceptable.  For children who failed mathematics at the intermediate certificate to take pass mathematics in the leaving certificate is very difficult. The figures tell us that 10,000 pupils annually fail mathematics at leaving certificate level.  Take this against 7,000 pupils taking honours mathematics and we see there is something radically wrong here.  My suggestion is that a three level certification be introduced for leaving certificate mathematics to take cognisance of the fact that there are children who have been failing up to now with the three level certification.  The underachievers will be better catered for and will have certification from the junior certificate, but these children on the lowest certification, the lower achievers, <Col N="1063" /> must be provided for at leaving certificate level.  I ask the Minister to consider that very carefully.</P>
    <P>During the year the Minister introduced concessionary posts to national schools in disadvantaged areas, a very welcome development, and I compliment her on that.  The last time I checked the disadvantaged areas there were something like 160 throughout the country, most of them in Dublin and Cork.  Many schools in my locality, and schools in other areas, could be justifiably categorised as disadvantaged, and further resources could be provided for them.</P>
    <P>At Question Time some weeks ago I raised the matter of emotionally disturbed children in our schools.  I am glad the three pilot projects are going ahead, and again, the Minister is to be complimented on that.</P>
    <P>Indicative of our thinking <i>vis-á-vis</i> education is that there is now a Supplementary Estimate for first level.  There is a great need to provide more resources at first level.  If many of the problems that arise at first level are not dealt with at that stage the children will go on to become problems at second level and will never properly get their lives organised and become useful, productive people in society.  These children can be dealt with if more resources are provided at first level.  There are discipline problems there stemming from the fact that there is no real sanction that teachers in the classroom, the principal in a school or the board of management, can use.  This must be tackled quickly and effectively.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this problem is the growing number of the children I have termed to be emotionally disturbed. Remedial education deals with children who have problems with learning that can be rectified if they are given special care and attention, but emotionally disturbed children very often are quite intelligent. Their problems may stem from disturbance in the home.  Because of health cutbacks school psychological assessments in various rural areas have been very much reduced.  Even if the assessment is done, there is nowhere in the <Col N="1064" /> system these children can be referred to and dealt with.  The concessionary posts have gone some part of the road to solving these problems.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education must provide their own psychological assessment. This would be a worthwhile investment which at the end of the day would assist quite a number of children to escape the poverty trap, something everybody on every side of this House would favour.</P>
    <P>An area that causes me great concern is that children in many areas, Waterford being one of them, are disadvantaged in terms of obtaining third level education. A child in Waterford city or county has half the chance of a child in Cork city or county of obtaining a degree.  The Clancy report dealt with the various socio-economic groups in terms of access to education. Many children are excluded from third level education because of their parents' means or circumstances at home and a large number are disadvantaged in terms of access because of their geographical location.  The Minister should look urgently at the provision of more degree courses through regional colleges or possibly some agency through the VECs to provide these courses.</P>
    <P>I have said on many occasions that the income limits relative to scholarships and grants for third level education are way too low.  When we take the tax régime into consideration we can take a step forward if we can provide that these income limits relate to nett rather than gross income.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister will be seen as the Minister for Education who in the eighties destroyed the dream of the sixties &mdash; that is, the dream of fair education, more equal education, free education &mdash; by the cutbacks.  Everybody says the cutbacks were necessary, but I do not think the Minister fought enough for her Department at Cabinet and with the Minister for Finance because the cuts in education were far too severe.  The economy now sees the advantage there would have been had cuts in the education area been fewer from the point of view of developing the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cuts in the eighties created a more unequal school system approaching something like the health system.  Now we nearly have a two tier school system. The Minister should now be pressing at Cabinet level to eliminate the dreadful cuts in the free education system and to restore free education.  Deputy O'Shea mentioned the Clancy report which showed that in the third level area education is increasingly dominated by the well off.  The report indicates, for instance, that Dublin is very severely disadvantaged in this way in the third level area.  Only 20 per cent of Dublin school leavers go on to college as compared with 35 per cent in many other counties. Strangely enough, the income limit Deputy O'Shea referred to does not seem to worry people on the higher incomes. Dublin was also the county with the highest proportion of students with no funding at all &mdash; 62 per cent of students from Dublin had no funding at third level. In other counties only 30 per cent to 35 <Col N="1066" /> per cent had no funding.  Of all Roscommon children, 80 per cent were funded.</P>
    <P>A survey was done two or three years ago in UCD which showed that 564 sons and daughters of farmers were in receipt of grants at the college, that 160 grant holders at the college had parents in the higher professional category and 231 students came from families in the employer-manager category.  All those children had grants at college but only 37 offspring of unskilled workers and 72 children of semi-skilled workers at the college were in receipt of grants.  This is extraordinary given the low income limit required to qualify for grants.  How do these people fool others into believing they are entitled to grants?  They obviously lie and cheat to get their children into college with grants while those who are entitled to such grants are not getting them.</P>
    <P>The problem begins at primary and second level because this is where the inequality is built in.  What happens at third level and in relation to jobs is decided more and more by the ability of schools to raise funds locally or directly from parents.  Adult and second chance education has taken an enormous knock. This has been of great importance as the number of unemployed has increased. The recent Aontas report showed a 40 per cent fee increase and a 60 per cent fall in enrolments since 1967 due to the cuts.  Their report was entitled <i>Steady as She Sinks &mdash; The Decline of Adult Education in Ireland.</i></P>
    <P>The Minister needs to rescue education from being an instrument which reproduces class inequalities.  There must be a commitment to building genuinely free education, towards which we were progressing during the sixties and seventies until we met the cutbacks of the eighties. Free education is costing more and more every day.  The Workers' Party have produced a booklet which shows that £200 would be a moderate estimate of the outlay required by a family with three children at school to cover the cost of books, clothing, uniforms, etc., not counting the so-called voluntary contributions which are asked from parents and <Col N="1067" /> charges for essential items like art and craft materials.</P>
    <P>Class divisions are emphasised at school.  Some schools are impoverished; they have nothing while other schools have fantastic equipment.  Areas of disadvantage are talked about as if disadvantage was something which just happened, like an earthquarke.  Disadvantage is something which has been imposed.  We should be talking about areas of oppression because they are being made more and more oppressed and disadvantaged through the system of education.  Every day there is further disadvantage.  It starts at primary level where the remedial teachers and the psychological service required are not available.  The disadvantage really shows up at second level; it is there we begin to see drop outs.  The need for remedial teaching and for a school psychological service is apparent if the career prospects of students are to be improved.  They have a very low level of confidence and a low level of anticipation of getting jobs.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made enormous cutbacks at second level.  I agree with Deputy Bruton regarding the dreadful increase in the pupil teacher ratio at vocational school level.  It is outrageous. The vocational sector get more pupils from disadvantaged areas and they also offer a very much higher proportion of practical classes which require a lower level of pupils per teacher.  The Minister should restore the position there.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in her speech to the planning criteria for the school building programme.  These criteria have all sorts of interpretations.  Generally speaking, there is a demographic change which indicates that fewer schools may be required and some children can change to existing schools.  In Clondalkin in my constitutency there is an increase in the building of private houses and the area is expanding very rapidly.  The second level school in the area, St. Kevin's Community College, is without a school building, although it was promised.  The numbers are increasing at the rate of 100 pupils per year.  This year they are to <Col N="1068" /> lose space rather than gain it in the old vocational school in Lucan which was abandoned by the VEC.  They are bussed there every day from Clondalkin and have to stay there all day without even a play area.  The Minister should reconsider the criteria for school building.  This school will have 800 or 900 pupils in three years time.  If the Minister were to decide now to build a school it would be three years before its completion.  I would ask the Minister to look at this disadvantaged area and other such areas.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Disadvantaged&rdquo; is the &ldquo;in&rdquo; word in national plans but instead of support being provided by the Government disadvantaged areas are daily becoming more disadvantaged.  Only the educational system can make them free and give people freedom of expression, freedom of movement, freedom to do what they wish in life.  They do not have any of those freedoms.  We might as well build walls around them since they do not have freedom or movement or freedom to express themselves in speech or writing because they have not the education.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at second level educational requirements in rapidly growing areas.  These areas should be looked at separately because the Department are making general demographic decisions for the whole country which are not relevant to these new areas in Dublin.</P>

      <P>Five minutes is a very brief time in which to deal with the many points raised.  I wish to thank the three party spokespersons, Deputy J. Bruton, Deputy O'Shea and Deputy Mac Giolla, for their contributions.  It would be quite impossible to reply to all the points but I will try to cover as many as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton spoke of the need for data.  I am addressing that matter within the computerisation programme.  He also raised a question on school buses, I am afraid I got my sums wrong but I got the number of buses right.  The Deputy asked about reducing the five year second level cycle, but I had dealt with that in my speech.  He referred to the need to focus on primary education and I agree with <Col N="1069" /> him on that.  He also asked that I speak to the EC Ministers about carrying out a comparative study of educational outputs among the Twelve.  He also expressed the need for assessment at the junior certificate level, and I note from the Order Paper we will be returning to that subject again.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy's suggestion on the need for in-service education and we have made provision for a very great increase in the amount of money for that. Deputy Bruton cavilled at EC funding for particular types of third level education. The funding of VEC third level colleges is enormous and is of great benefit to young people.  The Deputy spoke about the lure of Youthreach payments to young people, inducing them to drop out of school.  The criteria to participate in Youthreach are very strict.  The person has to have no formal qualification at any level, throughout second level, and they must have dropped out for a considerable period of time before they are taken on by the agency.  I will bear in mind what the Deputy has said; he has promised to give me an address.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Shea raised the discrepancy in school transport.  I have to admit I got the sums wrong but the number of buses right.  He has asked for an account of the £7.48 million and I will get back to him on that matter.  The Deputy welcomed the junior certificate, but he pointed out the need for three levels of mathematics at leaving certificate because there are three levels available at the junior certificate level.  I will look at this suggestion and bring it to the attention of the NCCA.  The provision of an additional 130 teachers over and above the norm for disadvantaged areas is a small step forward and I am glad the Deputy welcomes it.  He commended the start-up of the school psychological service.  This has been mooted for over 15 years and seven different Ministers tried unsuccessfully to get it off the <Col N="1070" /> ground.  I cannot believe I have it up and running, but I am glad &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If Deputies knew the barriers that had to be overcome; they were practically insurmountable but we managed it.  The Deputy asked that more resources be given to first level education and mentioned the growing problem of discipline.  He asked for more degree courses for the RTCs.  I am sure he was not only referring to the RTC in his own constituency of Waterford but to other RTCs as well.  I can say the review will attend to this.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla raised the cuts in education and the apparent inequities in the system of third level grants.  The Deputy referred to categories of persons who were in receipt of third level grants and wondered how that came about. Grants were paid on the relevant accounts which they submitted to the borough council, county council, or VEC and certainly a large mark hangs over many of those.  I hope that the review will look at this matter also.</P>
      <P>The Deputy said that inequality begins at primary level and is carried on into second level.  We have made a massive increase in the provision for school books, a 20 per cent increase last year and 20 per cent for the coming year. However, I have to say that it is never going to be enough.  You could forever put money into education but you would be short forever.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mc Giolla made a strong case in the House for St. Kevin's, Clondalkin. I also note he sent in a submission to my Department yesterday, which I have received.  I will be addressing this very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy said inequalities were reflected in the participation at third level education.  However, it is useful for us all to know that 96 per cent of all students attending VEC third level colleges have their fees paid and, to a varying degree depending on how far away they live from the college, they are in receipt of some <Col N="1071" /> maintenance payments.  In fact, there is a great opportunity for all students to have access to these colleges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan) Seamus Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1989, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Tourism and Transport, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants and grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to provide an additional £3 million for tourism marketing and promotion.  The additional expenditure will be totally offset by increased receipts under appropriations-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is both logical and sensible to make this additional money available for marketing and promotion at this time when potential visitors are making their holiday plans for 1990.  Agreement has been reached between Bord Fáilte and the industry on a joint marketing campaign before the end of 1989 and for the early part of 1990.  The campaign will thus help <Col N="1075" /> to ensure maximum exposure for Ireland at a crucial time.  I am confident that this will give a significant boost to the drive to attract additional visitors and foreign tourism revenue which is vital to sustaining and creating employment in the tourism sector.</P>
    <P>The £3 million will be met, pound for pound, by the tourist industry.  I greatly welcome the fact that, in recent years, the industry have agreed to supplement Exchequer moneys for promotional purposes. I propose to continue this method of financing.</P>
    <P>A similar initiative was taken last year and the effect on our 1989 tourist numbers has been dramatic.  Based on market estimates for the first three quarters of 1989 and market intelligence since then, Bord Fáilte estimate that visitor numbers this year will be in the region of 2.8 million, a 15 per cent increase over 1988. When compared to 1986 this shows a 48 per cent increase or over 900,000 visitors.</P>
    <P>Marketing by both Bord Fáilte and the industry has taken on a new sense of direction and purpose over the past three years.  The marketing initiatives introduced by the Government have resulted in a positive awareness among the industry of the need for increased active participation on their part in the marketing effort.  This approach must be continued in the future in order to build on the excellent work of the past few years.</P>
    <P>The success of our marketing strategy over the past three years, emphasising the joint involvement of the State agencies and the industry as well as the increased concentration on market segmentation, has prompted me to consider how the strategy can be maximised in the longer term.</P>
    <P>I have very recently invited the industry to sit down immediately with Bord Fáilte with a view to devising a marketing and promotional programme for the three-year period 1991 to 1993.  I have asked that the joint programme should include detailed costings, setting out what would be financed by the State and what would be financed by the industry itself.  I have committed myself to fighting <Col N="1076" /> for the necessary resources should a satisfactory joint programme emerge.  My invitation has been taken up.  I understand that negotiations between Bord Fáilte and the industry are already under way.</P>
    <P>These are indeed exciting times for Irish tourism.  There is an unprecedented aura of optimism and confidence about the future of the sector.  The increased level of investment in the tourism product and in marketing, allied to lower access transport fares and our improved cost competitiveness, will facilitate further significant growth for Irish tourism in the run up to 1992 and beyond and should achieve a substantial increase in sustainable employment opportunities for our young population.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> set challenging growth targets for the tourism sector, including the creation of 25,000 new jobs.  Now approximately halfway through that programme, the industry is on course for meeting those targets which seemed over-ambitious to many at the time of its initiation.  We are on target not just in the jobs area but also on revenue and tourist numbers.  Therefore, we are on target under all three headings.</P>
    <P>However, we must not become complacent. I should inform the House that in the nineties it will be difficult to continue to meet the targets set.  I am still confident we can do so but it is becoming increasingly difficult.  We must examine our marketing approach to establish whether we are reaching all potential visitors. We must also examine the level of investment in the development of tourist attractions and facilities, particularly those based on our natural, cultural and heritage resources.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, tourism has been selected by the Government as a central axis for development under the <i>National Development Plan, 1989-1993</i> and will be a major beneficiary from increased EC Structural Funds over that period.  The plan provides for an investment programme of almost £300 million by the public and private sectors in a wide range of existing and new tourism <Col N="1077" /> attractions and facilities.  EC Structural Fund assistance for the tourism programme will total more than £146 million over the five years, that is, £52 million on infrastructural project by State and local authorities, £28 million on training and £66 million to support private sector product development and marketing.  I expect to be in a position shortly to announce full details of this programme including the nature of the projects which will be assisted and the levels of anticipated grant support.  I should inform the House that that figure of £300 million is but part of the picture.  For example, if one takes account of the EC Structural Funds &mdash; the estimated private sector investment they would induce &mdash; Bord Fáilte's own budget, particularly the increasing business expansion scheme budget now constituting a major mechanism for investment in the tourist industry, if one includes the industry itself, estimating the potential investment in their industry over the next few years and the Investment Fund for Ireland, one arrives at a figure of up to a £900 million investment in the tourist industry over the next four to five years.  If I can put that figure in perspective &mdash; as I have endeavoured to do publicly many times recently &mdash; I might point out that arguably that represents more than has been invested in the industry over the past 20 years taken together.  Therefore, when I say we are on the brink of a major investment in the tourist industry I do not exaggerate because the figures are there to demonstrate that fact.</P>
    <P>The additional £3 million being provided for tourism is available due to buoyancy in revenue from aviation sources. As the House will appreciate, this is a transfer within the Vote rather than additional funding which I am seeking in this Estimate.  The growth in air traffic in Ireland and world wide has produced a surplus for Ireland in receipts from en-route charges.</P>
    <P>Restrictions on air traffic, due to inadequate system capacity because of unprecedented traffic growth, have recently been a regrettable feature of air travel.  I would stress however that most of the <Col N="1078" /> restrictions as they affected travel to and from Ireland were due to capacity problems elsewhere.  As Deputies are aware, we are in the middle of a £30 million investment programme to upgrade and replace the air navigation facilities.  We are also strengthening our manpower resources; 27 extra staff were recruited to the air traffic services in 1989 and further recruitment is planned over the next four to five years.  Indeed I would like to take this opportunity of thanking the staff concerned for their dedication and commitment in recent years.  Again I would reiterate an announcement which I made publicly in the last few days, that in regard to Ireland's Presidency of the EC, I have already put the whole question of air traffic control on the agenda of the Transport Ministers and one of the first items I will be discussing with them is the whole question of air traffic control.</P>
    <P>The additional funds under subhead A7 are required to meet the increased contribution to the Eurocontrol Organisation which have been given the task of establishing a central flow management unit.  Work on setting up the unit has commenced and it will greatly facilitate the smooth and orderly movement of air traffic in western Europe when fully operational in a few years' time.  It will make a significant contribution towards completion of the internal market.  I would also remind the House that in the past few days £15 million of equipment has been commissioned in Dublin Airport in the area of radar and other equipment relating to air traffic control which will greatly improve the position in the air.</P>
    <P>The completion of the internal market also creates a challenge for Ireland in moving goods in a cost-effective way and expeditiously into the continental markets. Deputies might like to know that I have decided to commission a major feasibility study on the development of air and sea freight links between Ireland and the rest of the Community.  This study which will be carried out with financial assistance from the EC, will help identify the new and expanded services that are necessary and how the needs of our exporters can be best met.  I have <Col N="1079" /> placed that assignment in recent days. In the course of these remarks I have focused on the main aspects of the Supplementary Estimate.  I will of course be addressing policy issues in a broader perspecitive when the 1990 Estimate for my Department is being taken in the New Year.  I will conclude by commending the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I would like to say about this report is that it makes a nonsense of any planning or alleged planning in the whole tourism industry for the Minister for Tourism and Transport to announce yesterday that £2 million is being returned by Bord Fáilte and today come into this House to seek to give them £3 million to top up the funds they have.  The Minister said there will be a plan from 1991 onwards and that next year might be &ldquo;becoming increasingly difficult&rdquo;.  There is no plan for 1990 in this book and, from what we heard yesterday, there is no plan for 1989 either.  Today's editorial in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> states that whatever explanations are offered, it is difficult to understand how £2 million in Government funds, intended for the tourist industry this year, was never spent.  I echo that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that the £2 million was returned because there was confusion as to when it could be spent.  The tourist board and the industry understood the money was secured for the autumn of this year and the spring of next year and it is only in the last few days that it has emerged that it should have been spent by the end of this year.  What sort of planning is going on in the Department of Tourism and Transport when there is £2 million worth of confusion and the Minister then <Col N="1080" /> comes in here with a Supplementary Estimate for £3 million which he has taken from other State agencies?  How could you place confidence in any sort of planning within the tourism sector with that sort of nonsense going on?  It is extremely difficult to understand.  The Minister should explain to this House why that confusion arose and how £2 million can be left lying around because of confusion. Is it any wonder there are doubts about how the industry might develop next year?  The Minister should explain that to the House.  It is true, as has been said by people within the tourism industry, that ad hocery seems to be the order of the day in the Department of Tourism and Transport when it comes to planning for proper spending of money.  The return of £2 million yesterday and the introduction of the Supplementary Estimate here this evening clearly indicates that that is the case.</P>
    <P>I have a very short period of time available to me and I want to use it as best I can.  In the Minister's speech he said that a 15 per cent increase in tourists to this country will be experienced this year over 1988 and that, when compared to 1986, this shows a 48 per cent increase or over 900,000 visitors.  I dispute those statistics. I would like to know how they are calculated. Is it true that the compilation of tourism statistics is under review?  The reason I ask this is that if a poor unfortunate person who has to emigrate to London or somewhere else has the good fortune to be able to return home three or four times a year, it is shown as four visitors.  That person is not a tourist.  How many of these people are beneficial to the tourism industry?  For instance, how many of them stay in hotels?  What is the increase in the hotel bed occupancy? How many cars were hired out?  Most of these people come back here and stay with family or friends.  I dispute these statistics.  The Minister should tell the House if a review is being carried out of the way tourism statistics are compiled.</P>
    <P>There has been some success in recent times in building up again the number of tourists coming to this country from Britain but it has not been helped by <Col N="1081" /> the gutter journalism we have had to withstand from some of the tabloid newspapers printed and published in Great Britain.  To be fair, most of the media in Great Britain give fair coverage.  An editorial in today's <i>Daily Express</i> states that Fine Gael, in and out of Government, have a solid tradition of opposing Provo violence and they say that they have also.  Since when have the <i>Daily Express</i> got a great record of opposing Provos?  Are they not the people who have been the recruiting agents for the Provos?  Are they not the people who have caused most trouble for us in fighting off the Provos?  Are they not the people who have done most damage for this country, when those of us who have tried to deal with the Provos and the terrible problems facing this country have had our backs to the wall, with their editorials and their front page anti-Irish racist outbursts time and time again? They have made it difficult for tourists coming to this country from Britain, which in turn has made it difficult for us to find the money to spend on security to deal with the Provos.  Secondly, they have made it difficult for the Irish community living in Britain, most of whom are tourists communiting back here from time to time.</P>
    <P>If the <i>Daily Express</i> and journalists writing for those gutter type newspapers want to do something for this country they can do so by getting off our backs and allowing us to get on with our affairs. They should stop running the sort of front page stories they have been running purely for profit motives to the benefit of a murderous and extortionist gang, the IRA, and the owners of the <i>Daily Express</i>.  Nobody else has benefited from the garbage which has been printed by some of these tabloids.  As James Dillon said: what can you expect from a sewer but sewage?  It is time the British media started to look at their standards and what they have been doing to this country by the stories some of their newspapers have been running.  I understand that recently they got together to set a standard on the invasion of privacy.  Perhaps it is time they were called together and <Col N="1082" /> asked to set a standard on the racism which is being printed by some newspapers. Is it any wonder the Guildford Four and other groups could not get a fair trial when the media who report these events are not fair?  We can hardly expect fair reporting from some of these tabloids.</P>
    <P>This is my ninth year as a Member of this House and for most of that period I have avoided saying anything about Northern Ireland or Northern Ireland affairs, but from the point of view of tourism much damage has been done to our country because of the reports which have been carried in those tabloids.  This has not been helped by some of the suggestions made by the present occupant of No. 10 Downing Street.  It is time all this stopped.  My party, in and out of Government, have taken a very strong stand on the IRA and we deserve the support of all people in our fight against the IRA.  Nobody should be allowed to make out that this country is in any way an unsafe place for heads of Government or State to visit.  This matter should be pursued immediately.  I await the outcome of the examination carried out by the Director of Public Prosecutions into the matter before I pursue it in another way, if I have to.  I reject any suggestion in the editorial that either I or any member of my party has anything in common with the <i>Daily Express</i> in opposing Provo violence.</P>
    <P>The sum of £13,000 being provided in this Supplementary Estimate for regional airports would not buy stationery, and I do not believe it is of any significance. The Minister made a big deal about touring the regional airports.  I did a tour of the regional airports and had a look at their facilities.  I am very proud of the developments which have taken place and are taking place.  A sum of £13,000 is paltry and the Minister should provide a reasonable sum so that those regional airports can be made safe and secure.  He should also be assisting them to develop the best way they can.  I do not think £13,000 distributed between regional airports will buy anything other than stationery.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1083" /> There are many other points I should like to make but I shall wait for a longer debate later.  With the permission of the House I want to give the remainder of my time to Deputy Reynolds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very difficult to understand why the Minister allowed £2 million to be returned to the Exchequer.  We have heard about the development of our tourism industry, and the people in this industry need as much funding as they can get.  I want to refer to one area where I believe the Minister could spend this money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope he is aware of the discrimination which exists against small family businesses in the tourist industry.  No grant aid is available for people who own hotels with fewer than 45 bedrooms and who wish to provide leisure facilities.  This is a very unfair and unjust system.  If a person wants to get grant aid to provide leisure facilities, he has to have more than 45 bedrooms in his hotel.  There are only 122 hotels with more than 45 bedrooms, while 428 of the hotels registered with the Hotel Federation have fewer than 45 bedrooms.  This leaves much to be desired when grant aid is being given to a minority rather than the majority.  The Minister should consider changing the system to cover everybody involved in tourism.  Not alone do we want to get the big hotels involved, but we also want to get family businesses involved.  Family businesses can create employment and make good returns to the Exchequer.  I hope the Minister will consider changing the present system. The International Fund for Ireland has been working well in the Border area from which I come and grant aid is given for leisure facilities.  This scheme has proved very successful.  Many small hotels have availed of this funding and are able to promote the leisure facilities they provide in their hotels.  Small hotels should have the same facilities as larger hotels so that they can get an extra share <Col N="1084" /> of the tourism market.  The present system is very discriminatory.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the rod licence. I do not intend to go off course but a number of people promoting this industry do not know where they stand at present. I know the Minister does not have responsibility for this area but I would ask him to help to bring about a solution to this problem.  It is creating difficulties for the people involved because they do not know what to say in the brochures they send to Britain and elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that less than an hour is being devoted to discussing this very important industry.  This debate is much too restrictive and I am sure half the Deputies in the House have an interest in this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be opposing this Supplementary Estimate.  This industry has potential to create wealth and jobs for this country. I believe there are three fundamental guidelines for a successful tourism industry &mdash; aggressive, intensive, marketing and promotion of the excellent product we are very lucky to have; good standards and competitive prices for both air and sea transport into Ireland and, most importantly, value for money should be given by all sectors in the industry.  If any one of those three factors is missing, it will militate against the aspirations and targets the Minister has set out tonight. We should have regard to the fact that £1 invested in tourism promotion brings a far greater return to the economy than £1 invested in any other sector of the economy.  We have to seek out the markets which will give the best return &mdash; for example, the British market, the traditional market, has been the most successful and profitable for the Irish tourist industry down the years.  Unfortunately the troubles in the North caused a reduction in that market which is now only being gradually won back.  The Minister and everybody else concerned with the industry will accept that the tourist <Col N="1085" /> industry is very sensitive and that one single act of violence, one kidnapping or one hijacking can totally distort the anticipated number of tourists who will come to this country and, as happened in the past, will do very considerable damage to the financial interests of our tourist industry.</P>
    <P>There is immense potential in Germany. At present we attract in the region of 100,000 tourists from that country but I do not see any reason we should not set a target of 250,000 people.  Germans who visit this country are very satisfied with the activity holidays we have in such abundance.  They are keen on boating, fishing, horse riding and mountaineering. I should like to impress on the Minister the importance of penetrating the German market because it is from such countries that we will get the best monetary results.</P>
    <P>There is no reason we should not develop the French market, and we could make a start in that direction by improving the air service between the two countries and reducing air fares to a reasonable rate.  For years we have looked on the US market as the backbone of our tourist industry because of the number of high spending Americans who visited this country, but that is not the case any more.  The US market has proved disappointing.  A country with 42 million ethnic Irish if properly marketed should be capable of returning to the homeland many more people for annual visits.  It is important to bear in mind that between seven million and eight million Americans visit Britain each year.  I accept that Ireland is not a primary tourist resort like Britain but we have many facilities to offer tourists, particularly those who have roots here.</P>
    <P>I am opposing the Estimate because our marketing and promoting services are inadequately financed and inadequately personalised.  I should like to congratulate Bord Fáilte on a job well done with limited finance and manpower. They are in a position to highlight the many pluses as far as Ireland is concerned but they must deal also with the many minuses.  Those involved in the tourist <Col N="1086" /> industry are familiar with the criticisms of the high cost of petrol, the high cost of car hire and the high cost of drink. The Minister must adopt an aggressive attitude at the Cabinet table and seek additional finance for the industry.  He must point out the scope that exists to create employment in that industry and its ability to earn foreign currency.  We must do something about the price of petrol which is so much dearer than in other countries.  Many people fill their tanks before they board car ferries for Ireland.  That high cost is doing great damage to the tourist industry.  The reduction in revenue to the Exchequer arising from a substantial reduction in the price of petrol would be offset by the return from an increase in consumption.</P>
    <P>When I had responsibility in the Minister's Department I heard arguments for a reduction in the VAT on accommodation and food from 23 per cent to 10 per cent.  The argument was that that reduction would have to be made if the industry was to survive.  The Government at the time acceded to that request but there was no loss of revenue to the Exchequer.  The Minister should take into consideration those pertinent factors.  Much of the accommodation is not up to the standard that will be required by tourists in the nineties.  The absence of accommodation grants is a vital defect in the efforts being made to prepare for the nineties.  The provision of good accommodation and wholesome food are the two greatest factors in giving satisfaction to our tourists.  We have a friendly people, a wonderful environment and unpolluted waters, but if our standard of accommodation does not meet the anticipated growth in numbers we will fall down and we will have more complaints.  It is unfortunate that many of our complaints relate to the high cost of petrol, of car hire and of drink.</P>

      <P>Although the details of this Estimate are fairly non-controversial The Workers' Party, like the Labour Party, will be opposing it, as this is the first opportunity we have had to register in the House our disapproval of the Minister's <Col N="1087" /> disgraceful decision to rob Aer Lingus of three profitable air routes and hand them over to the privately owned Ryanair.  We will be opposing it also to protest at the Government's failure to provide an adequate public transport system in our urban areas, especially in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Part of this Estimate relates to additional money for regional and local airport development.  We welcome the development of a network of regional airports over recent years, but we deplore the decision of the Minister in September last not just to order Aer Lingus to get off several profitable international routes and hand them over to Ryanair, but also to grant Ryanair exclusive rights for all direct services between Irish regional airports and the UK and continental Europe.  The Minister is a great advocate of free competition, but as a result of his decision Ryanair will have no competition on any of these routes.  How can this be considered to be in the interests of Irish tourism?</P>
      <P>The fact is that these moves are an indication of the growing pro-enterprise bias of Fianna Fáil which has become even more pronounced since the party entered coalition with the Progressive Democrats.  What other explanation can there be for giving such favourable treatment to a company, the main shareholder of which stands to make up to $20 million tax free this year from his other interests in Guinness Peat Aviation?</P>
      <P>The Government have constantly called on the State companies to become more efficient in the marketplace, but the Government's decision on the air routes will clearly inhibit this.  Such an attitude to Ireland's national airline could pose a threat to its viability in the EC open market after 1992, and if not reversed could damage the morale of management and staff in this vital State company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer also to the shameful attempt by the Minister to wash his hands of all political responsibility for the fine of almost $1 million imposed by US <Col N="1088" /> courts on Aer Lingus, allegedly for supplying aircraft parts to Iran.  Can the Minister tell us did he raise with the US authorities in any way this victimisation of the Irish national airline?  Many other airlines were involved in supplying similar equipment to Iran Air but court action was taken against Aer Lingus only.  In addition, whatever technical breaches of US law may have been involved when a subsidiary of Aer Lingus supplied nonmilitary equipment to Iran, they were very minor compared to the actions of the US Government, which was involved in secretly supplying missiles and other lethal weapons to the same country.</P>
    <P>What is even worse is that a number of those involved in the supply of US weapons to Iran, including President Reagan's National Security Advisor, travelled to Tehran using forged Irish passports.  The US Government never provided any explanation for this illegal act, or took any action against those involved.  In the light of the fine imposed on Aer Lingus the Government should now insist that action is taken against those involved in the illegal use of Irish passports.</P>
    <P>There is no questioning the potential of Irish tourism to create jobs and earn wealth for this country.  Neither can it be disputed that, despite the progress made in recent years, much more remains to be done before its full potential is realised.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte is not without fault but neither can it be denied that it has been the powerhouse of tourism and without it we would have made considerably less progress.  I am concerned at what appears to be a move away from strong central planning in tourism and an increasing tendency to leave it to the private sector. European Community money applied for under the Government's national development plan is dependent on it being matched by private sector moneys. Given that only yesterday it emerged that £2 million of the £5 million grant to this industry for this year has been returned unspent, this policy does not give any great grounds for optimism.</P>
    <P>The practice of asking private investment to match Government investment <Col N="1089" /> effectively precludes local authorities, who could and should be playing a major role, from getting involved.  Most of the local authorities do not have the money to even tar roads and they can hardly be expected to come up with money to match private enterprise, yet it is the local authorities who are often ideally suited and placed to determine what is required in the tourism area.  Dublin City Council are only too well aware of the tourism potential of the medieval city, yet we have no role to play on the tourism front.</P>
    <P>In addition, many parts of this country outside of the established tourist areas have considerable tourism potential, yet there must be a fear that private funds will go mainly or largely to the established areas where it may not be urgently needed.  I would like to see the Government provide a special financial allocation to local authorities to allow them play a far greater role.  For many people coming to Ireland the country's attractions are its relatively unspoilt nature, its lakes, wide open spaces, relatively clean air and uncrowded countryside.  As far as these advantages are concerned, we are simply living on borrowed time, unless we get our act together on the environment. Environmental disasters, such as the continuing smog problem in Dublin, and the increasing destruction of our rivers do not go unnoticed by tourists and can do incredible damage to the attractiveness of Ireland as a tourist destination.</P>
    <P>There is a fine balance to be struck between the demand for development and the need for conservation.  We have to ensure that the sort of development that takes place will add to the attraction of Ireland as a tourist destination and not detract from it.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to refer to the disastrous traffic conditions in Dublin.  It is no exaggeration to say that traffic is currently choking the city to death, largely because of the failure of the Government to promote public transport in the city and because of the preferential treatment being given to private transport. The fact is the introduction of one-person buses has been a disaster for most people who depend on public transport.  It has <Col N="1090" /> led to increased journey times and delays at bus stops which have led in turn to further traffic problems.  The success of the DART shows what can be achieved with imagination and when money is spent on public transport.</P>
    <P>We welcome the belated decision to provide a commuter rail service to Clondalkin but it is deplorable that the Government have refused to extend it to Tallaght where 80,000 people live.  This is all the more reprehensible given the fact that the Government refused to avail of EC structural funding to provide Tallaght with a rapid rail transport system. Unless we get more cars off the road and more people to use public transport the quality of life in this city will continue to deteriorate.  The way to do this is to give people an efficient and economic public transport system.</P>

      <P>As I only have five minutes in which to reply, unfortunately, I will not be able to go into great detail on many of the points raised.  As Deputy Mitchell said, we can do so when we discuss the Estimates in the new year.  I will touch on them briefly.</P>
      <P>In relation to the £2 million which has been returned, I want to make it clear that in the autumn I agreed to provide £5 million for a special marketing programme, to top up their existing moneys. This does not form part of Bord Fáilte's ordinary day-to-day expenditure.  There is no question of normal funds having been returned.  It is a special marketing campaign&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a special fund of £5 million which I made available on the clear understanding that the industry would match it, pound for pound.  I told <Col N="1091" /> the industry that I would let them have £5 million if they would match it.  Unfortunately, in the short time available &mdash; I do not believe this was the fault of the industry or indeed of Bord Fáilte or anybody else &mdash; it was not possible to arrange for all of it to be matched by the industry. I was not prepared to break the agreement I had entered into.  In any case, as the Deputy is well aware, the Government's accounting year ends at the end of December.  Unspent funds at that point have to be returned.  That is all that is involved here.  The industry and Bord Fáilte were not in a position to match the additional £2 million.</P>
      <P>Let me say at this point that in order to make up for this I have already told the industry that I intend seeking some of these funds again next year but this time earlier in the year to ensure there will be no overall loss, taking two years together.  I will have to talk to the industry about this to see if this can be arranged. I would not like the impression to go out that Bord Fáilte could not spend this money.  They could spend a lot more money, just like any other agency, if it was available to them.  Unfortunately, as this was a specialised marketing campaign, it was not found possible to arrange matching funds from the industry in time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell asked how the statistics were compiled.  The figures I have given were supplied by the Central Statistics Office.  The source of visitors is obtained by carrying out surveys.  I have asked that the way these figures are compiled be reviewed, as like everyone else I wish to find out if certain people are excluded or included and what is a tourist. This is the reason I told the industry recently that I do not want to rely on numbers.  The Deputy may have heard me make those comments.  I do not want to rely on numbers alone, I also want revenue and job figures.  We are now beginning to get those and these will give us a much broader picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the figure of £13,000 for regional airports, I could explain it if I had time but it is a technical matter.  It <Col N="1092" /> is not that we are spending £13,000 on regional airports this year but rather it has been included for technical purposes. EC structural funding, which I will be announcing immediately after Christmas, will amount to many millions of pounds for regional airports over the next four years.  The Deputy can rest assured that the figure runs into many millions and is not £13,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds raised the question of refunds but I have already answered that question.  I take the Deputy's point in relation to accommodation grants but I should say to him that there is excess bedroom capacity already.  Therefore we do not propose to grant-aid accommodation because of over capacity.</P>
    <P>I also take Deputy Moynihan's point on the potential of the German and United States markets.  I am sure that they are concentrating on those markets but I will direct Bord Fáilte's attention to his comments.  The Deputy was also quite right to put emphasis on access.  When it comes to the expenditure of EC Structural Funds we will have to be sure that we make the correct investment.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Byrne plead for competition.  I understood that that is precisely what I am doing.  In relation to the Aer Lingus-Ryanair decision, I am trying to ensure that we have two airlines in the country.  It does not take much imagination to figure out that if there are two airlines there is more competition. I did not hear the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was surprised by the Deputy's pro-competition speech which I approve of.  Second, I was disappointed that the Deputy did not refer to the 500 jobs provided by Ryanair.  No doubt this slipped his mind but I wish to bring it to his attention now that that company provide 500 jobs, and that they too are <Col N="1093" /> worthy of consideration by any Government. I should also draw the Deputy's attention to the fact, which he omitted to mention, that I have just given the go-ahead to Aer Lingus for a £35 million hangar and that we are providing £189 million for them, including funds for the purchase of new aircraft.  We have secured access into Los Angeles for Aer Lingus who have the full support of this Government.  They are the national airline and I and the Government are committed to their development. There is no threat to that company from anybody, nor would I tolerate a threat to Aer Lingus from anybody.  In general, Aer Lingus are poised for very significant development and they are well able to take on the chin the small adjustment that was made because they are a very fine organisation.  They have my full support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> I have given a short example of the type of development they are involved in. No doubt the Deputy omitted to mention these developments but it is important that he realise these developments are going on and that Aer Lingus have the full support of this Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Concern for the environment has now become both an international and a domestic priority.  Not so long ago those committed to environmental protection and articulating concern about man's destruction of his natural habitat were treated as cranks and ridiculed by international governments.  Now they have been vindicated and are seen to have had a prophetic vision.</P>
      <P>The urgent need to find solutions to global environmental problems has attracted widespread public attention. Problems such as the depletion of the ozone layer, the rise in the temperature of the earth's atmosphere giving rise to the so-called greenhouse effect, the destruction of the Amazon rain-forests, acid rain, the pollution of the Rhine, the release of dioxin gas at Seveso, the nuclear fall-out from Chernobyl, the appalling tragedy at Bhopal, the oil spillage in Prince William Sound in Alaska, have all heightened public awareness of the importance of the environment.</P>
      <P>A significant number of recent events in Ireland have also served to heighten public awareness of environmental issues and illustrated the lack of any coherent environmental policy.</P>
      <P>In the agricultural area the increasing use of chemical fertilisers and the largescale production of silage and animal slurry has led in recent years to eutrophication of inland waters and to substantial fish kills.  Industry, and to a lesser extent local authorities, have also been responsible for a number of serious water pollution incidents.  In the first nine months of this year alone there have been 108 fish kills resulting in the death of 35,000 fish.</P>
      <P>With regard to some industries, there have been problems of siting and pollution control which have resulted in a reluctance among local communities to accept new industries within their area with a resultant loss of potential jobs and economic growth.  In the aquacultural area problems are now apparent with the siting of cage based fin-fish farms which has resulted in opposition to such development arising in a number of coastal communities.</P>
      <P>With regard to waste disposal, uncertainty about the fate and effects of toxic wastes produced by industry and the apparent inability of local authorities to effectively monitor and control such wastes have contributed also to a growing reluctance among local communities to accept industries which may use or produce hazardous or toxic materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> In the context of particular industrial plants, the court proceedings brought by John Hanrahan against Merck Sharpe and Dohme considerably added to public scepticism as to the ability of both State bodies and local authorities to properly monitor industry and helped to fuel and exacerbate the Merrel Dow controversy which clearly illustrated the folly of government agencies promoting the siting of pharmaceutical or chemical plants at inappropriate locations.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government who took office in 1987 and the new Coalition Government of July 1989 share a substantial responsibility for undermining the public's confidence in the ability and willingness of government to deal properly with environmental matters.  At a time of heightened international and domestic concern about the environment, the Fianna Fáil Government of 1987 abolished both An Foras Forbartha and the Water Pollution Advisory Council. Following the horrific fish kills of 1987 it was not until January of 1989 that that Government published new water pollution legislation which only finally commenced a Second Reading debate in the Dáil last week due to the Bill containing, when published, a number of serious defects.</P>
    <P>Both this Government's and the previous Fianna Fáil Government's approach to the smog problem is nothing short of a shambles.  Over 12 months ago Dubliners were choking on smog and the present Minister for the Environment was asked by Fine Gael to extend conversion grants to all those areas of Dublin that had suffered smog above EC limits and to introduce essential amendments to the Air Pollution Act.  Nothing was done by the present Minister to tackle the problem and upon the formation of the new Government in July of this year, Fine Gael again asked the Government to take a series of specific measures prior to the onset of this winter.  Nothing happened and during the last four weeks Dubliners have again choked on smog which in many parts of Dublin was substantially above EC limits with all the dangers that poses for both the young <Col N="1098" /> and the elderly who have respiratory difficulties. It is with some incredulity that Dubliners view the Government's response to their problems.</P>
    <P>The Government's response has been twofold: first, the wasting of public money in an expensive public relations exercise in which people are urged to be &ldquo;smog busters&rdquo;.  When the smog descends most people cannot read the Government erected posters through the grey haze that envelopes the city as they pass them while many of those who received the smog buster leaflets through their front doors thought them to be an offbeat advertisement for the &ldquo;Ghost-busters II&rdquo; movie on in town at present; and second the appointment of yet another committee to consider what should be done.  This latter so called initiative guarantees, of course, that nothing of substance will happen this winter and that again next winter breathing in Dublin will damage your health.</P>
    <P>The environmental negligence of the current coalition Government, who are largely a continuation with some minor modifications of the Fianna Fáil Government who took office in 1987, extends to a variety of other environmental areas and a number of these were referred to by me in a speech on the Estimate for the Department of the Environment on Thursday, 30 November last.  I do not intend to repeat them here.  Suffice it to say that whereas in recent weeks the Minister for the Environment and his Minister of State have been heavy on environmental rhetoric, they have been weak on environmental action.  Governmental lip service to environmental concerns is not good enough.  What is required is legislative and administrative action.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael in their policy document <i>A Clean Environment</i> published last May recognised the need for a national environmental plan to provide a coherent framework for all the components of our environment and stated the need to establish an independent environment protection agency.  The Fine Gael proposal for such an agency became part of the joint Fine Gael &mdash; Progressive <Col N="1099" /> Democrat election programme and subsequently became part of the Fianna Fáil &mdash; Progressive Democrat <i>Programme for Government.</i></P>
    <P>In the months of September and October of this year various Government Ministers spoke publicly of the need without delay to provide by legislation for the establishment of an environment protection agency to restore confidence to our environmental processes and to tackle the problem of the apparent conflict that had arisen between the need for environmental protection and the need to create new industry and provide new jobs.  It became apparent that despite all the rhetoric there was no prospect of the Government publishing the legislation required to establish the agency during 1989 and the possibility of them enacting the necessary legislation to bring it into force during 1990 seems remote.  It also became clear that different Ministers had different views as to the functions such an agency should perform and how they should be structured.  In the circumstances Fine Gael determined to resolve the Government's difficulties by bringing before the Dáil the necessary legislation which is now contained in the Environment Protection Agency Bill, 1989.</P>
    <P>I intend now to give a summary of the main provisions in the Bill.  The environment protection agency provided for under the Bill will be independent of Government and local authorities.  The head of the agency will be the environment commissioner who is to be appointed by the President upon the recommendation of the Dáil and the Seanad.  The appointment mechanism provided for is the same as that applicable by Statute to the appointment of the Ombudsman.  The Bill also makes provision for the appointment of a deputy environment commissioner.  It is envisaged that the environment commissioner will hold office for a period of five years and will receive the same remuneration and allowances as are paid to a judge of the High Court.  Upon the completion of <Col N="1100" /> a five year period the commissioner may be reappointed for a further term.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the setting up of the environment council who are to act as an advisory body to the environment commissioner and will have a general role in advising the environment commissioner on the carrying out by the commissioner and the agency of their functions.  It is to be composed of ten persons &ldquo;competent and knowledgeable in matters relating to the environment and the general functions that fall within the competence of the agency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Bill also envisages the establishment of an Oireachtas Joint environment committee to which the commissioner is obliged to make an annual report.  The Oireachtas joint committee will play a role in formulating political policy and examining matters relating to the environment across a broad range of Ministeries.  They will not only provide a political focal point for the work undertaken by the agency so as to ensure the report they produce does not gather dust on ministerial shelves, but they will take an overview of all matters relating to the environment which fall within the ambit of Government.  It is intended that this committee will give a political impetus to ensuring that environmental policy proposed by the agency and any legislative or administrative changes seen to be necessary are taken on board by Government.  They will also provide an essential link between the independent workings of the agency and the Oireachtas and will for the first time establish a body within the Oireachtas who can take a comprehensive overview of the impact on the environment of a broad range of policies implemented by Government Departments and State bodies as well as the private sector.  They will also have a role in ensuring that adequate resources are made available to the agency to enable them to carry out their statutory functions as annually the environment commissioner under the Bill has to report to the Oireachtas joint committee on &ldquo;the adequacy or otherwise of the moneys <Col N="1101" /> made available to the agency by the Minister for Finance for the performance of their functions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As is required by the procedures of this House, if this Bill successfully passes through the Dáil, Fine Gael intend to engage in detailed discussions with the other parties so that agreement can be reached on the exact terms of reference to be given to the environment committee so that the necessary motion to provide for their establishment can be placed on the Dáil and Seanad Order Papers.</P>
    <P>Extensive provisions are contained in the Bill to provide for the agency to have their own full time professional staff to carry out their functions and the Bill envisages that staff currently in the environment research unit and in the Nuclear Energy Board will, upon its enactment, transfer to the agency.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 of the Bill set out a series of general and specific functions the agency are to perform.  Broadly, the agency will be required to take a comprehensive overview of environmental matters and to work towards ensuring that we properly manage our natural and physical resources for the benefit of this and future generations.  They are obliged to promote the conservation of natural, physical and historical resources generally and to ensure that proper environmental monitoring is carried out and that objective information for the formulation and implementation of sound and effective environmental policy is published. They are obliged to provide guidelines and codes of practice for the carrying out of environmental impact assessments and monitoring and required to ensure such assessments and monitoring are carried out to the highest professional standard. They are also required to ensure that a fully integrated approach is taken to environmental matters and that action, where necessary, is taken to protect and improve the environment, having particular regard to the quality of the environment, the sensitivity of the environment and the pressures imposed on it.  In this context the functions of the environment protection agency reflect <Col N="1102" /> specific functions to be conferred on the European Environment Protection Agency under the draft EC Directive relating to the establishment of the agency which it is anticipated, will be set up early next year.</P>
    <P>The legislation recognises that environmental policy cannot be developed and applied in an economic vacuum.  It recognises that if we are to tackle the twin evils of unemployment and emigration we must have industrial growth while at the same time ensuring effective environmental protection and development.  In line with the thinking in the Brundtaland report, for the first time in Irish law the concept of sustainable development is given statutory recognition.</P>
    <P>The agency must in the performance of their functions have regard to the need for sustainable economic development capable of meeting the needs of the present generation without endangering the living conditions of future generations. The Bill recognises the desirability of integrating environmental considerations in all sectors of the economy and the community so that they automatically form part of sectoral planning and decision making at all levels.  If such an approach had been adopted in the past some of the more recent environmental controversies we have experienced would not have arisen.  Also for the first time in Irish law the Bill gives statutory force to the precautionary approach which requires that action be taken to safeguard the environment where there is reason to believe that damage or harmful effects are likely to be caused in specific circumstances although no definitive scientific proof of such effects is established.  If a precautionary approach had been adopted in the early seventies action would have been taken much earlier at an international level to confront the problems posed by the breakup of the ozone layer and the greenhouse effect.  If a precautionary approach had been part of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, swifter and more immediate action could have been taken by Government to resolve the smog problem in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The agency have a variety of specific <Col N="1103" /> functions conferred on them by the Bill which include: monitoring the performance of local authorities and government bodies on environmental matters; reviewing the system of agencies and processes established by the State to manage the allocation, use, conservation, preservation and protection of natural, physical and historical resources; advising on the application, operation, adequacy and effectiveness of existing legislation to protect the environment; providing assistance to local authorities and other State bodies in the fulfilment of their statutory functions with regard to the protection and improvement of the environment; the compilation and dissemination of reliable and objective environmental data and information; the establishment of national criteria for water and air quality and for discharge standards; undertaking and sponsoring research in environmental matters; carrying out investigations and inquiries into matters that have had or may have a substantial or damaging effect on the environment and advising on necessary preventive or remedial action required to be taken; publicising provisions of both domestic and European environmental legislation; monitoring the extent of this State's compliance with European Communities environmental legislation and the effectiveness of the State in obtaining funding from the European Communities for environmental matters where such funding is available to tackle particular problems.</P>
    <P>Too frequently the general public are unaware of the environmental protections available and too often the Government have failed to comply with European Community directives with regard to environmental matters.  For example, persistently for the last 12 months Deputies in the Dáil have highlighted the failure of the Government to implement the EC Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment, 18 months after the coming into force of that directive.</P>
    <P>Further functions given to the agency by the Bill include the provision of advice <Col N="1104" /> with regard to the control and disposal of hazardous substances and with regard to the management, recycling and disposal of waste products.  The agency is also required to liase with other bodies both within and outside the State and will clearly provide a linkage to the new European Environment Agency that is to be established in 1990.  The agency will also have specific powers to take legal action in a number of circumstances which I will refer to later.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises it is important that the agency be not simply a centralised body and that for it to carry out its functions properly it is important that it has a regional presence.  In this context it is envisaged that the agency could harness resources currently available, for example, in the regional laboratories at Castlebar, Monaghan and Kilkenny as well as in other public sector bodies.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill provides for the establishment of regional environmental units which would be involved in the general work of the agency and which would carry out a number of specific functions. The regional units would: carry out spot checks on environmental monitoring equipment and procedures in use by local authorities and industry; assess the results of monitoring carried out by local authorities to fulfil their statutory functions; assess the results of monitoring carried out in compliance with licence and planning requirements by industrial, agricultural, aquacultural, mining and such other appropriate activities as are determined by the Commissioner; carry out such monitoring as is deemed necessary to ensure that licensing and planning requirements are being complied with; advise local authorities and other State bodies, including the Industrial Development Authority, on the suitability of industrial locations for environmentally sensitive projects; advise local authorities and An Bord Pleanála on the contents of environmental impact assessments and on the environmental implications of any projects in respect of which an environmental impact assessment is prepared; prepare an environmental impact assessment where requested to do so by a local <Col N="1105" /> authority or other State body in respect of any proposed project which gives rise to justifiable public concern as to its environmental implications; prepare an environmental impact assessment, where the Environment Commissioner deems it appropriate to do so with regard to significant environmental impacts of proposed or anticipated public or private sector developments or projects.</P>
    <P>In addition, the regional units would have to be consulted by each local authority within the area of the unit with regard to matters that fall within the competence of the agency in regard to the preparation of a development plan by such local authority as required by the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised that many local authorities do not have the technical expertise to check the validity of environmental impact surveys submitted to them.  In this context the regional units would provide the necessary back-up services, not just to the local authorities but also to An Bord Pleanála.  The conferring of a power on the agency to carry out environmental impact assessments on proposed projects prior to their reaching the planning application stage would also be of particular benefit.  For example, advance work could be carried out by the agency on the likely environmental impact of gold mining in the west of Ireland so that an informed public debate and discusion could take place well in advance of any possible planning application being made.</P>
    <P>The agency's role in providing advice on the suitability of industrial locations for environmentally sensitive projects to both the IDA and to local authorities and in making an input into the preparation of development plans by local authorities could ensure that we avoid in the future controversies such as that which arose over Merrell Dow in Cork.</P>
    <P>In the context of legal proceedings the agency can avail of a variety of statutory functions not available at present.  Power is conferred by the Bill on the Environment Commissioner to serve a stop order upon, for example, an industrial <Col N="1106" /> plant where the Commissioner believes, &ldquo;upon reasonable and probable grounds&rdquo; that a contaminant is being discharged into the natural environment which constitutes an immediate danger to human life, the natural environment, the health of any person or to property.  This provision will enable swift and immediate action to be taken to prevent substantial damage resulting from a pollution incident.</P>
    <P>The power to serve a control order to limit or control emissions or discharges of contaminants and to stop such discharges permanently or for a specified period will also provide a new and essential protection. Moreover, under the Bill the Commissioner is empowered to bring court proceedings to ensure that the polluter truly pays for any damage caused and provides whatever moneys are necessary to mitigate or remedy the effects of pollution.  This civil remedy is also backed up by a power conferred on the commissioner to initiate criminal proceedings where necessary against those who obstruct or interfere with the agency in the carrying out of its functions or who fail to comply with control or stop orders.</P>
    <P>In the event of a serious incident being caused, for example, by a major multinational pharmaceutical or chemical company, the Commissioner can institute proceedings which could result in a fine of up to £1 million being levied and terms of imprisonment of up to five years being imposed.  Hence this agency will not only provide for the development of a comprehensive environmental policy, engage in monitoring, research and the publication of essential information and provide support, back-up and advisory services where required but will, in addition, be an agency with real teeth, able to take specific action where necessary in the interests of the environment and of the community.</P>
    <P>Moreover, in specific circumstances provided for in the legislation the agency will also be able to institute proceedings under the Air Pollution Act, 1987, the Fishery Acts, 1959 to 1987, the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, the Local Government (Planning and <Col N="1107" /> Development) Act, 1963, the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1962 and the Dangerous Substances Acts, 1972 to 1979.</P>
    <P>Last week the Government published particulars of the proposed Environmental Protection Agency they envisage establishing.  Deputy Harney, Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, stated that the Government envisaged the agency broadly having the following four groups of functions: Control and regulation of developments likely to pose a major risk to environmental quality; general monitoring of environmental quality; support, back-up and advisory services, and environmental research.</P>
    <P>The Environment Protection Agency Bill effectively provides for all of these functions to be undertaken, together with a wide variety of essential additional functions.  The only difference between this Bill and the Government's proposal is that the Bill envisages the agency establishing and publishing national criteria for water and air quality and for discharge standards with regard to environmental licensing, whereas the Government now apparently propose that some licensing functions be carried on directly by the agency.  This minor difference in approach is something obviously that could be teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have no fundamental argument with the idea that the agency should, in specific instances, have a licensing function.  We believe, however, that a coherent and consistent approach is necessary and that either the agency should be the general licensing body or the local authorities should be the general licensing body, applying uniform standards and approach with the agency playing a role in monitoring the performance of the local authorities.  It seems a somewhat misplaced approach to give the agency some licensing functions and leave others with the local authorities.  In the context of preserving local democracy and the functions of local authorities we would question the need to deprive them of their licensing functions.  What is <Col N="1108" /> needed is a uniformity of approach, and what the local authorities need are the necessary back-up services.  What is required to ensure public confidence in the performance of local authorities is that an overview be taken of their performance by the agency.  However, this matter could be quite easily teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposed agency is basically a substantially watered down version of what is required.  For example, the Government's agency would play no role in monitoring our compliance with EC environmental Directives.  Is that surprising having regard to the record of this Government in this area?  I have already referred to the Government's failure to implement the EC Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment.</P>
    <P>The Government's agency has no right of access to departmental documentation relating to the environment and will not be free to investigate the manner in which bodies, including both Government Departments and local authorities, deal with environmental matters.</P>
    <P>The Government's agency will have no function in the carrying out of advance environmental impact assessment on proposed projects such as gold mining, as I mentioned earlier in the west.  The Government's agency will have no role in highlighting defects in our existing legislation and in administrative practices and proposing changes.</P>
    <P>The Government's agency will play no role in the area of radiological safety, whereas the Bill provides for the establishment of a radiological protection division to take over the current functions of the Nuclear Energy Board.  Detailed reference to this function of the agency will be made by my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, Fine Gael spokesperson on Energy tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The Government's agency will have no power to serve stop orders or control orders or to initiate proceedings of the nature described by me earlier.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the Government's press release makes it clear that the agency, which to date is only the subject of a press release and is not referred to in any <Col N="1109" /> published Government legislation, will not truly be independent in the carrying out of its work in that it will be subject to &ldquo;general policy directives issued by the Minister for the Environment&rdquo;, which means presumably that the Government's so-called &ldquo;independent agency&rdquo; can under the Government's proposals be ordered to refrain from examining particular environmental problems that might embarrass the Government.  For example, it was reported from the Government's press conference that it was envisaged that the agency it talked of would have no remit to deal with the smog problem in Dublin.  It is also clear that the Government do not envisage the establishment of an Oireachtas environmental committee, the setting up of which is now long overdue.  Clearly, if the Government's agency is put in place, in the manner in which the Government envisage, it will simply be a watered down version of what is required.  It will produce reports which will quietly go to Minister to gather dust on ministerial shelves with no real political impetus or no mechanism, such as an Oireachtas environmental committee would have, to ensure that what it proposes is actually implemented.</P>
    <P>The Government's press release makes it clear that they have not yet fully worked out the structure of the agency they propose to establish.  Confronted by the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill published a month ago, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, is quoted as saying, however, that &ldquo;pending the enactment of the legislation we are proposing to put interim arrangements into place so that some aspects of the work of the agency can be got under way on a non-statutory basis as soon as possible&rdquo;. No truly independent agency can properly undertake any of the necessary work in this area without being established by statute.  The Government should be warned that no credibility will be attached to any announcement they may intend to make appointing a few people to a so-called interim board pending the enactment of legislation.  It is almost two and a half years since the Government <Col N="1110" /> appointed interim members to a roads authority, promising the enactment of the necessary legislation to establish such an authority.  The necessary legislation has still not been published and is awaited by this House.</P>
    <P>The general public are sceptical of the Government's true commitment to tackling environmental problems.  The derisory allocation of £500,000 in the 1990 Estimates for the setting up of an Environment Protection Agency has done nothing to create any real public confidence in the Government's intentions. The Taoiseach's talk over the weekend of espousing a &ldquo;green agenda&rdquo; in the environmental context during his EC Presidency is seen by most people at present as nothing but a public relations facade to cover up the lamentable failure of his Government, not only to comply with essential EC Directives but to tackle our own domestic environmental problems.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach wants to lend some credibility to his Government's rhetoric and to give some substance to this State's interest in the siting of the new European Environment Agency here, he should provide Government support for this Bill on Second Stage.  If he does not do so, his expressions of environmental concern will be seen as nothing but political cosmetics. It is our hope that Government support will be forthcoming for this Bill and that it will be welcomed and supported by all on both the Government and Opposition sides of the House.  For our part, Fine Gael are happy to incorporate into the Bill any constructive amendments that may be proposed on Committee Stage to ensure the proper workings of this agency.  It is quite clear in the context of what the Government have been saying in recent days that no Government Bill will become operative during 1990.  Having regard to the Government's record in the context of the roads authority it is highly unlikely we will see the required Government legislation this side of 1992.  Support by the Dáil for the measure which Fine Gael have brought before the House would guarantee that we have this badly needed <Col N="1111" /> legislation put in place and enacted, and an Environmental Protection Agency established early in the new year.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.  I hope it will have support from all sides and that it will pass through Second, Committee and Final Stages speedily and then find its way into the Seanad so that by Easter the agency will be in place, the legislation will be in force and the environmental protection measures that are required will be seen to be there and an agency will have been established in which the public have confidence.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that Deputy Shatter has chosen to push ahead with his Bill at present.  The Deputy is well aware that one of the environmental initiatives in the present Government's programme provided for the establishment of an independent environmental agency.</P>
      <P>At the outset I would like to put the record straight.  Deputy Shatter is on record as saying in recent times that Fine Gael were the first party to propose such an agency, that they convinced the Progressive Democrats of that during the course of negotiations before the last election, and that it was then taken on board during negotiations with Fianna Fáil.  I have here a copy of the Progressive Democrats' environmental policy published in January 1987 and rather than going through all the sections I will give a brief synopsis.  The commitment to establish such an agency was given and its role and powers are outlined in great detail in that document which was published in advance of the 1987 election.  I simply put that on the record so that the inaccurate statements that are being made are withdrawn or at least that Deputy Shatter is aware that he was not the first to think of the idea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it really matters in the context of this issue who <Col N="1112" /> was the first to think about the idea; the important thing is that the agency is established as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I am committed to bring a more open approach to policy formulation.  I have indicated in a number of public statements since taking office four and a half months ago that the establishment of this agency is a major priority of mine and the Government.  Work on the preparation of the necessary legislation is proceeding with great haste.  As someone committed to more open Government I was anxious to get the widest possible consensus from concerned interests on the most appropriate way to establish the agency and I held extensive discussion with a variety of groups during the past few months.</P>
      <P>It was in the interests of the widest possible consultation that the Government's approval to proposals relating to the functions, Constitution, organisation etc., of the agency were published last week.  Deputies will appreciate that this is not standard practice in such matters. I am anxious to have greater public access to information and to involve the public as much as possible in policy formulation. This is going to be mere public relations agency but rather one that will have the necessary power and authority to restore public confidence in the monitoring and enforcement of environmental standards.  It is vital that we get it right from the outset.  I see Deputy Shatter's decision to press on with this Bill as opportunistic and an effort to jump on the band wagon of the Government's proposals to establish the agency.  The Bill shows all the hallmarks of having been rushed and the details have not been adequately thought through.  I will be returning to these points later on.  Nevertheless, I can welcome the principle behind the Bill from the viewpoint that it indicates a measure of agreement from the Opposition on the need for an agency of the kind proposed in the <i>Programme for Government.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The environment in Ireland is coming under increasing pressure from development of all kinds, whether it be from industry or agriculture, from the growth <Col N="1113" /> of urban areas or infrastructural development, or from increasing tourist numbers which bring their own stresses, often to sensitive areas.  Despite these pressures, the physical environment is in a reasonably good condition and most problems, whether they relate to air, water, waste, noise or whatever, affect a relatively small proportion of our environmental resources.  But we cannot afford to take chances with the environment or to run the risk that environmental degradation will follow the economic and social development to which we all aspire.  That is why there is now a growing public demand for the application and strict enforcement of environmental protection standards based on the use of the best available technology.  Indeed, it is clear that unless local communities can be assured that such standards will prevail, the establishment in Ireland of modern industrial plant will become increasingly difficult.  In this situation, I am convinced there would be advantages for industry, as well as for the environment, in the application of standards on a uniform and consistent basis around the country.  The need for a mechanism, in which there would be full public confidence, for monitoring and enforcing compliance with environmental standards is obvious.</P>
    <P>We must have a high level of expertise, coupled with sophisticated equipment, for the environmental monitoring of modern industry.  I do not believe this need can be fully met within the local government system, given that only a few major industrial plants may be located in any one county.  There is a case on these grounds alone for a change in the existing system.</P>
    <P>However, I see advantages, too, in separating the pollution control and regulatory functions of local authorities in relation to complex developments, from their role in promoting the economic development of their areas and the function of providing infrastructural services. In line with the experience of many other countries, it is evident that a national agency could more readily develop the <Col N="1114" /> necessary expertise and provide the sophisticated monitoring equipment required to deal with modern industry and complex pollution issues; such an agency would be best placed to ensure that there is full public confidence in monitoring and enforcement arrangements.</P>
    <P>I do not, of course, wish to give the impression that I see industry as the only problem or that the agency we propose will be concerned only with pollution from industrial sources; far from it in fact, as I will make clear later on.  There is no reason why industry and the environment cannot co-exist.  New industry is an important element in our programme for job cration.  With the co-operation of all involved and the right structures in place we can create employment and still maintain a good environment.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to an outline of the kind of agency I think is needed and, in particular, to set out the role and functions approved by the Government for the agency.  They will, initially, have the following groups of functions: control and regulation of development likely to pose a major risk to environmental quality, general monitoring of environmental quality, support, back-up and advisory services and environmental research.</P>
    <P>In explaining these functions, the first important point I would like to stress here is that the agency will be given direct responsibility for the licensing, monitoring and enforcement functions in relation to specified classes of new development with potential for serious pollution, including problems related to air, water, noise and waste.  It is the intention also to give the agency power to review the licences for existing developments of this kind.  The legislation establishing the agency will include a schedule of the classes of development for which it will be directly responsible and I propose that the schedule will be capable of amendment by Ministerial Order to cater for changed circumstances, including the development of new technologies or new information or facts related to pollution and hazards.  The initial schedule will include all industrial plant licensable under the Air Pollution Act, 1987, and <Col N="1115" /> most of the development that comes within the scope of the European Communities Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment.  These lists are extensive and cover a wide range of different activities.  I might add that final decisions have not yet been taken on the full range of development to be included in the agency's brief.  Deputies may wish to give views on this aspect.</P>
    <P>The proposal to give the agency direct responsibility for specified development is, I believe, fundamentally important to the success of the agency and goes well beyond what is proposed in Deputy Shatter's Bill.  I recognise that this proposal will impinge on existing local authority functions but, as I have previously stated, it is in an area where many local authorities are finding difficulties in meeting their responsibilities.  Many of them, for example, have not been able to gear up to deal with the new air pollution licensing system introduced last year and it is difficult to expect them to do so in cases where only a few licensable plants may be located in their administrative area.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will, of course, continue to play a major role in the regulation and control of development.  In fact, they will continue to be responsible for licensing and monitoring most development and for the granting of planning permission for all development. However, in order to ensure that the system will work smoothly I envisage that there will be a linkage between the agency and the local authority structure. For example, I would see as a minimum that the local authorities would be required to have regard to the agency's views on the environmental aspects of particular development proposals.  In effect, they would have to ascertain whether the agency would be satisfied that there would be no unacceptable environmental impact from the particular development if the developer complied with the specific licence conditions which the agency would impose.  Environmental considerations will, therefore, be given specialist examiniation in considering future development projects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> I am considering also the whole question of appeals in relation to air and water pollution licences in cases where the agency will be directly responsible.  At present, these appeals are made to An Bord Pleanála which was established primarily to deal with land-use planning matters.  I would see it as somewhat paradoxical, if decisions by the agency, which will possess some of the best expertise in these matters in the country, were to be appealed on their merits to another organisation which could not hope to possess the same degree of expertise.  There must be a better way which would allow all sides to be heard, and public participation to be ensured, while also facilitating more speedy processing of licence applications.  I am, therefore, considering the possibility of providing for the conduct by the agency of a public consultation process on draft licences with oral hearings by the agency where these are necessary in the light of the complexity or importance of the issues.  This is an issue on which I would be glad to hear the views of Deputies and, indeed, the public and interested bodies.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I am considering is the possibility of introducing a system of environmental operating permits rather than the present system of separate air and water licences and waste permits.  It may not be possible to introduce such a system initially as we do not wish to delay the transition from the local authority control system, but it is clear that an integrated control system of this kind would have major advantages.</P>
    <P>Other matters of a specific nature where the agency could play a major role would include the operation of the environmental impact assessment system, particularly with regard to effects on water, air or soil.  I also envisage a role in relation to the regulation of hazardous wastes, including its movement and disposal, as well as hazardous waste planning generally.</P>
    <P>A matter with which I am particularly concerned is the question of overall environmental reporting and information. We need to do much better in this respect.  Specifically we need some <Col N="1117" /> means of gathering together and publishing the information that is currently available in a wide variety of sources.  In addition, we must improve the quality of information on some aspects of the environment.  Some years ago, An Foras Forbartha, at the request of the Department of the Environment, published a very useful first report on the state of the environment.  Such reports need to be produced on a regular basis &mdash; perhaps every five years or so &mdash; so that we can see trends emerging and ensure that our policies are geared to deal with existing and potential problems.  I see the agency playing a significant role in providing increased access for the public to such information.  This should help to ensure that future debates on environmental issues can be based on accurate and unbiased data.</P>
    <P>The agency will be responsible for general monitoring of environmental quality, with particular emphasis initially on air and water quality monitoring (including monitoring of estuarial and coastal waters) and such monitoring as is required by European Community Directives and international conventions. I envisage that much of this monitoring would continue to be done on an agency basis by local authorities and other existing organisations but subject to general co-ordination, validation and other arrangements made by the agency to ensure that comparable and comprehensive data are produced.  I might mention here that, despite the fact that there has been some criticism of the environmental control activities of local authorities, it is only fair to say that there has been a significant increase in recent times in anti-pollution activities undertaken by them.  they have deployed additional staff on environmental control functions in many cases and the expertise they have built up should continue to be used when the agency are established.  It makes economic sense also that a lot of the high volume monitoring should be done by local bodies rather than by a national organisation.  What is essential, however, is that the agency should set up <Col N="1118" /> procedures which will enable them to establish, update and maintain comprehensive data-bases on environmental quality and publish regular reports on the current position and trends.  The agency will be the national focal point for the European Environment Agency which was agreed at the recent Environment Council in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The third group of functions for which the agency will be responsible will relate to the provision of support, back-up and advisory services for local authorities, including regional support and laboratory facilities.  Clearly the agency will make use of the existing network of three regional water laboratories and add to them to cover those areas of the country outside the present network.  I envisage also that the staff and equipment will progressively be expanded to cover all water problems as well as air, waste and noise issues.  The agency will need to arrange for national laboratory facilities to cater for specialised needs.</P>
    <P>The role of the agency should not be confined, of course, purely to monitoring pollution and related matters and so I want them to have a wider remit which they can develop over time, while maintaining the necessary distinction between policy formulation, which must remain a matter for Ministers and the Government, and other matters which can properly be developed.  In particular, I will be giving power to the agency to provide services for the Department, and to advise the Minister and the Government on environmental policy issues and on strategy for the protection and improvement of the environment.  An overall strategy or plan, with a cross sectoral approach, will be essential in the future in order to ensure, not alone the preservation, but also the improvement of environmental resources and I believe that an agency of the kind envisaged by the Government could make a major input to the formulation of such a strategy.</P>
    <P>The fourth group of functions of the agency will be related to research.  They will be responsible for co-ordinating environmental research by public and <Col N="1119" /> other bodies and for attracting and maximising funding from European Community sources.  Where necessary, they will carry out environmental research directly, or arrange for research to be carried out through consultancy and commissions.</P>
    <P>I think Deputies will agree that the functions we propose to assign to the agency are wide ranging and extensive. It would be unreasonable to expect any new organisation to undertake work programmes immediately for all of these matters.  What I have in mind, therefore, is a build up of activity over a period of three to five years.  The functions assigned initially to the agency will cover the most pressing environmental problems, involving aspects of air and water pollution control and hazardous waste management. I intend, however, that the legislation will allow for the assignment of additional functions to the agency on a phased basis.  The legislation will, therefore, be in the nature of a framework Act, flexible enough to allow such transfers or assignment of functions to be effected as the agency develop.  I will be giving particular consideration to the early assignment of functions in relation to major agricultural development and the monitoring of local authority operations in the waste disposal and sewerage treatment areas.  I know these are issues of considerable public concern.</P>
    <P>The agency will be a fully independent body and because of the type of functions they will perform they are likely to have a small full time executive board, rather than a part time representational board of the kind traditionally provided for in the case of semi-State bodies.  The board will have to be appointed through procedures which will be seen to guarantee their independence and competence.  Possible models for this are the systems for appointing the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Planning Appeals Board.  However, I accept the need for the input to the agency of ideas and views from a broad range of interests.  Accordingly, I will be providing for an advisory <Col N="1120" /> council representing the various environmental, development, professional and other interests.  The council would maintain a general oversight of the board's activities and could make recommendations to the board or to the Minister, as might be appropriate.</P>
    <P>There is a need to ensure that the agency will operate within a broad public policy context and take a balanced view on the issues coming before them.  Provision will be made, therefore, for a system of general policy directives by the Minister, or for some other procedure which would not compromise the independence of the agency in dealing with specific issues or cases.  I would expect that such a power would need to be invoked only very rarely.</P>
    <P>It is clear that there will be heavy demands on the resources of the new agency.  In the early stages, therefore, the agency will have to concentrate on the most pressing environmental problems but I would not like them to get an image of a fire fighting organisation as far as environmental problems are concerned. I see the agency developing over a period of years.  In addition to dealing with current issues, they must have an anticipatory approach, identify future problems and propose measures to ensure they are avoided or ameliorated. The agency will also have a role to play in suggesting measures for the improvement or enhancement of environmental resources.  In their work programmes, therefore, I see the agency making maximum use of consultants, of staff seconded temporarily for particular assignments, and of staff and facilities available at universities and other higher level institutions.</P>
    <P>It is too early at this stage to talk about a definite budget for the agency but necessary funds will be provided.  An initial start-up provision of £500,000 has been included in the 1990 Estimates but I must stress this is to provide for the initial start up costs and is not to be seen as the budget for the agency.  In addition, there will be transfers of funds from other subheads where staff and activity are transferred to the agency.  The agency <Col N="1121" /> will be expected to charge for services on a full cost-recovery basis and will impose contribution conditions when granting licences so as to recover the costs involved in monitoring compliance with the standards established.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter's Bill fails to provide in a rational way for many of the matters I have outlined and which are provided for in the Government's proposals.</P>
    <P>In preparing legislation to establish an agency of the kind that is in mind, we must remember that we already have complex codes of law on planning, water pollution, air pollution, waste, etc.  What we need are better arrangements for administering and enforcing these codes, but we cannot simply impose new structures on top of what exists and set-up a system where responsibilities overlap. That is what this Bill would do.  I am convinced that it would lead to confusion about who does what in any particular situation and create problems on the enforcement side and for those in industry and elsewhere who would be subject to the new arrangements.  If we are to have a more effective environmental control system we need to work out a rational division of functions as between: the Minister who would deal with policy matters, etc; the new agency, and the local authorities. Deputy Shatter's Bill fails to do this.  The Bill fails to give the agency any direct functions in regard to the licensing or control of individual industrial plants or other development which could cause major pollution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We need an agency with front-line powers to control major development, and not just some form of back-up system which only comes into play when the other bodies involved refuse or fail to act.  The failure to provide powers of this kind for the agency is, in my view, a fatal flaw in the present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the Bill has its good points &mdash; especially when it deals with general environmental quality monitoring, including the need for data bases. However, it does not really address the <Col N="1122" /> immediate problem effectively, that is, how we ensure that there is consistent, uniform application of high standards to all potentially polluting development, right across the country.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, numerous other points which could be made in support of the case for rejecting this Bill.  The Bill is unworkable in many respects.  Let me give a few illustrations.</P>
    <P>Section 5(1)(a)(ii) requires the agency to work towards ensuring &ldquo;that full and balanced account is taken of the values which are placed by individuals and groups on the quality of the environment.&rdquo; How is this to be done in practice? How would the agency know if they had adequate information on the values of individuals or groups and how would they balance one set of values against another?  Would the values of a group be superior to those of an individual?  I see this requirement as the basis for endless litigation, particularly by persons who could argue that their individual values had not been given adequate consideration by the agency in particular cases.</P>
    <P>Another example occurs in section 5 (1) (c) which requires the agency &ldquo;to ensure greater environmental monitoring.&rdquo; I think Solomon himself might have problems in determining what &ldquo;greater&rdquo; means in this context.  Think of the possibilities, not alone when the agency are established but in five, or even ten, years time.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes the transfer of all environmental research unit functions and staff to the new agency, but this would be totally inappropriate, given that the ERU have functions &mdash; and staff &mdash; dealing with roads, traffic, construction matters and the like.  What I envisage is the transfer to the agency of the environmental functions only of the ERU.</P>
    <P>The detailed provisions in the Second Schedule about the appointment of the commissioner, the environment council and the environment committee have not been fully thought out with clear contradictions in relation to appointments and dismissals, membership of the council, etc.  An Oireachtas committee should <Col N="1123" /> not be involved in determining numbers of staff, duties and salaries as is proposed in paragraph 24 (b) of the Schedule.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to appear to be nit-picking on the Bill but I feel it necessary to point to the fact that there are numerous defects in the drafting, as well as the major flaws I have identified earlier. There is no possibility, therefore, that the Bill could be acceptable to the Government on the understanding that necessary changes would be made at Committee Stage.  As I said earlier, I welcome the general principle but I cannot support the proposal that the Bill should be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <P>I hope that the outline I have given of the proposed role and functions of the environmental protection agency, as approved by the Government, will convince the House of the Government's intention to establish a fully independent and effective agency which will be vested with significant powers.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to have the necessary legislation prepared as early as possible in the New Year to give effect to the Government's proposals and to have the agency up and running in 1990.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saddened by the response of the Minister of State to this Bill.  Listening to her one would think that the Custom House was the fountainhead of all wisdom in the drafting of legislation, that they could, with equanimity and a lily white record in terms of drafting excellence, nit-pick at the provisions of other Bills.  I should not, but cannot resist, the temptation to engage in the bad grace of referring to the Building Control Bill which has been virtually rewritten twice by the same technical people who help the Ministers of the day in relation to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not discussing the technical provisions of this Bill.  The Minister of State has done hereself, her Government and the legislative process of this House a great disservice by the note she struck in her concluding remarks.  In fairness to Deputy Shatter &mdash; whose technical expertise in this matter is certainly above <Col N="1124" /> the norm obtaining in this House &mdash; he was the first to invite the House to offer amendments and declared a willingness on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, who sponsored this Bill, to be open to wide ranging amendments on Committee Stage without preconditions.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we should confine ourselves exclusively on Second Stage to the provisions of this Bill to establish an Environment Protection Agency.  Without wishing to nit-pick, I suggest that the title should be amended to read &ldquo;Environment Management Agency Bill, 1989&rdquo; rather than the &ldquo;Environment Protection Agency Bill, 1989&rdquo;, because part of the task ahead of us is to learn how to manage our environment.  However, I would not for a moment suggest that that constituted sufficient grounds for our not accepting this Bill at this stage.</P>
    <P>I commend the Fine Gael Party and Deputy Shatter on the service they have done this House and the Government &mdash; if only they had the wit to recognise it &mdash; in having provided them with an opportunity to jump the clogged queue to the parliamentary draftsman's office in providing the Minister of State and her senior Minister access on the floor of the House to a Bill which, broadly speaking, is in line with most of the provisions Government policy enunciates in terms of the type of legislation they would like to see enacted.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind our forthcoming EC Presidency &mdash; which we have been told from Strasbourg will be a green one &mdash; I would suggest that some credibility would be afforded that Presidency had we a Bill on the establishment of an environmental protection agency at least in course of passage through this House.  The Minister was unable to give the House a clear indication that a Bill would be circulated when we return after Christmas.  I share Deputy Shatter's pessimism in regard to the delivery mechanisms of Government to produce the type of legislation about which we are speaking within the term of our so-called EC Presidency.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will be supporting this Bill on Second Stage.  Furthermore, because, on Second Stage, we do not <Col N="1125" /> believe it is necessarily divisive, we would seriously ask the Government to reconsider their position.  After all, it is the season of goodwill, the Berlin Wall is tumbling, right across Europe all sorts of people are changing their minds, and perhaps the conventional legislative cuture that pervades all Government Departments might be altered in this instance so that the Government and Minister of State &mdash; with direct responsibility for such an agency &mdash; would examine the possibility of accepting this Bill in principle on Second Stage without preconditions or being hostages to fortune. The spirit of Deputy Shatter's remarks are on the record.  Once accepted on Second Stage the Bill would be open to amendments from all sides with the majority carrying those amendments through.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there will be significant disagreement about the main objectives of such an agency.  By way of anecdote I might introduce some substance to the suggestions I have just offered the Minister of State.  I suggest that she examine the Private Members' Homeless Persons' Bill introduced by Senator Brendan Ryan, a Bill full of defects which was placed on my desk when I held the position now held by the Minister of State.  I recommended precisely the course of action I am now recommending to her, but I was overruled.  I regret that I was overruled but I was not at the Cabinet table to argue my point.  The prevailing political, administrative, bureaucratic, political culture of the Department of the Environment &mdash; not peculiar to that Department, it pervades all Government Departments &mdash; is that one does not give the Opposition any kind of concession whatsoever.  We could have accepted that Homeless Persons' Bill proposed by Senator Brandan Ryan in 1983-84 without having compromised ourselves in any way.  We could have tabled the type of amendments subsequently tabled after an awful lot of unnecessary hassle.</P>
    <P>We are this evening talking about an attitude to a Bill on Second Reading.  I will not go into the merits or demerits of <Col N="1126" /> its contents which I broadly support.  I want to talk to the Minister of State &mdash; who is renowned for her courage and spirited advocacy of political decisions in which she believes &mdash; and tell her that the Department of the Environment is not renowned for speedy delivery on a number of fronts in relation to certain kinds of legislation.  That Department are not masters of their destiny in relation to responses from other Government Departments, including the parliamentary draftsman and the Office of the Attorney General.  Their track record, not alone in relation to the Building Control Bill in terms of sheer quality of drafting which should render them very hesitant to criticise anybody else's drafting of legislation &mdash; can be compared only with the total political failure of that Department to circulate the Bill for the establishment of a national roads authority. I say this despite the fact that it was repeatedly enunciated as being a matter of priority as far as the Government were concerned.  I would suggest to the Minister of State that, over the next three to four weeks, time be taken to reflect on the opportunity the House is offering the Government in relation to this Bill.  It would be a mistake to simply oppose it, as we have done on all sides so many times in the past.  Indeed I have been party to majority votes in this House which blindly followed the same kind of legislative logic, which is simply that if the other side was proposing something, we had to oppose it.</P>
    <P>There is no fundamental or principle opposition to this Bill.  In essence we are all agreed on the need for the establishment of such an agency.  Had we been doing our job properly Second Stage should have concluded by now.  I do not want to run away with myself but I was going to say we should by now have adjourned to a select committee of the House, away from the full Press or public gallery, and gone into the business of arguing its various sections, examining the pros and cons of what type of agency, what type of authority, we want, what should be their terms of reference and so on.  There is no principled argument on <Col N="1127" /> Second Stage that basically divides us. Yet what is going to happen?  The prevailing political culture that has dominated so many administrations in this country will be: Do not give in; you have to hold the line; we will bring in our own Bill sometime in the new year, maybe before St. Patrick's Day but certainly not later than Easter.  The Irish green Presidency will look precisely that &mdash; very green and very bereft &mdash; because the Government will not have delivered.</P>
    <P>The Minister should seriously seek advice from her senior colleagues in the Coalition Government of the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil and look at the tactics of how the agency are to be established by way of legislation between now and June.  That is the first point I want to make and I want to underline it. I am not trying to make some cheap debating point.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulties and I understand the kind of advice she will be getting from all quarters but at the end of the day the Minister of State has exclusive political responsibility for the establishment of this agency.  She is the person who will be identified as the person who did or did not deliver on this measure.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not necessarily being helped, objectively speaking, by the fact that she has to climb over the rubble of destruction that has been left behind by the current incumbent Minister for the Environment whose executioner hands at the throat of An Foras Forbartha are still covered with the blood of that inane decision.  I am speaking metaphorically in response to the kind of rhetorical style to which Deputy Flynn frequently has recourse.  I thought I would match measure.  The Minister, in the course of her speech, talked about hiring specialist consultant staff.  We used to have them once upon a time.  They used to be on the public payroll but they have been paid to leave.  Some of them are no longer in the country.  Some of them are so disgusted at the way in which they learned, through the public media, of the termination of their employment that they will never <Col N="1128" /> again trust a public authority as a prospective employer.</P>
    <P>We are a small nation with a small bank of skills.  Holding on to those skills and developing them and keeping professional people in the public sector at levels of remuneration which in some cases are less than they could earn in the private sector &mdash; acting for the poacher rather than for the gamekeeper &mdash; has always been a difficult task of management. That task has now been made immensely more difficult because of the rubble of destruction to which I referred earlier.  Yet the person who is responsible for that destruction is not in the House tonight and I presume will not participate in this debate.  At some stage the senior Minister will take this Bill through the Cabinet.  I understand that the heads of the alternative Bill have not yet been circulated to the Cabinet but the Minister who will argue his corner at the Cabinet table should at least respond to the debate or participate in it on Second Stage.  Untold damage has been done to the core skills of environmental research and monitoring to which the Minister's speech refers and to which Deputy Shatter's speech refers also.</P>
    <P>Because of the ludicrous way in which An Foras Forbartha had their terms of engagement terminated we have messed up the careers and the professional perception of a number of people who have worked in this area.  As a consequence of that bungling and I agree entirely with what Deputy Shatter has said, public confidence in the objectivity of the State's system at national and local level to dispassionately evaluate development proposals, the environmental impact of which may be damaging or dangerous has been shattered.  We have damaged that rare and precious ingredient of public confidence which over the years was built up on foot of trust in An Foras Forbartha. The task the Government of the day have now in relation to the establishment of a new agency has been made all the more difficult as a consequence of the actions that this coalition Government, and to a far greater extent their predecessor, the <Col N="1129" /> minority Fianna Fáil Government, have undertaken.</P>
    <P>Let me give a specific example.  The Leader of the party to which Deputy Harney, the Minister of State present in the House tonight, belongs, certainly undermined public confidence in the objectivity of the planning process when he gave the impression to the ordinary public in the greater Cork region that planning permission had been prematurely granted to a Swiss chemical plant. This, after the fiasco of the Merrell Dow incident, undermined the confidence that a significant section of the public have in this process.  It was the compounding of an error on top of a series of errors which made the establishment of this agency absolutely urgent.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech is a good speech.  A competent official was told to go off and do a demolition job on Deputy Shatter's Bill and it is not a bad demolition job.  Some points have been picked out which, on reflection, Deputy Shatter might consider again on Committee Stage.  If the demolition job was coming from a Government who at all times introduced legislation that was so perfect that they would not even bother introducing any Minister's amendments, we would accept that the demolition job had some intellectual clout and credibility for which we would have some respect but that is not the case.  The reality is that Department sponsoring legislation through their Ministers frequently have second thoughts on Committee Stage and frequently bring in ministerial amendments, some simply to correct the grammar, some simply to remove internal linguistic contradictions and provide clarifications of meaning which might otherwise produce ambiguity and others indicating that they are not happy with what they wanted to do originally and had found a better way of doing it.</P>
    <P>There is no shame attached to that process.  There is no declaration of intellectual feebleness in indicating that you had second thoughts and you wanted to make something a little better by way of amendment.  Why is such a process <Col N="1130" /> acceptable from a Government point of view and totally unacceptable from an Opposition point of view?  The sort of criticisms contained towards the end of the Minister's speech in relation to some of the points raised are nit picking in their most extreme and frankly are beneath the standard of political participation that the Minister has set for herself in the past.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the perception of the independence of the authority.  In this respect there is a fundamental difference between what the Fine Gael Bill proposes on the one hand and what the Government's hastily convened press conference, held in the middle of the smog to provide cover of a different kind, tried to indicate last week.  I would like Government spokespersons or other Deputies to clarify this during the course of the Second Stage debate.  I have the distinct impression that the agency as proposed by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition will be an agency as subservient to ministerial <i>dictat</i> as were An Foras Forbartha and as is the environmental research unit.  This needs to be clarified if this is the kind of agency the Government have in mind &mdash; it may very well be the kind of agency the Department of Finance are insisting is the only one they will give clearance to &mdash; it will not meet the requirements the rest of us in this House seek and will do untold damage to the Government's bid for the establishment and location on this island of the proposed European environmental protection agency, which I think we all support.  It would be an absolute disaster if the meanness of spirit which has frequently characterised some of the spirits in Merrion Street was to prevail and come through in the formulation of this legislation so such an extent that the opportunity to achieve the objectives of a green island and a green Irish presidency would be thwarted by such a measure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of this Government's emphasis on forestry as a key national development activity.  A fundamental aim of the <i>National Development Plan</i> is to &ldquo;stimulate the growth needed to reduce unemployment, to raise productivity and to begin to increase <i>per <Col N="1132" /> capita</i> income towards average Community levels&rdquo;.  Forestry is an economic activity well suited to contribute to growth, employment and general development. its value as a national investment is that it provides the raw material for a whole industry, creates wealth and employment, diversifies the economic base of rural areas, and provides an alternative and profitable land use for farmers and landowners.  The area under forest in Ireland is currently only 6 per cent, compared with an EC average of 24 per cent, and when we consider that the growth rate of Irish forests is particularly good, yielding a third more timber on average than UK forests and that the UK imports more than 90 per cent of its timber requirements and the EC about 50 per cent, the advantages of increased afforestation are abvious.</P>
    <P>Forestry has been targeted in the national plan as a major area for development, the stated objective is to increase substantially the area under forest.  Our specific aim is to achieve a national annual planting rate of 30,000 hectares by 1993, a doubling of the rate achieved last year.  Planting by both the public and private sectors is set to break all records again this year, at a total of 18,400 hectares.  Deputies will be aware of the operations of Coillte Teoranta, the State forestry company, in this sphere but it is afforestation by the private sector which is showing the most spectacular expansion and which is particularly the subject of this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>Afforestation by the private sector this year is expected to reach 8,400 hectares, compared to the 6,500 hectares estimated at the beginning of the year.  The projected figure itself was an increase on the record planting achieved in 1988 to 5,200 hectares.  The significance of this extraordinary achievement by the private sector can be highlighted most dramatically by comparing it with the planting rate in 1981, the year in which the western package grant scheme was first introduced, of only 275 hectares.</P>
    <P>Afforestation by the private sector is encouraged and supplemented through grant schemes administered by the Forest <Col N="1133" /> Service of my Department as follows: the EC assisted western package, which was launched in October 1981 and revised in 1988.  This provides for the payment of grants for the afforestation, that is new planting of land in designated disadvantaged areas throughout the country.  Grants are payable at the rate of 85 per cent of approved costs for farmers and 70 per cent for others, subject to a maximum of £800 per hectare. This scheme also provides grants for the construction and reconstruction of forest roads serving privately-owned forestry plantations in disadvantaged areas.  The grant payable here is 80 per cent of approved costs subject to a limit of £12 per linear metre.  Seventy per cent of all expenditure under the western package is reimbursed by the EC.  The forestry development scheme for agricultural holdings, also EC assisted, which covers the afforestation of agricultural land by farmers.  Grants are payable at the rate of 80 per cent of approved costs subject to a limit of £550 per hectare for conifers, plus an additional £300 per hectare for broadleaves.  EC reimbursement for this scheme is 25 per cent.  The grants for private forestry, a State scheme, which is funded solely by the Exchequer and covers the afforestation and reaf-forestation of land throughout the State. Under the last revision of this scheme which took place in November 1987, grants are payable at the rate of £500 per hectare for conifers and there is an additional £300 per hectare for growing broadleaves.</P>
    <P>The growing interest in forestry has resulted in an increase in both grant applications and payments and, therefore, in a greater than anticipated expenditure by my Department.  The bulk of planting grants in 1989 will be taken up under the western package scheme. Planting under this scheme is expected to be in the region of 7,700 hectares with the remaining 700 hectares taken up equally between the other two schemes.  The take-up by farmers is expected to be about 50 per cent with the remainder taken up by individual members of the public and by investment companies.  The <Col N="1134" /> bulk of the planting is expected to be in counties Mayo, Galway, Clare, Kerry and Tipperary.</P>
    <P>My Department now operate various promotional and educational measures to increase awareness of the benefits and techniques of forestry.  For example, my Department are liaising with Teagasc in the promotion of forestry among farmers, which includes participation in public meetings and field days to increase farmers' awareness of the attractiveness of forestry as an investment.  The Department are also involved in courses at the agricultural colleges to introduce young farmers to the concept of forestry on the farm.  In addition, forestry promotional stands are erected at various events such as the Spring Show and the National Ploughing Championship.</P>
    <P>The development of private forestry is also greatly assisted by the services of private forestry contracting and investment companies, several of which have emerged in recent years.  These companies bring afforestation within the reach of those who may not have the knowledge, skills or facilities to undertake forestry projects themselves.  A full range of services is provided by these companies, from the selection and purchase of suitable sites up to the ongoing management of the established forests and the provision of financial services. Among the financial services on offer is a forestry fund, for investors who prefer to spread their investment over a mix of new planting and semi-mature woodlands, and bridging facilities for the capital-intensive forest establishment pending the receipt of grants.  Facilities such as these have encouraged increased private investment in forestry.</P>
    <P>Significant developments have also taken place in recent years in the area of silviculture.  Most important has been the realisation that land quality is of prime importance in the choice of ground for planting.  There is an increasing appreciation that altitude and exposure have negative influences on the growth potential and quality of trees grown for commercial purposes.  There has been a gradual movement from the more <Col N="1135" /> exposed sites to enclosed lands which are marginal for agriculture, but which can give attractive returns for forestry. Ground preparation techniques such as mounding, mole draining and ripping have greatly enhanced tree stability and windthrow can be significantly reduced by such treatment.</P>
    <P>There is a growing awareness of the interaction, both positive and negative, between forestry and the environment. The harmony between the two, which must be maintained, is reflected in the particular duties placed on Coillte Teoranta in the Forestry Act, 1988, to have due regard to the environmental and amenity consequences of their operations and in the grant schemes for the private sector which make compatibility with the environment an essential consideration.</P>
    <P>The expansion of forestry has led in particular to recent concern about its effects on water quality for trout and salmon.  I am happy to say that, following extensive discussions between representatives of my Department, the Department of the Marine, the Central Fisheries Board, Coillte Teoranta and the Irish Timber Growers Association, much progress has been made in developing guidelines for afforestation, particularly in sensitive areas.  I hope to announce these in the new year, and to make their application mandatory for grant purposes: I expect that this will go a long way to alleviate fears on this matter.  The guidelines aim to reduce the interaction between forestry and fisheries to the minimum consistent with the development of both these important resources to their optimum potential.</P>
    <P>The Forest Service also operate a free technical advisory service for the private sector on forest establishment, management, protection and road construction. This work and the inspection of planted areas is currently undertaken by Coillte Teoranta on an agency basis. Payments to Coillte Teoranta are made from subhead E, and expenditure from this subhead in 1989 is also likely to exceed the original allocation because of the increased number of applications for <Col N="1136" /> technical advice and planting grants and the additional costs to Coillte Teoranta of dealing with same.</P>
    <P>While the advisory and inspection service has been provided by my Department free of charge up to now, certain charges are to be introduced in 1990. These will apply only where inspections for grants have to be repeated because the original plantation was not up to standard, and where advice on a management plan for a forest is given before a felling licence is issued.  The fees to apply are £10 per hectare for repeat visits and £20 per hour for advice related to felling licences, and it is envisaged that these will realise a total of £20,000 in 1990.</P>
    <P>Continued expansion by the private sector will play an important part in achieving the targets set in the national plan, and I confidently expect that with the continued support of the advisory and grant schemes, planting by that sector alone can reach 15,000 hectares by 1993.</P>
    <P>The further net allocation of £942,000 to private forestry in 1989 will bring the total expenditure in this area this year to £5.631 million.  This level of expenditure will generate £2.746 million in EC funding as well as employment in forest establishment, private nurseries and private forestry contracting companies.  In the longer term, the resulting increased level of afforestation will lead to an increase in domestic timber production, with the accompanying employment and economic benefits.</P>

      <P>Deputy Deenihan must have something very important to say when he is looking for two minutes. When the Bill establishing Coillte Teoranta was going through the House we were given to understand that adequate finance had been set aside to cover all <Col N="1137" /> eventualities.  It appears that the money sought by the Minister tonight is to cover the cost of increased planting by the private sector.  I do not think we can object to that allocation.  There has been disquiet in the private sector because of the competition Coillte Teoranta engage in. I was glad the Minister on Thursday announced that as far as private planting was concerned he was re-absorbing into the Department those who are carrying out the inspections for Coillte Teoranta. I should like to compliment him on that move because there were doubts about the intentions of some of the foresters although I do not think that was fair to them.</P>
      <P>All Members would like to see a breakthrough in regard to forestry.  Lip-service has been paid by all sides of the House to that sector.  We have heard a lot of talk about its potential and in the most recent national plan there were excessive employment projections.  The Taoiseach described that document as an historic publication but in his view all documents produced by the Government are historic. I hope the Minister for Energy does not make any historic leaps between now and the summer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the Taoiseach, the Minister has not claimed that 300 jobs will be created by Coillte Teoranta in the lifetime of the national plan.  Most people were amazed to hear that Coillte Teoranta would be creating 300 jobs.  I do not think that figure will stand up.  I accept that the Government, anxious to project the best image, engaged in a big PR exercise on the publication of the national plan.  At that time figures were plucked from the sky but that did not do justice to anybody, least of all to this fledgling industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On many occasions I appealed to the Minister to request Coillte Teoranta to promote a semi-mature timber market. My reason for doing so was because Coillte Teoranta, and the private sector, would benefit from such a move.  In particular, the farmers would be encouraged <Col N="1138" /> to get involved in forestry.  I am disappointed that Coillte Teoranta have not made any great strides in regard to semi-mature timber.  In fact, the Minister has told us that Coillte Teoranta intend dropping the idea of selling semi-mature timber.  That would be a retrograde step and I hope it does not take place.  Money will not be attracted into forestry unless people can dispose of the asset after a certain number of years and do not have to wait until the end of the cycle.  The Minister should bear in mind that the money being used is mainly from pension funds.  If it is not used for the development of forestry it will be invested abroad.</P>
    <P>We should encourage people to get involved in planting marginal land.  The Minister did not mention in his speech compensation repayments to farmers. Will he consider increasing the limit of compensation amounts to £10,000 in an effort to make this a more attractive scheme?  That limit should apply to all timbers.  We must set targets.  I leave it to the Minister to distinguish between the different types of land, whether it is marginal or bogland.  I had hoped the Minister would announce a more progressive scheme to attract private investment in forestry.  I am pleased that that activity has been successful but it is important that we encourage more private investment.  Farmers and co-ops are getting involved in forestry and I understand that Avonmore have planted up to 2,000 acres.  Other southern co-ops are anxious to get involved and that represents a progressive move.</P>
    <P>We must at all times be aware of the environmental difficulties involved in forestry. There should be liaison in regard to this between the Department of the Environment and local authorities.  In the course of his speech, the Minister outlined the authorities involved in the protection of our waters but he neglected to mention the Department of the Environment or the local authorities.  Reference is made to his Department, the Department of the Marine, the Central Fisheries Board, Coillte Teoranta and Irish Timber Growers but no reference is <Col N="1139" /> made to the Department of the Environment or the local authorities.  It is my experience that local authorities in putting together their county plan need guidelines.  The Forestry Department have the resources to get in touch with the Department of the Environment and county councils to see how the afforestation programme can progress.</P>

      <P>In relation to conifers, I agree with the Minister when he says we have made great progress, but in relation to broad-leaf and deciduous trees I must agree with him because we have made no progress at all.  In fact, there has been widescale destruction of our deciduous forests.  As far as I can see, there is a very lax conservation policy in this area.</P>
      <P>In the limited time available to me I wish to ask the Minister to outline his Department's policy on the proposed sale by Coillte Teoranta of Ballyseedy Wood in County Kerry.  This is a very shortsighted decision, as this wood is now more than 200 years old and there are 80 acres of deciduous trees and over 60 oak trees there.  I understand the Taoiseach has a personal interest in the preservation of these trees.  There are several species of tree in this wood which should be kept in public ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure that this wood is not sold to private enterprise <Col N="1140" /> to be cleared away but rather developed as an amenity for the local people in north Kerry as it is now the only remaining deciduous wood there, an area which was very heavily clad with broadleaf trees in the past.  It could be developed for various educational and wildlife purposes.  I would appreciate it if the Minister in his reply would dwell for a moment on the preservation of Ballyseedy Wood and on his policy on the development of the broad-leaf tree population.</P>

      <P>In 1984, a review group was set up to examine how the State could maximise its return from State forests as they matured.  That review group reported to a former Minister, the former Deputy Paddy O'Toole, in late 1985.  I succeeded him in that Department in 1986 and had the honour and great pleasure of putting into effect the proposals of the review group.  Unfortunately, it was not possible for me to set up a national forestry enterprise but I am glad to say that the new Government took on board the policy we had adopted and brought forward legislation to create the new semi-State body, Coillte Teoranta, to continue the work formerly done by the Department of Forestry in pursuit of their policy of afforestation and the development of forestry.</P>
      <P>It was proposed at that time that State forestry should be run on commercial lines by a semi-State company.  I am glad to say that that Government introduced that Bill and have since set up Coillte Teoranta.  It was envisaged in the Green Paper that Coillte Teoranta would have responsibility for private forestry but I am afraid that this has not been the case. It was always envisaged that Coillte Teoranta would be charged with the responsibility to progress the objectives of private forestry and that funds would be made available to them.  I am disappointed that the Minister has kept this function within his own Department and is making the arrangements for an expansion of private forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is heightened slightly by what the Minister said in his speech.  He indicated that planting, by both the public <Col N="1141" /> and private sectors, is set to break all records this year at 18,400 hectares.  He pointed out that Deputies will be aware of the operations of Coillte Teoranta, the State forestry company, in this sphere, but that it is afforestation by the private sector which is showing the most spectacular expansion and is the subject of this supplementary Estimate.  I am aware that we are confined to speaking about the private sector, but in the limited time available to me I would like to point out that I would not like to see State forestry being handed over to private enterprise. While it was always intended that Coillte Teoranta would play the leading role in continuing the afforestation programme on behalf of the State, it was never intended that this role would be transferred to the private sector.</P>
    <P>It was envisaged in the Green Paper that grants available from the EC to encourage private planting would present Coillte Teoranta with an opportunity to exploit the position.  This is certainly happening at present but I hope the Minister can assure us and those working in the forestry plantations around the country that they are not going to be subsumed in the future by private forestry enterprises. These are the people who created this industry and the fruits of their labours will result in huge dividends during the next ten years or so.  We would not like to see these plantations being handed over to private enterprise for exploitation and profit.  The afforestation programme began in 1946 and we want to see the benefits of this programme, the proceeds from the sale of mature timber and the expansion of public forestry go to the people of this country.</P>
    <P>The expansion of private forestry must be welcomed.  It was envisaged that there would be such expansion in the document of the review group presented to the then Minister Deputy O'Toole.  It was also envisaged that 24,000 hectares would be planted by 1991.  The Minister has indicated that we are on line to reach that target and perhaps exceed it, but he was not in a position to indicate what inducements and grants are now available <Col N="1142" /> not only from his Department but also from the EC.</P>
    <P>We will not have time this evening to outline our attitude on this matter but perhaps we will have an opportunity in the coming year to have a full debate on this important sector of the economy. The Minister indicated that private forestry contracting is taking over an increasingly larger part of the work being done in areas where private forestry is being assisted and serviced.  To my knowledge the rates and conditions prevailing in private forestry contracting operations bear no resemblance to those prevailing in the forests run by the Department of Forestry.  I am particularly concerned about the numbers of people from the black economy employed in this area.  I recently asked the Minister for Social Welfare about this and I understand that certain changes are being made in the new year that will try to combat the amount of black economy employment being used.  The fact that people are working in the black economy does not simply mean that people are drawing pay and social welfare at the same time; it means that these contractors are being subsidised by the Department of Social Welfare.  People drawn into this type of employment are drawn in because of the low rates of social welfare.  It also means that the rates of pay and the conditions that prevail in some private employment should be discouraged. A social welfare subsidy should not be used by them to attract people into private contracting arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to concern about the environment and particularly to the planting of conifers.  We know that 96 per cent of all planting has been of conifers and only 4 per cent has been of broad-leaf varieties.  I hope there will be some stipulation relating to private planting which will lead to an increase in the planting of broadleaf trees.  The planting of such trees should be encouraged particularly along boundaries.  Broadleaf planting should be encouraged not just <Col N="1143" /> from the scenic aspect &mdash; many plantations are in areas frequented by tourists &mdash; but because it is necessary to preserve the appearance of forest plantations and to ensure that the great forests of broad-leaf trees we had in Wicklow such as Coolattin oak forest, are replanted.  The private sector has a responsibility since they are now getting great benefits from the grants to ensure that broadleaf planting is included in the acreage they are planting.</P>
    <P>The year 1991 is the centenary of the death of Charles Stewart Parnell and his home was in Avondale.  The Minister had the pleasure recently of visiting us down there and he saw the wonderful timber operation there.  This has been the headquarters for the Wicklow area in relation to planting.  County Wicklow which has the highest percentage of planting by comparison with any county is near the city of Dublin.  I would ask the Minister to take the opportunity to celebrate 1991 by establishing the headquarters of Coillte Teoranta either at Avondale or at some other place in Wicklow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot in the Estimate and in the Minister's contribution which I welcome, including the Minister's pronunciation of Coillte Teoranta. I thought I was alone in my pronunciation of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that this Estimate relates to additional money for private forestry.  I am in favour of the development of private afforestation expecially having regard to the failure of successive <Col N="1144" /> Governments to exploit the natural advantage we have for forestry development. As Deputy Kavanagh said, there is detectable in the Minister's address the suggestion that notwithstanding the purpose of Coillte Teoranta and the debate that surrounded its establishment, private afforestation is gradually getting into the ascendancy.  It is natural to expect a considerable improvement in performance when one looks at the very generous grants available for private afforestation.  That is not to suggest that this should not be done because we are still at a figure of 5 per cent afforestation as compared to an EC average of about 24 per cent.  We have a long way to go but, as Deputy Kavanagh said, we would not like Coillte Teoranta and public afforestation to become the poor relation of the forestry programme.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that in 1948 a White Paper was published on this question which proposed a target of 10,000 hectares of new plantations per annum and now approaching 1990 we have still only achieved about half that rate.  Since Coillte Teoranta was only established at the beginning of this year it is too early to make an assessment but there is a suggestion that the greater emphasis in Government policy is now on private forestry rather than on State forestry.</P>
    <P>The question raised by the progress to which the Minister referred relates to the development of an integrated wood industry here as a result of the improvement in the figures.  I am aware from Question Time recently that the Minister is about to announce that a pulp mill will be located somewhere in the country and that negotiations are at an advanced stage with the IDA.  I am directly interested in that, and not only because of the opportunity it provides us to avail of the increased significance of forestry.  A sum of £298 million was the 1987 figure that we spent on imported paper, therefore the establishment of a pulp mill gives us an opportunity for import substitution.  If the Minister is about to announce the establishment of a pulp mill, hopefully downstream development from that would be the establishment of a paper <Col N="1145" /> mill.  I certainly have a very direct concern about that because of the closure of the last paper-making facility at Clondalkin where the mill, the equipment and the plant is in perfect working order, where the workforce have been idle since its closure, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce is due on Thursday to meet with the works committee from that plant.  I hope that what we are viewing here is the possibility of the revival of the paper-making industry in this country and that that will include in the Minister's grand design the reopening of Clondalkin paper mills.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the development of private forestry which he says is also greatly assisted by the services of private forestry contracting and investing companies.  Indeed, several such companies have emerged in recent years, raising serious questions about the monitoring of the generous grants that are available for private afforestation and about the abuse of the taxation measures that apply to all other workers.  There is and always has been a serious black economy problem in the forestry industry and because of the nature of the operations it is very difficult at any given time to quantify this.  In the early days of the industry, for example, this major scope for evasion operated in the timber harvesting area.  The system was that the Department of Forestry, as they then were, sold their timber standing and the purchaser hired a contractor.  The contractor and his casual labour operated mostly in the black economy.  The amount of timer being sold by the forest service is increasing rapidly and this system of purchaser harvesting is increasing on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, hence the black economy operators are an expanding category.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh referred to another source of black economy labour that began to emerge in forestry in the early eighties when the Department began to put their work out to contract and reduce their own permanent workforce.  This trend is continuing, on my information, at an accelerating pace and with it a new <Col N="1146" /> category of black economy contractors who are paid by the State.  We can now identify a third category who have emerged. These are contractors who are engaged in a heavily subsidised sector of private afforestation and this trend by all appearances is set to continue.  Studies have been done which I recommend to the Minister on this aspect of evasion and availing of the black economy.  For example, the trade unions involved have produced such a study and have drawn attention to a number of points.  They have drawn attention to the fact that the workforce do not work in their home areas but are absent on specific days of the week.  They use names and aliases such as &ldquo;John Smith&rdquo;, which abound; there is a big turnover of staff: they are anxious to work on Saturdays and, as Deputy Kavanagh said, they work for a pay rate which is normally not viable.  The Minister for Social Welfare himself instanced this industry as an area where these practices are rife.  The Committee of Public Accounts have recently drawn attention to the matter.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> includes a clause committing the partners to ensure the eradication of the black economy from the growing forestry industry, and a number of reports have been prepared on it.</P>
    <P>By way of positive recommendation I suggest to the Minister that the withholding tax system be introduced for all contractors and subcontractors in the absence of a tax clearance certificate.  The level at which the withholding tax should be set is a matter for debate.  Secondly, a certified statement including the names, home addresses, RSI numbers and amounts paid should be obtained for contractors, subcontractors and employees in all cases, and finally the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners should be notified by the forestry service of all available information as a matter of routine.</P>

I assure them that I welcome the <Col N="1147" /> support which is so evident from every side of the House for the Government's plans to expand afforestation rapidly in both the public and private sectors. Deputies raised a number of issues and in the short time available to me I will try to reply to some of the points mentioned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Carey said he hoped I would have some progressive plans to announce here tonight.  I am sorry I am not ready to announce them tonight, but I hope to be in a position to announce the details of the new expanded scheme of private grants early in the new year.  The compensation which will involve a new premium payment for farmers to replace the present compensatory headage payments scheme which he referred to and the compensatory payments for forestry are under review at present and with EC agreement &mdash; which I expect shortly because there is to be a crucial meeting relating to that on 18 December &mdash; I shall be in a position to make final arrangements prior to an announcement.  The new proposals I have designed which are going for final approval before the Commission will be available to farmers throughout the country.  The Deputy knows the advantages to those who reside in the disadvantaged areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opening speech I referred to the extensive liaison between a number of public authorities in regard to some questions that had arisen about the effect on fishing waters with reference to salmon trout.  My exclusion of any reference to local authorities should not be taken as an implication that they are not consulted. Of course they are consulted very extensively, as indeed are the OPW in regard to private afforestation proposals. The views of both those bodies are taken <Col N="1148" /> into account by me before any decision is made in regard to approving private grant applications, and the terms of county development plans are monitored carefully by officals and ultimately by myself before making any decisions. Therefore, there is a very high level of liaison between local authorities and my Department in regard to matters affecting plans for private afforestation and public afforestation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan raised the question of Ballyseedy Wood.  I am very familiar with the concern expressed in the Kerry area in regard to this and have already discussed it with a number of Deputies from that constituency.  I assure the House that if any proposal is finally made in regard to the sale of the wood or any part of it it would require a licence from my Department.  To date I have received no such licence application although I know the matter is under consideration by Coillte Teoranta.  If and when I receive an application I will consider it very carefully as to what is the correct action to be taken, that is if a felling application is ever lodged with regard to Ballyseedy. Whatever fears Deputy Deenihan may have in regard to that I would like to ease them somewhat by saying I am keeping a very watchful eye on the developments in regard to that wood.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Kavanagh regarding the establishment of Coillte Teoranta that it was not the intention at the time the Bill was introduced that they would take control of private forestry.  They have an important role to play in expanding the public forestry sector.  The Government's policy is to see rapid expansion in both areas but the Deputy will recognise the historical fact that there has been up to recent years very little private forestry undertaken here and it has a long way to go to catch up with public forestry.  The intention during the term of the Government's plan is to increase public forestry to 15,000 hectares per annum and to bring private forestry up to that level.  Therefore, to achieve the Government's targets private forestry has to proceed in leaps and <Col N="1149" /> bounds whereas the public forestry section making steady but substantial progress annually can arrive at the targeted figure of 30,000 hectares, which will be a remarkable development in such a short time.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the lead role in all this continues to rest with Coillte Teoranta and I hope the Deputy will continue to give his full support to what we are doing.  I compliment him on the important role he played in preparing the way for the kind of developments now taking place in his own county.  I note also what he said about the upcoming anniversary of Charles Stewart Parnell. Although the suggestion he made may not be the way in which that major event will be recognised, I agree it is important that it should be recognised in a special way and I am anxious that my Department should play a leading role and make a contribution towards ensuring that the event is properly recognised and suitable arrangements are made to celebrate the anniversary.</P>

      <P>Forestry activity in this country is very decentralised.  It employs 2,500 people, of whom perhaps 90 per cent reside in scattered locations throughout almost all counties.  This is a Department which is in effect decentralised already and all that remains in Dublin is the headquarters staff.  It is planned to relocate part of this staff elsewhere, closer to the action on the ground. The Deputy will accept the continuing need to retain a cadre at an office in Dublin, but it will be very small compared to the overall numbers employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy Rabbitte to the proposed pulpwood factory and I take the point he was making.  We are not free agents in regard to the exact product to be manufactured.  A number of interested companies have been in discussion with the IDA.  The Department of Energy and Coillte Teoranta have been to the forefront in advising on the proposals.  We are not at the stage where <Col N="1150" /> any firm decisions can be made.  So far three serious proposals are under consideration.</P>

      <P>Whatever is best for the forestry industry and for the country will be the determining factor in regard to the type of industry eventually chosen and its location.  If there are very heavy investors coming in from outside, as is the case, they will have a very important say as to where they want to locate their industry. As far as my personal preference is concerned, I am anxious to try to establish a pulpwood industry in the north-west where we see large sources of supply coming on-stream in the years ahead. That would be the most advantageous location from the State's point of view if everything else falls into place.  We are not in a position yet to make that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a dramatic increase in private afforestation, representing an increase of 60 per cent on the 1988 figure. This indicates the success of the Government's effort to promote investment in forestry.  The bulk of investment to date has been in the public sector, resulting in the current position where some 85 per cent or 350,000 hectares of the forest area of Ireland is in public ownership.  While the contribution by the public sector will continue to be significant, the balance between public and private is changing rapidly and we can look forward to an ever-increasing contribution from the private sector.  It is particularly heartening to note that farmers are accounting for almost half of private planting, a fact which I do not think is generally known.  There is an impression that many large companies have made heavy investments and that private planting is in the hands of a few small companies.  That is not the position.  A very substantial number of medium and small farmers have availed of the attractive grants. Almost half of the private planting this year was undertaken by farmers who of necessity were planting smaller areas.  I <Col N="1151" /> hope that with the greatly increased range of grants to be announced early in January the number will increase very substantially.  The programme is supported by the IFA and the ICMSA and we are in close liaison with both organisations. We recognise their assistance and advice and thank them for their encouragement and for the dissemination of information to their members, which has largely resulted in this increased uptake by farmers.</P>
    <P>The new schemes are based on eight new regulations comprising the Community Forestry Action Programme which came into effect on 18 June, following adoption by the EC Council of Ministers.  These regulations represent for the first time a real EC forestry policy with significant funding.  During the past few months my Department have been pressing ahead with the adaptation of Ireland's forestry policies in the light of these new regulations.</P>

      <P>I hope to exceed that very substantially in the period of this plan.  I have the full support of the Taoiseach. His interest, help and support for the forestry programme has been quite <Col N="1152" /> remarkable and the amount we have succeeded in getting through the Structural Funds has been largely due to the active role played by the Taoiseach.  This has guaranteed the future success of the afforestation programme.  An operation programme proposing to implement many of the new measures has been submitted to Brussels and is being negotiated.</P>
      <P>As well as creating 2,000 new jobs in forestry in rural areas, the programme will increase the annual supply of wood raw material for industry from 1.5 million cubic metres in 1989 to 2 million cubic metres in 1993 and contribute to the diversification of the rural economy, providing farmers with an alternative line of production and thereby improving the farm structure.  We should, therefore, see further expansion in forestry next year and in the following years from the EC funding.  I would be grateful for the support of the House for the Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £200,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1989, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Energy, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain loans, subsidies, grants and a grant-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supplementary sum of £200,000 which I am now seeking from the Dáil relates to the necessity for my Department, on certain occasions, to secure specialist external consultancy advice. The subhead in question is thus A2 and before I dwell on the particular consultancy assignment that gives rise to this Supplementary Estimate, I would like to <Col N="1153" /> explain to the House why my Department, more than most, have to go outside and secure the best specialist advice available in order to discharge their functions to the best advantage of the State generally and the taxpayer in particular.</P>
    <P>It would not be overstating the case to state that the work of my Department is radically different in orientation to that of most other Government Departments. Routine administration takes somewhat of a back seat when you are dealing with natural resources and four or five different energy forms.  The emphasis is very much on policy and the complexity and diversity of the issues involved will be obvious to all concerned, and I do not need to dwell on them here tonight.  It will also be obvious that the magnitude of the resources involved &mdash; both potential and actual &mdash; are of such size that even the slightest gap in the State's knowledge and negotiating position could ultimately have a very detrimental impact on the economy.  My Department's position in this regard has always been that very valuable national natural resources are entrusted in our care and it would be the height of irresponsibility to treat that responsibility lightly.</P>
    <P>The Department of Energy is a small Department and we simply do not have all the expertise inside the Department to deal with the full range of eventualities and scenarios that we face.  We could, of course, carry a greatly expanded departmental salary bill, many extra and pensionable professionals, but this would be a wasteful and expensive approach with no guarantee of meeting evolving short term or once-off requirements.  We have, therefore, on occasions to go outside the public sector to secure the best expertise available.  Almost by definition, the best expertise does not come cheaply but the cornerstone of our policy in this respect is that there is no point in saving a penny wisely if you are going to spend a pound foolishly.  I think this policy has proved to be a very wise one over the years as witnessed by, for example, the excellent reports done in recent years on the electricity and gas sectors, and more recently <Col N="1154" /> the consultancy work which was performed on the sale of the State's shareholding in Tara Mines Limited.  It is payment for this latter work which brings me to the House this evening seeking the supplementary sum of £200,000.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that earlier this year my predecessor announced the successful disposal of the State shareholding and royalty entitlement in Tara Mines Limited for a global consideration of US$50 million.  The total sum received into the Exchequer was IR£35,300,577. The State's professional adviser in the transaction was NCB Corporate Finance Limited and the fee agreed for the services in question was 1.5 per cent of the total consideration plus VAT.  Accordingly a sum of IR£661,885 now falls due for payment.</P>
    <P>To enable Deputies to appreciate what was involved in this transaction, I will briefly outline the wide ranging scope of the assignment.  NCB assigned three senior executives full time to the task which covered an 18 month period from the beginning of 1988 to July of this year. They produced a very comprehensive report on the valuation of the State shareholding, royalty entitlement and certain other State rights and privileges.  A lot of work was put into this valuation process, not least because the shares in question were not publicly quoted.  Because there was no share price as such which would assist in the more typical take-over situation, we had to get our figures right and I am satisfied that we did.  NCB also paid particular attention to the strengths and weaknesses of the State's negotiating position and on the negotiating tactics to be employed.  The report formed the basis for the State's approach to the negotiations which resulted in agreement being reached on the figure of US$50 million after protracted negotiations. The compilation of the information for this detailed analysis involved the commissioning of independent research reports on metal prices and currency exchange rates from a number of internationally recognised firms.  It also involved an exhaustive review of the Tara mining operation and of the company's <Col N="1155" /> relationship with the State under the mining lease and associated agreements and projection of the company's cash flow over the remaining life of the mine.</P>
    <P>Preliminary negotiations commenced in August 1988.  An opening offer was made by Outokumpu, holders of the majority 75 per cent shareholding in Tara Mines Limited but it was rejected.  An improved offer was made in March 1989 and again rejected but in April an offer of US$50 million was accepted of which $37.5 million was to be paid on 30 June and the remainder in annual tranches over a five-year period.  In fact, the outstanding US$12.5 million has since been paid over.  NCB were actively involved in all stages of these negotiations.</P>
    <P>NCB's solicitors subsequently drafted the various agreements necessary to give legal effect to the settlement reached and the company also put arrangements in place which enabled the full amount due to be brought to the credit of the Exchequer without any delay and well ahead of the five year time scale envisaged in the agreement.</P>
    <P>The final outcome of the negotiations, as I have already pointed out, is that the Exchequer received US$50 million for the State shareholding and royalty in Tara Mines Limited, a substantial part of which will be used to upgrade the oil refinery facilities at Whitegate.  It will be crystal clear from what I have said this evening that NCB played a very important role in this achievement and, indeed, it is agreed by all concerned that a settlement at the level reached would not have been achieved without their expertise and whole hearted commitment.</P>
    <P>While the total cost of this consultancy assignment amounts to nearly £662,000, the supplementary sum which I am now seeking from the Dáil is less than a third of this figure.  By utilising savings achieved on other consultancies in subhead A2, and savings in subhead E &mdash; Minerals Development &mdash; combined with additional receipts, the supplementary sum now being sought is £200,000.  Leaving aside the unforeseen NCB assignment, my Department's need this year <Col N="1156" /> to secure specialist external consultancy advice has proved to be a good deal less than had been anticipated and this is particularly so in the case of the petroleum exploration side of my Department. We have saved £127,000 in this regard.</P>
    <P>In relation to subhead E &mdash; Minerals Development &mdash; a saving of £88,000 has been identified against the 1989 provision of £150,000.  This arises because an expected refund of royalty in respect of the Tynagh mining operation will not now take place this year.  The 1990 Estimates make provision for such a repayment.</P>
    <P>The additional receipts of £247,000 arise in two areas.  Firstly, there is a general buoyancy in fees related to the petroleum exploration sector and this will yield £138,000 more than that estimated. Secondly, receipts from the EC in respect of the FEOGA western aid electrification scheme will amount to £1.213 million this year, £152,000 more than estimated. After offsetting these savings and extra receipts, the net figure involved is £200,000.</P>
    <P>I commend this Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think today's debate speaks volumes about the lack of powers of scrutiny in this House in relation to decisions of this nature.  We had no opportunity to debate the decision to sell Tara Mines Limited either before or after that decision was made.  The Committee of Public Accounts are supposed to examine Ministers on their accountability for spending, but have no powers to investigate whether this sale achieved value for money.  The only decision this House was asked to make was to sanction work carried out by consultants, work which the House has not had the opportunity to see.  We are relying on a couple of lines in the Minister's speech in which he refers to that work which cost over £600,000 for four-and-a-half man years, a fairly hefty fee to the consultants of over £150,000 per man year.  I would like to see the work they did for that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in the Stone Age as far as accountability is concerned.  The UK <Col N="1157" /> have changed their legislation and recently we saw the Comptroller and Auditor General condemn the price received for the sale of the Rover Company as being an inadequate return to the taxpayers for their shareholding in the company.  I think we should have a situation where the Committee of Public Accounts could do the same.  Instead we have to nod through the payment to consultants for their work.  We are Dickensian in our approach.  I question seriously whether we got value for money.  The Minister obtained US $50 million, approximately IR£35 million for two items which he sold &mdash; (1) 25 per cent share in the company and (2) all royalties, past, present and future.  Those royalties stemmed from 1978 through to 1989 and for at least another 20 years' life of the mine, and are paid at 4½ per cent of the profits being earned.</P>
    <P>The Minister or his predecessors sought payment of £5 million for the royalties for the period 1978-1984.  Those years were not very profitable for the company and the subsequent years 1985 to 1989 would have been, at least, equally good and yielded another similar demand of about £5 million by the Irish Government. Taking those two periods together that £10 million was for the first third of the mine, the remaining two-thirds of the mine were still to come.  We must bear in mind that since they were related to profits, the remaining two-thirds of the mine would have been likely to yield the Government a much better royalty return because the company would have written off their fixed investment in the early years of the life of the mine and would have been coming into profitability in the latter part.  Added to that, zinc prices rose and are considerably better now than they were in the earlier part of the life of this mine.</P>
    <P>Taking the full life of the mine, I reckon that the State could have expected to get about £40 million in royalties. What do we find?  The Minister sold the royalties for £11 million.  That was the proportion of the overall £35 million that was attributable to the royalties. By no stretch of the imagination, <Col N="1158" /> even if the demand of £5 million for 1978-84 was in some way overstated, could we have reduced the royalty over the 30 year life of that mine to a mere £11 million.  I admit there were difficulties in hammering out exactly what was the base against which the royalty calculation would be made but I find it difficult to believe &mdash; and I would need very considerable convincing in this House &mdash; that those difficulties were of such magnitude that we would have to settle for £11 million.</P>
    <P>The second item which was sold was the shareholding.  I reckon that the after-tax profits in this company up to the end of 1989 were over £32 million on the basis of the figures which the Minister's predecessor provided at the time of the sale for past profitability in this company. The Irish Government's share on that basis would appear to be about £8 million for the profits which have already been earned in the company and the remaining two-thirds of the mine are likely to yield a better performance.  It would seem to me that we could have expected well over £30 million for our shareholding in this company.  Again, we find that the Minister agreed to far less than that figure. Both the Minister and his predecessor sought to justify his sale by reference to the purchase price which Outokumpu paid in 1986 for the 75 per cent share of the mine.  According to the Minister's own figures which I quote from the Official Report, they paid $90 million at that stage.  The State's 25 per cent share compared with 25 per cent for the company would have been about $30 million. The point that must be made is that Tara at that time were sustaining losses; they were trading unprofitably.  There has been an enormous increase in zinc prices since then.  The fact that the Minister sold this year our share for $34 million, a mere $4 million more than the 1986 valuation, would suggest a very poor recognition of the dramatically changed circumstances that are affecting Tara at present.</P>
    <P>One other item of evidence I suggest would argue that we have been sold a pup in this area.  At the time this Government sold their shareholding, the market was <Col N="1159" /> valuing 0.7 million tonnes of payable zinc in the Galmoy find at £39 million.  The Government's quarter share in 4.5 million tonnes of payable zinc at Tara would, on that valuation, be worth £60 million. That leaves aside the royalties that were rolled up in this deal.  On the face of it, we should not be asked to sanction, on the nod, the payment of £600,000 to consultants for what I consider was a bad bit of work for the taxpayer.  I would like in the brief time that is left to me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to turn to another point which only gets passing reference in this Estimate and that is the Valoren Programme.  It strikes me that we have been very poorly served by the Minister's two predecessors in the whole area of conservation policy.  This is one area where the future generations will judge that we have sorely neglected our responsibilities.  We have absolutely no strategy for conservation.  The Government have cut back their commitment dramatically in this area.  I was somewhat encouraged to hear the Minister say he saw some sense in bringing forward a strategy but it was pathetic to hear that all he had in mind was a pilot study to see how his own offices were being heated and maintained.  That is not a conservation strategy.  We are well beyond the time when one runs pilot studies in one's own Department buildings.  The position is that numerous international agencies have been into this country.  We have had assessments of Government buildings, we have had assessments of combined heat and power and we have had assessments of the energy intensity of Irish industry, all of which indicate that we are well out of line.  We are using 25 per cent more energy in industry per pound produced than is European industry. The Government could, on existing technology, save 20 per cent of their bills for heating and lighting in their own Department buildings.  We have criminally neglected combined heat and <Col N="1160" /> power.  We have very large industries in Ireland, for example, NET, Aughinish and Whitegate &mdash; the Minister's own responsibility &mdash; which surely could adopt combined heat and power systems and use very economically our natural gas resource.  These opportunities have been left entirely untouched.  I urge the Minister to give more serious thought to the use of Valoren money and the money that succeeds it to have a decent conservation strategy for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I confess to having some difficulties in complying with the Minister's request that the House accept his request to sanction this Estimate of additional funds for the Department of Energy.  It is not as if the Minister was coming in here to write a blank cheque, in fact, he is looking for an endorsement of a cheque that was written many months ago.  I have to question some aspects of what the Minister has outlined to us in his statement here this evening.</P>
      <P>My first question relates to the sum of £661,885 which falls due for payment to NCB Corporate Finance LImited for services offered to the Department in relation to advising and negotiating the deal with Outokumpu for the disposal of the Government's share in Tara mines.  I want to question the Minister in relation to the choice of consultants, in relation to what procedures were undergone before these consultants were brought into the Department and in relation to what expertise these consultants were offering which was not available to the Department internally or which had not been made available previously to the Department in relation to dealings with the minerals section of the Department.  I hope the Minister can clarify what previous experience the three senior executives who were assigned full time to work for the Department on this deal for an 18 month period had in dealing with the acquisition or disposal of State assets in the mining industry or if they had ever been involved in negotiations of this sort before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to give <Col N="1161" /> some information on how the fee was agreed because the Minister and the Department would have been in a very strong position to dictate it.  A far more resonable fee could have been negotiated in relation to those who would have been available and willing to take on that sort of employment.  The 1.5 per cent may sound like a small sum but, given the large disposal sum on the mine, it obviously amounted to a very large sum for 18 months' work for three senior executives.  The Department could have dictated a far more reasonable sum for the taxpayer to bear.  Perhaps the Minister would give an indication of the consultants' experience and what they had been involved in previously in relation to mining which might assuage the suspicions and fears surrounding this contract.</P>
    <P>I also have to ask what amount of work was done on behalf of the Department of Energy because my recollection is that most, if not all the facts &mdash; other than a certain amount of updating &mdash; would have been available to Minister Molloy's predecessor and his officials in the Department in relation to the ongoing saga of the Tara-Bula negotiations and discussions.  All the information was available and all the valuations of the reserves in the mine had been done.  I cannot, for the life of me, understand what was required in relation to a comprehensive report because in relation to the valuation of the mine it was only necessary to take down books from the shelf.  There are people in the Department of Energy with far more experience in relation to mining and the valuation of mines than the people who were brought in from NCB Finance Limited.  What new information was made available to the Department which was not there already?  I accept that some indexation and additional valuations were necessary but not enough to warrant consultancy fees for 18 months at around £200,000 per head per annum.</P>
    <P>In relation to the payment, perhaps the Minister will clarify whether a sum of 35 per cent has been retained by the Department in relation to retention tax? <Col N="1162" /> If that is the case it would put more respectability on the payment because my understanding is that retention tax is deduction from payment by the State to consultants and people working for it.  As a matter of public interest, the Minister should inform the House whether this has been done.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to know if we got value for money.  Some of us believe that we did not in relation to the royalties due and those which have been due for a considerable period, since the development of the mine.  I suspect that the opportunity to get rid of a nagging and ongoing problem &mdash; one which, in retrospect, prior to Outokumpu's involvement, the Department of Energy had received very little co-operation on from the owners of the Tara Mine &mdash; involved more enthusiasm than wisdom in getting rid of the State's interest in the mine.</P>
    <P>Looking at the differential and the improvement in zinc values from the time of the Outokumpu purchase of Tara's interest until the time of the State's disposal of its interest, I, like Deputy Bruton, am of the opinion that we did not get current day values in relation to the mine's worth.  Obviously there is little we can do now because the Minister is really coming in here to do a lap of honour in relation to the money that has been committed and spent.  Needless to say, contracts have been signed.</P>
    <P>I should also like some clarification in relation to the contract because even though there are staff shortages in the offices of the Attorney General and the State Solicitor, I should like the Minister to explain why outside solicitors were engaged in drawing up the contract.  I know from my own experience that the Attorney General's office is very well versed in the intricacies of State mining and in the interests of Tara.  I would have thought it was well within the competence of the legal officers in the Attorney General's office and &mdash; needless to say &mdash; within the Attorney General's own competence, to draw up the necessary contracts.  It is surprising that an outside consultancy brought in their <Col N="1163" /> own firm of solicitors.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us the name of the legal firm who drew up the contracts because it should be a matter of public record.  I should like the Minister to name them in the House and to say why the Attorney General's office were not engaged in doing this work.  I know from my own experience in the Department of Energy that the Attorney General's office had day-to-day involvement, over a considerable period, in matters of this kind and would have been totally versed in the question of the disposal of the State's interest in this contract.  Obviously the work was not put out to tender by the Minister and what happened in regard to the disposal to Outokumpu still leaves a bad taste in relation to the conduct of mining in this country right from the start of the Tara-Bula saga.  We have lost out badly in this regard and the opportunity to salvage anything has gone forever.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to address some of the questions I put to him because his initial statement leaves more unsaid than said in relation to looking for a Supplementary Estimate of £200,000 &mdash; a substantial sum of money &mdash; and the sanction of the House for a sum of £661,805 to consultants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In many ways it is fitting that the taxpayer in respect of this entire matter should receive one last slap in the face because the saga of the Tara Mines experience has been of insulting proportions to the taxpayer who has been ripped off since the first exploitation of that mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to make a point which has not been made by Deputies Bruton or Spring concerning the original arrangement which provided for an annual royalty of 4.5 per cent on the profits of the ore extracted from this mine.  After spending years complaining that we had no resources in this country we found we were in possession of the largest lead zinc deposit in Europe and the best we could manage was a 25 per cent stake and a disastrously flawed lease which allowed <Col N="1164" /> Tara Mines, as they then were, to pay us &mdash; or not pay us as it turned out &mdash; a 4.5 per cent levy on profits rather than on ore extracted.  It was a disastrous error. I realise it is easy to be wise with the benefit of hindsight but I am one of a number of people who was concerned at that time, with colleagues from the Labour Party and The Workers' Party, in what was called the resources protection campaign and we predicted that error then and argued for the retention of that very valuable mine in public ownership. It did not happen.  What we are asked to approve this evening retrospectively constitutes really the final slap in the face for the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Tara Mines commenced operations in 1978 and managed until 1982 &mdash; through managing their capital allowance entitlements and so on &mdash; to declare that no royalty was payable.  When the State tried to levy such royalty it was disputed by the company on a number of grounds, including whether the losses from one year could be carried forward to another year.  They went further, in the dispute with the State, to extend the area of disagreement into those concerning the deductibility of exchange losses on foreign loans, deductibility of interest on loans, the timing of capital allowances and so on.  Anybody could have known that any multinational company could use the legal mechanisms there without any difficulty to contrive not to show a profit and to leave the taxpayer from the wealthiest ore deposit in Europe with nothing but the jobs that are being provided in the town of Navan.  In my view that constituted one of the most serious errors ever made in the management of the affairs of this country.  Our being asked to pass this Supplementary Estimate this evening simply rubs salt into that wound.</P>
    <P>I had an opportunity some morning last week, as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, to visit the mine at Navan.  During our discussions with Outokumpu we were given certain minimal information but, so far, more than we managed to get from the Department of Energy although we will be returning to our examination of the Accounting <Col N="1165" /> Officer.  According to Outokumpu the $50 million referred to consists of two separate elements &mdash; $33.4 million for the shares and $16.6 million for the royalties &mdash; as Deputies Richard Bruton and Spring have said &mdash; past and future.  I did not know about the introduction of this estimate until today but on the basis of the information and advice available to me, I should like to have had more opportunity to adduce certain evidence here because that was a lousy deal for the taxpayer, measured by any yardstick. The Outokumpu people confirmed that there is approximately two-thirds life expectancy of the mine remaining which does indeed bear out the contention that it is the largest lead zinc deposit in Europe.  They suggested a life expectancy of 17 to 19 years; equally that could be 25 years.  They suggested 47 to 49 million tonnes of ore remaining; again, as we know, it could well exceed that.  For example, between 1977 and 1986 that mine produced and exported some 4.25 million tonnes of lead and zinc concentrate at a value of £608 million but the manner of the granting of the lease ensured that we could never claw back any royalty for that.  I should make the point that, of course, the State finally became so frustrated in attempting to extract some payment for the taxpayer it ended up throwing its hands up in the air and surrendering to Outokumpu because it was not possible to work out with Tara Mines any reasonable share of the take. Eventually we ended up selling it in what, in my view, was the sale of the century. Having done that, having been forced to dispose of it &mdash; because we could not get any decent share for the taxpayer &mdash; what happens?  The £33.4 million for the shares ended up costing us now, in consultancy fees, over £500,000, which is in excess of £1.5 million of the value got for the shares.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the Minister's presentation of the figures here.  I must say they differ dramatically, unrecongnisably from the view taken by the Minister's former colleague, Deputy Pat O'Malley, inside and outside this House earlier this year.</P>

That is so unrecognisably different from what the Minister has put forward this evening I must presume he is disowning his former colleagues and defending blatant croneyism because that is what is at stake here.</P>

      <P>Before I do I want to make quite clear that this is a blatant case of croneyism, a case of using the Fianna Fáil bankers, the principal of which &mdash; NCB &mdash; is a close associate of the Taoiseach, handing out a contract at exorbitant rates.  To a man who I understand aspires now to be president of all the Europeans I would respectfully suggest that &mdash; while he is working on the reunification of Germany &mdash; nowhere in the corruption in the GDR régime will he find anything to rank on a par with the handing over of this amount of money to one of his croneys to put a valuation on <Col N="1167" /> a stake that belonged to the State, and which we were forced to sell out because of our inability to extract any share from Tara Mines at the time.  It is a disgrace that we should now be called to approve that retrospectively.  It constitutes a disgraceful page in our history.</P>

      <P>One of the difficulties of dealing with a Supplementary Estimate of this kind &mdash; in respect of which a valuation has been put on something &mdash; is that it is fair game for people, who have not access to the exact information, to allow their imaginations range over the whole field.  I heard some extraordinary figures pulled out of the sky here this evening.  I was surprised at Deputy Richard Bruton &mdash; whom one would have thought would have some knowledge in this area &mdash; entering into that game.  All the same it is a fact that exaggerated claims have been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only give them this assurance: they recongnise that I was not in the Department at that time and that I would bring a fairly independent mind to bear on what I saw.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1168" /> In regard to the amount achieved by way of this particular sale &mdash; the US $50 million &mdash; it is fair to say that a good deal was done for the State.  I have very good reason for saying that and I hope that Members on the other side have some trust in my judgement on that matter, not having reason to make any claims otherwise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton claimed that the Department had put a valuation of £4.5 million on the royalties for the period 1978 to 1984.  The Department were in a negotiating position.  They were in a difficulty in that the original agreement with the Revenue Commissioners which allowed the royalties to be based upon a percentage of corporation profits meant it was quite difficult to know exactly the figure for profits.  From what I can judge, a lengthy dispute might have been entered into on this matter which might even involve court cases and further expense for the State.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the House that the Revenue Commissioners were asked by the Department of Energy to prepare profit and royalty computations and they confirmed the view expressed in March 1987 that there was a strong possibility that no royalty would be payable for the years 1978-84 inclusive.  They estimated that with cumulative corporation profit tax on profits from 1985-88 of approximately £51 million the royalty would be of the order of £2.3 million.  It was stressed that this was a highly optimistic figure and that £1.5 million would be a far more likely figure.  That was the Revenue Commissioners' estimate.  The realistic royalty expectations in respect of the period 1978-88 were estimated by the Revenue Commissioners to range in the region of £1.5 million to £2.3 million but that was not brought to a conclusion because the negotiations for the sale were entered into at a later date.  It is important to put that on the record and to try to kill the notion that elaborate figures would be available to the State had it held out.</P>
    <P>The arrangement under which the royalties were decided had worked very successfully in the case of previous mining operations, notably in the case of <Col N="1169" /> Tynagh.  It now transpires that the company who were mining at Tynagh overpaid the royalties and at present the State are repaying some small amounts to them.  These are amounts they had paid on account which turned out not to have been due following the Revenue Commissioners' final computation of the amounts.  The arrangement had worked successfully in that case but it certainly did not work successfully in the case of Tara Mines who ran into a series of difficulties when no profits were determined for years.  Obviously there were difficult and complex arguments to be worked out before a final decision could be arrived at as to what exactly would have been due in relation to royalties.</P>
    <P>I have studied the estmates made by NCB who, in the opinion of the trusted senior officials of the Department, gave excellent service as regards the expertise they brought to bear in making the assessment and carrying out the task that they were asked to do by the State.  Their work was of an outstanding nature and I would like to thank them for it.  The sum seems to be a large one but in a case such as this it is important from the Minister's point of view to encourage the optimum sale price.  Other systems of remuneration could have been used which would have scaled down the percentage payable to the consultants as the figure became higher but with that kind of remuneration system the incentive is not there for the consultants to seek the highest possible price.  On balance, one has to accept that the price achieved was considered outstanding in the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £214,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1989, for salaries and expenses of the Office of the Attorney General including a grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The Supplementarty Estimate I am moving today for the office of the Attorney General requires an additional sum of £14,000 for the travelling and incidental expenses subhead which provides for the office expenses, subsistence, travelling and other incidental payments of both the Attorney General's Office and the Chief State Solicitor's Office. An additional sum of £200,000 for the counsel's fees subhead which provides for the payment of all fees due to counsel engaged on behalf of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on counsels' fees to date has been higher than anticipated at the beginning of the year and the additional sum of £200,000 will be required to fund this subhead to year end.  The volume of expenditure reflects a high throughput of cases through the courts and also the large volumes of litigation, mainly against the State, being handled by the Attorney General's office.  The volume of litigation cannot be known in advance and it is very difficult to forecast expenditure under this subhead with accuracy. However, Deputies should note that, even including the additional amount of £200,000, total expenditure on this subhead in 1989, at £790,000, will still be significantly less than the 1988 outturn figure of £1,070,000.</P>
      <P>The excess on incidental expenses is largely attributable to the cost of security at the office of the Chief State Solicitor which is £55,000 per annum.  These costs were formerly shared with the Revenue Commissioners.  However, as a number of the Revenue staff vacated this building earlier in the year, a greater than anticipated proportion of the cost will now have to be borne by the Attorney General's Vote in 1989.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not be opposing the Estimate but I should like to make two points in relation to it.  My first point relates to the need, as I see it, for an overall review of the legal services provided by the State.  I note that we are providing a total of £790,000 for fees to counsel under the Vote for the Attorney General's office.  Last week we dealt with a Vote for the Director of Public Prosecution's office which, essentially, was to increase the amount for counsels' fees to about £1.2 million.  That makes a total of <Col N="1175" /> about £2 million for counsels' fees between the two offices.  I am not objecting to the barristers being paid their proper entitlements but I wonder whether the time is now right for the State to look at the way legal services are delivered by the State and whether the State is getting full value for the substantial sums of money being paid out.</P>
      <P>That point was highlighted last week where a rape charge was struck out by a district justice because the book of evidence was not ready.  I am not pointing the finger at anybody but that case brings home to us the need to have our offices, be they the Director of Public Prosecution's office, the Chief State Solicitor's office or the Attorney General's office, functioning properly.  I do not know if it was in relation to the case of last week, the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions was overworked, but overall there is an onus on the Minister for Finance to make sure that the very substantial sums of money being expended are being spent in a cost effective manner, and if there are problems in the Office of the Attorney General or the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, he should carry out an efficiency audit.  It might conceivably be a better bet to increase the number of staff in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions rather than to expend the kind of money we are talking about in this Supplementary Estimate and in the Supplementary Estimate for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions which we discussed last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I want to make on this Supplementary Estimate relates to the Law Reform Commission.  I am saddened that the need to expend some more money on law reform is not being taken on board.  We need to establish a separate criminal law reform commission because of the need to reform, revise and codify our criminal code.  I hope the Minister for Finance will be sympathetic to the case being made in that regard.  The allocation for the existing Law Reform Commission is around one third of £1 million, and I think he has to give sympathetic consideration to the case being <Col N="1176" /> made for a separate subhead for a criminal law reform commission in the very near future.  I cede to my colleague, Deputy Enright who has a couple of points to make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in introducing the Supplementary Estimate referred to large volumes of litigation, mainly against the State.  That is right and it has been an increasing phenomenon in recent years.  This is a source of concern and is exhausting inordinate amounts of public funds and it has grown by leaps and bounds.  If we look at the reports of the Law Reform Commission, the High Court and Supreme Court, we can see the amount of time and expense being spent on litigation against the State.  It is time we sat back and looked at what is going on.  It is correct to say that some of this litigation is unavoidable but a great deal of it could be avoidable with a measure of forethought and care.  If Ministers and civil servants were prepared on occasion to listen a bit more carefully and pay more attention to the combined wisdom of this House instead of relying all the time as they, unfortunately, all too often tend to do on the more narrow base of a few civil servants in their Departments, a great deal of public money on litigation against the State might be saved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give the example of road traffic summonses.  In connection with this matter a Bill was brought in and rushed through to try to remedy a defect which had appeared in the summonses procedure. I and other Deputies came into this House and pointed out that we had reservations that this Bill would meet the needs of the situation, but we were told, following the usual nod across the stairway, that, on the best possible advice of the Attorney General's office and the officials, everything would be okay and that they had checked it out.  They may have checked it out and they may have thought they had the best possible advice, but when the matter came back to the <Col N="1180" /> High Court and the Supreme Court it turned out that our fears as expressed in this House on that occasion were well founded and that he did not have the best possible advice.  They just were not prepared to listen.</P>
    <P>It would be a tremendous help and could be a big saving on public funds if Ministers and their officials would on occasion listen to the contributions made, with the best intentions, by many Members in this House.  The overall question of this increase in litigation is a matter fit for review by the Attorney General's office, because the thing is getting out of hand.  Any matter that involves any trip-up seems to be ending up in the High Court and the Supreme Court.  I do not know what can be done to try to deal with that, but it will build up further if it is not tackled.  Henceforth care will have to be taken in Government Departments who will have to be much more responsive to representations made on legislation and will have to take more heed of Members of the House when they contribute on legislation much of which finds its way unchallenged under the Constitution in the courts.  The procedures for the referral of Bills to the Supreme Court at an early stage should be availed of more because that would put legislation beyond the yea or nae of challenge in the courts on the grounds of unconstitutionality.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe talked about extending the Law Reform Commission and perhaps having a separate commission to deal with criminal matters, but what we really need is more notice to be taken of the existing Law Reform Commission. We should make use of the expertise already available and we should use the reports and recommendations produced by the Commission.  I keep a shelf in my office where I aggregate the Commission reports.  They are coming out at a spanking rate, and more power to them.  The gratitude of the House is due to the commission. However, the implementation of the reports in legislation is a different matter.  That is not being done perhaps because there is inadequate staff in the Attorney General's office to produce the legislation based on those reports.  What is the point in spending upwards of <Col N="1181" /> £300,000 a year on the Law Reform Commission when the reports are left to gather dust on the shelves?  Most of the reports are non-controversial and could be dealt with by this House sitting every Friday.  I am sure all the Members of the House would contribute to such legislation. I have urged before that that procedure be adopted and I put it again now to the Minister for Finance who is in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the additional supplementary estimate in relation to the Office of the Attorney General.  I accept that it is perhaps impossible to estimate accurately at the beginning of any year what will be needed so we have the practice that supplementary estimates of this kind are moved with a view to seeking the additional funds to discharge counsel and other legal fees incurred by the Office of the Attorney General at the end of each year.  Last year on the debate on a similar supplementary estimate the Minister involved was helpful to this House in terms of giving some breakdown on the cases responsible for the extra expenditure in that year.  The Crotty case, for instance, had consumed a lot of the previous year's litigation. The settlement of counsel fees was only resolved last year.  That was an addition to the list and encumbrances of the Department and of the Office of the Attorney General.  A number of other cases were referred to and we were able to comment on the need and the propriety for perhaps a broader approach by the Attorney General in terms of what should be contested and how often these issues should be contested so fully in our courts.  Why have we not been afforded some information this year as to the type of cases, if not the particular cases that required this type of expenditure?  I wonder how many cases, for instance, involved the extradition process that is now seen to be debated and agitated through the High and Supreme Courts by people who are wanted for the prosecution of serious crimes in other jurisdictions. How much of this extra expenditure for instance arises from garda assault cases where the Attorney General defends those cases?  It seems <Col N="1182" /> that there is an increase in these kinds of actions in the High Court.  How many of them are being fought but which would be better disposed of by way of amicable settlement before full agitation is taken on in the High Courts?  The problem is that often a settlement is seen to reflect badly on the officer or officers involved, but that should not be allowed develop as a practice.  If there is a case to be met, in some instances the settlement process is a better way to deal with it with no adverse reaction down the line to the member involved.  How much of the extra cost here relates to the lible case involving members of the Department of Justice arising from a TV programme that sought to put a critical light on the administration of our prisons?  That was a very hotly contested action and I had grave reservations about the extent to which the taxpayer should have been asked to pay for the costs involved.  I understand that there was indemnity offered to the person involved before the action was launched. It was certainly close to the border line, if not on it, at the time.  We are entitled to some information other than the Minister just saying that this is an overrun on expenditure.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General operates a scheme known as the Attorney General's scheme and it allows for the payment of lawyers' fees, counsel included, for issues on the State side, issues particularly involving <i>habeus corpus</i> applications and extradition applications where the representative assigned by the court to represent an impecunious applicant is paid for through this scheme.  There is a huge disparity between what is paid to the lawyer on the defendent's side as opposed to what is paid to the counsel or lawyer on the State side.  That should be addressed.  The fees paid on the impecunious applicant's side as assigned by the courts are paid on a par with the criminal legal aid scheme of District Court or High Court level.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for contributing to the debate.  It will not be possible to deal with all the points in two minutes but in relation to Deputy O'Keeffe's question on staffing, he will recall that when the Supplementary Estimate for the Chief State Solicitor's office and for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions were being discussed, I said that where it became a good business decision to put in more solicitors and technicians, I did that.  I continue to keep a very vigilant eye on overruns in costs. Despite the fact that there is an overrun here which is very difficult to estimate at the start of the year, expenditure was still £280,000 less in 1989 than it was in 1988.</P>
      <P>On the question of how many of the cases arose out of litigation and Members' contributions not being listened to in the House, I tell Deputy Taylor most of the money I am talking about here is in regard to the general area of accidents and such cases.  I am surprised Deputy Taylor made that point tonight in the House.</P>
      <P>I have listened very attentively to Committee Stage debates of all the major legislation I have brought through the House this year and in the past couple of years.  I am never slow to adopt amendments if they are reasoned amendments and will contribute to a Bill.  The Deputy will recall that only in the past week or so he has been in my office with other spokespersons from various parties trying to address the very sensitive issue of disabled drivers.  Information on this issue will be published tomorrow. We have gone a long way to resolve the very sensitive problems that were there.  I have been open to accept amendments not alone to the Finance Bill but to the Central Bank Bill.  I always listen attentively and where there is a good, reasoned amendment I will be happy at any time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The expenditure would not alone go through the roof but up to Heaven if I were to be attentive to everybody who wanted everything.  However, everything gets a fair run.  At the same time I will continue to hold the level of expenditure because it is in the interests of the economy that I do so.</P>

      <P>The decision of the British Government and the British Prime Minister Mrs. Thatcher to repatriate, or more correctly deport, as many as 44,000 of the 56,000 Vietnamese people who fled Vietnam as a result of the cruel totalitarian rule in that area and who travelled by boat &mdash; many of them did not arrive at their destination and were lost at sea because of the flimsiness of the craft in which they had to travel &mdash; has aroused the international indignation of the world.  Ireland should join in expressing that indignation and be seen to condemn the British Government's decision to repatriate the boat people. The EC of which Ireland and Great <Col N="1185" /> Britain are members, the USA, the United Nations and Amnesty International have all joined in this condemnation.</P>
      <P>The fact that in a few short days our Taoiseach will be President of the EC allows me to raise this issue with him and I was given the opportunity here today to do so and to express on behalf of the Irish people and many of the people of Europe and in the Community our disgust at this decision.  There is stiff opposition throughout Britain itself to it which the British Labour Party voiced very forcibly in the House of Commons yesterday. Mr. Stanley Clinton Davis &mdash; a former Commissioner of the EC, now Chairman of the British Refugee Council &mdash; said the action must be condemned by all civilised people.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the Minister's reply here tonight to say that the Irish voice will be heard clearly in this condemnation because we as a people have known for many centuries what it is to be under the heel of British rule, but never, even after the Famine when people fled in many directions to Australia, America and other parts of the world, were Irish people repatriated.  Therefore, a country like Ireland should have its voice heard throughout the international community and because of this despicable decision of the British Government should be seen to be aware and have sympathy with these people and condemn the British Government's action.  That condemnation should be sent through the British Ambassador to the Prime Minister and the Government of Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague Deputy Liam Kavanagh for sharing his time with me and, as spokesman on international affairs for the Labour Party, I am very glad of the opportunity of expressing on behalf of the party our abhorrence at the appalling behaviour of Mrs. Thatcher and her Government in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of issues are at stake and I would like to say a word or two about them in elaboration of the points Deputy Kavanagh made.  In the first instance, Ireland in assuming the Presidency of the <Col N="1186" /> Community will have particular responsibility in relation to the whole process of foreign policy within the Community.  At this stage we should make absolutely clear our stand in relation to Mrs. Thatcher's behaviour.  Mrs. Thatcher, the British Prime Minister, is operating in flagrant violation of international consultation. Even her closest ally in all circumstances, the US, issued a statement today condemning the action she has taken in relation to the forced expulsion of Vietnamese people from Hong Kong. In doing so the US referred to the Geneva meeting at which an accord was reached between the US, Vietnam and Britain on the orderly handling of this problem.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised, and I noted in Irish foreign policy, that there is a constraint on us at times from certain elements of the public and press who would wish that we be silent on Mrs. Thatcher's behaviour in the international context because it is perceived as being unhelpful in relation to bilateral relations.  Her record in relation to international policy &mdash; I have described it elsewhere as international terrorism &mdash; must be remembered. She is the Prime Minister who ordered the sinking of a ship in retreat to international waters in the Malvinas affair.  Many of the world community to their shame were silent on that occassion. It was in breach of every principle of international law.</P>
    <P>What is at stake in the matter before us is the issue of refugees and migrants. I am very interested in a statement made by Stanley Clinton Davis with whom I had the honour of serving in Basle and in Nicaragua on the Committee for the Defence of Refugees and Emigrants.  His very judicious comments, issued by somebody with training in law, refer to a number of seedy aspects to this decision: the deporting of people at 5 a.m., the majority of whom were children, is in itself disgraceful; 26 children, 18 men and seven women were deported at 5 a.m. The Governor-General of Hong Kong suggested that the due process of investigation into all the circumstances of each individual was taken; that left it open in regard to the knock-on effect on the 44,000 people who were to be dealt with. The question has been reasonably raised: <Col N="1187" /> what procedures of investigation have been taken in relation to the rights of children, particularly children without parents or guardians?</P>
    <P>There are other aspects that are very important.  Ireland as a member of the UN with a particular interest in the decolonisation work of the UN should take an interest in this matter.  Having referred to the US's condemnation of Mrs. Thatcher's behaviour, there is an element of crocodile tears and hypocrisy in this because precluding the right of entry to the US of North Vietnamese citizens is not an insignificant factor in the whole affair.  We in the Labour Party are interested in the rights of migrants and refugees and people who have been forced from their home anywhere.  It is very interesting to contrast the rhetoric of Mrs. Thatcher in relation to the free mobility of capital and her statements this evening as reported on the news that the Hong Kong people had to bear more than they could take, which smacks of racism.  Mrs. Thatcher's policies have a knock-on effect not only in relation to the remaining people in Hong Kong but also in her general attitude towards migrants and to the rights of refugees.</P>
    <P>It is important that Ireland, before we assume the Presidency of the European Community, should distance itself from this outrageous breach of humanity on an international scale and that we condemn it and express our concern for the rights of all the people involved.  We should also insist in our participation in the community of international affairs that when people sit at conference, such as took place at the Geneva meeting, the accords which have been reached should be respected.  It is very clear that Mrs. Thatcher's behaviour is consistent with what I have no reservation in referring to as international terrorism in relation to the Malvinas affair.  Now she is revealing her thinly veiled racism in relation to immigrant and refugee issues.  Our Taoiseach would have the support of my party in addressing these issues and expressing regard for elementary humanity and respect for the rights of movement of people from one territory to another. <Col N="1188" /> These rights need to be respected now more than ever.</P>
    <P>It is important that on our behalf a very strong statement be made, as Deputy Kavanagh has suggested, through the British Ambassador and that this be communicated immediately.  We should communicate it further to our partners in the European Community.  I should like assurances in both these regards from the Minister of State.</P>

      <P>I share the concern expressed by the two Deputies about the decision by the Hong Kong authorities to commence the repatriation, against their wishes, of Vietnamese &ldquo;boat-people&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In June Ireland joined with other countries represented at the International Conference on Indochinese Refugees, held in Geneva, in endorsing a &ldquo;Declaration and Comprehensive Plan of Action&rdquo; on the question of IndoChinese refugees.  In accordance with the plan, the &ldquo;boat-people&rdquo;&mdash; including those who landed in Hong Kong &mdash; were to be screened by countries of first asylum to determine whether they met the internationally-accepted definition of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo;&mdash; namely, a person with a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.  Those who so qualified were to be eligible for resettlement in third countries.  Those who did not qualify as &ldquo;refugees&rdquo; were to return to Vietnam.  However, it was clearly understood that every effort would be made to encourage them to return voluntarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against this background, it is regrettable that the Hong Kong authorities have commenced repatriation of &ldquo;boat-people&rdquo; who do not wish to return to Vietnam.  I must acknowledge, of course, that the authorities in Hong Kong are faced with a very difficult situation given, on the one hand, the continued flow of &ldquo;boat-people&rdquo; into the small colony and, on the other hand, the increasing reluctance of third countries to accept Vietnamese for resettlement.  It is my hope that the Hong Kong authorities will consider the appeals that have been <Col N="1189" /> addressed to them from many quarters to suspend any further involuntary repatriation at least until the international community has been given an opportunity to further assess the situation, with a view to coming up with a more acceptable solution based on the comprehensive plan agreed at the Geneva conference in June last.</P>
    <P>Ireland has played its part in the international community's effort to address the tragic plight of the Vietnamese &ldquo;boat-people&rdquo;, by accepting since 1979 over 400 Vietnamese for resettlement in this country.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the interest displayed by the Deputies in this matter of international importance and I hope that the Hong Kong authorities will take the opinions of the international world into account in arriving at their decisions in this very important issue.  I hope that the Vietnamese people will be treated with the utmost care and compassion.</P>

      <P>The question we raise in the House this evening relates primarily to the future of the 15 megawatt coal-burning power station in Arigna.  While that is very serious, there is nevertheless a <Col N="1190" /> broader and more serious allied question, namely the future of coal mining in Arigna.</P>
      <P>On 29 October last the ESB announced that they intended to close the coal-burning generating station, making 57 people redundant.  Since 95 per cent of the coal mined in the area is consumed in the power station this means too the cessation and closure of coal mining in the Arigna region.  This is an industry which is almost 150 years old and the closure of mining will bring just over 200 future redundancies.  The combined closures of the power station and mining will put over 260 men on the dole, most of them in the age range 20 to 45 years and married with families.</P>
      <P>Given what has been said and promised over the past decade and given the economic and social facts, the people of Arigna have every reason to expect better.  Let us go back just ten years to 1979.  In the years immediately prior to that it was said that the reserves of high grade coal were running out.  The debate centred on how to use the lower grade coal called &ldquo;crow coal&rdquo; so abundant in the area.  That debate was brought to an end when Mr. George Colley announced that the Government had sanctioned the construction by the ESB of a second power station in Arigna to burn this crow coal, which new technologies had made easy and economical. The output of the station was to be 45 megawatts and work, according to the promise, would commence in 1980.  Work did not commence in 1980 and by late 1981 it was obvious that the ESB were having second thoughts.  The community and the unions organising the miners became active and sought from the Government and the ESB the exact position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be recalled that early in 1982 there was the second of the three-in-a-row general elections.  The second power station for Arigna became a major election issue in the Roscommon and Sligo-Leitrim constituency.  Of course the people were given assurances, as they always are on these occasions.  At a famous public meeting in Drumshambo on 14 February 1982 a letter was read out to hundreds of locals, including almost <Col N="1191" /> all the employees in the collieries and the power station.  The letter, they were told by the speaker, Mr. Seán Doherty, who happens now to be Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, was given under the hand and seal of Charles J. Haughey and it promised that if Fianna Fáil were returned to office work on the power station would commence immediately. Fianna Fáil were returned to office and needless to say, in keeping with their tradition, the promise was not kept. When the ESB unions met the board of the ESB later that year they were told the Cabinet had shelved &mdash; indeed killed &mdash; the idea of a second power station, notwithstanding the fact that one of the members of that Cabinet had read out the famous, or perhaps infamous, Drumshambo promise.</P>
    <P>After further negotiations involving the new Government elected in November of that year, the ESB and the unions, an agreement was reached that the present 15 megawatt station would be maintained and kept going as long as there was coal of sufficent quality to burn in it and no major mechanical breakdown in the station. That remained the position.  Deputy Spring, the Minister for Energy, in 1985 reiterated the arrangement.  There were no breakdowns and the supply of coal at 45,000 tonnes per year had no difficulty in being met.  That remained the situation without change until the ESB bombshell announcement on 29 October last.</P>
    <P>In terms of output the power station is the fifth most efficent in the ESB's grid of power stations.  The Minister will no doubt try to counter this argument by saying that Arigna coal is expensive to produce and imported coal is much cheaper.  That is true and we accept it. However, we could argue, for example, that we could buy cheaper beef on the world market than Irish-produced beef since the world price of beef is just about half our intervention supported price. The same could be said about our dairy industry but we do not argue in that way because when we take all the economic implications into account there is no validity in that argument.  I submit that these kinds of arguments about our native coal have similar degrees of invalidity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> The Minister simply cannot let this unique region and its industry die.  Arigna mines are the last working coal-mines in Ireland and the three collieries involved are the last privately owned collieries in Europe.  There are alternatives and the Government must apply them.  One option is the recently announced EC RECHAR programme for the regeneration of declining coal-mining areas. We understand it is to have a budget of £300 million ECUs or approximately IR£260 million.  Have the Government formulated a submission to RECHAR? I do not think they have.  Will the Minister assure us tonight that he will make such a submission and that Arigna, the only remaining active mining area in Ireland, will be the cornerstone of that submission?</P>
    <P>Another option which the Minister should bear in mind, should the Government lack the will to stop the ESB closing down the power station, is the affore-station-timber alternative.  The establishment of a new wood pulp factory has been mooted for several years.  There is an ever pressing need to establish such a plant because Coillte Teoranta and other observers agree that the raw material in Ireland for such a plant will more than double in the next decade.  In a region consisting of counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, west Cavan, Longford, Roscommon, Mayo and north Galway you will find 40 per cent of the national forests and probably more than 40 per cent of the available raw material because of the type and nature of timber in these regions.  If the coal-mining industry and the Arigna power station are to close then what better economic location for the proposed wood pulp plant, given that it is in the middle of a region where 40 per cent of the resources are.</P>
    <P>The proposed wood pulp plant was first mooted by a Government spokesman some years ago when he said it would be located &ldquo;somewhere in the north-west&rdquo;. The fabric of this unique community which straddles three counties &mdash; Roscommon, Leitrim and Sligo &mdash; has but one bind, that is mining and allied power generation station.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connor for allowing me to share his time. We have been talking a great deal in recent days about smoke free zones but in counties Leitrim and Roscommon we are looking for more smoke.  Arigna power station has been a beacon of prosperity to the people of mid-Leitrim, north Roscommon and the east Sligo area.  The announcement by the ESB that the power station in Arigna would close within the next six to nine months has caused major concern in the area.  As the representative of Sligo/Leitrim.  I have to say that both counties will be affected by the closure of the mines.  In County Leitrim alone, 150 jobs will be lost if the closure goes ahead.  Since Leitrim is the only county in Ireland with a declining population, it is essential that the power station and the mines remain in production because the loss of these jobs would rip the heart of the area and have disastrous consequences for the future of County Leitrim.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Connor, has dealt with the promises made by former Fianna Fáil Ministers that the power station would not close until all coal in the area had been exhausted.  Surveys carried out state that there is enough coal to keep the mines and power station in production for the next ten to 15 years.  It is necessary for the Government to state that the power station will be kept in production until all the coal in the area is exhausted.</P>
      <P>Finally, I call on the Minister to provide an alternative industry for County Leitrim as a matter of urgency and I suggest that the proposed wood pulp factory would be ideally located in this county.  The reality is that the mines cannot go on forever and the wood pulp factory would need to be in production before this happens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>At <Col N="1194" /> the outset I would like to point out that the decision by the ESB to stop accepting supplies of coal and to close the Arigna power station was no quick overnight decision.  As early as 1983 when the ESB submitted their strategic plan for the period 1983-88 it was recognised that the underlying supply conditions could not support an open ended commitment to keeping the power station going.  The ESB then proposed the closure of the station.</P>
      <P>Arising out of discussions and representations to the ESB regarding their plans, the ESB presented modified proposals which involved keeping the station open.  These were accepted by Government in 1984 on the basis that the station would be kept open as long as no major investment was required and suitable local coal was available at an economic price.  This was announced by the then Tánaiste and Minister for Energy in the Coalition Government in June 1984.</P>
      <P>Since that time, however, the ESB have built up a stockpile of about 93,000 tonnes of coal at the station which is equivalent to over two years' supply to the power station.  In addition, total current reserves of usable, semi-bituminous coal in the area is estimated by the Geological Survey of Ireland at less than 100,000 tonnes.  I should stress that the ESB tell me that such reserves of coal are becoming increasingly uneconomic for the mine owners to extract and that the proposition of the continued operation of the mines at current coal prices are not an attractive one.</P>
      <P>The current price of Arigna coal is approximately £91 per tonne compared to an average price of £32 tonne for coal delivered to Moneypoint.  However, when adjusted to a compared calorific value, the price of Arigna coal is approximately £111 per tonne.  The cost of producing a unit of electricity at Arigna is 7.62p compared to 1.37p at Moneypoint, 2.83p at the Tarbert oil station and 4.89p at the Ferbane peat fired station.  Arigna station is thus five times more expensive than the cheapest ESB station and the ESB are actually selling Arigna sourced electricity at a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the diminishing usable coal reserves, the high cost of power produced <Col N="1195" /> and the fact that this power station is now operating more than six years beyond its expected life span of 25 years, I was recently advised by the ESB that they intend to close the station within the next two to three years.  Regrettably, because of these diminishing reserves there is no way that the station can continue in operation for very much longer.  In the circumstances, it is desirable that the operations in both the mines and the power station should be wound down in an orderly fashion.</P>
    <P>The Arigna power station employs 53 people and up to 180 are employed in the three companies supplying the station. Arigna Collieries Limited Laydens, are the largest of three companies working the Connacht coalfields and have a total employment of about 120 people.  The ESB state that Layden have for several years signalled that their deposits are nearing exhaustion and are anxious to achieve an orderly wind down of their activities.  They currently have reserves of about 90,000 tonnes of usable coal which are becoming increasingly uneconomic to work.</P>
    <P>The second of the three companies Flynn and Lehany Limited employ between 30 and 40 people but have little or no coal left at ground level.  They do, however, have about three years' supply underground but this is of poor quality and its extraction would be totally uneconomic.</P>
    <P>The third colliery is owned by Wynnes and employes about 20 people.  The mining involved is highly difficult and labour intensive.  They only have about 15,000 tonnes of usable coal reserves.</P>
    <P>The impact on mine workers of the proposed closure is such that approximately 130 miners in the 20-40 year age bracket will become redundant.  These workers are likely to find it very difficult to obtain alternative employment with any of the existing major employers in <Col N="1196" /> the area and, therefore, the potential for investment in the Arigna area with a view to attracting new industries needs to be explored urgently.  The ESB have advised me that they have been in contact with local development groups and are actively pursuing ways in which the ESB can assist in the attraction of viable alternative industries to the area.  They tell me they are prepared to contribute financially to the establishment of any new viable industry that might be attracted to the area.  They have also been in contact with the IDA and have had discussions with the manager of the three county councils involved about planning future employment in the region.</P>
    <P>Both the west and north-west regional programmes drawn up in the context of the National Plan refer to the situation at Arigna and highlight the need for providing alternative employment when the station closes.</P>
    <P>What I am concerned about is that the State should facilitate replacement industry in so far as it is possible to do so.  Arigna have provided good jobs for the area for over 30 years.  I want to ensure that there will be soundly based jobs for future generations of workers in Arigna.</P>
    <P>I am therefore, in discussions with my colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce with a view to establishing a working group aimed at identifying and locating suitable alternative employment in the general area.  It is intended that this group will comprise representatives of the Department of Industry and Commerce, the IDA, the local county development teams, the ESB and my Department.  It is my intention that this group will be asked to do their work with a view to an early report for the consideration of the Government.</P>

      <P>I introduced a new scheme of allowances for widowers and deserted husbands with dependent children in the Social Welfare Act, 1989.  Following this I made arrangements to bring the new scheme into operation from October this year.  There are now six separate social assistance schemes providing income support to lone parents.  These schemes also differentiate between men and <Col N="900" /> women.  Accordingly, there is clearly scope for rationalisation in this whole area.</P>
      <P>I informed the Dáil on 7 March 1989 during the debate on the Second Stage of the Social Welfare Bill, 1989 that I was examining the possibility of replacing these schemes by one lone parent's allowance scheme for parents who are bringing up children on their own.  In this context the position of unmarried fathers and of parents who are separated or who have been divorced in another jurisdiction and who do not come within the scope of the existing schemes is being examined.</P>
      <P>The study of this matter is being finalised at present and I expect to be in a position to bring forward proposals on the issue in the near future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> I would like to remind the two Deputies that although the reports they refer to are of relatively recent publication, the surveys on which they are based were carried out some time previously &mdash; in 1986 and early 1987 in the case of the ESRI study, and from November 1987 to April 1988 in the case of the Combat Poverty Agency study.  Neither study, therefore, takes account of the measures taken by the Government in the last two budgets to improve the lot of families with children.  These measures include increases in the child dependent allowance paid to Social Welfare recipients and improvements in child benefit and the Family Income Supplement.</P>
    <P>This year, the Government has directed an additional £32 million in support to children.  There were a number of ways in which this could have been spent, including those suggested by the Deputies. We decided that the best way of targeting the funds to those most in need was the package we presented.  This package included an increase in the level of child benefit for the fifth child, thus directing the child benefit increases where they are most needed.  We also introduced a new £200 child-related tax exemption for those at work on low incomes, again focusing the help on families who need it most.  Expenditure on the family income supplement has been increased by 20 per cent and, for those ances paid to Social Welfare recipients have been streamlined, bringing the minimum payment up to £10 per child.  Furthermore, this allowance is now paid up to the age of 19 where the child is in full-time education.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that, as resources permit, we will continue the work we have begun in improving the situation of families with children.</P>

      <P>Under the medical referee system administered by my Department, medical referees conform to the ethical conduct and behaviour guidelines of the Medical Council when carrying out medical examinations of claimants.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made to ensure that the interests of persons referred for medical referee examination are fully safeguarded. Their own medical certifiers are advised of the forthcoming examinations and invited to submit an appropriate medical report including references to any recent consultant examinations.  In addition it is open to the certifier to attend the medical referee examination if he or she so wishes.</P>
      <P>In carrying out an examination, the referee reviews the history of the case including the initial diagnosis already made by the person's own medical practitioner, considers any fresh reports received and expresses an opinion based on the results of the medical examination of the claimant.</P>
      <P>The medical adviser, who has operational responsibility for the medical referee system selects appropriate cases for examination by a specialist or a consultant who will in all instances be attached to a hospital.</P>

      <P>In my reply to the question in the matter put down by the Deputy on 8 November 1989, I explained that the allowance which used to be made in respect of rent or mortgage payments in cases where an unemployment assistance claimant's wife was in employment was discontinued in November 1986 on the implementation of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985 which provided for equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security.  Accordingly, from that point onwards, particulars of rent or mortgage are generally no longer requested from unemployment assistance claimants.</P>
      <P>Prior to November 1986, such particulars were obtained, where appropriate, in order to enable the deciding officer to make due allowance in calculating the claimant's means.  However, statistics on the number of claimants who at any time benefited by virtue of the allowance or on the total amount of such allowances were not maintained.  As pointed out also in my reply of 8 November 1989 any claimant who had the allowance in question in November 1986 may continue to do so for as long as he remains continuously unemployed.</P>

      <P>My Department's report for 1987 and 1988 summarises the main developments which took place in the social welfare area in those two years.  It provides a valuable reference for people with an interest in social security matters. The total cost of publishing the report was £9,064.43, including £1,188.82 in respect of VAT.  This includes the cost of revising the design and content of the report in line with my policy of updating and improving the quality of information issuing from my Department.  This element of the cost is once-off.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,150 copies were printed by the Brunswick Press Ltd.  This firm currently has the contract from the Government Supplies Agency for this particular category of printing.  The contract was awarded to them in May, 1989 following a public competition.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to the fact that many farmers on the various farm retirement pensions, formerly operated by the Government are not eligible when they reach the age of 66 for the various old age pension free schemes and that because of this they are worse off by having opted for the retirement pension; and if, in view of this, he will consider changing the regulations to enable them to benefit from these schemes.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to the free schemes from my Department is available to the elderly or permanently incapacitated <Col N="906" /> who are receiving certain social security-type payments and who are either living alone or only with excepted persons.</P>
      <P>The current rate of the annuities payable under the former farmer's retirement scheme is not such as to preclude entitlement to old age (non-contributory) pension where the recipient has reached pensionable age and the annuity is the sole source of income to the household. For example, a single farmer entitled to an annuity of £2,020 could still qualify for an old age (non-contributory) pension of £16.00 per week at current rates.  A married farmer whose spouse is also over age 66 and whose current annuity is £3,037 could qualify for an old age (non-contributory) pension of £26.00 each per week at current rates.</P>
      <P>Once in receipt of the old age (non-contributory) pension, there is follow-on entitlement to the free schemes such as free electricity allowance, free television licence, free telephone rental allowance, free bottled gas and the national fuel scheme.  Free travel is available to all residents over 66 years of age irrespective of pension entitlement.</P>
      <P>Any changes to the schemes on the lines suggested would have to be considered in the context of the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether the system of assessing applicants for smallholders' assistance on average and estimates of incomes rather than on strict factual criteria is an equitable and accurate method of determining means; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1983, when the notional method of assessment based on the rateable valuation of the holding was discontinued, the assessment of means of all smallholder applicants for unemployment assistance purposes is carried out on a factual basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislative basis for the calculation of means of smallholders is set out in legislation which provides in general that the yearly value of any advantage accruing to the claimant from the use of property &mdash; other than property personally used or enjoyed by the claimant, such as a dwelling &mdash; is assessable as means. Income from farming is assessed under this provision and is taken to be the yearly profits plus the value of farm produce consumed in the home.  In arriving at the value of the advantage derived from a holding, the normal basis of calculation is an income and expenditure one; that is to say, the gross income from all the farming activities less all costs and <Col N="908" /> expenses necessarily incurred in earning that income.</P>
    <P>The investigation of the means of smallholder claimants is carried out by social welfare officers.  The usual procedure is that, before visiting the claimant, the social welfare officer writes to him and lets him know when the visit will take place and what information is likely to be required.  In this way, the claimant can prepare for the visit and have his facts and figures ready.</P>
    <P>In the normal way, the report is based on the claimant's actual income and outgoings in the previous year.  However, in making the assessment, due allowance is made for any unusual features in that year so that the means assessed reflect the normal situation.  For instance, where the claimant had an abnormally high income from the sale of stock in the previous year, the assessment would be adjusted to reflect his normal income from this source.  Similarly, a large amount spent on something which does not occur every year, such as fencing, would be averaged out to reflect the smallholders normal outgoing under that heading.</P>
    <P>The social welfare officer makes out a report which includes full details relating to the smallholder's income and expenses.  It is on the basis of this report that the deciding officer determines the claimant's means.  A copy of the report is furnished to the claimant so that he is in a position to see exactly how the means assessment has been arrived at and to guide him in his appeal against the assessment if he is dissatisfied.</P>
    <P>The method by which the means of smallholder claimants are calculated is fully in accordance with the legislative provisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a basic condition of the social welfare legislation that to be entitled to unemployment benefit or to unemployment assistance, a claimant must be unemployed, available for and genuinely seeking work.  The question of whether a person who participates in an educational or training course fulfils these conditions is a matter for decision by a deciding officer who must decide whether the degree of participation is such as to remove the person from the labour market.  In general full-time attendance at a school or training centre is not regarded as being consistent with being available for work.  However, claimants who engage in part-time courses would normally be eligible to continue to receive their unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious that education and training play a vital role in helping unemployed persons to improve their prospects, particularly in the case of those who left the school system early.  I am anxious to ensure that there is the greatest flexibility within the current legislation to allow persons who are unemployed to attend education courses while still retaining entitlement to unemployment payments.  Deputies will be aware of the provision I made in the 1989 Social Welfare Act to provide for the making of regulations which would enable unemployed persons who engage in certain activities to be deemed to satisfy the availability conditions for the purpose of receiving unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>I was accordingly very pleased to be able to announce yesterday that I have now made regulations allowing certain long term unemployed people aged 21 years or over to take up full time educational courses while at the same time continuing to receive unemployment assistance.  The courses covered by the regulations are those at second level and which lead to a certificate recognised by the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These opportunities will make second chance education a real option for unemployed people who want to improve their employment prospects.  I am confident <Col N="910" /> that this initiative will greatly assist those people who want to improve their educational attainments with a view to reentering the jobs market.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the vocational training opportunities scheme was launched to provide unemployed people with the option of doing leaving certificate courses at 12 designated VEC centres throughout the country.  These new regulations will complement that scheme and provide nationwide opportunities for second chance education.</P>
    <P>I am also examining the situation regarding participation of long term unemployed in third level and other courses.  I expect to be in a position to announce details of pilot projects in the new year.</P>
    <P>I will continue to seek out initiatives which will remove obstacles in the way of those who are unemployed by making it possible for them to make constructive use of their time while continuing to receive their unemployment payments.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare, arising from his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 5 of 8 November 1989 in which he stated that disability benefit is essentially a short-term payment in respect of temporary incapacity for work, if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there is a large number of people in receipt of disability benefit for perhaps ten or 11 years; whether such persons are being discriminated against; whether he considers ten years as short term; if he will reconsider the request for inclusion in next year's budget; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Disability benefit is paid in the first instance to persons who become incapable of work through incapacity but the legislation does permit suitably qualified persons to remain in receipt of such benefit indefinitely up to pension age. However, it is open to persons who satisfy the relevant conditions to switch after one year on disability benefit to invalidity pension.  Not everyone who is qualified <Col N="911" /> elects to do so.  In essence, the disability benefit scheme is primarily intended to cater for illnesses in the short term and while it does remain as an option for those whose illnesses are prolonged, it is the invalidity pension that is the main provision for the long-term sick.  Far from discriminating against those on long-term disability benefit, the position actually is quite the reverse in that the long-term ill have a choice of scheme under which to claim.  Any person receiving disability benefit for over 12 months and who satisfies the conditions for invalidity pension could opt for that scheme and so open up access to payment of fuel allowance and other benefits.</P>
      <P>In my earlier reply I mentioned that there is also provision under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme whereby assistance can be given where a person has exceptional heating needs by reason of ill health or infirmity.  I am satisfied that this provision, the eligibility of invalidity pensioners under the national fuel scheme and the option open to most recipients of disability benefit to claim that pension ensure that the heating needs of the long-term ill are satisfactorily catered for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">

      <P>The instruction to social welfare officers to notify farmers applicants to unemployment assistance of intended visits has not been relaxed.  It is still normal practice to notify them.  However some flexibility has to be allowed in particular cases for operational reasons and to reduce delays and expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of other applicants under the various social assistance schemes <Col N="912" /> officers do send notices of proposed visits.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to issue instructions that all applicants to be visited be notified in advance.  In his/her approach to investigating means, the social welfare officer, has to keep in mind the possibility of fraud or attempted fraud.  She/he must therefore be allowed discretion in deciding whether or not it is prudent to notify visits in particular cases.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to maintaining the overall value of social welfare payments and to providing special increases, as resources permit, for those on the lowest levels of payment, particularly the long-term unemployed. This policy of channelling resources towards increasing the basic rates of payment rather than increasing income limits is designed to ensure that the available resources are directed at those in greatest need.  An increase in the £50 limit used to determine dependency would be in conflict with this approach as it would require that resources be directed towards households which include a spouse with income from employment.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the limit is to ensure that a spouse engaged in a limited amount of part-time work is not precluded from qualifying as an adult dependant.  The existing figure of £50 is reviewed on a regular basis in the light of increases in the general level of earnings and other relevant factors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>The European Social Charter has implications for the social welfare system in relation to two broad areas.  The first area concerns the adequacy and comprehensiveness of the social security protection afforded under the social welfare system and the charter refers in particular in this regard to workers and the elderly. This is one area where implementation of the charter will be mainly the responsibility of the member states and, in this regard, the provisions of the charter are fully in line with Government policy.</P>
      <P>As Minister with responsibility for that policy, I am embarked on a major programme of increasing substantially in real terms the lowest levels of social welfare payments and of maintaining the levels of the other payments at least in line with increases in the cost of living.  Significant improvements in the nature and quality of social welfare protection have also been made, most notably by the extension of social insurance to the self-employed, and I am committed to continuing this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="917" /> These improvements in the social welfare system will also contribute to one of the main aims of the Social Charter which is the achievement of greater social cohesion between the various regions in the European Community.  The aim at the very least is to prevent existing disparities in relation to living and working conditions between regions of the Community being exacerbated and to reduce these disparities significantly over time.</P>
    <P>However, it is not considered that harmonisation of social security systems is necessary to achieve this.  Instead the Commission are proposing in their action programme a strategy for the convergence of objectives in relation to social protection.  This approach would not require major structural changes to social security systems, which vary greatly in nature from one member state to another, but would contribute to reducing regional imbalances in this area. The Commission intend in this regard to submit a recommendation to Council setting out the objectives which all member states would aim to achieve in relation to social protection.  The Commission also intend to submit similar proposals on common criteria for the provision of adequate resources and social assistance to the least advantaged citizens of the Community and the elderly, in particular.</P>
    <P>Ireland fully supports the initiatives which the Commission are taking in this area and during the course of the Irish Presidency I will be pressing to have priority given to having such proposals brought forward for consideration by the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>A considerable degree of convergence in the area of social security has already been achieved between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Most contingencies are catered for under both systems and comparisons show that when allowance is made for the different mix of schemes, rates of taxation and the cost of living in both countries, the differences in rates of benefit and level of cover are not substantial.</P>
    <P>The second broad area in relation to which the charter has implications for the <Col N="918" /> social welfare system concerns freedom of movement and, in particular, the protection of the social security entitlements of persons who move to other member states to work and/or reside.  EC Regulations on social security for migrant workers provide for the protection of the basic social security entitlements of persons moving to other EC countries. However, certain categories of persons who are not active as employed or self-employed persons are not fully protected by these regulations and I consider that the protection afforded to persons who are unemployed is unduly restrictive.  In addition, there is no provision at present at EC level to protect entitlements acquired under occupational pension schemes.</P>
    <P>Ireland has always been fully supportive of measures to protect the social security entitlements of persons moving between member states and this approach will continue in relation to any further proposals which are made to extend the existing level of protection.  I will also, during the course of the Irish Presidency, be pressing for priority to be given to having proposals in this area brought forward with a view to having a comprehensive system for the protection of social security entitlements both under statutory and occupational schemes in place by 1992.</P>

It has its own salary scale which reaches the same maximum <Col N="919" /> as that of a higher executive officer in the Civil Service.  Social welfare officers, on entering the civil service, undergo a four month period of training covering all aspects of the work, under the guidance of an experienced colleague.  In this period a brief group-training course may also be given.</P>
    <P>For a further period of eight months they are assigned to assist mature colleagues or do duty for absent staff members, under the guidance of their supervisors.  After 12 months they are entitled to apply for a vacant social welfare station, if available.</P>
    <P>The performance of new social welfare officers in their early years is closely monitored by their supervisors, who give them advice and guidance, as necessary.</P>
    <P>During the training period, and indeed throughout their career, the obligation on these officers to be courteous, helpful, and sensitive in assisting applicants to get their entitlements is stressed, as well as their duty to prevent fraud.</P>

      <P>A number of factors can have a bearing on the speed with which appeals are processed.  Each appeal case is determined having regard to its own particular merit.  The time for cases which are dealt with summarily by appeals officers is four to six weeks.  Further investigation may be necessary where, for example, the contentions put forward by the appellant as the basis for the appeal are at variance with the information already available.  In many cases, this may result in prolonged inquiries by a social welfare office before the case is submitted to an appeals officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where further investigation of an <Col N="920" /> appeal case is not deemed to be necessary, it is estimated that the time taken to process an oral hearing from the date the case is referred to the appeals officer to the date of hearing is about ten weeks in Dublin and longer in provincial areas. Staffing arrangements for dealing with appeals are kept under review so as to keep delays to a minimum.  Additional appeals officers, including some temporary appeals officers, have been appointed in recent years.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that I recently announced in the House that the Government have approved the setting up of a Social Welfare Appeals Office as an executive office of my Department.  This is in line with the commitment given in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Arrangements are already under way to set up the new office on an administrative basis.  I intend to introduce the necessary legislative changes early next year in the context of the usual Social Welfare Bill following the budget.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the Social Welfare Appeals Office will provide an improved service to social welfare claimants who wish to exercise their right to appeal.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>The situation of the schools and universities, in the Occupied Territories, including Bethlehem University, has been raised with the Israeli authorities on numerous occasions over the past two years, both bilaterally and in association with the Twelve.  I shall continue to monitor the question closely, including the need for further approaches to the Israeli authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Council in a Declaration on the Middle East issued on 9 December 1989 recalled the need for the occupying power to observe strictly its obligations under the 4th Geneva Convention to which it has notably not conformed in such a basic area as education. The Twelve, in a statement issued on 6 October 1989, requested the Israeli Government in the strongest terms to end without delay the closure of the universities and other higher education institutions. They stressed the need to ensure the normal functioning of schools and universities.  They also resolved to further <Col N="923" /> develop actions to assist the proper functioning of educational institutions at school and university level.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs made clear in the Seanad on 30 November 1989 the Government's deep concern at the measures taken to deny the Palestinian people their right to education and Ireland's direct interest in education through the co-operation which University College Dublin maintains with Bethlehem University.</P>
    <P>On a bilateral level we have expressed our concern at the closure of Bethlehem University directly to the Israeli authorities. Moreover, our Ambassador in Baghdad who is accredited to Jordan, regularly calls on Bethlehem University in the course of his visits to the West Bank in order to underline our interest.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the number of certificates under section 485 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, referred to sheriffs in 1988 was 108,000.  The number of payments received was 38,769.  The number of certificates returned unpaid in the year was 80,030 and the number carried over to the following year was 95,201.</P>
      <P>In addition to the certificates referred to above, execution orders on foot of judgments obtained and registered in the courts are also referred to sheriffs and to county registrars.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the figures requested are not available in respect of those items.  In 1988 however, 1,109 judgments were registered and it would be reasonable to conclude that the number of execution orders referred to sheriffs and county registrars in that year would be slightly less than that figure due to prior payment in some of the cases involved.</P>

      <P>The Hume report on the regional problems of Ireland was completed in July 1987.  In essence, the report incorporates a summary of problems confronting Ireland, an explanatory statement which includes details of the Irish economy, social conditions, structure of Government and administration and the Community contribution to date, together with a list of recommendations <Col N="929" /> to the Irish Government and to the Commission.</P>
      <P>The report was but one of a series of reports, submissions and consultations which informed the Government's thinking in regard to the preparation of the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i> and the negotiation of the Community Support Framework for Ireland &mdash; CSF &mdash; completed in October last.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the recommendations made are reflected in the specific priorities adopted in Community Support Framework and in the measures to be taken on foot of the various operational programmes.  Copies of the CSF have been placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>In addition to the recommendations germane to the CSF the report contains a recommendation in regard to decentralisation of Government Departments. The Deputy will be aware of the Government's successful policy in this area. Already under phase 1 of the programme approximately 1,000 civil servants have been relocated to four centres and a further 2,000 are due to be relocated in phase 2.  It is expected that 510 of phase 2 will be relocated by the end of 1990.</P>

      <P>The 10 per cent rate is a special rate, introduced in 1980, in substitution for export sales relief that previously applied to manufacturing for export, as part of the policy of attracting mobile international investment.  Requests from farming organisations to have this tax régime extended to farming have been made at various times over the past nine years to successive Ministers for Finance, and these have always been refused.  If the régime were extended to farming, there would be strong pressures to have it extended to other sectors as well, which have also been refused this rate in the past.  In any case, the 10 per cent rate applies only to certain companies, and not to individuals.  The vast majority of farmers are unincorporated, and are subject to income tax rather than corporation tax.</P>

    <P>The VAT rate on works of art and certain antiques, was reduced from 25 <Col N="935" /> per cent to 10 per cent in this year's budget in response to the widespread concern expressed in many sectors of the community about the outflow of such items from Ireland and the consequent depletion of the national heritage.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 to 89, inclusive, and 91 together.</P>
      <P>The fall in sterling, which increases the purchasing power of the Irish pound in the North, undoubtedly adds to the incentive to buy petrol and to shop across the Border, particularly at the local level, in areas close to the Border.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the introduction of the &ldquo;48-hour rule&rdquo; has had the desired effect of substantially reducing the volume of shopping generally in Northern Ireland by residents of the Republic. This rule continues, and is being diligently implemented by customs and excise staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards smuggling, the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the intensive surveillance being carried out by customs and excise staff in Border areas is proving to be an effective deterrent against such smuggling.  Furthermore, additional measures have been taken recently to strengthen the ability of customs and excise to combat smuggling. These include: the extension of the land <Col N="937" /> frontier zone within which customs and excise officers are entitled to stop and search vehicles from 20 to 40 miles; the introduction of a new distinctive dye and marker for rebated gas oil in order to facilitate the identification of illegally imported supplies; and the introduction of a new licence for petrol dealers, (retailers, wholesalers etc.,) as an aid to combating the smuggling of petrol supplied from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The problems about petrol and cross-border activities generally are being taken into account in the ongoing discussions on EC tax harmonisation.</P>

      <P>Any change in mortgage interest relief would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.  I would point out, however, that the revenue from this year's restriction of mortgage interest relief to 80 per cent of eligible interest was used to defray a small part of the cost of the major package of income tax concessions, costing over £200 million in a full year, which I announced in the 1989 budget.  I would also point out that, notwithstanding the partial restriction of mortgage interest relief, that relief will still cost the Exchequer about £165 million in the present tax year.</P>

      <P>The virtually completed County Sligo Sites and Monuments Record arising from the archaeological survey of County Sligo will document approximately 4,500 sites ranging across a very diverse range of monument types. The survey shows that Sligo has an impressive density of archaeological heritage with many prehistoric sites including a notable number of megalithic tombs. Consideration of various sites for specific protection under the National Monuments Acts will be an ongoing process. The work was largely an office based paper survey with only limited fieldwork. Further survey work in County Sligo will involve full fieldwork with a view to producing an archaeological inventory.  It is the policy of the Commissioners of Public Works to provide, subject to financial constraints, comprehensive visitor interpretative facilities at major national monuments.  Minor works to facilitate the presentation of monuments to the public are done at other sites.  Their programme is constantly under review and sites in County Sligo will be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>In May 1988, the Government decided to designate Counties Louth, Wexford, Wicklow and Offaly, together with a small site in Mayfield, Cork, for the higher rate of fixed asset grant, for a period of three years commencing on 1 January 1989.  These <Col N="951" /> counties were added to the existing designated counties of Cavan, Clare, excluding the Shannon free zone, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo and parts of Cork and Limerick.</P>
      <P>The basis for the Government decision was a report entitled &ldquo;Designation of Areas for Industrial Policy&rdquo; published by the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) in September 1985 which recommended objective criteria for determining the area to be designated. These criteria were based on labour market imbalance, which is a broadly defined measure of unemployment.</P>
      <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) were commissioned to determine on an independent basis the actual areas which merited designation under the NESC criteria.  The results of the ESRI analysis were not published but the counties above covered under the Government decision in May 1988 were those which merited the highest priority for designation under the NESC criteria.</P>

      <P>I understand that terms for the purchase of additional years for superannuation benefit proposed for introduction by An Chomhairle Oiliúna prior to the establishment of An Foras Áiseanna Saothair were not consistent with public service norms and did not secure the necessary statutory approval of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Labour.</P>
      <P>I have initiated discussions between officials of my Department, the Department of Finance and An Foras with a view to responding to the outstanding superannuation issues in respect of former AnCO staff which had not been finalised before the establishment of An Foras.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the appeal launched by the Kerry Association in London highlights the fact that the floodgates of emigration have once again opened; if he has any estimate of the number of young Irish people seeking accommodation or living in London; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The appeal by the Kerry Association in London for funding to provide hostel accommodation was launched over two years ago.  There would be dangers in drawing inferences about the current level of emigration from the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="955" /> The demand for increased hostel facilities has probably more to do with increases in the cost of accommodation in the London area.  In general, increases in wages have not kept pace with increases in the cost of accommodation.</P>
    <P>While statistics have indicated an upward trend in the movement of people from this country, there are no reliable figures on the number of young Irish people seeking accommodation in London.  There is no evidence to suggest that there has been an increase in the number of disadvantaged Irish youths going to London.  On the other hand, the recent HEA survey of the first destination of award recipients in higher education points to the increase in the numbers leaving third level education who obtain employment overseas.</P>
    <P>The improved FÁS services for intending emigrants which has been introduced at my request and the Youthreach Programme, aimed at unqualified early school leavers, mean that many potential emigrants, who could be at risk, are now being actively encouraged to stay at home.  The tightening up of British social security regulations in relation to young people, which has been widely publicised here, should also act as a deterrent to prospective emigrants who are ill-prepared.</P>
    <P>For its part, the DÍON Committee have identified a number of initiatives which will be targeted towards &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; groups in the coming year.  Attention is being directed towards ensuring the availability of &ldquo;Move-on&rdquo; housing as a follow-up development to schemes for emergency support for single homeless people. The attention of local authorities in London is being directed to the shortfalls in provision for Irish people in the range of move-on housing available.</P>
    <P>The DÍON Committee have always taken the view that direct access provision for single homeless should be clearly identified as a local authority responsibility &mdash; and that the development of special provision for Irish needs should proceed only on the basis of clear commitment by the appropriate borough <Col N="956" /> authorised to arrange funding and move-on housing.</P>
    <P>In terms of DÍON's general role <i>vis-á-vis</i> advice work, etc., it will continue to support the work of voluntary agencies providing front-line advice and referral services for homeless young Irish people in London.</P>
    <P>The question of emigration was fully debated in the House as recently as 8 and 9 November last when the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I gave a comprehensive and detailed statement on the Government's policies in that regard.</P>

    <P>There is no information on the numbers of disability benefit recipients at different durations who have applied for invalidity pension.</P>
    <P>In 1988 almost 10,000 disability benefit claimants were considered for invalidity pension and just under half were awarded a pension.  Included in the number who were not awarded a pension is a sizeable proportion (some 40%) who elected to remain on disability benefit.  The majority of those who were not awarded a pension would have failed to satisfy the medical conditions at that particular point in time but many would subsequently qualify on such grounds.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the concerns referred to by the Deputy and I am glad to be able to inform him of the following developments.</P>
      <P>Firstly, arrangements are now in hand to implement the pre-retirement allowance with effect from 1 March 1990.  This allowance will be payable by means of a weekly pension order book encashable at a post office.  Those eligible to apply for the allowance are all unemployed persons over age 60 in receipt of the long-term rate of unemployment assistance who opt to retire from the labour market before pension age.  The maximum rate of allowance payable will be the same as the maximum rate of long-term unemployment assistance.  Those who opt to participate in the scheme will no longer have to attend at their employment exchange office or at the Garda station signing centre.</P>
      <P>An information leaflet on the new scheme together with a form on which to apply will be issued to all long-term unemployment assistance applicants over aged 60 within the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>In addition, shortly after the pre-retirement allowance is in operation, it is proposed to introduce special arrangements for persons over age 55 who are in receipt of unemployment assistance at the long-term rate.  Persons in this category will be able to elect to sign on at their employment exchange office or attend at the local Garda signing centre once every three months only while being paid weekly at their local post office by means of postal warrants.</P>

      <P>Contributions under the social welfare code are either paid or credited. Paid contributions must relate to employment which is insurable under the legislation while credited contributions may only be awarded in respect of specified contingencies such as certified incapacity or proven unemployment.</P>
      <P>There is no provision at present to award credited contributions to women working in the home who have left insurable employment and who do not otherwise qualify for credited contributions. To do so would have wide-ranging implications for levels of benefit take-up with consequential significant additional costs.  Women who leave insurable employment to work in the home remain eligible for short-term benefits for up to two years after ceasing to pay PRSI contributions.  In addition, those who have at least three years contributions may apply to become voluntary contributors in order to preserve their insurance for pension purposes.</P>
      <P>The extension over two years ago of dental, optical and aural benefits to the dependent spouses of qualified insured workers has been a major recognition of women working in the home.  To date, almost 125,000 dependent spouses have claimed treatment under the new scheme.</P>

In this instance, the transfer of a substantial sum of capital to the applicant's daughters was deemed to have been done in order to qualify the applicants for an increase in their pensions.  Consequently, the amount involved was included in their means assessment for the purpose of determining their claim for an increase in their pensions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The one-stop-shop concept or variations of it are now operating in a large number of locations countrywide. Only certain facets of the one-stop-shop model can be implemented in many areas, due to the lack of information technology, the absence of suitable accommodation and the current locations of social welfare officers (SWO) and community welfare officers (CWO) <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Department's employment exchange/ branch office network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the one-stop-shop concept is to provide one point of contact for clients who need to avail of income maintenance and related services, to deliver these services in a co-ordinated and cost effective manner and to eliminate duplication of effort at local level <Col N="969" /> and effect greater control over social welfare payment systems.</P>
    <P>The one-stop-shop concept has initially been applied to unemployment assistance so as to reduce delays in the time taken to process claims.  With the introduction of the one-stop-shop concept, increased communication and liaison was established between the social welfare officers, the community welfare officers and the local exchange manager which had not existed heretofore.  The social welfare officers now operates clinics on a regular basis and clients can have their claims investigated immediately on referral from the local exchange.  The community welfare officers operate a clinic which complements the service provided by the social welfare officers where clients who may have additional requirements can have their needs met.  While it has not been possible as yet to have all of the officials housed within the same building this improved level of co-operation which includes sharing of local information and resources eliminates duplication of investigations by the community welfare officers and social welfare officers and reduces the volume of work involved in recouping social welfare allowance payments from the unemployment assistance vote.  It has also resulted in more effective control of our systems.</P>
    <P>It is my objective, as accommodation and resources permit, to provide an integrated local service throughout the country for the benefit of social welfare applicants and beneficiaries, and under one roof.</P>

      <P>The Loan Guarantee Fund of £200,000 is financed by an allocation of £100,000 from the Government, drawn from national lottery funds and a contribution of £100,000 from the Irish Banks Standing Committee on behalf of the main associated banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" /> The recommendations for the operation of the fund were made by the Supervisory Committee of the Loan Guarantee Fund who submitted their first report to me at the end of November.</P>
    <P>Their proposals involve the expansion of schemes which the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Credit Unions have already been operating to tackle the problem of moneylending.  Those who wish to avail of the schemes should contact their local Conference of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or their local Credit Union where, depending on the local arrangements, a detailed budget will be worked out for the borrower and negotiations undertaken on his behalf with creditors.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that the fund will be used mainly to discourage those who avail of the schemes from having further recourse to moneylenders.  Should they require loans to meet special or unforeseen needs, while they are participating in a scheme, loans at conventional interest rates will be negotiated for them and these loans will also be guaranteed by the Loan Guarantee Fund.</P>
    <P>The operation of the fund on a nationwide basis will require considerable effort and resources on the part of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Credit Unions.  These organisations participated, through their nominated representatives on the Supervisory Committee, in drawing up the proposals for the use of the fund and were, accordingly, fully aware of the final format of the schemes.  They are currently making the necessary preparations through seminars and other training activities and it is hoped that it will be possible between them to provide a nationwide service early in the New Year.</P>

      <P>Section 146 (1) (a) of the Social Welfare Act, 1981, as amended, provides for the assessment in the prescribed manner of the yearly value of all property belonging to an applicant or his spouse (other than property which is personally used by either of them) which is invested or otherwise put to profitable use or is capable of being, but is not, invested or put to profitable use.</P>
      <P>In accordance with this provision, where an applicant to unemployment assistance owns a second residence, it is the capital value of the property which is taken into account in assessing his or her means therefrom and not whatever rent may be paid.  In assessing its capital value, allowance is made in respect of any outstanding mortgage on the second residence.</P>
      <P>The manner of assessment of the capital value of property is set out in Statutory Rules and Orders 34 of 1934 which prescribes that the value should be taken as 5 per cent of the first £400 of capital, and 10 per cent of any balance.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Supplementary Welfare Allowances Scheme a supplement in respect of rent or mortgage interest is payable to persons whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The amount of supplement payable, if any, is at the discretion of the health board.  Regulations provide that the rate of supplement shall be the amount by which the rent-mortgage interest exceeds £3.20 per week or such part of that amount as the health board considers reasonable in the circumstances. In general, the amount of weekly supplement paid is such that the claimant is left with a disposable income, after payment of rent-mortgage interest, which is equal to the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate less £3.20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in the legislation governing the supplementary welfare allowances scheme which specifically disqualifies a person who owns two residences from receiving a mortgage supplement.

When this officer's report is received here entitlement to a free fuel allowance will be re-examined and she will be informed of the outcome without delay.</P>

      <P>An application for a widow's pension was received on 25 August 1989 from the person concerned.  Before a widow's pension can be awarded, proof of the widow's date of birth is required. As she did not enclose her birth certificate with her application a letter was sent to her requesting same.  The birth certificate <Col N="976" /> was not received and a reminder was issued to her on 10 October 1989.</P>
      <P>On receipt of her birth certificate she was awarded a widow's contributory pension at the reduced rate of £76.60 a week with effect from Friday 9 June 1989, the Friday following the death of her late husband.  This was increased to £78.90 from Friday 28 July 1989.  This is the appropriate rate of pension payable to a widow under 66 years with two qualified children and is based on her late husband's insurance record which yielded a yearly average of 31 contributions.</P>
      <P>She has been notified of this decision and a pension order book containing orders from 6 October 1989 has issued to her.  The arrears due will be issued by cheque shortly.</P>

      <P>The National Fuel scheme is intended to assist persons dependent on long term social welfare or health board payments who are unable to provide for their heating needs.</P>
      <P>I extended the scheme to the long term unemployed who lived alone or only with dependants in October 1987.  I further extended the scheme, from October this year, to long term unemployed persons who live with other eligible categories, such as pensioners or others who are long term unemployed.  This has also ensured that a standard &ldquo;living alone&rdquo; condition applies to all eligible categories.  The cost of this improvement is estimated at £2.4 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>The improvements which I introduced in October meet the Deputy's suggestion in regard to long term recipients.  Further extension of the scheme would have wide-ranging and costly implications.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is mistaken.  Disability benefit and unemployment benefit are paid at the same rate of £45 per week. However, unemployment benefit is paid for a maximum of 15 months, while disability benefit can be paid indefinitely.</P>
      <P>When a person's period of entitlement to unemployment benefit expires he or she can apply for a means tested unemployment assistance payment.  The maximum rate of long term unemployment assistance is higher than either unemployment benefit or disability benefit; however, due to the means test, not all clients would receive the maximum rate.</P>
      <P>After a period of disability benefit of a year or longer, a sick person can apply for invalidity pension.  This is a long term payment and is currently £51.50 per week for a single person under the age of 66. This is £4.50 higher than the corresponding rate of unemployment assistance. Furthermore, invalidity pensioners can obtain other benefits, such as free travel.</P>

      <P>A request from the corporation for approval to a further phase of the refurbishment programme for this estate is being examined and a decision in the matter will issue shortly.  The 1990 allocations for the remedial works scheme are at present being considered and will be notified to local authorities as soon as possible.  The actual level of funding that can be provided each year for individual projects is dependent on the amount of capital available, the competing demands for assistance from authorities, and the priorities accorded by the corporation to their various projects.  It is not possible, therefore, to give an indication of the likely timescale for completion of work in the Cloverhill estate.</P>

This section provides that such notices are to be signed by not fewer than three persons residing or carrying on business in the area concerned. I have no function in relation to the serving of such notices or in relation to the prosecution of offences under section 51 and, accordingly, information in this regard is not available in my Department.

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 225 and 226 together.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board do not employ any specialist orthodontists directly although each dental officer of the health board is qualified to carry out routine orthodontic treatment.</P>
      <P>It has proven difficult to attract suitable candidates to the posts of consultant orthodontist in the health board dental service and five of the six posts created, including the post in the Eastern Health Board, remain vacant.  I am committed to the direct employment by the health boards of consultant orthodontists as the most efficient method of delivering orthodontic services.  With this purpose in mind, a review of the conditions attached to the posts is being undertaken in my Department at present with a view to making them more attractive before they are readvertised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the difficulties in recruiting <Col N="997" /> a consultant orthodontist the Eastern Health Board have entered into an arrangement with the Dublin Dental Hospital whereby the senior Lecturer/ Consultants from the Dental Hospital provide treatment sessions for Health board patients.  In addition, the Dental Hospital is providing specialist training in orthodontics for a number of dental officers from the staff of the Eastern Health Board, who will, in time, be able to provide advanced orthodontic treatments themselves.</P>
    <P>The Government recently made a special allocation of £300,000 to the eight health boards to enable treatment to commence on a number of top priority orthodontic cases.  Of this amount, £90,000 was allocated to the Eastern Health Board which should enable the board to treat around 200 priority cases.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 254, 255 and 256 together.  There are two schemes of assistance to schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>The first of these is a scheme of grants which, <i>inter alia</i>, supports home-school liaison projects undertaken by schools.</P>
      <P>The second scheme is a scheme of additional teaching posts for schools.  While schools may opt to use the additional teacher as a home-school liaison teacher, the practice almost invariably is to assign the additional teacher for class teaching purposes.  I recently announced the appointment of an additional 95 teaching posts for national schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>The great majority of additional teaching posts are in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick.</P>
      <P>The amounts allocated to the scheme of grants have been as follows: 1984, £500,000; 1985, £500,000; 1986, £750,000; 1987, £500,000; 1988, £500,000; 1989, £500,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 178 schools have been assisted under these schools to date and <Col N="1010" /> grants have been paid in respect of approximately 51,000 pupils.</P>
    <P>The cities and towns assisted are as follows: Dublin city and county, cities of Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and Sligo, towns of Dundalk, Drogheda, Athlone, Rathnew, Glenealy and Bray.</P>

      <P>My Department, through its Psychological Service and with due regard to the recommendations of management authorities, maintain an ongoing review and assessment of the special educational needs of post-primary schools throughout the country, with particular reference to schools catering for disadvantaged pupils.</P>
      <P>On the basis of such assessments, and proposals from the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee, my Department allocated an ex-quota remedial teacher post in respect of Collinstown Park Community College in July 1985 and a resource teacher post to cater for the needs of mildly handicapped pupils in August of the same year.  In November 1986 my Department allocated a second resource teacher post in respect of Collinstown Park Community College.  The assistance given to the school by my Department in the allocation of additional resources is readily acknowledged by the school authorities.</P>
      <P>The question of providing a further resource teacher at the school is currently receiving attention in my Department.</P>

It is not, however, possible from my Department's records to state the staffing of the vocational school as teacher allocations are made on a global basis to the vocational education committee and not in respect of individual schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Sealink announced on 10 October last that, as part of a major reorganisation of their Irish Sea services, the Dún Laoghaire-Liverpool service would be terminated with effect from 9 January 1990.  While I naturally regretted Sealink's decision to terminate the service, the closure is more than counterbalanced by expansions in services to Britain from Dún Laoghaire and Rosslare which Sealink are planning.</P>
      <P>Sealink's decision to provide additional capacity next year on the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead route is particularly welcome, and they will also be increasing capacity on the Rosslare-Fishguard route by 44 per cent or 146,000 cars.  These two developments represent an increase of about a third in Sealink's Republic of Ireland capacity.  By contrast, the discontinued service represents only 5.5 per cent of total car carryings and less than 2 per cent of freight carryings between Ireland and Britain.</P>
