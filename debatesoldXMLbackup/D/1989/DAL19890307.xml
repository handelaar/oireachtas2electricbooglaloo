      <P>asked the Taoiseach the gifts which were presented by him to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and his party on the occasion of their visit here; the value of the said gifts; and whether the gifts in question were paid from Government resources.</P>

      <P>I personally presented the Crown Prince with two gifts.  These did not involve any cost to public funds. On his departure, I presented the Crown Prince with two books which were paid for from State funds.  Individual members of the party accompanying the Crown Prince were presented with items of china, crystal and books, which were paid for from State funds.</P>
      <P>The presentation of these gifts was in accordance with longstanding international practice which has been followed for very many years by successive administrations. It would detract from the value of the gifts as tokens of friendship and goodwill to make public their monetary value.  The Deputy can be assured that they were in good taste and suited in every way to the needs of the occasion.</P>

      <P>I accept that procedure, protocol and good diplomacy have established that gifts are part and parcel of the normal exchange between diplomatic figures and heads of Governments but it is not the value of the said gifts which is at issue here.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that because the gifts given by him to the head of state were purchased from taxpayers' money that, therefore, they were gifts from the nation and the converse should be true &mdash; the reciprocal gifts should be regarded as gifts to the nation and their ownership by the nation should be the question at issue here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the new proposals he has for the development of the Irish film industry; and the scale of growth in the industry which he targets on foot of these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of the Irish film industry is being facilitated through the advice and assistance provided by a number of State agencies, including NADCORP, the IDA, CTT and the Arts Council.  In addition, the tax reliefs under section 35 of the 1987 Finance Act, the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax and the business expansion scheme provide a generous range of incentives for the development of a commercially successful film industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A bilateral agreement on film and video co-productions will be concluded in the very near future between Ireland and Canada.  Several production companies in both countries are planning to use the framework provided by that agreement to shoot a number of major productions here.  The potential of <Col N="2355" /> schemes now being initiated by the European Community through its media programme for script development and related film matters is being pursued by my Department.</P>
    <P>The value of our TV and film exports in 1988 was estimated by CTT to have amounted to £20 million, an increase of 60 per cent over the corresponding figure for 1987.  CTT estimates that the value of exports from that sector in 1989 will amount to £25 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the figures he has given with regard to the export potential from that sector, not to talk of the national potential it would have, is but the tip of the iceberg of what we could have here?  I ask the Taoiseach to consider re-establishing the National Film Board so that all the facilities, subsidies and incentives could be concentrated through one board.  I am sure the Taoiseach is well aware of the example which, for instance, Australia offers us with regard to the investment and State support which their film industry received which allowed them to expand their creative and technical skills, of which we have plenty here, thereby enhancing their national image.  We are not recognising the creative talents and technical skills we have in this area and we are forcing those involved in this industry to emigrate.  I ask the Taoiseach, who is dedicated to the arts, to keep the potential and skills we have in this country and use them in the various areas in which they can be used &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will, I hope, agree with me that it is a difficult area.  We have not had much success in State aid for film making and production. <Col N="2356" /> I would have to say that the film board were not a success and were responsible for the expenditure of considerable public funds without any visible return. There is now a range of incentives, the main one of which we were asked to provide by the industry and we have agreed to that proposal.  There is also, of course, the question which a number of people in the film business concentrate on, that is, the preparation of film scripts. This proposal is being looked into by the Department.  I take note of what the Deputy has said and if anything arises that would appear to help in addition to the incentives already there I would have no objection to considering them favourably.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he favours the notion of a development fund, which has been put forward by the film makers of Ireland? Does he not think that section 35 has been less successful then was hoped and that possibly this has been due to the fact that the film industry is very different from an ordinary industry in terms of tax incentives?  It is not a capital-intensive, investment type industry.  Would he, therefore, look both at the notion of development and at the possibility of a review of section 35 in the light of experience?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would have to confirm that section 35 does not appear to have worked wonders, to put it mildly, but there are proposals coming up which will be looked at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will introduce legislation to protect consumers from the implications of the decision of the High Court in a case (details supplied) whereby the non-disclosure of information of a trivial kind by the consumer in a proposal form for home insurance allowed the insurance company, on a strict interpretation of their rights, to repudiate all liability on a claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, section 61 of the Insurance Bill, 1987, which completed all stages in Dáil Éireann on 22 February 1989 enables the Minister for Industry and Commerce, following relevant consultations, to prescribe &ldquo;codes of conduct&rdquo; to be observed by insurers in their dealings with proposers of policies of insurance and policyholders renewing policies of insurance in respect of duty of disclosure and warranties.</P>
      <P>My Department have already commenced discussions with the Irish Insurance Federation with a view to having such codes of conduct introduced as early as possible.  The Deputy can be assured that our objective is to encapsulate in the codes of conduct to be drawn up requirements in relation to disclosure and warranties which are just and equitable from the point of view of the insurance consumer and insurance companies and which will deal with the Deputy's concerns in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is disgraceful that in this case a very large insurance company should have relied on the small print of a contract in regard to the non-disclosure of information, which the court admitted to be trivial information, to achieve the defeat of a legitimate claim by a consumer who was not in a position of contractual equality with the company?  Would he further <Col N="2359" /> agree that in advance of the code of conduct which I know he intends to introduce, it would be appropriate for him now to make a public statement here deprecating this practice by companies and appealing from this House to companies not to engage in such tactics?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is, of course, referring to a particular case which has been dealt with by the courts. I would not propose to comment on it in any way.  The Deputy has expressed during the course of the debate on the Insurance Bill his opinion on this matter. On his prompting I introduced an amendment to that Bill as it went through the House which I am fully happy will deal completely with the Deputy's concerns in this area, in that it is my intention to lay down a code of conduct which will deal specifically with the Deputy's concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the negotiation that will occur with regard to the precise wording of the proposed code of conduct, would the Minister not agree that it could be quite some time before it takes effect? In the meantime insurers continue to rely on Keenan <i>v.</i> Shield Insurance Company to prevent people from making legitimate claims on house policies.  Does the Minister not agree that he should now use his authority here in this House this day to ask companies not to rely on that legal judgment and to ensure that policy claimants are treated equitably and fairly and not in the fashion that occurred in this case, based on the strict interpretation of law?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the industry will take note of the reply to this Dáil question today, that is, it is my intention to introduce codes of conduct to deal with the type of problem the Deputy has brought to our attention. With regard to the time scale, this will not take very long because we have had some discussions with some of the <Col N="2360" /> interests involved and are moving very quickly on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the plans he has to implement the new agreement between the United States and Ireland on the development of technology-based joint projects; if these projects will be located in technology parks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposed agreement between the United States and Ireland will enter into force on signature.  Arrangements are now being made for signature, within the next few weeks, by the Secretary of Commerce on behalf of the United States, and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on behalf of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Articles 3 to 6 of the proposed agreement's text, as laid before the House, provide that its implementation will be effected by an executive officer to be appointed by the IDA.  This officer will work in conjunction with a designated US Commerce Department official and under the general supervision of a US/Irish joint advisory committee.  I will, therefore, have no direct role in the implementation of the agreement.</P>
      <P>To prevent any misconceptions about the word &ldquo;project&rdquo; as it is used in this agreement, I should explain that a project could take any one of a number of forms, ranging from the purchase of a technology licence or patent rights to new joint greenfield industrial projects.  The agreement has been designed to be flexible and to cover the full range of needs of a wide variety of firms.  Most projects will take place between existing firms at their existing locations in both the US and Ireland.  There is no necessary connection, therefore, with technology parks in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is of course possible that in cases <Col N="2361" /> where a project results in the establishment of a new firm in Ireland, a technology park location could be decided only by the firms involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has basically repeated most of his script used in the recent debate on this matter.  I wish to ask again the question to which I am seeking an answer.  Would the Minister agree that the original intention of this Government in designating technology parks has now been severely watered down?  Indeed, all that we are left with is a theme.  Specifically, does that mean that firms that have a technology base can be designated for various parts of the country without necessarily being part of a specific technology park, in other words, that there is not to be any specific technology park?  Would he not see this agreement as a basis for the development of technology parks which development is taking place throughout Europe at the moment and specifically in the United Kingdom?  Would he not see this as an opportunity to develop the Government's original intention of a designated area of a technology park?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the Deputy has departed slightly from the details of his question which related to whether technology parks might be encompassed in the science and technology programme.  He asked that question in relation to the agreement which was ratified here in Dáil Éireann last week and which will be signed within a matter of weeks.  As I have said, I shall have no direct role in implementing that agreement.  It is for firms both in Ireland and the United States to propose projects. This will be industry driven.  I expect a very wide range of industrial sectors to be involved.  There are few sectors where the process, if not the product, cannot be improved by technology and research.  It would be reasonable, however, to assume that there would be a fairly strong showing for the more technology-intensive sectors such as electronics, chemicals and bio-technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of technology parks will <Col N="2362" /> be decided on by the industries which will be involved as a result of the agreement. I have some control over it and there is no question of the Government watering down their programme on science and technology, which may include technology parks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State have a discussion with the new executive officer who has been appointed to help him to implement this programme?  Will he also discuss the possibility of utilising this agreement for the development of technology parks?  That is a straighforward question which deserves a straightforward answer.  The Minister did not answer my second question.  What does he describe as a technology park?  Is it the original idea that it should be a designated area as a pilot programme in the south-east?  If that is the case, will the Minister say so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of whether technology parks become involved is up to the firms who decide where to locate their industries.  I appreciate that Deputy Cullen is very concerned about the south-east region, especially Waterford, but I am sure he is aware that there is already an industrial park in Waterford under the management of the Industrial Development Authority.  At present there is space available in this park for new projects and there is also further land available for development.  Therefore, the question of establishing a technology park in the south-east region is really a question of finding appropriate projects which would form part of that park.  This is something in relation to the agreement over which I do not have specific control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that some of the smaller bakeries who are adversely affected by the bread price war feel that some of the bread sold at a relatively low price is from plants where normal depreciation does not apply because the funds in question were not borrowed, which is the case with other bakeries?  Will the Minister agree that this gives an inbuilt advantage in relation to prices?  Will he indicate if the criteria under which the examiner is working are such that there will be a standard measure of cost across the whole industry or will it be judged, under the existing rules, on the basis of a bakery by bakery?</P>

      <P>On the question of funding, further accusations have been made in relation to some of the bakeries and I want to assure the House that the bakeries which have been the subject of a lot of recent publicity received no grants from the IDA.  The director, having carried out his initial examination which produced no evidence of a breach of the groceries order by the multiples concerned, said that there was no basis upon which to institute a prosecution and found no evidence of predatory pricing on the part of the relevant bakeries. However, after the initial investigation he decided that it would be appropriate to undertake an investigation into the true production costs of an 800 gramme sliced pan which would enable him to establish the price at which an economic return can be made from the production of bread.  He said that all factors would be taken into account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention <Col N="2365" /> has been drawn to the fact that unemployment is currently at 33 per cent in Carrick-on-Suir, County Waterford; and the plans he has to create employment there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to the unemployment situation in Carrick-on-Suir.  However, the Industrial Development Authority have statutory responsibility for the implementation of national industrial development policy. The information sought by the Deputy relates to the day to day responsibility of the Industrial Development Authority and is not, therefore, a matter in which I have a direct function.</P>
      <P>However, I am informed by the IDA that they are actively promoting Carrick-on-Suir for suitable manufacturing industry and that every effort is being made to maximise job opportunities in existing industries there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the latter part of the Minister's response, will he give some examples of what the IDA are doing to maximise job opportunities in Carrick-on-Suir and to market it?  To the best of my knowledge, sites in the area have not been visited by anyone in the last three years and there have not been any discussions at local level about job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misinformed in relation to this because the IDA have been actively promoting the Carrick-on-Suir area.  As recently as 27 January they approved the establishment of a tannery there in co-operation with the local co-operative and they expect 25 jobs to be created.  Negotiations in that regard have been going on for some time and included the funding of a feasibility study of a consultancy and other reports leading to the detailed proposal which was then approved by the IDA at the end of January.  Considerable work is going on and the IDA are very anxious to encourage the development of a major tannery project in the Carrick-on-Suir area because of the tradition there of that industry.  The IDA are also actively <Col N="2366" /> promoting the area for other projects. There have been a number of startups and I acknowledge that there is major unemployment in the area.  It is a matter of concern to me and that is why I am pushing the IDA on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the high level of unemployment &mdash; 33 per cent &mdash; which must be as high as in any rural area, will the Minister give a positive indication as to the prospect of some jobs being created?  I recognise the desirability of a tannery project given the history of the area, but I should like to know if there is a hope of any other industry given the fact that the 25 jobs in the tannery &mdash; while a help &mdash; will not greatly alleviate the problem?  Is the Minister seeking to attract any other sector of industry to the area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Minister expect to present this Bill to the Dáil? Will it radically alter sections 12 and 13 of the 1964 Act which were determined by the court to give independent authority to examiners, thereby rendering them not subject to direction by the controller? Would the Minister indicate how <Col N="2367" /> this problem is being dealt with in the meantime in view of the apparent lack of authority of the controller under existing law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position is most unsatisfactory.  Since the decision of the court, and I have no argument that that is the decision of the court, the position in relation to the waiting list in the Patents Office has deteriorated. Therefore, as a result of the High Court decision, to give the controller the necessary powers to direct examination staff and to decide on procedure and practices which one would assume form part of the normal managerial role it will be necessary to change the law.  Draft heads have been approved by the Government who have decided to give the controller this power under the new Patents Bill.  The new law would establish a totally different approach to the examination of patent applications, the type of approach it was intended to adopt but which was found to be defective by the High Court. The present position is most unsatisfactory.</P>

There is a time constraint no less than in other cases and I can assure the Deputy that no stone will be left unturned to bring this Bill forward as soon as possible.

      <P>I propose to take Oral Question No. 11 and Written Question No. 112 together.</P>
      <P>The consumer is entitled to purchase bread or any other commodity at the cheapest possible price.  Where an undertaking avails of the opportunities to produce and market commodities according to the most efficient methods it cannot be argued that the consumer should be deprived of any of the benefits. In the bread industry market forces have been allowed to prevail and this has resulted in a fall in the price being paid by the consumer for bread.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any predatory pricing in the food industry.  In so far as the so called bread price war between the major supermarket chains is concerned it is not Government policy to interfere in the day to day operation of the market place. Our policy is to provide the legislative and economic framework that will allow competition in the market place to operate in a free and fair manner.  As I have previously stated, I do not have power vested in me under the Prices Acts to make minimum prices orders.</P>

      <P>As I informed the House in the course of the Adjournment debate on predatory pricing last week, the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade gave me an initial report which indicated there was no below cost selling. He then went to take another look at the position and gave me a further report last week which showed, on the basis of findings of two sets of consultants brought in to examine the companies involved, that not only was there no evidence of below cost selling but also no evidence of predatory pricing of any sort.  However, he is continuing to examine this matter and I expect to receive a report from him next week.

      <P>Having regard to the report by one of the chain stores that it might be possible to retain the 800 gramme sliced pan at a price of 39p for approximately a year, would the Minister see in that an indication of an increase after certain aspects of competition have been omitted from the market?</P>

      <P>I would see that the days of bread at over 70 pence are well and truly gone, and that should be a matter of satisfaction to this House and to the general public.  Let me ask if the Deputy or anybody in this House is seriously suggesting to me, when you consider somebody on unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance or on a low wage with a family of three or four <Col N="2373" /> children who would normally take about two sliced pans a day, that even if there was a minimum price order, we should implement it and drive the price up?  Take the difference between 39p and 69p for a sliced pan, and the average price was higher than that.  In regard to a family in the circumstances I have mentioned, you are talking about a saving of 60p a day over seven days a week, that is a £4.20p a week saving.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that his catchphrase in this &ldquo;benefits to the consumer&rdquo; is very narrowly focused and relates only to the price of the bread? He is not taking into account the quality of the bread, the range of bread available, distribution and all these areas.  Will he not consider those factors as in the area of what should be benefits to the consumer? He is simply only talking about the cheapest possible cost for the sliced pan with total disregard to all the other factors. Secondly, is it his intention to introduce no legislation whatsoever to lay down ground rules for competition <i>vis-à-vis</i> Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome? In the last three or four weeks he has not alluded to this area except to say he wants to see competition in it.  Is it his intention not to introduce legislation in the whole area of competition?</P>

      <P>With regard to cost alone being taken into account, this question relates to cost.  In regard to quality, range or type of bread, there are people who do not like the sliced pan, who would prefer to buy a batch, and that they can do.  They can go and buy a Swiss roll or what they want.  That is their business, it is the choice of the consumer, and I have no intention of interfering in that.  We live in a democracy.  Regarding the introduction of further legislation, the Fair Trade Commission are looking at the question of the implementation of the groceries order.  I expect a report from them by the end of the year.  We have already had a debate in this House as to whether the proposal of a prohibition system should be implemented.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the allegation of inactivity.  We are providing the framework in which the bakers can operate and from which the consumer can benefit from whatever reductions result from the opportunities taken to produce and market commodities in an efficient manner.  I do not see that we can <Col N="2375" /> deprive the consumers of the benefits of that efficient production.  The Deputy must be aware, because it has been said often enough in this House, that there is no statutory basis on which I could make a minimum prices order even if I wanted to, which I do not.  I regret the losses in that industry or in any other industry because I have one of the key responsibilities in Government in relation to job creation, but you cannot hope to see an industry survive if there is not investment in modern plant and machinery, using the best available plant.  I saw one plant close. I happened to see the TV pictures of it where in this year of Our Lord 1989, the sliced pan was being handwrapped individually by a worker.  Surely in this day that is no way for management to hope to be able to keep viable jobs going for their workforce.  Surely it is important for management and companies generally to invest so that we can have a viable industry giving long term, viable jobs to employees.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his Department have carried out any survey to establish the extent of share pushing in this country; if he has any plans to take further action to prevent this activity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs has, at my request, carried out, over the last 12 months, extensive investigations into the operations of share pushers in this country.  The director's efforts have closed down one large operator and resulted in the successful prosecution of another in the courts.</P>
      <P>Some of those involved in share pushing have, as a result of these attentions, left this country.  The director is continuing his investigations into the operations of share pushers and is keeping me fully informed of developments.</P>
      <P>My Department are in consultation with the Department of Finance and others with a view to identifying the best way of strengthening our domestic regulatory structures to ensure that share pushers and similar operators can no longer operate here.  The problem of share pushing is recognised now as an international scourge which is getting the attention of Governments throughout the world.  On an EC level, draft proposals are being considered which, when adopted, will provide member states with laws and regulations to tackle the problems of share pushing in a harmonised manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the Director of Consumer Affairs, while he is trying desperately well to do the job, is completely ill-equipped to tackle the growing number of instances of this type of illegal trading? Would the Minister indicate whether he has any plans to consider the establishment, for example, of an investment <Col N="2377" /> and securities board with the full regulatory and policing authorities that such boards in countries like England, America and elsewhere have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's point that the director, using the legislation that is there, is not the best way for tackling this new problem.  However, I assure the Deputy that larger states with more facilities, such as the US with its securites and exchange commission, have been trying to come to grips with the problem.  Despite all the resources available to that body, they have described the policing of share pushers to be like hitting mercury with a hammer.  That phrase was recently used.  The chairman of the SEC recently stated that share pushing has reached epidemic proportions in that country.  As far as the present legislative structure is concerned, I accept that is not the way it should be handled.  The proper road to follow is the EC directive, so that we can have a Community-wide attack on the abuse of share pushing.  I admit this is somewhat down the road.  In the short term the Government, throught the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, my Department and the Garda, are trying to bring forward legislation to close the loopholes and strengthen the legal position.  I am sure the Deputy will understand that it would be imprudent of me to forewarn share pushers by announcing here the type of action being considered. It is a problem we recognise and we have had some successes.  We have succeeded in driving a number of them out of the country.  The problem needs to be tackled at Community level but that will be in the medium to long term.  In the short term we are trying to come to grips with it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will introduce legislation which would prevent employees of the IDA from leaving to take up positions with companies which had recently received substantial <Col N="2378" /> financial support from the IDA, especially where such staff had been involved in the decision to provide such financial support; if his attention has been drawn to a recent case where an executive of the IDA who was reported to have been involved in a decision to provide almost £1 million financial assistance to a company (details supplied) in County Wicklow resigned from the IDA and joined this company as a director; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no proposals to introduce legislation of the kind suggested in the question.</P>
      <P>While it would be inappropriate to comment on specific cases, I am aware that IDA staff have, on occasions, been offered positions with grant-assisted companies.  I do not regard this as objectionable as there are arrangements to ensure the proper handling of all proposals for financial assistance from the IDA.  All such proposals have to meet certain specified criteria set out in legislation and detailed guidelines laid down by the authority.  Each proposal is required to be approved by an independent board or committee, with projects involving a significant amount of financial support requiring Government approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply disappoints me.  Surely he will agree that offers of substantial jobs in executive positions in IDA-assisted companies exert undue pressure on the IDA employee to ensure that the appropriate grants are given to the company.  Would the Minister not agree that this sort of occurrence approximates very closely to a type of bribery or indicates that some decision has been made beforehand that if a grant is approved a person will get a position in the company?  Surely that raises dangers for the employee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The picture painted by the Deputy is not what happens.  No individual executive of the IDA has the power to sanction a particular grant.  I do not consider it appropriate that we should <Col N="2379" /> have new legislative provisions because grant assistance decisions are not taken by IDA staff members.  I do not believe that legislative provisions are feasible in that project executives and staff generally would deal with a large number of companies over a long period.  Grant decisions are taken either by the IDA Authority, the IDA board, specific grants committees or small industries regional boards on which there are representatives of the IDA, other State agencies and Government Departments.  There are also specific provisions in the 1986 IDA Act which prohibit staff from divulging information received in the course of their employment.  No individual executive of the IDA has a grant-giving function and so cannot be influenced.  Grants are decided by the Authority, the board, grant committees or regional boards in the case of small industries.  If the grant is over a certain level it must go to Government for approval.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>While agreeing that decisions are made at top level by the Authority, surely the Minister will agree that those decisions are made on the basis of research and reports done by employees and assistants within the IDA and that it is on the basis of this research work that the authority finally make a decision.  They made a wise decision, for instance, in the case of De Lorean on the basis of research supplied by employees of the IDA.  It is important to ensure that employees doing this research are unbiased in their reports to the authority, so that they will make their decision on the basis of correct information.</P>

In the day-to-day operations of the IDA it is not one specific individual in any case.  It is a question of a full proposal being put forward, taking into account all factors.  It <Col N="2380" /> is on the basis of that report that a decision is taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two specific areas under my ambit as Minister for Communications whereby this sector of the audio-visual industry can be helped to develop.  The first is through the contribution which RTE can make, and indeed have made, through the commissioning of programmes from the sector in question.  In this regard and in the context of increasing their homeproduced material RTE has targeted a proportion of its annual programme budget at the sector and the amount involved has steadily increased from £1.3 million in 1987, £2 million in 1988 and £2.2 million in 1989.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the third television channel will also constitute a major stimulus for the sector in question.  In this regard a specific provision was included in the Radio and Television Act, 1988, requiring the Independent Radio and Television Commission to ensure that a reasonable proportion of the service included original programme material from the independent production sector.</P>
      <P>The operation of these measures will be kept under review and will be strengthened or added to as necessary in the period ahead.</P>

The matter is being reviewed.  I am reluctant to involve RTE, or others, in quotas but the public have shown that there is a demand for home-produced programmes.  I favour the method being used by RTE of continually increasing the level of outside production.  They have now reached the quota, if there was a quota, of 5 per cent. That is the figure put forward in the EC Directive and in the document issued by the Council of Europe.  I have no doubt that the independent service will meet the requirement laid down in the Act for a reasonable proportion of their service to include original programme material from the independent production section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications whether he has considered the possibility of the establishment of an international telecommunications service centre to attract the rapidly growing telecommunications linked services to locate in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no proposals to establish an international telecommunications centre.  Telecom Éireann are able to provide the full range of telecommunications services and these are available for any person or body wishing to set up such a centre.  Furthermore, Telecom Éireann liaise closely with the IDA in relation to the information technology needs of industries setting up here.  An important element of Telecom Éireann's strategy is to develop Ireland as a communications gateway between Europe and the USA for communications intensive businesses and in implementing this strategy, they have made a number of major infrastructural investments in the recent past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the development of telecommunications services offers Ireland a unique opportunity in that it is a rapidly growing sector, with a 40 per cent per annum growth and a £5,000 million industry expected in the EC?  In the light of that, will the Minister accept that it will be necessary to provide some package, like that prepared for the financial services centre embracing tax relief, special service agreements and so on?  Does the Minister accept that we may miss an opportunity in this area if we do not provide some attractive measures for this sector?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we will miss any opportunities.  In fact, one of the major marketing tools of the IDA in selling Ireland is the fact that we have an effective telecommunications network, one of the most up-to-date in Europe and just slightly behind France.  In regard to <Col N="2394" /> information technology I should like to tell the Deputy that under the EC Star Programme information technology centres have been set up at Letterkenny and in the Gaeltacht areas of Bunbeg, Furbo and Dingle.  They provide a wide range of information technology training and application services.  Telecom have been playing a significant role in the Custom House Docks development project and plans are advanced for supplying the telecommunications need on that site.  They are also involved in a new transatlantic fibre-optic cable connection outside Cork and a new Ireland/Great Britain fibre-optic cable.  They are very much up-to-date on this and I should like to assure the Deputy that they are not missing any opportunity to get Ireland a major share of the telecommunications and information technology industry.  I accept, as the Deputy said, that it has great potential and that is why we are putting such an effort into the software involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is a little disconcerting.  For some time we have been asking him about the increased cost to the consumer.  The document he published did not show what the increased cost of the MMDS system would be to the consumer.  Is the Minister satisfied that the consumer will be able to bear the enromous increased cost involved with this system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a question on the Order Paper in relation to cost.  As I said in reply to many questions, I expect the MMDS charges to be of the same order as the most modern cable systems. I gave that reply in the past and my expectation has not changed in that regard.  It is anticipated that there will be a connection charge of about £100 and the annual fee will also be about £100 per consumer &mdash; that is on the basis of the applications I have received.  I do not <Col N="2397" /> believe that is excessive in view of the wide range of choice that will be available in rural Ireland, which will be similar to the choice that is available in urban Ireland.  I believe the people in rural Ireland are entitled to that choice.  I do not see why a person in some part of Clare should have any less range of service than a person living in Dún Laoghaire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that one of the reasons the second bidder for the independent television channel pulled out was that they were not convinced about the MMDS system on two counts: firstly, it was going to be too expensive for the consumer and therefore they were not going to purchase it and secondly it would not be viable as a system which operates on line of sight. That was one of the main reasons those people pulled out of the bidding for the second television channel.</P>

However, when the Cashel head-end was subjected to serious and repeated vandalism, the cable licensee had to change his plans which has led to delays.  I understand that the licensee is currently negotiating with Telecom Éireann for the provision of signals from Limerick to Tipperary via fibre-optic cable, and is hopeful of an early satisfactory outcome which will enable him to cable the town.</P>

      <P>In December 1986 the then Minister for Communications on behalf of the Government, gave a commitment to issue a licence to Atlantic Satellites Limited to provide an Irish satellite network which would utilise the five direct broadcasting by satellite frequency assignments and geostationary orbital position allocated to Ireland by international agreement.  The licence would issue when the company has become irrevocably committed to construct and launch the satellite network.  The original commitment to issue a licence expired at the end of 1987.  Having considered the case made by the company I granted an extension of time, initially to the end of 1988 and again to the end of 1989, to allow the company to continue their marketing efforts.  The company therefore are continuing in their efforts internationally to find users for the proposed satellite capacity but at this point in time no concrete proposals have emerged.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I served you notice in writing this morning, as required by Standing Order No. 30, that I wish to raise at the commencement of public business today a specific and important matter of public interest which requires urgent consideration: that this House view with great concern the continuing crisis in the health service as exemplified by the further cuts in staffing and services announced by the Southern Health Board yesterday.  This House is now concerned that the continuing deterioration in the health service will be directly responsible for the loss of life unless an immediate allocation of resources is made.  I served you that notice, a Cheann Comhairle, because I believe the health services are on the verge of breakdown.  What is needed is an immediate intervention by the Minister for Health, or indeed by the Government as a whole, because the curtailment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In bringing this Bill before the House, I am taking another major step in the development of our social welfare support system.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for a significant additional allocation of resources to the less well off in our society at a time of economic difficulty. The Government have now provided almost £256 million extra over the last two years to those on low incomes.  For a family with five children on long-term unemployment assistance, I have provided an increase of £29.10 in weekly income over two years. This is more than three times as much as was provided by the Coalition Government, £9.20, in their last two budgets.</P>
      <P>Our policies represent a practical commitment to low-income families and children.  We have ensured that resources are directed to those families with the greatest need.  The cost of the extra provisions for children in this year's social welfare package is £42 million per annum.  This includes the increases for children dependent on social welfare and for those whose parents are at work on low pay, both through the special childrelated tax exemption scheme and through the family income supplement.</P>
      <P>This allocation of resources over the last two budgets is designed to tackle poverty as a priority.  We are doing this not just through increases in social welfare payments, but also through the development of the system as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have taken other important initiatives which extend and improve social welfare. This Bill provides for a new social assistance scheme for widowers and deserted husbands.  We have abolished the lower rural rate of unemployment assistance by applying the higher urban rate throughout the country.  We are extending occupational injuries cover to members of the Garda Síochána.  We are imposing a liability on a deserting husband, or wife, to maintain the deserted <Col N="2484" /> wife, or husband, and children.  I extended PRSI to the self-employed last April and the Government have now decided in principle to extend PRSI cover to public servants, following consultation with the public sector unions.  We have radically streamlined and restructured social welfare payments.  We have reduced the number of different rates for children from 36 to 12, and the number of rates of unemployment assistance from 17 to six, all within a two year time span. Other changes are being introduced without recourse to legislation.  These include an option to use natural gas in the free schemes, allowing pensioners carry over unused units of electricity from one billing period to the next, and improvements in the free fuel scheme.</P>
    <P>I will be examining other possible developments during the year and implementing them as appropriate.  I am, for instance, considering the question of self-assessment for means test purposes.  I have already introduced a limited form of self-assessment in unemployment assistance, through desk interviews. These have proved very successful.  I am currently examining the question of extending self-assessment to other schemes.</P>
    <P>I want a service for social welfare clients that is equal to the best the public or private sector can provide.  I am satisfied that we are going the right way to achieve this.  This Bill will further that development.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out to implement the significant social welfare improvements announced in this year's budget; to give effect to the new scheme for widowers and deserted husbands with dependent children; to abolish the lower rural rate of unemployment assistance; to extend the occupational injuries scheme to members of the Garda Síochána and to introduce a major innovation in the area of desertion.  It makes deserting spouses liable for the maintenance of their families and enables the State to recover maintenance from them through the courts and offset it against its support for the deserted family.  In addition, the Bill sets out to improve the effectiveness of <Col N="2485" /> the social welfare system through additional measures aimed at the elimination of fruad and abuse.</P>
    <P>The general increase of 3 per cent in social welfare payments provided for in this Bill will more than maintain the position of all claimants, since the rate of inflation is just over 2 per cent.  The special increases of 12 per cent for the longterm unemployed and 8 per cent for people on supplementary welfare allowance give those on the lowest payments a further substantial rise this year.  These increases show the Government's continuing concern to improve the position of those dependent on social welfare. They more than meet our commitments in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>The main improvements in rates are : (1) a general increase of 3 per cent in widow's and old age pensions, unemployment and disability benefit and other weekly payments; (2) a 12 per cent increase in the personal rates of long-term unemployed on unemployment assistance and an 8 per cent increase for short-term unemployed and those on supplementary welfare allowance; (3) the abolition of the lower rural rate of unemployment assistance by increasing this rate, and consequently the rates of supplementary welfare allowance, to the higher urban rate.  In future, therefore, the higher urban rate will apply throughout the country; (4) a streamlining of the rates of adult dependent allowance for unemployment payments to two rates &mdash; a long-term rate and a short-term rate &mdash; instead of five as at present; (5) an increase to a minimum of £10 per week in child dependent allowances payable with weekly social welfare payments. This mainly benefits families on unemployment assistance, supplementary welfare allowance and old age, non-contributory pension and (6) payment of the higher rate of monthly child benefit of £21.75 in respect of the fifth child and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>From July next a family with three children and in receipt of unemployment benefit will receive an increase of £3.50 per week giving them a new rate of £105.80 per week.  Pay-related benefit of <Col N="2486" /> up to £18.10 per week may also be payable bringing the total to £123.90.  A couple on retirement or old age contributory pension will receive an increase of £3 per week giving them a new rate of £102.20 per week.  A widow with four children and in receipt of a contributory pension will get an increase of £3.10 per week giving her a new rate of £110.90 per week.</P>
    <P>This year the Government again approved a further special package aimed at the least well-off.  We appreciate the special difficulties faced by the long-term unemployed and I have increased the long-term personal rate of unemployment assistance by a further £5 a week.  I am aware that the assistance rate will now be higher than the basic benefit rate, but I am satisfied that this is necessary to help people cope with the extra needs where unemployment is of long duration.</P>
    <P>The personal long-term rate of unemployment assistance will now be £47 per week.  The personal rate for short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance will be £42 per week.  A married couple bringing up three children on long-term unemployment assistance will get £8.20 extra per week bringing their total to £107.  A similar family with five children will get an extra £11.40 per week bringing them to £127 per week.  They will also get an increase in child benefit.</P>
    <P>Taken together with the increases given last year, these payments have risen by almost 25 per cent since last July.  They represent a very considerable improvement for those dependent on these social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>In future there will only be two rates of adult dependant allowance for the unemployed, one long term and the other short term.  In reducing the number of rates from five to two I am also giving special increases.</P>
    <P>I am continuing to streamline the child dependant allowance rates as I did last year.  A minimum rate of £10 a week for dependent children is being introduced. This represents a considerable increase for larger families and as a result, the <Col N="2487" /> number of rates of child dependant allowances is being reduced to 12 as against 36 rates up to last July.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the child dependant allowance for long-term recipients will be paid up to 19 years where the child continues in full-time education.  The Government regard this as a first step towards eventually extending the period of payment of the child dependant allowances, where the child is in full-time education, to 21 years.  This will be of particular benefit to families of the long-term unemployed, old age and invalidity pensioners.  The provisions are contained in section 7 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides that the higher rate of monthly child benefit of £21.75, which is currently payable in respect of the sixth child and subsequent children, will from next October be payable in respect of the fifth child and subsequent children.  This measure is aimed at the special difficulties faced by larger families.</P>
    <P>The Government are firmly committed to improving the position of families.  We do this directly through the social welfare payments and through the family income supplement scheme for those at work on low incomes.  Child benefit &mdash; children's allowances &mdash; on the other hand applies to all children and is paid directly to the mother.  It has the further advantage that it does not create a disincentive to employment since it applies equally to the children of those at work and those on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The one disadvantage of child benefit is that it is not possible at present to allocate extra increases to those who need them most through this system.  We can go some way in this direction by giving extra increases to larger families as we did this year.  To overcome this limitation in the child benefit scheme the Government decided to introduce the child-related tax exemption this year. This is a novel approach which directs additional resources to those with children where the parent is at work on low income.  If in future we wish to use the child benefit scheme, not only for general <Col N="2488" /> across the board increases but also as a means of directing more resources to particular groups of children, then we will have to find a way to do this.</P>
    <P>The extent to which we can do this will depend on our success in matching tax records with child benefit records so that we can identify the income level of recipients. To date we have matched approximately 70 per cent of our records and we are working on the balance.  This matching exercise is very important for the future as it will enable us to use the child benefit system, not only to make payments to every mother, but also to direct additional resources to lower and middle income families.</P>
    <P>A further element in the resources allocated to families is the family income supplement.  In keeping with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> I arranged for a detailed study of the family income supplement scheme.  The report is now to hand.  It addresses the main policy issues in relation to the scheme, including the question of the rate of take-up.</P>
    <P>In May 1988 there were 5,195 FIS cases in payment of which 3,799 were in the private sector and 1,396 in the public sector.  In all 2,381 were labourers &mdash; 46 per cent &mdash; and a further 589 were agricultural or factory workers.</P>
    <P>The report identified that the average supplement in February 1988 was £17.89. A main conclusion of the report is that the original estimates of take-up on the scheme were too high.  A reassessment of the potential claimant pool revealed a maximum of 20,000 families who would be eligible.  Allowing for take-up rates experienced internationally on such schemes, the report estimated that the maximum achievable number of clients is unlikely to be more than 12,000 families.</P>
    <P>The following measures are recommended in the report: retention of the scheme subject to improvements in its structure with the aim of moving towards a family credit variant in due course; increases in the income limits for receipt of payment.  The report does not recommend payment on the basis of net income; an increase in the maximum payments; additional payments to families <Col N="2489" /> with more than five children; and a reduction in the minimum hours of work required to benefit under the scheme.  In the case of two parent families the hours worked by both spouses should be summed to obtain eligibility, improved distribution of information on FIS.</P>
    <P>I am at present finalising my proposals for improvements in the scheme, which I will be announcing shortly.  These will take into account the main recommendations of the report.  The improvements will come into effect with the increases in rates of payment generally from July next.  As already announced in the budget, there is an allocation of £1 million extra for the FIS scheme to cover these improvements.  This 20 per cent increase will bring the total expenditure to over £6 million for 1989.</P>
    <P>For some time, I have been very concerned at the difficulties faced by men on low incomes who are bringing up children on their own.  While we have a number of different schemes for women in this situation there are no equivalent schemes for men.  Widowers and deserted husbands with children, who are unable to take up paid employment due to their domestic responsibilities, find that the only social welfare payment available to them is supplementary welfare allowance &mdash; one of the lowest social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>I have already announced my intention to correct this anomaly by providing a new social assistance scheme for widowers and deserted husbands.  The legislative basis for the new scheme is contained in section 6 of the Bill.  This section provides for payments to widowers and deserted husbands with dependent children on the same lines as the non-contributory widow's pension and deserted wife's allowance schemes.</P>
    <P>Let me give some examples of how a widower will benefit under this new scheme.  A widower with two children who is in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance currently gets £56.80 per week.  Under the new scheme he will get £74.80, an increase of £18.  Those with large families will gain even more.  A man with five children would get £80.80 under <Col N="2490" /> the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  This will be increased to £115.30 under the new arrangements &mdash; a very substantial increase of £34.50 per week, This is in addition to the increase in child benefit for large families, which would increase the weekly gain to £36.05.  It is an improvement that is long overdue.  I estimate that 5,500 men will benefit from the new schemes.</P>
    <P>The introduction of these new schemes also represents a major step in bringing about equality of treatment between men and women in this whole area.</P>
    <P>I also consider that there is scope for rationalisation in this whole area.  With the introduction of these new schemes there will now be six separate social assistance schemes providing income support to lone parents, and these schemes will also differentiate between men and women.  Accordingly, my Department are examining the possibility of replacing these schemes by one lone parent allowance scheme which would apply to parents, whether male or female, who are bringing up children on their own.  In this context, the position of lone parents who are separated or of fathers who are unmarried or who have been divorced in another jurisdiction and who may not come within the scope of the existing schemes is being examined. Complex legislative changes will be required to provide for such a scheme, but I hope to be in a position to bring forward proposals in the matter later in the year.  In relation to the PRSI ceiling for employers, as is customary, the earnings ceiling up to which social insurance contributions are payable will be raised.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the increase in the ceiling for employees and employers and section 9 provides for the increase in respect of the self-employed.  As a result of these increases from 6 April 1989 employees and the self-employed will pay PRSI contributions in resepct of earnings up to £16,700 instead of £16,200 at present.  Employers will continue to pay contributions up to a ceiling of £18,000 in respect of employees who have these higher earnings.  The extra cost to employers in 1989 will be £4 million.  At <Col N="2491" /> the same time employers will save an estimated £7.5 million in 1989 as a result of the reduction in their contribution to the redundancy fund.</P>
    <P>Irish employers pay one of the lowest rates of PRSI in the European Community. In the United Kingdom, there is no ceiling for employers in respect of which contributions are payable.  The higher ceiling will reduce the burden on the general taxpayer of maintaining the Social Insurance Fund.  In relation to pay-related benefit section 10 of the Bill provides for an increase from £66 to £69 in the amount of weekly earnings disregarded in calculating the rate of pay-related benefit.  Since the introduction of the pay-related benefit scheme in April 1974, a proportion of reckonable earnings has always been disregarded in calculating the amount of pay-related benefit payable in addition to flat rate benefits.  The purpose of the disregard is to ensure that the amount of personal flat rate benefit is taken into account in determining the amount of the pay-related element.  The change will effect new claims from 3 April.</P>
    <P>In relation to the increase in the rural rate of unemployment assistance, section 11 of the Bill provides that the rural rate of unemployment assistance will be raised to the higher rate applying in urban areas.  As Deputies will be aware, this differential dates back to 1934 when the unemployment assistance schemes was introduced.  Clearly, however, such a differential is now outmoded.  People in rural Ireland face the same cost of living as urban dwellers and furthermore the present situation has led to serious anomalies in that many areas now accepted as urban are outside the urban classification. Claimants in parts of Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Clondalkin, Dún Laoghaire and Lucan are paid at the rural rate. Similar difficulties arise in other areas such as Cork, Limerick, Dundalk, Drogheda, Ballina and many other towns.</P>
    <P>As part of the budget I undertook to review the position and the Government accepted my recommendation that the <Col N="2492" /> only logical approach was to abolish the rural rate.  The supplementary welfare rate of payment which was the same as the short term rural rate, irrespective of where the claimant lived, will also be increased to the short term urban rate. The effect of this measure will be to give a total weekly increase of £5.70 to a couple on supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>When I took up office there were 17 rates of payment in unemployment assistance alone.  In just two years I have cut these down to six rates &mdash; a personal rate and an adult dependant rate for short term and for long term unemployment assistance and two child dependant rates. This is a substantial reform of the social welfare code by any measure.</P>
    <P>The break-up of marriage through desertion is an increasing problem in our society today.  In 1978 there were 5,237 women in receipt of deserted wife's benefit or allowance.  This grew to 13,617 for 1988.  This represents an increase of 8,380 or 160 per cent in a ten year period. Expenditure has shown a corresponding increase rising from £5.6 million in 1978 to £52 million in 1988.  The State has always shown concern for deserted wives and will continue to do so.  They are paid at the same rate as widows.</P>
    <P>Except in the case of supplementary welfare, no provision has been made up to now to require a deserting spouse to contribute towards the payments being made under the social welfare code for the maintenance of his or her family.  In the case of social welfare payments to the deserted spouse, responsibility for seeking income support from their spouse has been left to the claimant.  Entitlement to the payments is conditional on the claimant making and continuing to make reasonable efforts to obtain such support. The only sanction my Department had, in cases where they were not satisfied with those efforts, was to reject the claim or to withdraw payment in cases where it was already in payment.</P>
    <P>My Department also had to have regard to the personal trauma being experienced by the family and their need for time to adjust to the situation created <Col N="2493" /> by the departure of the other spouse and to try to build a new life.  Pressure on the spouse to seek maintenance adds to these problems.  It could also be counterproductive in that it could serve to reduce any possibility that might remain for reconciliation.</P>
    <P>However, it is clear that too many spouses are just walking away from their responsibilities towards their families and leaving it to the taxpayer &mdash; through the State &mdash; to pick up the burden.  This is not good enough.  What we are setting out to do through this Bill is to impose a liability on a husband to maintain his wife and family and, likewise, to impose the same liability on a wife to maintain her husband and family.  The new measures proposed in this Bill are designed to ensure that, as far as possible, adequate contributions are forthcoming from the deserting spouse.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides that the competent authority &mdash; either the Minister for Social Welfare or a health board &mdash; can seek a maintenance order against a person who fails to maintain their family, and the District Court shall order that person to pay the maintenance to the competent authority.  Where the persons concerned or their employers fail or refuse to supply social welfare officers, or the health boards as the case may be, with any information or documents required for the purposes of any investigation related to the award of benefits or allowances under these schemes, they shall be guilty of an offence and subject on conviction to substantial fines.  In this way, the State can recoup some of the cost of supporting the deserted family.  Where the maintenance is paid to a deserted spouse, that person, if receiving an allowance from my Department or from the health board by way of supplementary welfare allowance, shall be liable to transfer the maintenance to the competent authority.</P>
    <P>A practice has grown up in the courts, when dealing with maintenance orders, to limit maintenance to a topping up of the payments received from social welfare. The effect of this is to cause the State to bear the responsibility of supporting the family, rather than placing <Col N="2494" /> that responsibility firmly and fairly on the shoulders of the deserting spouse. Section 13 of the Bill provides for amendments to the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, to exclude social welfare payments from the benefits that a court can take into account in determining maintenance orders.</P>
    <P>Special provision has been made to protect the income position of claimants who are currently receiving payments under the social welfare code as deserted wives.  Those claimants will not be required to transfer any payments they are or will be receiving on foot of maintenance orders obtained prior to the coming into force of these provisions. Where those claimants obtain maintenance orders after the date of commencement of these provisions, only the amount of payments in excess of amounts awarded under the original orders will be transferable by them.</P>
    <P>This new section on liability to maintain contains a clear, comprehensive and coherent set of provisions.  They will enable my Department or the appropriate health board to obtain contributions from deserting spouses.  The contributions obtained will help to ease the burden on PRSI contributors and taxpayers generally of financing these payments.</P>
    <P>At present a person who has exhausted entitlement to unemplyment benefit can requalify for benefit after having worked and paid contributions for 13 weeks.  This proved to be a significant incentive for people to take up insurable employment of short duration.  While entitled to or in receipt of unemployment benefit a person was not entitled to receive unemployment assistance.  This does not pose any problem where the rate of benefit exceeds the rate of assistance.  However, following the improvements I have already announced, the rate of unemployment assistance is now higher than the rate of unemployment benefit, and so there could be a disincentive to an unemployed person to take up employment of short duration.  Because of this, section 14 of the Bill provides power to enable me, by regulation, subject to the <Col N="2495" /> sanction of the Minister for Finance, to allow an unemployed person the option of claiming either unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance, whichever is the more favourable.  This reflects my determination to ensure that the social welfare system is as flexible and responsive as possible to the needs of today.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that in recent years I have promoted a number of initiatives to increase flexibility in the unemployment payments system, and facilitate the unemployed in their efforts to find a foothold in the jobs market. These initiatives cover facilities to pursue educational courses, to take up part-time work, and to engage in voluntary work of benefit to the community.</P>
    <P>I introduced the part-time education initiative to encourage the unemployed to exploit the considerable amount of flexibility in the unemployment payments system, which would allow participation in part-time courses without infringing the availability for work criteria.  The initiative takes the form of guidelines issued to deciding officers to assist them in the determination of entitlement to unemployment payments in cases where the participant wishes to engage in education courses.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Bill provides for the exemption of fostering allowances from the assessment of means for unemployment assistance, old age and widow's pensions and supplementary welfare allowance schemes.  Fostering allowances are payable under section 55 of the Health Act, 1953.</P>
    <P>Current social welfare legislation in relation to the assessment of means requires that all cash income which the claimant may reasonably expect to receive shall be taken into account.  Certain cash payments are, however, excluded from this assessment, for example, income from charitable organisations, benevolent societies and certain health board payments.  The Bill proposes to add fostering allowances to the list of exempted payments.</P>
    <P>The health boards have experienced considerable difficulties in recruiting <Col N="2496" /> foster parents in recent years.  As Deputies are aware, there has been a move away from residential care and efforts are being made to place more children in foster homes where they can enjoy the benefits of normal family life.  The health boards regard the fostering allowance, currently £34.50 per week, as a payment for the maintenance of the child.  The fact that it is payable irrespective of the foster parents' circumstances allows the financial circumstances of potential foster parents to be disregarded when their suitability as foster parents is being considered. By excluding the assessment of fostering allowances from the social welfare means test, this section removes what could be seen as a disincentive to potential foster parents.  I am sure Deputies will be supportive of this very worth-while measure.</P>
    <P>Under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, regulations have been made which allow the payment of the allowances for adult and child dependants to be made directly to the spouse of a claimant, in cases where the claimant does not provide the spouse with sufficient money for ordinary household expenditure.  The claimant, usually the husband, continues to receive the personal rate.  This arises where there are problems such as gambling, alcoholism or drug addiction.  Women in receipt of separate payments are in a difficult financial position.  The income which they receive consists of increases for dependants only and is often insufficient to meet their needs and those of their children.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Bill is designed to remove the restriction whereby only the dependant's element of a payment may be paid direct to the spouse in such cases. The section provides that regulations may allow such amount of the social welfare payment as is reasonable in the circumstances to be paid direct to the spouse.  The claimant will be paid at least the value of the adult dependant allowance. I am sure this new provision will be welcomed by those who are currently surviving on separate payments.</P>
    <P>With regard to insurability of sub-postmasters, section 17 of the Bill is <Col N="2497" /> designed to confirm the current insurability of sub-postmasters as employees, by specifically including such employment in the list of insurable employments contained in Part I of the First Schedule to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>Arising from a recent High Court judgment, it was considered that there was a possibility that subpostmasters might be regarded as being under a contract for service as distinct from a contract of service.  In that case they would no longer be insurable as employees.  This provision is intended to safeguard their current position under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    <P>I am providing in this Bill for the extension of occupational injuries benefits to members of An Garda Síochána.  Section 18 of the Bill provides the means for including gardaí in the occupational injuries scheme.  At present the Garda have no entitlements under this scheme. In the case of malicious injuries or death, a Garda or his representatives may apply for compensation under the Garda Síochána (Compensation) Acts.  However, other injuries received or diseases contracted accidentally in the course of duty are not covered by this legislation.  It is now proposed to fill this gap in their coverage by bringing gardaí within the scope of the occupational injuries scheme.  Gardaí will be covered on the same basis as other civil servants.  They will be entitled to disablement benefit starting 26 weeks after the occupational accident occurs or the disease is contracted. They will also be covered for survivors' benefits.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the rate of disablement benefit for gardaí will be half the ordinary rate, in line with civil servants entitlements, although full adult and child dependant increases will be payable.  At present, if a garda is injured while on duty or in the course of duty, he may receive full salary for the duration of absence caused by that injury.</P>
    <P>Survivors' benefits for which members of the Garda will be covered include widow's pension, dependent widower's pension or gratuity, orphan's pension, <Col N="2498" /> dependent parent's pension and funeral grant.  A reduced rate of occupational injuries contribution will be paid on behalf of the Garda in line with the limited benefits for which they will be covered.</P>
    <P>The section also provides that any benefits payable to the gardaí or their survivors under the scheme will be taken into account in the assessment of damages under the Garda Síochána (Compensation) Acts.  This is in line with similar arranagements in assessing damages for the purposes of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act, 1964.</P>
    <P>The details of coverage and the contributions payable will be set out in regulations following this legislation. Coverage under the occupational injuries scheme will represent a considerable improvement in their employment conditions for the Garda.  I am sure that Deputies will support me in acknowledging the good work done by An Garda Síochána and I am sure that this measure will have the support of the House.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years I have placed great emphasis on the effective managment of the resources devoted to social welfare.  As a result, I have put in place a range of measures to eliminate fraud and control abuse of our schemes.  Expenditure on social welfare is one of the highest spending areas of Government activity and it is vital that money is paid out only to those who are entitled to receive it.  I intend to continue to pursue these measures vigorously and improve them as the need arises.  Consequently, there are a number of measures in this Bill aimed at improving the effectivenesss of the various measures I have brought in.</P>
    <P>With regard to sub-contractors from the start of this year, employers in the construction, contract cleaning, forestry and security industries are required to notify my Department when they take on new employees.  So far, from the preliminary returns for January, it appears that well over 500 employees have been notified to my Department.</P>
    <P>I am aware from discussions with the trade unions and from other sources that <Col N="2499" /> there has been an increasing recourse to the employment of sub-contractors in these industries.  It is also clear from investigations carried out by my Department that many sub-contractors are not fulfilling their responsibilities in terms of tax and PRSI.  Accordingly, I am amending the legislation to provide for the notification to me by any employer, in the designated industries, of the employment by them or any sub-contractor.  In addition, each sub-contactor will also have to notify me of any person engaged by him or her or working with him or her.  This will greatly assist in the control of those &ldquo;cowboy&rdquo; operators who set out to cheat the taxpayer and their competitors.</P>
    <P>On the question of court proceedings, section 20 provides that, in any proceedings for an offence under the Social Welfare Acts, a certificate, signed by an officer and certifying facts recorded on computer or on microfilm will, in the absence of the original document, be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the facts so certified. This provision is required because of the increasing extent to which records of the Department are held on computer and microfilm instead of on paper.  The provision also extends to organisations with which the Department conduct their business.  For example, An Post proposes to microfilm cashed social welfare pension orders.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides that records relating to earnings and periods of employment maintained by an employer shall be regarded as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of these matters.  This is intended to simplify the current arrangements whereby, in cases involving large companies, a number of company staff would be required to give evidence to prove that a person was, in fact, employed in a particular period and that wages were paid to him in respect of such employment.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides that, where an employer who colludes with an employee in fraudulently obtaining any social welfare payment is convicted of certain offences, that employer will be liable for the repayment on demand, as a civil debt, <Col N="2500" /> of the amount irregularly received by the employee as a result of that collusion, while in his employment.</P>
    <P>Under the legislation enacted last year relating to self-employed contributors, a self-employed person was required to have discharged his full liability before he could be regarded as having paid his PRSI contribution.  Because of the way the tax system works, this requirement for full discharge is giving rise to serious problems as tax assessments are reviewed and revised.  The provisions allow contributions which have not been paid to be treated as having been paid, in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for substantial improvements for the proposed pre-retirement allowance scheme.  The legislative basis for this scheme was contained in last year's Social Welfare Act and regulations are required to implement it.  Following the amendments in this Bill, I propose to make regulations providing for the new improved scheme as soon as the administrative arrangements are in place.</P>
    <P>The pre-retirement allowance scheme is intended to provide more flexible arrangements for unemployed people in the over-60 age group, many of whom regard themselves as semi-retired and not really members of the labour force.  At present, these people are required to sign on each week at their local office, where they receive their cash payments.  The new scheme will relieve certain persons of the need to attend the local office, while at the same time providing them with alternative arrangements for receiving their basic entitlements.  It is intended that payment will be made by way of orders cashable at post offices.</P>
    <P>Under the 1988 legislation, to be eligible for the scheme a person must: have attained the specified age; have been in receipt of unemployment payments for at least 390 days; satisfy a means test; be otherwise entitled to unemployment assistance at the maximum rate.</P>
    <P>The main effect of the amendments included in this Bill is to remove the <Col N="2501" /> requirement that an applicant be otherwise entitled to unemployment assistance. This will enable the allowance to continue to be paid to retired persons who, for example, fall ill and would, therefore, not fulfil the conditions for unemployment assistance.  The Bill also provides for the inclusion of the pre-retirement allowance as a separate allowance in the list of social assistance payments contained in the Fourth Schedule to the Act.  This will give greater flexibility in regard to determining reduced rates of allowance as the rates will no longer be tied to the rates of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>On <i>pro-rata</i> pensions, section 30 of the Social Welfare Act, 1988, provided powers to make regulations giving entitlement to pensions to certain persons who came back into insurance on the abolition of the earnings limit for liability for social insurance contributions in April, 1974.  The provision was intended to cater for those who, having paid a contribution covering them for old age contributory pension, failed to qualify for a pension because of gaps in their insurance record prior to 1974.</P>
    <P>These gaps occurred because, prior to April 1974, social insurance coverage for non-manual workers only applied if their earnings were below a certain limit.  This limit was increased from time to time and, as a result, some persons found themselves in and out of insurance, thus causing gaps in their insurance records. To qualify for an old age (contributory) pension, a minimum yearly average of 20 contributions is required over a person's working life.  Some people with gaps in their insurance record before 1974 could not achieve this minimum average and so failed to qualify for pensions.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies will be familiar with this problem.  It was always considered to be particularly inequitable because employees who became compulsorily insured for the first time in April 1974 were able to build up an entitlement to a minimum old age contributory pension after a relatively short number of years. Others, with a similar record of insurance after 1974, failed to get a pension because <Col N="2502" /> of the effect that the pre-1974 gaps had on their yearly average of contributions.</P>
    <P>It has since emerged that the enabling legislation and regulations made under it in 1988 gave entitlement to <i>pro rata</i> pensions to categories of insured persons other than those for whom they were intended.  The wording of the legislation also gave entitlement to persons who came back into insurance in 1974, but at a modified rate which did not include cover for old age (contributory) pension. Persons in this situation are part of what is known as the &ldquo;mixed insurance&rdquo; category and there are particular problems associated with their situation.  The problems of &ldquo;mixed insurance&rdquo; and its effects on pension entitlements are being examined at present by the National Pensions Board as part of their review of State, semi-State and private occupational arrangements.</P>
    <P>Section 25 is intended to remedy the defect in the primary legislation.  The effect of the amendment is to confirm that, under any regulations made, entitlement to pensions will be confined to those affected by the insurable limit as originally intended: persons who again became compulsorily insured at the full rate of contribution in April 1974 following the abolition of the insurable limit.  Sections 26 and 27 are designed to remedy potential defects identified in existing legislation and ensure that the provisions covered endure and are correct.</P>
    <P>Since the Government took office two years ago, we have introduced some of the most far-reaching improvements in the social welfare system for many years. We identified problems and anomalies which were the cause of hardship to those relying on our schemes and took steps to solve them.  At the same time, I have concentrated resources on ensuring that the system is managed effectively and that fraud and abuse are controlled.  We have succeeded in this and the improvements outlined in this Bill have been facilitated by better control of social welfare expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, implements the measures we introduced in the budget <Col N="2503" /> and directs additional resources to those on the lowest incomes.  That was the policy we adopted last year and which we are continuing this year.  As a result, those on long term unemployment assistance over the two years will have received an increase of almost 25 per cent in the period and the Government have allocated almost £256 million to those on social welfare.  This is a very substantial transfer of resources and a clear sign of the Government's determination to tackle the problems faced by those on low incomes, particularly those dependent on social welfare.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>For any Government the Social Welfare Bill represents their flagship in any year in the battle against poverty.  Using that analogy for 1989 the Bill resembles a leaky rowing boat instead of a sleek, carefully planned designer vessel like the round-the-world yacht <i>NCB Ireland.</i></P>
      <P>The Bill is presented without any planning for or vision and foresight into the need to change our systems to encourage job creation.  It is glibly presented as if there was no unemployment crisis and ignores the measures which can be taken within the social welfare system to create jobs.  The Bill is unexceptional and of little account.</P>
      <P>My main criticism of the Bill is that it will have no appreciable impact on the cause or the effects of poverty.  The Government have totally failed to capitalise on the consensus that exists in this House in favour of the necessary reforms that will lead to jobs being created and an end to the haemorrhage of emigration which is draining the lifeblood from this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main cause of poverty is lack of jobs leading to huge unemployment and emigration at a level unprecedented in recent times.  The central issue on which every policy instrument has to be judged is its effect on jobs.  On that basis the Bill scores zero and must be categorised as <Col N="2504" /> another missed opportunity where headway might have been made &mdash; but was not &mdash; in the battle against unemployment and the poverty resulting from it.</P>
    <P>There are major structural defects in aspects of our social welfare system which have disemployment effects and which act as a positive disincentive to job creation.  Our aim and object must be a system which does the reverse, which contributes to job creation.  The social welfare system &mdash; and indeed every system introduced or maintained by the State &mdash; should be trawled from top to bottom to identify and isolate those aspects which discourage employment and the necessary reform to change them must be introduced; otherwise we will have to accept continuing huge unemployment levels.  Obviously this has not been done in relation to this Bill.  This lack of planning is also evident in many of the hastily conceived measures announced by the Minister over the past two years which lend support to the view that no serious reform of the system can be expected under the present Administration.</P>
    <P>Therefore, more in hope than in expectation, I will identify specific examples in the system which contribute to unemployment and impede job creation.  I am asking the Minister to seriously consider proposals for amendments which will root out those aspects of the system which are discouraging jobs.  In relation to those directly affected by the social welfare system, the Commission on Social Welfare some years ago mapped out the highway to be established if we are to have an equitable solution.  The ESRI-Combat Poverty report established the extent of poverty at different levels in society and focused particular attention on the kind of households affected.</P>
    <P>The three main groups vulnerable to poverty were identified as (1) homes headed by the unemployed, (2) those with large families and (3) small farmer households.  In addition, those in low paid jobs, female single parents and the sick and disabled were identified as being highly at risk of poverty.  Despite the <Col N="2505" /> claims of the Minister, it is clear that the provisions of this Bill will do very little to improve the abysmally low standard of living of those so identified.  The Social Welfare Bill, 1989, will ensure that those at the bottom of the trough will stay there.</P>
    <P>This raises the broader issue of the whole spectrum of economic and social policies of the Government in so far as they have been clearly defined.  We do not have a very clear definition of their objectives and we most certainly do not have specific proposals to achieve the job targets which have been vaguely defined. It is now clear that the effect of Government policy to date has been to make those at the upper end of the scale richer while those at the bottom of the pile are staying there.  They are frustrated, alienated and dispossessed.  They are condemned to live &mdash; more correctly to exist &mdash; on the margins of society.  Clearly, the benefits of sacrifice and fiscal adjustment have not reached or &mdash; in the immortal words of a former Taoiseach &mdash; trickled down to the poor and marginalised.</P>
    <P>There are impressive figures on exports, balance of trade, the balance of payments and other economic and financial indicators and statistics.  These are of no consolation to the huge number of people seemingly permanently wedged on the dole.  On the other hand, those figures bring boundless satisfaction to the rich and powerful, the haves of our society who now have a lot more.  I have no basic objection to the accumulation of wealth by the industrious and energetic and by those in a position of power and influence.  In many ways the more we have in that category the better for the country but where the privileged few are the main and perhaps the only beneficiaries of Government policy it is time to question the thrust and direction of such policy and to seek a redirection focusing on the needs of the have nots, principally, the unemployed and the low paid.</P>
    <P>The policies of the Government have made no impact on the root cause of poverty, which is unemployment.  They have failed utterly to devise policies and <Col N="2506" /> reforms which would lead to job creation. They have shirked the task of reforming and redirecting our tax and welfare systems so as to provide incentives to work, to employ and be employed.  The OECD have reported that Ireland has the taxation and social welfare systems most biased against labour in all of the OECD countries.  How have the Government reacted to this appalling statistic?  Last week in a radio interview at the conclusion of the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis the Taoiseach stated that he found it difficult to accept the percentage of our people found by the ESRI to be living on the poverty line.  He held out no hope for the young and not so young trying to cope with the consequences of unemployment and other social problems.  In fact his offhand response to the social problems in our society was &ldquo;all we can do is keep on trying to solve them&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That kind of &ldquo;God help us&rdquo; approach is all right as a rhetorical aspiration but where is the prescription for a solution? Where are the jobs going to be created? When are we going to see changes in our tax system and in our social welfare system which we are discussing today which would lead to the creation of jobs? When are we going to see bold initiatives to tackle our unemployment rate of almost 20 per cent?</P>
    <P>These questions hardly cross the Taoiseach's mind or, apparently, the minds of his Ministers.  Basking in the adultation of the rich the Taoiseach has surrounded himself with an imperial guard of power, wealth and influence &mdash; the glitterati of our society.  Obviously he is being led by them to the extent that those below the salt and those who have no salt at all are completely excluded from his thinking. While the barons of industry and the captains of commerce pay homage at the court of Kinsealy, the ordinary Joe Soap is being strangled by the PAYE system or sweating it out on the dole queue. His lot will not be improved by policies dictated by the politburo of millionaires.</P>
    <P>The dangers of division in our society can be very clearly seen.  We should learn from the experience of other countries who have allowed this approach to <Col N="2507" /> develop.  The Marcos régime in the Philippines collapsed under its own weight when the people rejected the corruption resulting from policies which only favoured the powerful and the wealthy.  We should not tolerate that kind of divided society in our country.  The warning signals are already there and cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>Proper planning is needed if the kind of reforms required are to be successfully implemented.  Apart from the lack of any serious intent to introduce the reforms needed, the record of the Government in regard to the careful planning of any change is outrageously bad.  There are so many examples of this in many areas.  Let me mention a few outside of the social welfare area.  There was the U-turn in respect of the AFT-ACOT merger followed shortly afterwards by the announcement of the hastily conceived, hopelessly planned new farm body with disastrous consequences for our farmers. In recent weeks Fóir Teoranta fell victim to the same ill-thought out proposals.  The Government should know that a shoot-from-the-lip approach is no substitute for detailed planning.</P>
    <P>In the area of social welfare a similar approach has been adopted.  A number of schemes which had not been properly and clearly thought out were announced, such as the free fuel scheme, an amalgamation of two schemes, which ended up with more anomalies than had existed previously, with the result that in many cases those with less income and worse off than those entitled to receive it were not able to benefit under the scheme. If our objective is fairness, justice and equity this approach will not do.  The educational opportunities scheme was announced in a great fanfare by the Minister for Social Welfare last year but now he will not even answer a Dáil question about the non-operation of the scheme, preferring to pass the buck to the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>It was announced on the publication of the Estimates that there would be an increase in employers' payroll taxes, to an income limit of £20,000 per employee. <Col N="2508" /> Again, this had not been thought through and the consequences this would have for employment were not fully considered and only under the most extreme pressure was this figure rolled back to £18,000. There was an announcement in relation to child benefit in the budget.  I am not sure what detailed planning went into it but there was a suggestion in one of the newspapers that it arose following a rashers and eggs discussion at breakfast time between the Minister for Finance and his wife.  It is very clear that no thought was put into what the consequences would be of the step proposed in the Budget Statement.  Thereafter there was a rolling back, a watering down and an amendment by the Taoiseach and his Ministers, and today the Minister for Social Welfare has implied that payments from now on will be made to every mother.  I suggest that that is not the way to go about introducing any change or to plan any programme for the betterment of this country.</P>
    <P>We then come to <i>pro rata</i> pensions and again the Minister touched on these in his speech today.  It is clear that the provisions as originally announced and legislation for extended entitlement to those who it was intended would not benefit. This is another example of bad planning and follow-through.  Provision was made in the 1988 Act for the pre-retirement scheme but it is now proposed to amend this scheme in the 1989 Bill without the scheme ever having become operational. This is yet another example of a scheme not being properly thought out.  The Minister made various announcements of major changes.  In July 1987 he made an announcement that he intended to transfer the responsibility for paying the first 13 weeks of disability benefit to employers.  He also was able to quantify the saving that was to result from this dramatic change &mdash; £20 million a year. What happened?  Nothing.  The Minister obviously at the time he made this grand announcement was not aware it took about two years preparation in the UK before such a change was implemented. It is not good enough that this shoot-from-the-lip approach should have been <Col N="2509" /> adopted in relation to such a serious matter or, indeed, any other matter.</P>
    <P>While proposals for change to remove anomalies and to respond to the needs of the poorest in our society are necessary, the real priority for the Government and the Minister in relation to social welfare is the need to trawl the entire system and isolate those aspects which are causing unemployment or acting as a disincentive to job creation.  In the light of the various examples I have quoted I am not so sure this Government are capable of doing that.  They are capable of planning the necessary changes, but I want to use the opportunity here in the debate on this Bill to mention some positive proposals for consideration, all with a focus on jobs.</P>
    <P>The first relates to the establishment of a single means test based on net income. How often have we heard from people on the dole, particularly those with families, the words, &ldquo;I cannot afford to take the job&rdquo;?  That arises because there are no tax allowances for children in the income tax system and because of the changes that will be made in relation to the medical card assessed on gross income and the changes in the costs which may arise in relation to the differential rent system and a whole range of areas.  Surely one of the most serious and positive steps that could be taken towards a graduated entitlement to various benefits applicable to those on employment and those on social welfare would be the introduction of a single means test based on net income.  I believe the establishment of such a system would permit a graduated response to different levels of need whether for the employed or the unemployed. It would lead to the removal of distortions, poverty traps and a major disincentive to employment.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Minister should have had the courage to tackle social insurance contributions.  With the payments being made by the employers, it is very clear that the bias is totally in favour of capital intensive employment as opposed to labour intensive employment.  The more employees you have, the more you pay. In other countries, particularly those with <Col N="2510" /> unemployment problems, a variety of different approaches have been tried. Nothing has been tried here.  I suggest to the Minister that at the very minimum we should have a modulation of the rate of contribution in respect of certain labour intensive industries.  I am thinking in particular of the clothing sector as one example.  To encourage employment, the rate payable in respect of certain labour intensive sectors should be low enough and thus be an incentive to the employer to take on more employees.</P>
    <P>The other side of the social insurance contribution is the payment being made by the employee.  Here again is a very strong case for change.  That change should be focused on exempting a portion at the lower end of the salary scale.  That could be done if the Minister took power to vary the rate and the upper income limit in respect of which the contributions are payable.  It would certainly provide an incentive to those who might be offered relatively low paid employment.</P>
    <P>We come to the long-term unemployed, many of whom have virtually given up hope of work.  I suggest that the new approach be tried of exemption from payment of social insurance contributions for a defined period.  It need not be very long &mdash; perhaps the first 12 months or up to April of the following year, the end of the contribution year &mdash; to exempt somebody in receipt of long-term unemployment from all social insurance contributions and all such payments payable in respect of an unemployed contributor who immediately prior to taking up employment had been in receipt of unemployment assistance or benefit for the usual period which for long-term unemployment is 390 days.</P>
    <P>A further proposal I have to make relates to the low paid and their non-entitlement, non-access to supplementary welfare.  This is of major importance in relation to rent supplements. I suggest it would be an important incentive measure if we removed the provision of section 202 of the Principal Act which excludes those in full-time employment from access to supplementary welfare.  That, in many <Col N="2511" /> instances, could be the final bridge to enable those on social welfare to take up employment, particularly if the only employment available is of a relatively low paid nature.</P>
    <P>A further suggestion relates to the pre-retirement allowance.  Even though the Minister is introducing a minor amendment in the present Bill, he should go further.  The scheme when it becomes operational should be amended and extended to those of 55 years and over. One important further addition should be made.  Those who accept the pre-retirement allowance should be allowed some dignity.  An occasional bit of work would be good for them, and provision should be made to allow that.  I suggest to the Minister that any means derived from employment of less than 18 hours per week would not be assessable as against the pre-retirement allowance.</P>
    <P>Another area in relation to jobs is the family income supplement.  Let me record my major disappointment that the report to which the Minister refers in his speech has not been made available to me despite requests made in this House and in writing to the Minister.  It is a rather short-sighted policy on his part that where reports of this kind are available they are not furnished to those members of the Opposition who have sufficient interest to request them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not mind if they go to the Government first?  I gave a summary of the recommendations which the Deputy asked for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Not so.  I asked for the report because there are some recommendations here and I am not sure of the terms of reference in the report or the basis on which these recommendations are made.  It seems that a major overhaul of the FIS is necessary.  In the context of the £1 million made available by the Minister in the current year we are confined to quite minor changes and, of course, there is no possibility of the kind of major overhaul that would result from changing the system from gross pay to <Col N="2512" /> net pay.  That would involve a complete overhaul of the system which would not be possible within the context of the miserable £1 million which the Minister has allocated towards this important instrument which, if developed, could lead to a considerable number of jobs.  The Minister should have power to change that system.  He may not have the money immediately but at least he should put the full report before us and let us discuss the possibility of a new type of family income supplement based on net income.</P>
      <P>My understanding is that in every country in Europe where there is a family income supplement it is based on net income.  I cannot accept the few lines in the Minister's speech as a basis on which to debate fully the report which the Minister has guarded so jealously and declined to make available to me.  There should be a change to payment based on net income.  I accept the Minister's point that there should be an additional payment for families with more than five children. That minor change costing £300,000 should, of course, be made.  I am worried that the Minister will tinker with the present system, that there will be very little impact on unemployment as a consequence and that the major overhaul which should be made will be shelved.</P>
      <P>These are just some of the areas which should be touched upon in regard to removing disincentives to employment in the social welfare system.  The proposals I have mentioned have a focus on jobs and point the way to the kind of major overhaul needed to encourage job creation.  Let the Minister take his courage in his hands and, if necessary, have a major trawl done within the Department to isolate the issues leading to unemployment.  He will have the support of this House in any reasonable proposal which is clearly and definitely focused on job creation.  I am putting forward these proposals in a non-confrontational way. It is imperative for us all to see where our system is wrong when it comes to jobs. This Bill is a total failure in that it evades the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some other changes which the Minister should seriously consider, <Col N="2513" /> including a few pet anomalies of mine which he might consider amending the Bill to cover.  It is very unfair that middle-aged people should find that their unemployment assistance is reduced by the benefit in privilege provision when they are residing with relatives.  It was pointed out by the Commission on Social Welfare that there is some justification for this provision where a young person is living with parents.  There is a notional assessment in relation to living at home.  It is, however, altogether ridiculous that a person in the forties living perhaps on the charity of a brother or cousin should find that unemployment assistance is reduced as a consequence.  I strongly appeal to the Minister to adopt the proposals of the Commission on Social Welfare and exclude the benefit deemed to arise from living at home for those over the age of 25.</P>
    <P>I also feel strongly about payment of the prescribed relative allowance and I cannot understand why it is not paid to the person providing care for an elderly relative.  The first step should be to pay it direct to the carer, then as resources permit to increase the amount of money payable, which should be at least on the supplementary welfare level, and thereafter to extend it to other categories who are caring for the sick and disabled.  It was ironic that a lady in receipt of a contributory old age pension recently attended my clinic bearing a tax demand from the Inspector of Taxes based on the amount of the prescribed relative allowance she was getting.  I hope it is a mistake and I have raised the case with the Minister for Finance.  If it is not a mistake, it is adding insult to injury in respect of this allowance.</P>
    <P>My party have circulated a Bill on the right to privacy.  The humiliation suffered by many people going to social welfare and other public offices and being expected to disclose their personal affairs in public must be avoided, if at all possible. A minimum degree of privacy should be afforded to applicants and others who have occasion to go to such public offices.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the position of <Col N="2514" /> children.  While I am glad to see the Minister rolling back even further on the question of child benefit, the whole question of support from the State in relation to children needs to be looked at in greater detail.  The position of families is affected not just by child benefit.  There is also the matter of child dependant allowances.  In the general taxation system we have no income tax allowances in respect of children. In respect of the residential property tax, the reduction which was available for children has now gone because the child tax allowance has been removed.  I accept that it is not a very serious point, but is just another part of a rather complex cocktail.  Taking into account the changes that should be made in the family income supplement, the need to introduce a new payment such as a back to school payment and so on, I suggest that there should be a special examination of how we support children today.  A body such as the Combat Poverty Agency have the expertise and resources to carry out such a complex examination and I should like to ask the Minister to make an official request to them to carry it out.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that more progress has not been made towards simplifying the system.  I would like to see, as far as possible, the abolition of the differentials in all child dependent allowances under the social welfare code.  I would like to see the differential in relation to dependent spouse allowances being removed. The way forward is to increase the allowances for those at the bottom of the scale. We must simplify the system in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another issue the Minister should take on board.  The Commission on Social Welfare recommended some years ago that all income support schemes of the State be transferred to the Department of Social Welfare. They were referring, in particular, to the disabled person's maintenance allowance which is operated by the Department of Health and the health boards.  They also recommended that all treatment benefits be transferred from the Department of Social Welfare to the Department of Health but that has not <Col N="2515" /> been done.  We now have the dispute between the Minister for Social Welfare and the Irish Dental Association which has all the signs of becoming more bitter and prolonged.  The Minister should stand back from that dispute and, as part of the solution, implement the recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare in regard to dental services.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at the position of old age pensioners and those in receipt of blind pensions because it is very unfair for those in receipt of non-contributory pensions to be assessed at a rate of 10 per cent on the few pounds they have in the bank or elsewhere &mdash; it is known down the country as funeral money.  Those people, despite the fact that they receive about 3 per cent interest on their deposits, are assessed for means purposes at a flat artificial rate of 10 per cent.  It is time to change that and I urge the Minister to do so.  The Minister should look at the <i>pro rata</i> pension system which he is now amending in order to correct a mistake that was made last year. However, those on mixed insurance are left high and dry.  Some people are forced to make contributions under the new self-employed scheme without any hope of getting a pension.  I am thinking in particular of those who are more than 56 years of age.  They will have to make contributions until they reach the age of 66 but they will not be entitled to a contributory pension.  The Minister should introduce <i>pro rata</i> pensions to cater for such people.</P>
    <P>The Bill is largely unexceptional and mechanical.  Obviously, we will have to tease out a number of its provisions on Committee Stage.  I should like to refer to some fears I have about the new provisions in regard to liability to maintain the family.  In principle, I favour the idea behind the proposal but I am worried about the effects of the Bill as it is drafted.  It is clear that there is no co-ordination of family law and social welfare legislation.  Under current maintenance regulations if a wife is regarded as being in desertion the courts may not allow maintenance.  Neither can she get <Col N="2516" /> a deserted wife's allowance although she can get a supplementary welfare allowance. It is ludicrous to think that a husband in such a case may have had a maintenance order refused by the courts but he may subsequently be ordered by the same court to reimburse the Minister for Social Welfare or a health board.  The District Court, under this provision, will be able to order a contribution even though on a different application a maintenance order might earlier have been refused.  That seems to have the possibility of bringing the law into serious disrepute. However, that is not my most serious concern.  The new section 317 is more worrying.  It may amount to an attack on a dependent wife.  If she is in receipt of a deserted wife's allowance and subsequently files an application for a maintenance order she must notify the Department of Social Welfare.  The Minister will then decide what portion of the maintenance must be reimbursed.  Under that provision it is solely for the Minister to determine the amount.  On what basis will such a determination be made?  A more serious prospect is that such a determination might include provision for retrospective payments leaving the deserted wife, and her children, far worse off than if she had never filed an application for maintenance.</P>
    <P>Similar questions arise under the next section.  If a person ceases to receive the benefit or allowance is she still liable to make payments retrospectively?  There is a danger that the section, as framed, may result not in husbands meeting their obligations but in wives and children being kept in poverty.  I am worried, particularly in the light of the experience of the ill-thought out proposals mentioned earlier, that anomalies will arise.  It is obvious that the effect of the proposal, as drafted, is that it will undermine court decisions and, more important, instead of bringing recalcitrant spouses to heel may amount to an attack on deserted wives.  It is important that the House should tease out those provisions fully on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have stated I am very disappointed with the Bill.  The priority <Col N="2517" /> focus for us all must be on jobs, not jobs for the boys but jobs for as many men and women as possible.  The economic imperative, the social imperative and the political imperative is job creation.  The Bill lacks the vision, foresight and reforms needed to encourage job creation.  It is my intention to table, on behalf of Fine Gael, a series of amendments principally focused on job creation and the reforms needed in our social welfare system to encourage that.</P>

      <P>The manner in which social welfare issues are dealt with by the Dáil is totally unsatisfactory.  There are only two general debates each year in the House on matters relating to social welfare.  The first is the debate on the Social Welfare Bill which gives legislative effect to the budget changes in relation to social welfare matters.  The second debate is that on the Estimate for the Department.  It is usually a two-hour debate and deals with the allocation of money for the various sections of welfare. That is a disgrace given that we spend £2.6 billion each year on social welfare, £1.6 billion put in by the Exchequer and a further £1 billion by the social insurance fund.  There are 741,478 recipients of social welfare and they have 160,514 adult dependants.  Almost one million adults are in receipt of some social welfare payment each week.</P>
      <P>It is time we reformed fundamentally our social welfare system.  I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for Social Welfare who has gone much further than any of his predecessors in seeking to rationalise the number of payments, to simplify the system and to extend welfare payments to new categories of persons.  I should like to compliment him for that because he has made major improvements. He has been imaginative in many ways.  He has reduced the number of payments in respect of children from 36 to 12 and the number of payments in respect of other categories from 17 to six. That is still not good enough but when people make an effort to go in the right direction they deserve our support and compliments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2518" /> However, until such time as the House establishes an all-party committee to simplify our social welfare code we will not get the type of changes that are urgently required.  Such a committee should be established as soon as possible.  It should have working with it the Economic and Social Research Institute which would act in the first instance as a research group to that committee and, second, as an outside independent group working on a consultative basis with Members of this House.  That committee should receive submissions from people working with social welfare recipients and the poor and deprived in our society.</P>
    <P>So many of these groups put a lot of time and money into preparing very detailed worthwhile submissions but, unfortunately, do not get very far.  Such a committee should be asked to report to this House within nine months to one year and the findings fully debated and implemented by whatever Government happen to be in power.  It is disgraceful that the report of the Committee on Social Welfare has never been debated in this House.  Such reports on which a lot of public money has been spent and on which there is much public interest should be debated by the Members of this House.</P>
    <P>This happens not just in relation to social welfare matters.  The very fine reports of the Commission on Taxation are never debated in this House either. When problems arise there is great urgency on the part of the Government of the day to establish a committee to longfinger action to get over the problems. Then the reports of these commissions are usually left in the Library of this House and ignored.</P>
    <P>Our welfare system which is very complicated is also very unfair.  It could be radically reformed by introducing a number of sensible measures.  I will mention just a few.  Those who are dependent on social welfare have to go through the most degrading treatment to get what they should be entitled to.  The means test carried out by both the Department of Social Welfare and other Government <Col N="2519" /> and State agencies is often degrading to those who have to go through them.</P>
    <P>A new self-assessment system should be introduced.  If it is appropriate for people to assess themselves for taxation purposes it is equally appropriate for people to assess themselves for social welfare purposes.  The Minister has said already that he is considering introducing self-assessment for more categories of social welfare payments.  I would urge him to do that as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>At the moment there are 11 different means test schemes in operation in the Department of Social Welfare.  In response to a Dáil question by my party last week I learned that there were 234,084 such tests carried out in the last year in which figures were available, 1986; and that there are 235 social welfare officers involved in this work.  That is a waste of the resources of the State.  These public servants would be more usefully employed working with applicants for social welfare explaining people's rights and acting as a liaison between the public on the one hand and the Department on the other.  Obviously any means test based on self-assessment would have to carry with it very stiff penalties if false information is given.</P>
    <P>At the moment a person applying for social welfare may also have to apply for a medical card and may live in a local authority house.  He may have to apply to the Department of Social Welfare first for supplementary benefits when they are assessed, and then to the health board for a medical card; the local authority will then assess them for differential rent. This is a gross waste of limited resources, and it is time it was brought to an end.  All that is necessary is a simple application form, a simple means test for all these benefits.  People could complete these forms and if necessary they could get assistance from the officers currently engaged in carrying out means tests.</P>
    <P>Another degrading practice is the requirement that unemployed people sign on each week to prove that they are unemployed.  Many have to queue in the street, and many hold newspapers over <Col N="2520" /> their faces because they are ashamed of the fact that they are unemployed.  This is a disgraceful way to treat our unemployed. There are major problems with unemployment here.  It should not be necessary for people to go through such degrading procedures to get what they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>An extension of the new notification of commencement of earnings procedure to all categories of employment, in addition to stiffer penalties, would be a more effective way of ensuring that those who claim unemployment benefit or assistance are genuinely unemployed. The defence used for the present procedure is that it acts as a deterrent to people in employment claiming benefit. I do not believe that.  A small number of people might escape if the system was changed but the vast majority claiming assistance or unemployment benefit are genuinely unemployed decent people who deserve to be treated better by the State.</P>
    <P>At the moment there are 11 different rates of payment in respect of children in our social welfare system.  This is a huge improvement on what existed two years ago.  Nevertheless, it is unnecessary to have so many different rates.  Only two are needed, one for children up to the age of ten and a higher rate for older children whose needs are more expensive. Implementing this would greatly simplify the system and help in particular families with a large number of children.</P>
    <P>The supplementary welfare system acts as a fire brigade system for those in emergency situations.  Despite its drawbacks, there is a need for a flexible system of welfare which can deal with emergencies as they arise.  However, it is not necessary for that system to be operated by the Department of Health.  That leads to unnecessary duplication.  I would urge the Minister to incorporate that scheme into his Department.</P>
    <P>I agree too with the comments made by Deputy O'Keeffe in relation to the disabled person's allowance.  That too is a welfare matter and should be run by the Department of Social Welfare.  Anything that relates to health is more appropriate <Col N="2521" /> to the Department of Health.  It should not be seen as a welfare matter but should be handled by the appropriate Department. Administrative procedures would be greatly improved if they were more streamlined and if the Department ultimately responsible for welfare matters, the Department of Social Welfare, took over total responsibility for all aspects of welfare.</P>
    <P>The recent ESRI report for the Combat Poverty Agency on poverty in Ireland showed that 17 per cent of the poor belonged to families where the head of the household was in employment. That is a frightening statistic.  Despite the head of household being in employment, these families are living in poverty and still have to pay PRSI and tax.  For example, a married man with four children earning £220 per week pays £42 a week in tax and £16 a week in PRSI. PRSI is a tax on work and acts as a major disincentive to employment.  If we are to encourage employment this disincentive needs to be removed.  It is not a social insurance in any sense.  It is no more than a tax under another name.  It is time we dismantled the PRSI system by removing the payment of employees' PRSI.  I accept that it cannot be done overnight but we should begin the process.  A more effective way of helping low income earners in this year's budget would have been to remove the payment of PRSI from the first £2,000 worth of income.  I know there was a question to the Minister on what that would cost and I have not seen the answer; but I understand that in 1989 the removal of PRSI from the first £2,000 worth of income would have cost £87 million.</P>
    <P>Despite the improvements in the budget that the Minister said would help low income families, there will be no improvement at all for families with an income of £3,000 or less, yet they will continue to pay PRSI.  If we removed PRSI from the first £2,000 of income all employees would have been helped, but particularly low income earners.</P>
    <P>On 26 January in his budget speech the Minister gave an example of how the changes would help low income families, <Col N="2522" /> particularly the tax exemption changes and the child benefit increases for low income families.  One of the strange things I discovered about that was that if you were earning £7,000 a year your income, including family income supplement, would be £179 per week but if you were earning £9,000 a year your income, including family income supplement, would be £169 per week.  In other words, you would get £10 a week less while earning £2,000 a year more.  That indicates very clearly the disincentive effect of the PRSI system and the fact that it puts many people into the poverty trap.  For an employer to give a single employee on average industrial earnings an extra £1 in take home pay it will cost him in excess of £3.  That is a disgrace. The gap between what the employee takes home and what it costs the employer is so huge that it acts as a major disincentive to employment and increases costs for the country.  It leads to our products being less competitive than they are elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the improvements that were made in rationalising the number of payments for the different schemes.  I note the Minister said he intends to introduce one scheme for lone parent families.  I believe one scheme would be sufficient; I understand there are six schemes at present.  I believe equally that there should be only one scheme and one rate of payment for all those who are unemployed.  That people should fall into different categories of payment simply on the basis of whether they have been employed for three months, six months or whatever or on the basis of previous social insurance contributions is wrong and unfair.  I also believe there should be one rate of payment for those whom I would broadly describe as handicapped or invalids.  The only area where there should be two rates, where there should be a distinction between those who paid PRSI for a long period during their working lives and those who paid for a shorter time, is in the area of old age pensions.  It would be right that people who have paid PRSI on the understanding that they would get more when <Col N="2523" /> they retired or when they were elderly should continue to receive a higher rate. Other than that there should be just one rate of payment for all categories of persons.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to introduce as soon as possible the measures he announced over 12 months ago in relation to the payment of disability benefit.  This is one area of the social welfare system where there is widespread abuse and fraud.  Until such time as employers are asked to police the disability payments scheme, particularly for the first number of weeks &mdash; I understand consideration is being given to the first 13 weeks &mdash; we will not see major improvements.  It is over-bureaucratic and very expensive to have to engage in the medical referee procedure particularly in the early weeks of disability payment.  It would be much more effective if the employer was asked to do this job.</P>
    <P>Some of the measures I welcome in this Bill include the abolition of the distinction between the urban and non-urban rates of unemployment assistance. As the Minister said in his speech, to pay different rates to people who live sometimes in the same estate &mdash; as happens in places like Clondalkin and Tallaght and other parts of the country &mdash; is ludicrous.  It is time that scheme, which I understand from the Minister's speech, came into being in 1934, was ended because there is no longer a need for it. Equally, the new measures to deal with the collusion between employers and employees should be welcomed.  The employer will be liable for repayment on demand, by way of a civil debt, of any moneys paid to an employee where he colludes with him or her in relation to pretending the person is unemployed.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a deserted husband's or widower's allowance is also to be welcomed although obviously there will be still a distinction between women and men in that men will be means tested and will receive the payment on an assistance basis only whereas women qualify on a benefit basis.  Nonetheless, the changes are to be welcomed and are long <Col N="2524" /> overdue.  The changes in separate payments is also to be welcomed.  There is no doubt that since the spouse is only paid the adult dependant rate plus the rate for children causes grave hardship for many spouses.  A separated wife whose husband is unemployed can often get £20 less per week than a deserted wife.  It is right that a greater proportion of the payment should go to the dependent spouse, the person who in many cases looks after the children.  Nonetheless, where there are difficulties of that kind it is virtually impossible, no matter what system we have, for two people living separately to survive on the same level of payment as they would survive on as a family.  That is not possible and I am not sure what the correct approach would be to making it possible.</P>
    <P>The new procedure whereby the Minister or the health board can apply to the District Court for a maintenance order against a deserting spouse is to be welcomed. It is right that the State should take on board the responsibility of tracing and making deserting spouses liable for their families.  It is very difficult to expect a person &mdash; a woman in the main &mdash; in this position to have to go through the trauma and the difficulty of trying to track down her husband and take him to court in order to prove that she is genuinely deserted.  It is right that the State should take over this responsibility.  It is also right that if the State is paying benefit to a deserted wife, or to a deserted husband after the new arrangements have been introduced, it should be able to recover from the person who has so deserted the amount to be paid, if that is possible. However, the remarks I made in relation to separate payments apply in this case, too.  It is often not possible for people living separately to survive on the level of income or welfare payments they would be able to survive on in a single family unit.</P>
    <P>The extension of the age from 18 years to 19 years for child dependant allowance for the long-term unemployed, where the child is still school going, is also to be welcomed.  That this allowance has been limited to 18 year olds has caused grave <Col N="2525" /> hardship for many families.  Many young people are still at school, and do not do their leaving certificate examination until they are 19 and it is only right, particularly for families on long-term unemployment, that they should continue to receive the allowance until the person is 19 years old.</P>
    <P>For many people who may have been for many years paying a high mortgage and suddenly find themselves unemployed, their whole world almost falls apart.  Very often they are no longer able to continue making their mortgage repayments and have to look to local authorities for housing.  I believe the equivalent amount of the mortgage interest relief, paid at the standard rate of tax which is about £1,260 per year for a person on full interest relief, should be paid to people who become unemployed. That would be a much more effective way of helping people in this category than allowing them to lose their houses and to turn to local authorities to provide them with houses costing £40,000 or more in this city and in other parts of the country. If workers are entitled to mortgage interest relief, those who have had a mortgage for a number of years and become unemployed should be equally entitled to a particular allowance and not just be dependent on a supplementary welfare allowance or some such allowance at the discretion of a community welfare officer.  They should be entitled, as of right, to a payment to help them keep their homes and the Government should consider that.  If that measure was introduced instead of, for example, pay related benefit it would be far more effective and would help a category of people who find it very hard to cope and who have for a long time tried to help themselves in every way possible.</P>
    <P>In this country there is an over-dependency on the State to provide people with maintenance in cases where they could rightly help themselves if the tax system was fairer and if there was more of an incentive to work.  Any changes that are suggested in the welfare area must be accompanied side by side with changes in the taxation system.  One cannot move in <Col N="2526" /> one direction without following suit in the other.  If one were to do so one would create new poverty traps and would further increase the disincentive to employment.</P>
    <P>In the ESRI report, it was suggested that £80 a week was a reasonable income for an adult and that 60 per cent of that or £48 per week would be the poverty line.  I do not think that is too much to expect.  The rate in respect of a spouse is 0.7 per cent of that, which is £34, and 0.5 per cent in relation to a child, which is £24.  According to the ESRI a couple with five children should be entitled to £202 per week, if one takes the 60 per cent level of income, and anything below that would be considered to be living in poverty. I am aware of the remarks of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in relation to the numbers of our people living in poverty.  Neither of them accepts that 1.3 million people live in poverty. The Taoiseach made the point that when the Combat Poverty Agency were drawing up their report they did not take into account non-cash payments made to many social welfare recipients.  That may well be the case, but for a married couple with five children £202 per week is not an enormous amount of money.  Yet somebody at that level of income, for example, somebody in receipt of a gross income of £220 a week, with five children, would pay £58 a week in tax and PRSI contributions. In other words, we are taxing some people into poverty.</P>
    <P>One of the first things this Government should do to alleviate poverty, particularly for low-income families, would be to commence dismantling the PRSI system, which would be much more effective than the family income supplement.  The Minister referred to the report on the family income supplement and said that, contrary to earlier impressions, 20,000 families only rather than 35,000 should be entitled to the family income supplement. Even if we take the 20,000 families, we find that just over 5,000 of them are currently in receipt of the family income supplement.  That means that approximately 25 per cent of those entitled to it are in receipt of it.  There <Col N="2527" /> are a number of reasons for that.  First, there is a problem in relation to information about the provisions of the scheme; I know from the people with whom I deal that they are not familiar with its provisions.  Second, the scheme is complicated.  It is not easy for somebody to ascertain whether they are entitled to its provisions.  Third, there is an impression that if somebody qualifies they will lose other benefits they might have had such as a medical card or whatever. It is my belief that this scheme will never be effective, that it will never be possible to get to those 20,000 families. Although the Minister compared the take-up with that of similar schemes in other European countries, contending that probably 12,000 was a more realistic figure at which to aim, I believe that if we work on PRSI we can target exactly those who are in the poverty trap, who are working but are in need of special assistance in order to make it worth while for them to make an effort for themselves. In the long run I believe if we begin the dismantling of the PRSI system &mdash; even if only on the first £1,000 of income &mdash; it would immediately and radically improve the take-home pay of low income families.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred briefly to child benefit.  At one point he contended that all mothers will receive child benefit, that at present it is possible, through the taxation system, to correlate child benefit and income levels and that this has been done in respect of 70 per cent of beneficiaries. Like many women in this House and many others in the country I believe it is time to target child benefit to low income families.  I believe it is not unreasonable to cease paying child benefit to people on incomes of over £30,000 per annum.  Even though I accept that &mdash; as the Minister said in the course of answering questions in this House last week &mdash; that that would save only £5 million, if that amount could be allocated to the most deprived and poorest sections of the community it would be indeed worth while.  There is no justification for paying the same level of child benefit to <Col N="2528" /> somebody with an income of £35,000 per year and somebody in receipt of social welfare of, say, between £3,000 and £5,000 per annum.  It is time this political hot potato was grasped by this Government once and for all.</P>
    <P>Way back in the early sixties the present Taoiseach, then Minister for Finance, spoke about targeting child benefit to low income families and taking it from top income earners.  Twenty-seven years on we have done nothing to target child benefit to the poorest and most deprived sections of our community.  Many people argue that it constitutes a payment to women and that it would be an insult to women were it abolished.  First, I might make the case that it is a payment to women with children only, so that childless married women are entitled to nothing, which is a poor reflection on this State.  Second, when children reach a certain age they are not entitled to anything either.  Perhaps a more effective method of assisting dependent women would be to consider payment directly to women who have children, and those who do not, the tax-free allowance their spouses are entitled to claim on their behalf.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the notification to the Department by employers of new employees the Minister has introduced with regard to the contract cleaning, forestry, construction and security areas.  As the Minister said, these were the areas in which the greatest abuse occurred.  I contend that provision should be introduced in all sectors.  I believe there is widespread abuse in agriculture and within the motor and catering industries.  I do not single them out; each sector should be expected to comply with these new provisions.  I accept that there will be difficulties encountered when introducing schemes of this type.  Nonetheless the Government should extend its provisions to all persons newly employed. The Minister referred to what he called cowboy sub-contractors or employers.  I believe that would be an effective way to deal with those people defrauding the State to the detriment of the most vulnerable in our society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2529" /> If that provision is to be really effective it will have to be accompanied by the introduction of an indentity card scheme. I do not favour the introduction of an identity card scheme for social welfare recipients only: it is time such a scheme was introduced for all citizens from the age of 16 onwards.  We always appear to be afraid of the big brother attitude, any form of what might be regarded as officialdom.  We now fall into the category of a small number of European countries that do not have such identity cards.  The identity card would not merely combat fraudulent practices within the social welfare and taxation systems and in relation to crime, under-age drinking and so many other areas, but would also save our citizens having to use passports when they travel to other European countries.</P>
    <P>I must compliment in particular senior officials of the Department of Social Welfare who in recent years have gone out of their way to deliver social welfare payments in a more effective manner to their beneficiaries.  There is no doubt that there has been a huge improvement in the level of service to recipients.  As a public representative I cannot but compliment the Department on the quick, effective manner in which they deal with queries from us.  I have been a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas for 12 years and I can honestly say that it is the Government Department that has improved most within that period.  For example, there was a time when it took weeks to elicit a simple reply to a query; now one can have such a response within a matter of hours.  In particular I want to compliment those who have been responsible for initiating a more effective manner of dealing with the public, public representatives and recipients.</P>
    <P>However, we need to go somewhat further in terms of the information emanating from that Department because, generally speaking, it is not as simple as it might be.  It is not easy for many applicants for benefits to ascertain exactly their entitlements.  Application forms and accompanying explanatory leaflets could be simplified to a much <Col N="2530" /> greater extent so that the public would understand exactly their entitlements and what is expected of them.  I will give a simple example of something I encounter in my clinics, that is, that many people do not understand the meaning of the word &ldquo;spouse&rdquo;.  Some people might find that difficult to believe but it is a fact. The simpler the language the easier it will be for applicants to complete the relevant forms.</P>
    <P>Neither is there much point in inserting huge advertisements in papers such as <i>The Irish Times</i> or the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> because generally they are not read by social welfare beneficiaries.  We need to target such information and the advertising in which the Department engage more at newspapers, periodicals and publications read by those entitled to benefit. That is not to contend that one can reach all beneficiaries through newspapers or information leaflets.  We could be more efficient in targeting the information and publicity at those by whom it is really required.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with <i>pro rata</i> pensions. While I welcome the changes that were made last year, there is a great deal of confusion and those in the mixed insurance category are still excluded. There are very many elderly people who feel very sore that they will not qualify for even a reduced pension.  Given the difficulties that have been caused by this particular problem, it is unreasonable to exclude this category of persons.  I ask the Minister to clarify a number of points. For example, I understand that if somebody who worked in this country prior to emigrating returned later and took up employment here they would also be disqualified. Likewise, somebody who was in employment and later became self-employed but went back to working for someone else is also disqualified.  Those who returned to paying the full rate of contribution prior to 1974 are also excluded.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify who is included under the arrangements.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the level of poverty in this country.  Whatever <Col N="2531" /> figure you take, and regardless of whether you agree with the Taoiseach, there is no doubt that a great number of families, in particular, are living in very real poverty or at least in difficult financial circumstances. Despite the real improvements in helping the long-term unemployed, who are in receipt of the lowest levels of payment, that has not been an effective way of helping the very poor families.  A more effective way of helping families, in particular, would be to increase the dependent allowance in respect of the spouse.  At present spouses receive around £27 a week.  If we were to increase that to £40 a week, an increase of £13 per week &mdash; which I understand would have cost £21 million in 1989 &mdash; it would have been a huge increase for families and would have been an effective way of dealing with the problems of large families especially.</P>
    <P>We need to remove a number of existing anomalies in our social welfare system between what I would regard as persons in married situations and those in unmarried situations.  For example, an unmarried mother having a liaison with an unemployed man on long-term unemployment assistance is entitled to £22 a week more than her counterpart who is married.  I know the Minister will tell me that if the woman has a liaison in any formal sense and the person concerned is living with her, she will not get the unmarried mother's allowance.  There is a disincentive for that person to get married simply because they will be worse off by £22 a week.  The only way we will change that anomaly and ensure that families are not discriminated against in our social welfare system is to increase the amount paid in respect of the dependent spouse.  If that allowance remains as low as it is, the anomaly will always exist.</P>
    <P>No matter what employment incentive the Government introduce over the next few years, we will still have a major problem with unemployment.  Almost 20 per cent of the workforce are out of work. There are 16 million people unemployed throughout the European Communities. <Col N="2532" /> Even if the Cecchini report with its projected 2 million to 5 million jobs, depending on the action taken by national governments, comes through after 1992, that still means that only 33 per cent of the unemployed in Europe will get jobs.</P>
    <P>There will have to be introduced in this country and in the European Communities more imaginative ways of helping the long-term unemployed to have an interest in life in general and in particular to find a useful role for themselves.  There are many unemployed people who would love the opportunity of participating in some type of course or of helping, in a voluntary capacity, one day a week perhaps, a voluntary or Government agency. We need to introduce a scheme that allows people in the long-term unemployed category an opportunity of making some contribution to society, even if it is only on a voluntary basis.  I have no doubt that many of the long-term unemployed would like to avail of the opportunity of doing something worth while with their time.  Such a scheme would have to be organised on a national and official basis.  I have no doubt that the skills and resources of the unemployed are being wasted and that people have to waste away in order to qualify for unemployment benefit. People get to the stage when they have been looking for work for such a long time that it is no longer worth their while trying because when they take bus fares, phone calls, or postage into account, it is too expensive to look for work that is not there.  The State has an obligation to use the resources and skills of the unemployed in an imaginative way.  It might just mean asking somebody to help out in a local school or hospital.  There is endless work to be done, which I think could be organised in an official way so that more use could be made of the skills and resources of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the need to establish a committee of this House for the purpose of simplifying and reforming our social welfare system.  Such a committee, given the correct terms of reference and composed of Members of this House interested in welfare matters and given <Col N="2533" /> the back-up research facilities of a group such as the ESRI and indeed the Department of Social Welfare, could have a huge effect in changing radically and improving the position of welfare recipients. Some years ago I had the privilege of sitting on a committee that consolidated the then Social Welfare Acts. The committee did not sit for very long but it was an interesting experience. Many Members spend a huge amount of their time dealing with people's welfare applications and matters relating to social welfare of one kind or another.  We see many examples of anomalies and we would like to have a say in improving the situation.  It is a shame that we have not had that opportunity, that we do not ever have an opportunity to influence social welfare, because, as I said earlier, there are usually only two opportunities to debate welfare matters, and that is during the course of the Social Welfare Bill and the Estimate speech.  The experience of Members could usefully be put at the disposal of this country if such a committee were to be established and given a period of nine months to a year to report.  Such a committee could consider the report of the Commission on Social Welfare, many of whose recommendations I support, but I think the commission operated on the concept of extending social welfare rather than limiting the concept of dependency and trying to help people to help themselves. I have no doubt that if we move towards reducing taxation and dismantling the disincentives to employment by way of PRSI payments, we will create opportunities for people who are currently dependent on the State in order to survive. I believe also that if we end some of the degrading practices such as signing on for unemployment benefits and the various means tests for social welfare payments we will have improved the position of those who are most vulnerable in our society, who are dependent on social welfare.  These measures could be introduced if people had a little more faith in our welfare recipients.  There is a view <Col N="2534" /> that if somebody is a social welfare recipient or unemployed, that person is obviously lazy and could not care less.  I have no doubt that there are lazy people among the unemployed but there are also people working who are lazy and could not care less and I do not think that this is confined to one group or the other.</P>
    <P>We have an obligation to be concerned about those in our society who are dependent on the State.  We have an obligation to represent them because they do not have the powerful lobbies that other groups have.  I am delighted that the Catholic Church, in particular, has seen fit to speak out on their behalf in recent times.  Groups like the Combat Poverty Agency have been vociferous in highlighting the need for change in our social welfare system.  I think the most effective way that this Dáil could help to bring about the type of changes required and show the concern that social welfare recipients deserve is by establishing a committee of this House which over the next couple of months would apply itself with great vigour and concern to reforming many of the anomalies that currently put people at the bottom level in our society in a very difficult situation.</P>
    <P>There may not be a lot we can do in terms of financial aid for social welfare recipients.  This country does not have huge resources, but we can do a lot to streamline and improve the system to make it more effective and fair.  If we were setting up a social welfare system now and did not have the plethora of schemes introduced in recent years to deal with problems, we would not take on board many of the schemes that are currently in operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>To take up Deputy Harney's point about an all-party committee, I mentioned that a number of times over the last six years to different Ministers for Social Welfare.  When one considers that approximately one third of the population are in receipt of social welfare in one form or another compared with the very small number of people and the small level of employment affected by semi-State companies whose activities <Col N="2535" /> receive substantial headlines when examined by a committee of the House, one wonders where our priorities are.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt about the absolute need for an all-party committee of this House to deal with social welfare.  I entirely agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Harney that such a committee should be properly serviced with the necessary expertise.  We should not have to rely on pre-budget submissions by various organisations drawing attention to the problems of poverty. National and local politicians who work with people on a daily basis do not need to be reminded about poverty because we see it every day of the week.</P>
      <P>We should get our act together.  The only real discussion of any kind about social welfare takes place during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill.  That is not good enough.  The people in the poverty trap are the only section of the community without a representative body.  The farmers have a very strong representative body, as do the organised workforce through the Irish Congress of Trade Unions or individual unions.  To the credit of the unions, they have attempted to play a part in the area of social welfare.  There are also the FUE and the CII representing other power blocs or pressure groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody really represents the people on social welfare except the Members of Dáil Éireann.  It is our responsibility to ensure that people on social welfare have enough on which to live.  They do not have that at the moment.  The churches, collectively, have recognised this and I welcome their intervention in this area as many of us who are involved in political parties and who take an interest in social welfare recipients are not listened to because there are no dramatic headlines about somebody dying from hunger or about a person living outside the Dáil in a cardboard box because there is not enough money for a B &amp; B, to live in a hotel or to get a house.  Not so long ago, I saw a woman asleep in a cardboard box within ten yards of the gate of Dáil Éireann.  That sort of thing is happening <Col N="2536" /> all over Dublin city, and it is happening more and more throughout our towns and cities.  Last week I saw a young fellow of 16 in a homeless aid centre.  The home had broken up and he had no income and did not qualify for any assistance.  He had to go to a homeless aid centre in order to survive, and he was suffering from malnutrition.  The whole question of poverty is something the Dáil have to come to grips with.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister has made an attempt to rationalise the system, but what has been done related to problems that have been standing out like sore thumbs over many years.  These problems should have been dealt with many years ago by successive Governments.  It was pointed out by me and other Members of the Dáil that there were many confusing aspects of social welfare relating to the multiplicity of rules and regulations and the 47 or 48 different benefit systems and so on.  Part of the work of an all party committee could be to rationalise the system, to simplify it and to find a way to allow people in receipt of social welfare not to feel degraded and insulted by the system.  We should finish up with a system that would allow people an income on which they could survive.</P>
    <P>It is all right for us, for the Minister and the Department to talk of a 3 per cent, a 5 per cent or an 11 per cent increase, but what does that mean to somebody on £37 a week social welfare? There are people who would spend that in the Shelbourne Hotel on one lunch and yet we expect people to feed and clothe themselves on that.</P>
    <P>I would refer to another point made by Deputy Harney.  I am not trying to steal the Deputy's thunder; I just happen to agree with the two main points she made. I agree with Deputy Harney that the service provided by the Department has improved substantially, but the reason is different from that given by Deputy Harney.  The reason for the improvement was the furore in the national media about the level of PQs being put down by Members, including Deputy Harney. I remember heading the poll in relation to that at one time, and getting a right <Col N="2537" /> telling off in the national media because it was costing so much to put down PQs and get replies from the Department of Social Welfare.  As a result the system has been radically changed and, as Deputy Harney said, we can now get the information virtually overnight, or within 48 hours.  That service is much appreciated by the unfortunate people who because of a delay in the post, a delay in handling a query or shortage of staff in a Department often had to wait eight or ten weeks to receive payment of benefit and crawl on their hands and knees into a community welfare officer to get payment pending a reply to a query.  The system has changed and I hope it changes still further.  When one looks at the Order Paper now &mdash; and the Ceann Comhairle will know this better than anyone &mdash; one will see that the number of questions to the Department of Social Welfare has been substantially reduced.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to abuse, which in social welfare terms always gets major headlines.  I suppose one can understand the reason for this but there is a new practice in the area of social welfare which is developing very rapidly.  This practice is led by the multiples who are now tearing the guts out of the bakery industry and putting very many men and women on the dole queue, this has happened to footwear workers, clothing workers and textile workers during the past 15 years.  These multiples are now the leaders in the &ldquo;part-time brigade&rdquo; which has developed over the past number of years.  Young girls and boys are employed on a part-time basis they work a few hours in the morning, a few hours in the afternoon and a few hours late at night, and they are paid buttons. One might ask what that has to do with social welfare.  It has a hell of a lot to do with social welfare.</P>
    <P>I carried out a survey in this area.  I believe the majority of these young people are being exploited to the extent that they are not paying any social welfare contributions because they are not working the statutory number of hours. In this way, the employers do not have to pay their proper contributions under <Col N="2538" /> the social welfare system but when these employees become unemployed they will not be entitled to proper social welfare payments.  This practice is developing at a rapid rate, particularly among the large multiples in the retail sector.  People are beginning to wonder when these workers will become full time employees.</P>
    <P>Last week in my town I met a girl who had been employed on a temporary part time basis for five years and who was not covered for any benefits.  These employers are putting people in the bakery, textile, footwear and clothing industries on the dole.  This practice needs to be investigated and these employers should be obliged to submit to the Department of Social Welfare information on the number of people they employ on a full-time basis, the number they employ on a part-time basis and the hours they work.</P>
    <P>This is one of the greatest exploitations of young people I have ever come across the 30 years I have been involved in trade union affairs.  The trade unions will have to become more active in this area and young people will have to be advised to join trade unions.  The reason many young people are not joining trade unions at present is that many of them come from the very families we are talking about today &mdash; families on low incomes and families on social welfare and in order to supplement the miserable amount of money they get from the social welfare system many kids are forced to take these jobs.  They often work very late at night, well after midnight in some cases, and in many cases there is no proper record of the payments made to them.  In this way the system is being deprived of substantial moneys and young people are being exploited because their parents do not have a decent income.</P>
    <P>If these families received a decent income the parents would not allow their children to take up employment with these racketeers.  These employers are racketeers of the worst kind &mdash; they steal money out of the pockets of young people and in many cases there is no return to the tax system or the social welfare system.  I <Col N="2539" /> ask the Minister to take particular note of this practice because, if it is allowed to develop, in a year or two from now it will have increased to alarming proportions.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some provisions in the Bill.  I welcome a number of them because they are proposals which came from the Labour Party and which I made in this House over the past number of years.  I am glad that the Minister has taken these proposals on board.  I do not know how long we have been discussing <i>pro rata</i> pensions, it was being discussed long before I came into Dáil Éireann but I do not think the present proposal goes far enough.  I intend putting down an amendment to this provision on Committee Stage and I hope the Minister will accept it.  I believe a <i>pro rata</i> pension should be dealt with as it states &mdash;<i>pro rata</i>&mdash; and anybody who pays social welfare should be paid <i>pro rata</i> to the contributions they have made.  The regulations, as they are now framed, will create much confusion and further anomalies. I will deal with this subject on Committee Stage.  However, I want to refer to one point.</P>
    <P>When many local authority employees and health board workers in certain categories who had paid social welfare contributions for 20 or 30 years were promoted to a supervisory position or became staff, which I think they are called, they did not continue to pay these contributions.  They went on to local authority pension schemes and the net result was that they were only entitled to that pension.  Many of those men who had worked all their lives are now getting less than if they were receiving an old age pension but they cannot get the old age pension because of the anomalies in the <i>pro rata</i> pension system.  They feel very bitter about this.  I hope to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer again to fraud. We need to be very careful that we do not go overboard.  Much resentment and fear is building up among the people on social welfare because they believe they are being interrogated in many cases. <Col N="2540" /> It was never intended that the various sections of the Department which investigate fraud should act in a Gestapo way. Of course, they are obliged to get and receive the information necessary in order to investigate any proposed fraud or abuse but I should like to draw the Minister's attention &mdash; and I am sure he is aware of this &mdash; to the fact that people feel that members of the public are being paid to spy on them at a price, on a piecework basis, and that they will be paid for everybody they squeal on.  It is necessary only for people to write a letter to the Department or to the local employment exchange making any accusation they wish against a next door neighbour.  I understand there is at the moment a special section dealing with such accusations. I have come across quite a bit of this.  When we go to defend these people at appeals it is not possible to get the information required to enter a proper defence.  Social welfare investigating officers, particularly those involved with the special investigating unit, will not supply us with the necessary documentation showing how they have come to the conclusion that a person has defrauded the system.</P>
    <P>There was a case of a man who had eight children having his benefit stopped on a Christmas Eve.  It took me one solid year to fight that case until it was discovered &mdash; and the Department accepted this &mdash; that it was a case of mistaken identity.  There were two persons with the same name and the social welfare officer identified the wrong man.  All the money was refunded to that person, but for one year he and his family felt like criminals.  The man will never forget the difficult time he had.  I am not saying that all cases are as bad as that, but there are a number of areas that must be changed with regard to the investigation of social welfare abuse.</P>
    <P>As the law is framed now, the social welfare investigating officer has more power than the Special Branch of the Garda Síochána, or any member of that body.  They must go through a certain drill in accordance with the law.  Effectively those investigating the abuse of <Col N="2541" /> social welfare payments can find a person guilty without ever bringing him or her to trial.  It is the only sector of the community that can be found guilty until proved innocent.  Once a complaint goes to the special investigating unit, payment is automatically cut off and the person must go to the community welfare officer for payment.  Information about the situation having being passed to him, the community welfare officer treats the person in the same way.</P>
    <P>The regulations under that section must be altered and, if not, we as Members of the Opposition jointly will have to do something to alter them.  In dealing with abuse one can over-react and innocent people are falling foul of that regulation at the moment.  When a complaint is made that a person is alleged to have been working or to have abused the system, that person should be presented with the facts and figures as received from the source by the investigating officer.  Even in a murder case, which is probably one of the most serious crimes, if not the most serious crime in any state, the solicitor or representative of the accused, will be able to examine the book of evidence before the court case takes place.  This is to establish the evidence the State has in relation to the charge of murder and ensures that that person can be properly defended.</P>
    <P>I spent more than 25 years on the appeals panel of the Department of Social Welfare.  People accused of working while in receipt of social welfare payments or of fraud have no means of defending themselves.  They do not know who made the complaint, or from whence it came.  They have no indication of what is in the report of the special investigating officer, what information was given to the deciding officer and on what basis he made his decision. When the matter goes to appeal, the appeals officer will write across the document: &ldquo;Decision of the deciding officer upheld&rdquo;.  No indication is given as to how that decision was arrived at.  I am consistently hearing of more of those cases not alone in my constituency but throughout the length and breadth of the country.  Serious consideration <Col N="2542" /> should be given to the whole question of the conduct of investigation, the powers of the officers concerned and the manner in which the information supplied to them should be made available, either to the person if he so wishes or to his representative.  I am making that plea.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of other matters arise but I am sure we can deal with them more adequately on Committee Stage.  I support the comments of the two previous speakers with regard to people over 60 years of age.  For example, people in the public service are being encouraged by the Government to take early retirement or voluntary redundancy.  They get their entitlements from the Department of Labour, and their pension from the local authority.  They sign on at the employment exchange and are asked where they are looking for employment. Did you ever hear anything more ridiculous? They are told they will get their pension, their redundancy money, a payment from the Department of Social Welfare, PRSI, etc. and then they can apply for unemployment assistance, and when they reach their retirement or old age pension date they will get their pension. Such people are now being told that they cannot get unemployment benefit because they are not looking for employment. It would not happen in Africa.  This is stone age stuff.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter by way of parliamentary question and am again doing so because I feel very strongly about it. People over 60 years of age should not be asked to fill in a form that they are seeking employment on the day they retire on a voluntary basis or go redundant, by encouragement from the local authority, the Department of the Environment and the Department of Labour. That is crazy.  I was hoping this Bill would include the elimination of the retirement benefit.  I do not see why there should be a two-tier retirement system.  If a person reaches the age of 65, the present recognised retirement age, he or she should be paid the old age pension there and then Look at the amount of administration that would save for a start.  Two sections in one Department deal with a person a <Col N="2543" /> 65 years of age and at 66 years of age, necessitating the filling in of additional forms and obtaining the same information twice.  Rationalisation would eliminate a very substantial amount of work within that Department.</P>
    <P>We must bring down the retirement age.  This is what we should do if we want to get some of the young people to work and take them off unemployment benefit or assistance in most cases.  It would be much better to have people retiring at 60 years of age, many of whom would have worked 40 or 45 years in full-time employment, rather than have young people emigrating to London, Birmingham or Manchester, or queueing up outside the American Embassy with cap in hand looking for a visa.  An all-party committee on social welfare should concentrate on matters of that kind and develop policy by all-party agreement in relation to social welfare.  This would ensure that far greater progress would be made.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the free fuel scheme.  In fairness, attempts were made to rationalise and improve the system.  I also accept that this is the first year of its operation and that, therefore, there would be problems.  However, major problems have developed.  For instance, an old age pensioner living with her son who is on unemployment assistance is not entitled to free fuel.  I am sure the Minister knows that in cases like that the young man or woman living with an older person will simply go and live with another relative so that the old person can get the free fuel.  We should not be encouraging children to leave home.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons for 32,000 people leaving the country this year and last is the low level of social welfare allowances.  They have to go, cap in hand, to the Department who carry out a means test.  If the father or mother of the young person is working the Department will not grant any allowance.  Sometimes an exception is made and a sum of £10 is given.  A young man came into my office some time ago and told me he had been awarded 50p and he had to travel six <Col N="2544" /> miles to collect it every week.  That young man is now working in London because he got sick of the system, and I would not blame him.  The Minister will have to come to grips with those two problems. In the case of the young man living at home, his father makes the major contribution to the home, but I have five children and I know what it costs to keep them at that age.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the indignity suffered by the young person.  The money offered is an insult to young people.  They cannot spend all their time sitting at home.  They need money to go to a disco or to bring their girl friend out for a pint or a bottle of lemonade.  They cannot keep walking the streets because that has led to a substantial increase in crime and other types of activity which were unheard of in past generations.  Thousands of young people are going to local employment offices and receiving a pittance. In some cases two or three young people rent a house or flat between them and they can then claim the full amount. It would be far better if they were under their parents' roof where at least they would be under control.  I appeal to the Minister, in the interests of the young unemployed, to change that rule.</P>
    <P>Nobody seems to be too clear about the guidelines issued to social welfare officers because one will grant £10 and another will grant £25.  Politicians have to bear the brunt of this policy as we are often asked how others in the same position get more money.  It is creating a lot of bitterness among young people and leading them into crime.  I do not know how much it would cost, financially, to change the regulations but keeping young people at home should be a priority.  If I could change any provision in the Social Welfare Bill it would be in relation to this allowance.  I appeal to the Minister to issue a new regulation to managers of employment exchanges and social welfare officers in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>Over 1.2 million people depend on social welfare and live in poverty.  That is 33.7 per cent of the population.  When various churches and church leaders plead with politicians to do something <Col N="2545" /> about the level of poverty and low social welfare payments, it is time to sit up and take notice.  I have come to the conclusion that nobody in the Oireachtas over the years gave a damn about the people on social welfare.  However, they will have to listen to them now.  Heretofore, people on social welfare represented a much smaller section of the community, but there are now more people on social welfare than there are farmers.  Indeed, farmers had some political clout and changed Governments for a hell of a lot less.  There are more people on social welfare than those affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and all the other unions.  They will eventually unite, they are merely waiting for someone to lead them.  I welcome the churches taking a more active part in highlighting their plight because they, more than anyone, realise what poverty is; like us, they see it in the course of their daily work.</P>
    <P>You cannot say that people are better off on social welfare.  Anyone who says that is telling a lie.  People on social welfare are no better off than they were 20 years ago.  The Minister has rationalised the system and brought in things which I had fought for over the years, even before I was a Member of this House.  However, that is not putting money in people's pockets or food in their bellies, and that is what we are talking about.  The question therefore is what do we do about it?  All of the savings should be used in improving the system and the greatest slice of the moneys owed by the biggest frauds of all, those who are defrauding the taxation system &mdash; it is those from whom we have to get money &mdash; should be given to the poorer sections of our community.  Poverty in Ireland is increasing and it will continue to increase until something dramatic is done.</P>
    <P>We should forget talking about increases of 3 per cent, 5 per cent or 11 per cent, as those in receipt of social welfare benefits do not understand percentages. They cannot afford to educate their children any longer as at every hand's turn the system wants to get money out of them.  It is only those in the <Col N="2546" /> higher income brackets who can afford to send their children to third level education. There are not too many people attending University College Dublin, Trinity College, University College Cork or University College Galway whose parents are in receipt of social welfare benefits.  The percentage is very low. When we talk about social welfare we should not forget that we are not only talking about the payment of social welfare benefits but also about what is going to happen in the future if we do not put people back to work or give them back their dignity.</P>
    <P>I hope we will eliminate the need to pay social welfare benefits altogether.  It is the greatest evil ever created.  It is an excuse for lazy Government and paying people a handout for doing nothing.  No man or woman wants to be paid for doing nothing.  They would prefer to go out and earn their living and that people would have respect for them.  That can only be put right by Dáil Éireann.  This is one thing we cannot blame anyone else for. This is the one time when the combined Opposition are in a position to tell the Government what to do.  This is the one time when we can say to the Government that this is what we want them to do and this is what they are going to do.  I do not know whether it will come to that but we will find out in due course.  The Minister may be thinking that I am having a go at him but I am not.  In fact I paid him a compliment in his absence for reacting to many of the concerns expressed by those of us in Opposition.  I will have a number of things to say when we come to Committee Stage but for now I will let the hare sit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak to the Social Welfare Bill, 1989.  At the outset I would like to compliment the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, for the exceptional progress which has been made by the Government in protecting and improving the position of those dependent on social welfare payments.  That being said, it should come as no surprise to anyone that the Minister has adopted <Col N="2547" /> a caring approach to the needy.  When he was Minister for Social Welfare in the early eighties he increased old age pensions by 25 per cent in each of the three years 1980, 1981 and 1982.  These very significant increases were a major factor in giving dignity and a reasonable income to the elderly after a lifetime of work.  The increases outlined in this Bill concentrate on the needs of families and those in receipt of the lowest social welfare payments. That is as it should be.</P>
      <P>The Government have made major progress in getting the public finances back on a sound footing.  That was one of the priorities of the Government on taking up office.  During the previous four years we had to listen to a Coalition Government tell us what needed to be done.  Their first priority, according to them, was to reduce annual borrowing and the national debt.  The end result of four years of Coalition mismanagement was quite the opposite.  During that period annual borrowing increased to £2,145 million while the national debt doubled from £12.7 billion to £25 billion by March 1987.  This occurred under a Coalition Government who preached the need for fiscal rectitude.  At the same time they acted with reckless disregard for the needs of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It took this strong Fianna Fáil Government to stop and reverse this trend.  The budget for 1989 projects annual borrowing at £1,057 million, which is only half the rate we inherited from the Coalition just two years ago.  The Government recognised that decisive action was needed and they took the necessary steps to restore order to the public finances.  It is to their credit that they have achieved this turnabout while paying special attention to the needs of those dependent on social welfare payments.  To appreciate the extent of the Government's achievement it must be remembered that the Government have increased social welfare payments with special substantial increases for those in receipt of the lowest payments and have made a range of improvements in the social welfare system.  The annual cost of improvements <Col N="2548" /> in the 1988 and 1989 budgets totalled £255 million.  This is a real transfer of resources to those in receipt of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>The various pressure groups fail to appreciate that substantial progress has been made by the Government in helping those on low incomes.  I compliment Deputy Harney for recognising the progress that has been made during the past two years and complimenting the Minister, Deputy Woods, for this.  I was disappointed that the main Opposition spokesperson did not do likewise and recognise that progress has been made, rather than adopting a negative attitude. It was very easy for Deputy Bell to argue that we should not talk in terms of percentages but, having done practically nothing when in Government for four years, the Opposition find it very easy not to recognise that progress has been made.</P>
    <P>There was much discussion on television and many articles in the newspapers on poverty in our society before the presentation of this year's budget.  It was almost as if the media had suddenly discovered poverty.  As the public finances were in order a controversial subject for debate with politicians was removed from the list of current topics and poverty was added.  I accept that there is poverty. I represent an area where there is high unemployment and I keep in regular touch with people who are facing real difficulties in making ends meet.  I live in Cork and represent a constituency which is one of the worst affected areas when it comes to unemployment.  I am not sure whether an attempt to sensationalise poverty would do any good for the majority of those in need.  What we need is a practical, committed and caring approach on the part of the Government and society.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has shown his qualities and has taken practical steps to improve the position of those in receipt of social welfare payments. Lest anyone forget, he was taking action before the present outcry in the media began.  Provision was made in last year's <Col N="2549" /> budget for an 11 per cent increase in the level of unemployment assistance.  This was the lowest social welfare payment and it was recognised that the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed, were the group at greatest risk. That increase marked a significant first step in improving their position.  The Minister proposes to further increase the unemployment assistance payment by 12 per cent this year.  This represents a total increase of about 25 per cent over two years.  In cash terms it means an increase of £8.20 per week for a family with three children bringing their total payment to £107 per week, and this does not include child benefit or other benefits.  We all recognise this is not enough.  We must continue to work on their behalf, but these exceptional increases of 11 to 12 per cent are being granted when inflation is running at just over 2 per cent and workers are getting increases of around 3 per cent.  This decision to concentrate the resources of the State for the benefit of the long-term unemployed was agreed with the social partners and incorporated in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> This programme was agreed and was being implemented before the poverty lobby really took off.  I am not suggesting they have not a role to play, and we must get the balance right.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has decided to end the urban renewal anomaly whereby persons outside urban renewal areas are legally defined and paid a lower rate of unemployment assistance than persons in urban areas.  This was a long-standing anomaly.  It may have served some use when it was introduced in 1934 but is totally outmoded now.  People in certain areas were on different rates depending on what side of the street they lived.  That makes no sense.  The cost of living is no different just because one happens to live on one side of the street and is not in the legally defined urban area.  This anomaly has existed for too long and it has been impossible to explain to people why they should receive less money because they are not in a legally defined urban area.  I am glad the Minister has decided to raise the lower rural rate of <Col N="2550" /> unemployment assistance to the level of the higher urban rate.  This will mean an increase of £1.30 per week for people on the long term rate of unemployment assistance.  This increase is on top of the £5 per week in the personal rate of assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When introducing their recently published document, <i>An Economic Accord for 1992</i>, Fine Gael announced their intention to publish this Bill.  It is a comprehensive Bill, attempting to cover all aspects of preparation for 1992.  Fine Gael believe it is only by a comprehensive, integrated approach that the country will reap full benefits from the Single European Market.</P>
      <P>The process of preparation for 1992 is the last opportunity Ireland has this century to lift itself from the relative economic decline from which it has suffered for over 100 years, almost since the Famine.  In the Single European Market every inefficiency in our economy will be exposed, any costs that are out of line will lead to job losses, any sluggishness in our response to market opportunities will be fatal; others will get in before us. That is why every aspect of the economy must be modernised in preparation for 1992.  A comprehensive Bill of this kind is the quickest way to remove a whole series of legal roadblocks to our development. If each of the legal changes proposed in this Bill, ranging from education right through to roads policy, is left aside to be dealt with in individual Bills emanating from individual Departments, valuable time will be lost.  Some of the measures may not be implemented for years because they are low in the priorities of individual Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2551" /> I do not expect that the Government will agree with every detail of the individual provisions in this Bill.  They may even want provisions to be removed entirely.  That can be dealt with on Committee Stage.  The issue to be decided now on Second Stage is a different one. It is the question of whether we should seek to have a comprehensive Bill to deal with 1992.  Do the Government agree that 1992 issues should be put at the top of our legislative agenda and dealt with right away?  This Bill would enable the House to do that, to put 1992 and everything germaine to preparing for it at the top of our agenda and deal with it comprehensively and quickly.  If politicians can be seen to work together to prepare for 1992, as would be seen to be the case if this Bill is accepted, this example will encourage others.  If, on the other hand, politicians are seen not to wish to co-operate in a matter of this kind, some of the ritual sermonising to the rest of the economy about preparation and co-operation for 1992 will seem much less credible.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to some of the detailed provisions in the Bill.  Section 12 sets formal targets for national industrial performance as a result of the measures proposed. We must set our sights high and aim at something worthwhile.  These targets will be established by law, and are to achieve by the years 2000, (a), an increase in the labour force at work by 100,000, that is up to 320,000 in industry and related services and, (b), a doubling of Ireland's share of the world market for industrial products by reference to our share in 1987.  These targets are not drawn from the air; they are based on the OECD study on innovation policy in Ireland published in 1987.  The Bill also provides in section 12 for the establishment in all seven regions of the country of regional development authorities similar to SFADCo, who already operate successfully in the mid west.  All agree that SFADCo have worked well. Why then should other regions be denied the same opportunity that SFADCo afforded to the mid west?  Local talent <Col N="2552" /> can best be harnessed if there is local decision making.  The flair and imagination of our people will not be harnessed by schemes and plans that are simply handed down from Dublin.  There must be genuine local responsibility.  That is the way to get results and that is why in this Bill we propose regional development authorities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides in section 7 for regular reporting by the Government to a joint committee of the Dáil and Seanad on the progress of preparation for 1992. This committee could provide the basis for a national forum for 1992 as proposed in the Fine Gael document <i>An Economic Accord for 1992</i>.  Such a national forum of 1992 would bring together politicians of the main parties along with the social partners.  One of the positive achievements of this Government has been the constructive involvement of the social partners in decision making.  If it has been successful in the limited area to which it has already been applied, why not, as was done in the New Ireland Forum in regard to Northern Ireland, extend this consensus approach to involve political parties as well in regard to the economy? Surely 1992 is a topic important enough to warrant such a radical departure.  Such a forum on 1992 would provide a means whereby the valuable work of bodies like the NESC could have a direct input to the political system.  The NESC have produced numerous reports on a variety of topics in respect of which there is no direct access to the political system and which, as a result, have little impact. The involvement of all the major political parties in a forum on preparation for 1992 would also tend to obviate the danger of a recurrence of manifesto politics of the 1977 variety.  Regardless of whether one has read that manifesto document, one must agree that manifesto politics of that type did nothing but harm to this country. With a forum approach in which fundamental economic policies were being looked at together by politicians of all major parties, the scope, the temptation and the credibility of manifesto politics will be greatly diminished.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides in section 8 for the <Col N="2553" /> statutory establishment of an independent national roads development authority.  Such an authority have already been set up by the Government but on a non-statutory basis.  Section 8 would enable the Minister to give them a statutory basis.  Only if they have a statutory basis will they have real authority, as is intended, to make decisions.</P>
    <P>It is essential that there be effective, co-ordinated, long-term planning for road development.  This cannot be left to a multiplicity of local authorities pursuing individual plans.  One can drive at present on a wide spacious road but suddenly the road narrows, the surface worsens and one realises that one has crossed into a different county council area.  That is no way to plan and a national roads authority would ensure that this type of phenomenon would become a thing of the past. Delays on our roads can cost dearly in competition for orders in the European market.  Just in time delivery to minimise the holding of stocks in industry is a key element in industrial success.  If goods are supposed to be at the harbour in Antwerp at 5 a.m. it is not a sufficient excuse to say that they were stuck in a traffic jam at Lucan.  That is why we need a road development authority.</P>
    <P>Section 8 also requires the Minister for the Environment to present to the Dáil before 30 June a report on improvements to country roads and the reclassification of roads.  The recent cuts in the rate support grants by the Minister for the Environment make such a report on the situation of county roads a matter of urgency.  Reclassification of some of these roads would relieve some of the pressure on them.  Many of them are carrying traffic volumes which are inappropriate to their status as county roads.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of this Bill makes statutory provision for the first time for the promotion of the teaching of continental languages in our schools.  It provides that EC funds should be sought for the retraining of teachers in additional continental languages for this purpose.  A certificate in continental languages for adults as well as for school children is also proposed.  International teacher and <Col N="2554" /> pupil exchanges are to be promoted under the terms of the Bill.  Only in this way will Irish people begin, through learning both the language and lifestyle of continental Europeans, to think as Europeans.  If we continue to see ourselves, despite all the hype about 1992, as really part of the Australian-American culture, we will not get the best out of Europe.</P>
    <P>At present the vocational education committees and regional technical colleges are precluded by law from co-operating effectively with industry.  Section 1 (2) of the Bill will give them for the first time the statutory authority to co-operate with industry.  This will allow for the placement of students and graduates in firms with a view to promoting employment and technological competence in Irish industry.  It will enable regional technical colleges to do research for industry.  Linking industry and education is a key area.  Most people would agree that innovation is the key to success.  The OECD in their study on innovation policy in Ireland identified above all else better links between industry and education as the key to success.  This Bill provides for the first time the statutory basis on which this can be done, both in regard to vocational and regional colleges in section 1 and in regard to higher education in a later section.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the introduction of effective competition policy in our economy, thereby reducing business costs.  This is necessary if we are to increase our share of the international market.  It is to be done under this Bill by incorporating EC competition legislation, Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome, in domestic law through section 14 of this Bill.  These Articles of the Treaty of Rome would then become directly enforceable in the Irish courts as regards domestic as well as international business transactions.  Predatory pricing, market sharing and all other abuses of a dominant position in the market would then become crimes in Irish law.  That is the only way to stamp them out.  It is much more effective than our present cumbersome procedure whereby there <Col N="2555" /> has first to be a complaint, then an inquiry, a report, a recommendation to the Government, the drafting of an order which has to be approved by the Dáil and finally action.  That process can take two or three years.  This Bill would make such activities illegal from the date of enactment and legal proceedings could be instituted without any of that wasteful process.</P>
    <P>I recognise that a study is being done by the Fair Trade Commission into the feasibility of bringing Articles 85 and 86 into domestic law.  I recognise that the Minister for Industry and Commerce may wish to have this report before bringing section 14 of this Bill into effect, if the Bill is passed.  There is, therefore, provision in section 14 to give the Minister the power to deal with various administrative matters by regulation and also the power to delay the implementation of this section until he has the report and is satisfied that everything is ready for its introduction.  I hope this overcomes some, if not all, of the objections the Minister advanced to an earlier proposal along the lines of section 14 promoted by Deputy Cullen and the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>Section 12 also requires regular reporting by the Government on the actual reduction of Irish costs for energy, electricity, road transport, postal services, telecommunications and air and sea transport to a level at or below that obtaining in other member states.  It is important that there should be a legal requirement on the Government to report regularly to this House on the progress they are making in bringing down our costs.  Only then will the Government have consistent pressure on them and be able in turn to put consistent pressure on the relevant agencies to bring down our costs to European levels.  There is a great discipline for the public service in the requirement to present a regular report to this House on progress in a particular area.  That provision in section 12 will be of great assistance in ensuring the consistent application of policy to reduce to European levels and below Irish energy, <Col N="2556" /> electricity, road transport and other relevant costs.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill amends the Higher Education Act to give the HEA a specific mandate to promote links between institutions of higher education and industry. This will be achieved, for example, by joint ventures and research.  At the moment the Higher Education Authority have no particular mandate to concern themselves with whether individual colleges are making an effort to establish links with industry or are making no effort.  If colleges do make this effort, they may perhaps do it to get money to maintain programmes they want to continue.  That is not the best motive.  We believe that there should be a consistent policy applied by the Higher Education Authority in favour of getting closer links between higher education and industry for the reasons I have already quoted in regard to the OECD report.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority are also being required under section 6 to make provision for second chance or part-time education for those who have already spent time at work.  Second chance education is vital as a means of providing a route back to work for those who have become unemployed.  By putting emphasis on second chance education, we can also help to reduce emigration.  Voluntary emigration is highest amongst those who have been in full-time education up to graduation from university, without ever having worked in Ireland.  Young people who go from school to university, who have helped to finance their university education by summer jobs in America or Britain, never work in Ireland.  Immediately on reaching graduation those young people see jobs in Britain or America as their natural destiny.  If more of those people, in order to qualify for the maximum grants for university, or in order to have enough money to help finance their education, were encouraged to work for some time in Ireland before going to university I believe they would have a greater tendency to look to the Irish job market as a possible place of employment rather than, as many seem to do, going <Col N="2557" /> straight from the country to admittedly better paid jobs overseas.  The brain drain is one of our biggest problems.  It has been probably the biggest single problem inhibiting the development of the country since the famine.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Finns, the Austrians and others who have suffered much more trauma than us, their talented people have to stay at home.  They do not have the option of emigration because of the linguistic barrier and they are prepared to work, perhaps for less than they could get in America or Australia, in their own country.  They may not have a choice because they do not speak sufficiently good English to take up a job in America, but the fact that they are forced to work at home means they invest their talent in their own economy.  We have, on the other hand, a process whereby the best are being creamed off by recruiting agencies from overseas.  People who should be the natural leaders in this community will become the natural leaders and wealth creators in other countries and that has been happening since the famine.  We have had a process of negative selection in so far as our population is concerned over that period.</P>
    <P>If we are to get into the European fast lane rather than the slow lane between now and 1992, we must do something about that.  Putting more emphasis on second chance education, putting more emphasis on going to work for a while before completing higher education &mdash; preferably working here rather than elsewhere, but at least giving an incentive to people to work before going to university &mdash; is one way of fixing more of our people here and encouraging them to put their talents back into our economy.  The composition of the Higher Education Authority is also being altered under the Bill in order to give greater emphasis to broad national concerns in the planning of higher education. More non-academic members are being introduced to enable the HEA to better perform a genuinely independent analytical role.  Academics totally dominate the Authority at the moment. This is unhealthy.  In future, under the <Col N="2558" /> Bill, a minimum of ten members of the Authority should be non-academic, of whom seven shall have had practical commercial experience.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority are also being required under the Bill to emphasise university disciplines which have good employment prospects in Ireland, and to eliminate unnecessary duplication of facilities.  There is a high degree of wasteful duplication of facilities at the moment.  This is money we cannot afford when so many of our young people are still leaving school without any basic qualification.  As a result of this Bill, Irish higher education will be given a new statutory mandate to prepare for the next century.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believe it is essential that banks give greater support to economic development.  Section 2 amends the Central Bank Act to this effect.  The Central Bank are being asked to co-operate more closely with industrial development agencies.  The asset fixation of our banking system and our bankers must change.  Human resources, not physical assets, are what produce wealth.  Human resources should be the best possible security for our bankers.  They are not at the moment but I hope we can in a small way through legislation like this change those fundamental attitudes in our banking system.</P>
    <P>Delays in obtaining planning permission from local authorities can inhibit commercial and industrial development. We propose in sections 3, 4 and 5 to reduce the time limits for decisions on planning applications.  Similar provisions are being made in regard to by-law approval in urban areas.  Section 4 also requires that, in the case of all planning applications, a notice shall always be erected on the site.</P>
    <P>Ireland ties up a disproportionate amount of its national savings in houses. We are a relatively overhoused population in terms of our actual needs.  Ordinary people do not tend to save at all in the form of wealth generating assets.  The general public must be encouraged to put their savings into productive business which generates new wealth rather than <Col N="2559" /> the generation of consumer goods like houses.  We cannot afford to have a disproportionate amount of our savings tied up in fixed assets where the employment spin-off on a continuing basis is small or nil.</P>
    <P>Section 9, therefore, makes a radical new proposal to encourage greater investment in Irish industry by ordinary individuals.  Taxpayers will be allowed under this section to use any unused portion of their normal mortgage interest tax relief as tax relief on interest paid on borrowings for investment in firms established under the business expansion scheme.  Taxpayers with no, small or declining mortgages, will thus be given a major incentive to invest in job creation. This is much more productive than the present system which encourages people who have no, small or declining mortgages to invest only in trading up to a larger house in order to ensure that they get the maximum tax relief.  By providing an option to take that tax relief in the form of interest on investment in something that will generate a flow of wealth rather than being a consumer good itself, like a house, we will remove the bias in favour of fixed asset investment in housing. We will then move more of our private savings into the productive sector.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the Government, whoever is in power, cannot create jobs on their own.  It is only if private individuals are prepared to use their savings as well to create jobs, and get a profit for so doing, they they will lift our economy.  A tax incentive of this kind, which would encourage ordinary people to use mortgage interest relief as a means of investing in shares, will help us to achieve our full potential in that area.</P>
    <P>The Government are asked under the Bill to investigate the possibility of selling shares in State companies to provide funds for the expansion of employment and activity by those companies.  There is a provision in section 12 that the Government must present a report on <Col N="2560" /> the possible sale of shares in State companies to the House on or before 30 September 1989.  I stress that the purpose of the sale of such shares would be to finance expansion by the companies concerned into other areas.  The section also requires that the report be objective and cover the disadvantages as well as the advantages of the possible sale of shares.  I trust that nobody could object to such an inquiry being conducted.  Certainly it is a subject upon which a great deal of heat has been expended and, perhaps, the proposal in the Bill will shed a little light on to it and lead to constructive action on an agreed basis.  It might perhaps find a way in which the Government could get over some of the objectives they are facing from some members of the central review committee in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>The creation of a single European market provides major opportunities for Irish agriculture.  Irish agriculture still suffers from severe structural problems. Much of the land of Ireland is under-utilised. This is because the occupiers of the land are too old in some cases to utilise it fully but, for understandable reasons, do not wish to surrender ownership of the land.  Long-term leasing provides a solution to this dilemma.  It allows the ownership of the land to be retained by the original occupier while a younger or more highly motivated person has the opportunity to actually use the land and use it more intensively for a period on a secure basis.</P>
    <P>Section 10 proposes to more than double the existing tax relief available to those who let their land under long-term leases contracted before the end of 1992. The provision of a cut-off date, the end of 1990, for this extra tax relief and the revision after that date to the present level of relief in designed to ensure that such leases are contracted speedily.  This will give a major boost to long-term leasing and will provide a target towards which agricultural advisers, solicitors and others can work in ensuring that these leases are drawn up.  It will be, if accepted, a major agricultural reform.</P>
    <P>The 1986 Finance Act introduced a tax incentive for investment in research and <Col N="2561" /> development by Irish companies.  Complex restrictions were however included in it by the then Minister for Finance. These have meant that these improved incentives have remained unused, despite the good intentions of the promoter and his advisers.  Time is always available to people to repent their errors; therefore section 11 of this Bill proposes to remove these unnecessary restrictions.  This is very necessary.  Research and development are vital in preparation for 1992. State funds are not available to finance sufficient research and development, at least on the scale that we need it here. This section if approved will provide the means to get more private Irish money into research and development in Irish companies.  Some of the money that is now going out, through the Irish Stock Exchange, to oil companies that are engaging in speculative developments in the South China Sea or off the Northern Coast of South America will be attracted back into similarly speculative research and development in Irish companies by the offer of a better tax deal for investment into research and development than is available for investment in offshore oil in those exotic locations.  It is a pity that our Stock Exchange is most exciting and excited in dealing with the development potential of the continental shelf in such remote parts of the world.  I would like, through this tax incentive, to create conditions in which our Stock Exchange might perhaps become excited about research and development leading to major products being produced by Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The mandate of the Industrial Development Authority is also being radically altered in this Bill.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is being required in section 12 to report to the Dáil on the progressive reduction in the share of IDA aid being given to fixed assets and the commensurate increase in the share of the systems to marketing, research and development and the acquisition of product and process technology.  This is already policy but it is simply being included in a statutory form to ensure that it is implemented in full.  In one of <Col N="2562" /> the recent years there has been a lapse away from this trend and this would be exposed under this section.</P>
    <P>The IDA is also being required by law in this Bill to work towards a replacement by private equity investment of State grants as the main source of extra finance for industrial expansion.  The IDA will be specifically required to encourage small companies to take in outside equity and strengthen their boards of directors with outside expertise.  This is vital.  Too many companies fail because they do not take in outside capital and equity or if they do they take it in too late in the form of a director from Fóir Teoranta and funds from that source which was available until it was prematurely and unwisely stopped by the present Minister.  There is a need to give the IDA a clear statutory direction to reduce the level of grants and increase the level of private equity right across industry, and that would be a very healthy development.</P>
    <P>If a programme of modernisation of our economy is to work we must develop the Irish venture capital industry.  At the moment this is unduly concentrated in Dublin.  It has a heavy banking bias; many of the people involved are former bankers. It is cautious and, like all bankers, in Ireland at least, it is asset-oriented in its investment policy.</P>
    <P>Section 13 proposes that the National Development Corporation be required to establish regional investment funds. Regional investment funds of this kind will bring venture capital closer to practical reality throughout Ireland and out of the office suites of Dublin 4 and Dublin 2.</P>

      <P>I will not use it all, Sir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preparation for 1992 requires a central thrust at Government level.  Delays in individual Departments must be eliminated. The best way to do this is through a comprehensive economic development Bill like this amending a range of statutes. In this way much faster progress can be <Col N="2563" /> made than if we were to wait for individual measures to be produced.  I invite the Government to use this Bill as a vehicle to get some of their own proposals, if they have them, out of the queue that they may at present be lying in in various Departments, and into law under the umbrella of preparation for 1992.  A comprehensive Bill of this kind has not been introduced before.  Such an approach would have its critics but if we were to stick only to things that have been done before we would certainly fail to meet the challenge of 1992.  The traditional way of doing things in this House and in this country has left us, after 60 years of independence, with one of the lowest incomes per head and certainly the highest rate of emigration in Europe. So, old ways of doing things are not necessarily best.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that now that the publicity campaign is over the debate about 1992 is lapsing into arguments about how and by whom the begging bowl can best be presented in Brussels.  The truth is that EC aid is a minor matter by comparison with what we can do ourselves here in this country and in this House to prepare ourselves for 1992.  That is what this Bill is about.  It is not about a better way to get other people's money.  It is about a better way to organise our own affairs so that we will, through our own initiative, be better able to prepare our economy for 1992.  It is a huge challenge that this House should be seen to respond to in a comprehensive way.  I hope that will be the way the Government will look at it and that they will use this Bill, and amend it if necessary, as a means of preparing our entire administrative machine for 1992.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's interest in the Single European market and share his concern to ensure that we prepare adequately for this development.  The Government have long since made full arrangements to this end.  A committee of Ministers and secretaries under the chairmanship of the Taoiseach has been <Col N="2564" /> established to deal with all matters relating to the completion of the internal market.  We have also launched the national European campaign to make the community and especially the business sector more aware of events and to generate a greater sense of urgency about the changes that are inevitable.  As part of the campaign booklets and leaflets of interest to both the general public and those with specialised interest in specific topics and policies have been published.</P>
      <P>That was stage one in the awareness campaign on behalf of the Government. Indeed, I can assure the Deputies and the House that further measures to increase awareness of the issues involved are being planned.  The European campaign was indeed an unqualified success and the business sector and any surveys done have shown that.  Quite clearly it brought the whole topic into the forefront of the debate and brought the message home to every individual company here that they had a job to do.  The Government had a job to do and it was up to the business and industrial sectors to get their own house in order.  We created a partnership awareness between the two and spelled out who the person of 1992 was in each Government Department and each State agency to ensure that there is no need for people to be without information.</P>
      <P>Many individuals and economic interest groups are responding very positively to this campaign.  I acknowledge, however, that the response of others is not always as good as we would hope but that has been a common experience across Europe in relation to such campaigns. It is the resolve of Government to sustain a strong awareness, to keep the pressure on for changes where they are deemed to be necessary and to do whatever is required to facilitiate these changes.  There is still a widespread perception that, somehow, integration is down the road, whereas the reality is that it is already happening.  It is imperative, therefore, that we maintain a sense of urgency about the preparations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This integration of the European market is a historic development that opens up new opportunities and great <Col N="2565" /> challenges for us.  We will have direct and full access to a market of 320 million people.  As a small open economy, we have to trade abroad to survive and to grow and we have to be able to withstand the winds of competition.  We export more than two-thirds of our national output and three quarters of these exports go to the other member states of the Community.  It follows, therefore, that any dismantling of barriers to trade within the Community should be to our advantage, provided we are ready to exploit such a development.</P>
    <P>But the internal market is not simply about free trade.  It will embrace every facet of economic activity and entail the freedom of goods, services, labour and capital to circulate without hindrance throughout the Community.  For instance, it provides for mutual recognition of professional qualifications and, with our high standards of education and training, we should benefit from this. Similarly, it will open up tendering for public contracts, a development which should be to our advantage.  Public contracts worth perhaps up to £300 billion a year will be open to Irish business.  This aspect of the single market alone represents 15 per cent of GDP throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>One of the more significant features of the opening up of the internal market will be the elimination of restrictions on capital movements.  This means, in short, that all residents of the Community will be free to raise or invest funds in any member state or Community currency. We are committed to removing all controls by the end of 1992 but we have already taken a big step forward.  Since 1 January there are no longer any restrictions on investment by Irish residents in medium and long-term foreign securities. There is no evidence so far that this relaxation has had any adverse effect for us. It is a lesson for the business community, however, that capital can be much more volatile than before and that it will tend to find a home elsewhere if we do not provide an attractive environment for investment here.</P>
    <P>There is continuing debate about the <Col N="2566" /> likely overall impact of the integrated market on the Community.  The Cecchini studies, sponsored by the European Commission, estimated the benefit of removing the trade barriers at between 4.25 per cent and 6.50 per cent of the Community's gross national product. This is big by any standards.  I know that the findings of these studies have been challenged and there is a minority view that integration will not be of any benefit. Whatever the merits of different arguments, there is abundant evidence that the Community as a whole will stand to benefit substantially.  The Cecchini studies also estimated that the completion of the single market could lead to an increase of five million jobs in the Communtiy and we must ensure that we get our share of this increase.</P>
    <P>There is a clear acknowledgment that, in a unified market, the central and more prosperous areas of the Community are likely to benefit to a greater extent than other areas.  There is a natural tendency for activity in any single marketplace to gravitate towards the centre.  To compensate for this unevenness in growth potential, there has been a commitment from the beginning to a greater effort to counter regional imbalances.  The objectives of economic and social cohesion are written into the Single European Act. Moreover, we have secured agreement from the Commission to establish a task force within the Commission to interact with our committee of Ministers and secretaries. This will put our relationships with the Community on a new footing and ensure speedy and effective co-ordination of national and Community policies.</P>
    <P>The developments in relation to the Structural Funds to remedy the structural deficiencies in the market are of crucial importance to us.  The European Council have agreed that the funds for the least developed regions, among which all of Ireland is included, will be doubled by 1992.  In addition, there will be an increase in the rates of contribution from the funds to a maximum of 75 per cent.  It is the Government's intention that these additional resources will be used to <Col N="2567" /> strengthen our ability to compete successfully in the completed internal market, to reduce unemployment and to raise <i>per capita</i> incomes towards average Community levels.</P>
    <P>Our regional development plan, which is the basis for applications for assistance from the Structural Funds, is now nearing completion and it will be submitted to the European Commission before the deadline of 31 March.  As the Taoiseach has already indicated, arrangements will be made to debate the plan in this House.</P>
    <P>We have had consultations with the Commission as well as extensive local consultations in drawing up this plan.  The agreed objectives of the plan are: to prepare the economy to compete successfully in the internal market when completed in 1992; to stimulate the economic growth needed to reduce unemployment and to raise <i>per capita</i> incomes towards average Community levels; to improve further the state of the public finances and to complement economic growth with a greater social dimension in our society.</P>
    <P>In seeking to achieve these objectives, two types of programmes will be implemented.  The first type will be directed at improving our competitiveness by reducing the costs imposed by our peripheral location and inadequate infrastructure.  This will involve, for example, improving our road and transportation network and providing adequate port and airport facilities.</P>
    <P>The second type of programme will be directed at developing the productive capacity of the economy.  This will be done, for example, through assisting industrial development, including expanding the marketing and technological capacity of industry, the development of tourism, forestry, agriculture, rural development and the development of human skills through training and work experience schemes.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that what he mentioned in relation to his good intentions as expressed in the Finance Bill, 1986, will certainly be looked at very <Col N="2568" /> closely before I introduce this year's Finance Bill.  If the incentives provided in that Bill for research and development have not been used, quite clearly there is something seriously wrong because Ireland normally responds to incentive.  I am a strong believer in incentive.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the details of the Bill tabled by Deputy Bruton.  As I said earlier, I appreciate and share his concern about the impact of the single market and the need to prepare adequately for it.  I am not at all clear however as to what order of priorities he is attempting to follow in this Bill.  He has chosen a miscellaneous list of development issues ranging from the leasing of agricultural land to planning procedures and restrictive practices. From listening to this introduction I can say quite honestly that he has posed many questions but that some of the answers are missing.  For example, when talking about having a SFADCo type operation in every region of the country, has he asked himself if that means the dismantling of the IDA or is that what he is proposing?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question that has to be addressed.  There is no point in saying something and not going into the repercussions of it.  Is the Deputy looking back towards what Buchanan once devised for this country which, I suppose, one could in simple terms describe as a new authority at every crossroads?  I do not think this country could sustain something like that and it would not be in its best interests.  We are a small economy of 3.2 million people and we do not want to choke ourselves with more and more bureaucracy.  I think the Deputy is a little like myself in that he believes that those who govern best govern least.  The less bureaucracy we have the better. However, there will be plenty of opportunity over the next two weeks for us to elicit answers to some of the questions the Deputy has posed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum states that the Bill is designed as an integrated <Col N="2569" /> set of legislative measures to prepare the economy for the Single European Act.  I must admit that I cannot see an integrated structure and I do not mean any disrespect to the Deputy's intentions when I describe the Bill as a hotchpotch of individual proposals, or could I say Johnny's Jolly mixture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it makes the Minister happy.  If it does, that is fine. The Minister's budget is also a mixture of measures.  There is nothing wrong with mixing a variety of measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not if you have the right mix and in the right order.  If there are other ways of bringing in measures, I do not think the Deputy would deny us the opportunity of doing so in the way we think best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In due course I hope to deny the Minister that opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is serious about that, then the type of debate engaged in by political parties throughout the length and breadth of the country over the past few weeks would not have endeared them to the public nor enticed them to give them a chance to come back and perform the task expected of them.</P>
      <P>I do not intend going through the Bill line by line.  As the House will appreciate, my other ministerial colleagues will be responding to the aspects affecting their Departments.  However, I shall make a few observations to put the various aspects in proper context.  My colleague, the Minister for Education, will speak later in the debate on the education provisions of this Bill.  She will be making a statement of the Government's intentions for adaptations to the education system to prepare us for 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I merely wish to make three points at this stage.  First, the emphasis in the Bill on school/industry links and on continental language teaching is welcome. However, I do not consider that the present Bill is the best, or indeed an adequate, framework in which to promote these two objectives.  Second, the <Col N="2570" /> Minister for Education is at present finalising new legislation in relation to the affairs of VECs and RTCs generally.  To the extent that legislative action of the type that this Bill proposes may be necessary, the appropriate place to take such legislative powers is in the forthcoming legislation.  Third, it is the Government's intention to address the issues referred to by the Deputy in relation to the Higher Education Authority Act as part of an overall review of the third level sector. For this reason, we set up an interdepartmental committee last year to consider the development of third level education.  That committee will be reporting shortly.  It would be premature to consider changes in legislation until that report is available.  However, I would be in agreement with Deputy John Bruton when he spoke about the makeup of the Higher Education Authority, contending that there is room for people in the business and economic world to get the right mix in promoting the best emanating from third level education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>At present there is not one single businessman on the Higher Education Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>So I believe.  However, the Deputy has a supporter and I will be pushing in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 6 of the Central Bank Act, 1942, the general function and duty of the Central Bank is to protect the integrity of the currency and, in relation to the control of credit, to secure the welfare of the people as a whole.  I do not see that the provision which the Deputy wishes to include will add anything to the content of the existing requirements.  On the contrary, it would be unwise to isolate one objective in particular as this might mean that it should be pursued in priority to, or to the exclusion of, all others.  The aims of monetary policy in general, such as stable interest rates, exchange rates and prices, contribute to the realisation of economic development and job creation.  We have seen a practical demonstration in the last two years of how <Col N="2571" /> sound financial policies can promote economic welfare.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to empower the Central Bank to undertake studies and consultations in regard to the co-operation of banks with the State industrial development authorities.  I am not sure if the wording of the proposed addition to section 8 of the 1942 Act would achieve what seems to be the intention.  I am not convinced that we need to proceed in this manner.  The bank is the monetary authority, not an industrial development body, although the bank plays its part in co-operating with the industrial development agencies.  The involvement of the Bank in the certification of firms wishing to set up in the International Financial Services Centre is an example of this cooperation. For my part, I believe that direct requests and invitations by the Government to the banks can achieve results, as was demonstrated recently by the response of the banks to my initiative in relation to bank loans for young entrepreneurs.</P>
    <P>This type of initiative should have been taken long ago because one of the greatest drawbacks to young people trying to establish businesses has been the security or collateral requirement.  Heretofore lending by the banks has tended to be wholly security-orientated.  I want to pay tribute to the banks for having responded to this initiative.  It is most important that young people have not to provide security, that their firms have not to put their names on the line in that respect but rather that they have access to non-recourse lending which is what this is all about.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 to 5 of the Bill propose amendments to the planning laws and section 8 proposes to amend existing legislation to provide for the establishment of the national roads authority by regulation.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, will be dealing with these matters in some detail later in this debate so I will only refer to them briefly.</P>
    <P>In relation to planning legislation, I am sure the House will agree that this whole area is one which should be discussed in <Col N="2572" /> another context.  The link with the single European market is somewhat tenuous. Whatever about the merits of the case for speeding up the planning process &mdash; and there is merit in its discussion &mdash; this should be approached carefully as this is a very sensitive area which requires full and proper consideration in its own right and should not be dealt with as a minor item in an omnibus Bill such as the one before us today.</P>
    <P>The Government have already announced that legislation will be introduced in relation to the national roads authority.  This is already in course of preparation.  This legislation will be extremely important and it will have to be fully debated by the Oireachtas on its own merits.  The legislation will have to ensure that the national roads authority, local authorities and the Government will work together as a partnership which will plan and implement the roads capital programme in a way which will maximise the benefit to road users, taxpayers and the economy generally.  The Deputy is seeking statutory backing for the national roads authority in his Bill.  I should say that that provision is in preparation by the Government.</P>
    <P>I note that the provisions of the Bill incorporate a number of tax incentive schemes or, rather, the extention of existing schemes.  There is a proposal for tax relief on interest paid by an individual on a loan raised to buy shares in a business expansion scheme company.  The ceiling on tax relief that may be granted to farmers who let their land under a long-term lease would be increased.  There is also a proposal to modify certain restrictions on tax relief for investment in research and development.  First, the appropriate vehicle for tax changes is the Finance Bill when there will be a full and lengthy debate on taxation policies.  As to the specific proposals before us here, I could not accept that they would make a useful contribution to our preparations for 1992.  The schemes in question are already very generous and the tax concessions are substantial.</P>
    <P>Let me sound a note of caution as to the multiplicity of tax incentive schemes. <Col N="2573" /> All sides of this House are advocating tax reform and, while we may have different opinions about the specific conditions for reform, there seems to be general acceptance that widening the tax base is an essential requirement.  Reliefs and incentives have the opposite effect: they fragment even more a tax base which is already very fragmented by the large number of existing reliefs and incentives. Clear benefits, especially in terms of additional jobs, must be seen before still further incentives, or improvements of existing ones, can be considered.  I cannot accept that the proposals now before us meet this criterion.  We have a duty to the general taxpayer to ensure that incentives are not excessive and that they pay their way in terms of increased economic activity.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of provisions which require that progress reports be made to the Oireachtas.  For instance, section 7 requires the Government to report every three months to each House of the Oireachtas and to a joint committee thereof on preparations for the creation of the single European market.  Section 12 also imposes reporting requirements in relation to industrial development.  I would like to think that the Oireachtas will keep a very close eye on preparations for the single European market.  We already have various arrangements whereby we can debate this issue regularly in this House.  I have no doubt that we will do so but surely there is no necessity to enshrine this as a requirement in legislation.  Again I would make the point that statutory provisions could have a decidedly negative effect by removing flexibility.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, will be replying in detail to sections 12, 13 and 14 of the Bill.  In the meantime, I will make some brief comments on these sections.</P>
    <P>Section 12 proposes, <i>inter alia</i>, that targets be set for industrial performance by the year 2000.  I can see merits of targets in certian situations but I cannot see any value in taking figures, as it were, <Col N="2574" /> out of the air and planting them in legislation. Section 12 of the Bill proposes to amend section 6 of the Industrial Development Act, 1986.  As the Minister in whose name the majority of State shares in commercial companies are held, the suggestion that shares in some State companies might be sold in order to fund investment in others, or that consideration of this option be enshrined in legislation, strikes me as being both simplistic and inappropriate.  The problems of the commercial State sector, where they exist, as well as its future development deserve and require consideration in a far wider context than that implied in this proposal.  Throwing scarce Exchequer funds at such problems, whether the money is raised from taxation, by borrowing or by asset sales, is no panacea.  I can assure the Deputy that we need no legal compulsion to carry out our responsibilities in this area.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I could not accept that the Government should have a prior constraint imposed in the manner in which they might employ receipts which accrue to the Exchequer from any source, including the sale of State shares.  There may be other, more pressing requirements, which could impact to a far greater extent on the economy generally &mdash; for instance reducing the national debt.  I recall that when Deputy Bruton spoke on this subject some years ago he did not rule out this possibility.</P>
    <P>As regards section 13 which proposes to provide for the establishment of regional investment funds by the National Development Corporation, I am inclined to the view that the nature and scale of the National Development Corporation's activities are not such as to require on a statutory basis a regional breakdown of its investment activities.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill attempts to import Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome into Irish legislation without the benefit of a proper study of what that might mean.  These are the Articles which contain provisions to counter the restriction or distortion of competition within the Common Market.  The Fair Trade <Col N="2575" /> Commission have been studying the subject for over a year as the Deputy referred to and they will report this year and an opportunity will be given for debate on that report.  It is only after the report and debate that a well informed decision can be taken on whether Articles 85 and 86 should be the basis for our competition law.</P>
    <P>In summing up, therefore, I must reject the Bill which has been put forward by Deputy Bruton.  Some of the individual items may have some merit and may be appropriate for discussion in a different context, but I see no merit in gathering together a rag-bag of propositions touching on various aspects of the economy on the pretence that this will enhance our preparations for the single European market.  I want to see greater interest in these preparations and I want more dialogue about the impact of this great development at all levels.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of the Government's management of our economic and financial affairs over the past two years, we are now much better placed than before to face the new challange.  There is a growing confidence in the economy and we are already recouping some benefits from this.  The inflation rate is at its lowest level for more than 20 years and we are regaining a strong competitive position. There has been quite a dramatic improvement in our public finances and there is hope again that we can after all succeed. Exchequer borrowing will be down to a projected figure of 5.3 per cent of gross national product this year compared with an outturn of 13 per cent in 1986.  This goes beyond the most optimistic expectations of two years ago.  We have a surplus position in the balance of payment, there has been a big fall in interest rates in the past two years and there are big inflows of investment from abroad.  These are the real fundamentals; these are the conditions that we need to sustain to take the best advantage of the new opportunities that the single market will provide.</P>
    <P>Our greatest priority is employment. The prospects for employment can only <Col N="2576" /> improve when we have the right economic conditions, as the Deputy has said on so many occasions in the past Already there are encouraging signs in relation to employment and I am very confident that, as we continue this good management of the economy, there will be a steady improvement in the employment situation which, regretfully, is always the last link in the chain of economic recovery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset may I say, as the Minister has pointed out, that the Bill ranges over a large number of Departments.  Because it tries to cover such a huge range, it probably lacks the detail necessary to give real effect to many of its aspirations.  For example, the Bill seeks to amend the Vocational Education Act and it desires that at least two continental languages be taught at primary level.  The Bill also requires that the National Roads Authority be established on a statutory basis.  I am not saying that these two items of themselves are not of great importance but it is difficult to relate them to each other under one Bill.  It blurs the focus of what the Bill is trying to do.</P>
      <P>I take Deputy Bruton's point on board that just because it has not been done in the past we should not do it now. I think legislation should be focused on a specific area.  However this Bill does not focus on a specific area and the range of issues covered is too broad.  I have often complained in the past about legislation introduced by various Departments which greatly impinges on other areas but which in its drafting and import does not seem to bear a relationship to things occurring simultaneously in other areas. It often leads to conflict or a contradiction either because of a lack of understanding between the Departments or tunnel vision that legislation must specifically deal with one issue and cannot of itself be relevant to other areas.  That should not continue to be the norm, but perhaps the Bill before us this evening goes too far and tries to cover just about everything that he could conceivably cover in one Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2577" /> There are many aspects of the Bill which have a great deal of merit and one should not take away from that. However, because of the lack of detail, some of the issues covered in the Bill pose more questions rather than give answers. While there may be issues in the Bill which are incompatible and notwithstanding the lack of focus in the Bill, the Progressive Democrats support many of the sentiments and aspirations of the Bill, which is worthy of support on that basis alone.</P>
    <P>For many years I have stated that a reasonable percentage of the population will never be proficient in continental languages until such time as they are taught in primary schools.  It is a very hollow claim to suggest that we are interested in teaching continental languages because they are on the secondary school curriculum. The evidence of this type of rigid structure in our education system is plain to see.  It is a fact that no worthwhile percentage of students leaving schools are proficient in continental languages. The question of teaching continental languages in primary schools poses difficult questions for other subjects on the curriculum.  This probably accounts for the fact that this question has not been faced up to over the past number of years.  The reality is that we have to do something immediately about continental languages.  As I have said, we will never be able to say we are serious about teaching continental languages unless we begin teaching them in primary school.</P>
    <P>We have often heard explanations why the Germans, Danes and French seem to be proficient in at least English, if not a third language, and there is a basic reason for that.  It is a well known fact that the younger the child, the more open he is to absorbing the various nuances of a foreign language and to speaking it. No one is suggesting that a child could become technically proficient or grammatically correct in speaking a lang uage, but that is the nub of the problem in this country.  There are some people in Ireland who understand grammer and can write an essay in a foreign language, <Col N="2578" /> but ask them to discuss any subject with a foreign nationalist in their language and they will find it impossible to do so.</P>
    <P>There is no point pretending that because of 1992, the integration of the single market and the real opportunities that will open up, that by talking about the problem people will suddenly become proficient in speaking continental languages. What is laid out in the Bill &mdash; although it may not be the most appropriate way to deal with it &mdash; is of huge importance in the field of education.  If we are to introduce the teaching of two foreign languages at primary level, it raises the question of teaching Irish in primary schools.</P>
    <P>Because of the range of services available and the number of subjects to be taught, and if we were to start teaching languages at the age of six or seven, it would be ludicrous to suggest that one could learn four languages along with all the other subjects.  There are obvious stumbling blocks in this area but the issue must be faced.  Until it is faced there will be no development in the teaching of languages in this country.</P>
    <P>Further down the road, at third level education, we do not have a college of languages, for instance.  In other countries there are specific third level institutes which are termed colleges of languages. They make students proficient in foreign languages.  The students know the technicalities of the language, they can converse in the languages and they are capable of taking up a career in business in countries throughout Europe.  The college of language does not simply deal with the language but with other areas relevant to helping somebody find a career that would require the use of continental languages.  That is another aspect of where we are going in the development of continental languages that could be addressed under this heading of the teaching of foreign languages.  If this problem is not addressed we will go nowhere.  It is deplorable that a country with the youngest population in Europe which will in the years ahead provide much of the educated talent needed in the jobs market throughout Europe is not <Col N="2579" /> proficient in the teaching of languages. It is essential that the Department of Education introduce with the utmost urgency a provision to teach at least two continental languages at primary school level.</P>
    <P>I am uncertain as to what section 2 of the Bill dealing with the Central Bank intends to achieve.  Does it mean that banks and credit institutions can be forced to implement certain types of packages at special low interest rates to companies which State agencies believe are worthy of investment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>If that was the case it would be virtually impossible to give practical effect to this under this Bill.  I accept that the banking system has to date been very much concerned with securing, in an over demanding way, the loans they are prepared to issue to the extent that it is virtually impossible for some small companies to be up and running.  The Minister in replying to Deputy Bruton said that in the last budget he had encouraged the banking system to make loans available at attractive rates which did not necessarily put this huge burden of interest onto a company trying to get off the ground and which did not demand the securities to satisfy the bank that the loan would be totally secured.  We have to move more to an equity based system of lending.  The system in operation is not sufficiently geared to the type of developments occurring in the context of the European economy at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton about how we as individuals spend our finances.  We do not tend to save money or invest it in a number of ways in productive areas which could create employment.  Surely there is an opportunity for the setting up of a national fund that could be subscribed to by ordinary people, a fund that would be controlled by experts who would look specifically at small companies in the start up phase and sift out those whom they thought were worth investing in, and invest in them.  There <Col N="2580" /> would probably be a necessity for guarantees so that people would be encouraged to invest.  At the moment there is a great waste of private funds in that there is no real encouragement for people to invest in areas geared to encourage employment. As the Germans say, in Germany they rent their houses and buy their televisions but in Ireland they rent their televisions and buy their houses.  There seems to be something cockeyed with that sort of development, although as a home owner with a large mortgage, I would rather own my own home.  The point I am trying to get across is that we need to encourage individuals to make funds available for productive employment. That resource has not yet been tapped and until it is we will lose out on a great opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Bill attempts to deal in a small way with local Government and does not do justice to the range of issues that need a large and detailed Bill in their own right. Local Government at the moment is very much out of date and needs to be reconstituted and given much more substantial powers than it has at present.  Over the last decade local Government has shifted to a manager based system which is in the control of the bureaucracy of the State apparatus, where the local representatives have very little say.  One of the major factors causing this was lack of control in relation to raising finances and then a lack of control as to how finances should be spent in the regional areas. This Bill touches in a small way on local Government but this Government need to bring forward a Bill which would require major reform of local Government, how local Government is constituted and how much power it should have to develop its own structures.  We tend to be over centralised in this area and the entrepreneurial flares at local level are totally stagnated.  There are many good people at local level and they are stagnating.  They cannot develop in conjunction with the local representatives a dynamic entity for the development of their own areas.  This problem must be seriously addressed. With the Structural and Regional Funds <Col N="2581" /> potentially available to us it is a great shame the way this question is being dealt with at the moment.  City managers, county managers and local people involved in the community have no idea about what is going on or about how funds are to be distributed.  Indeed, the projects they would like to see developed in their own areas are not getting the type of airing that they, as the people responsible, would like to see.  Ultimately the people will have to answer in their own areas as to why certain developments have not taken place.  I do not understand why the Government, in this general area, have to be so secretive about the national plan, local plans or regional plans.  This secrecy is baffling a huge range of people at local level.</P>
    <P>The question of how local government is to develop has to be addressed legislatively. Until such time as it is, it will continue to stagnate and a great opportunity for regional dynamic forces to develop will be lost.</P>
    <P>The educational system in many ways is too divorced from the requirements of the job market.  There have been moves in recent years to gear some aspects of third level education directly towards requirements in the area of employment. Many of the regional technical colleges such as the one in Waterford in my own constituency which now has over 2,300 students and is the largest technical college in the country, have been gearing a number of their courses to where there is a shortfall of skills in the market place. However, a fundamental review of the Higher Education Authority is necessary so that future developments in education are directly linked, where possible, to developments in the industrial market. This type of planning would have the effect of reducing the number of students undertaking courses where there is no possibility whatsoever of gaining employment in this country and redirecting them into areas where there is a demand for their skills in the market place.  This proposition is beginning to dawn on the Government; the clear need for proper planning in this area is becoming more evident every day.  A Bill or legislation <Col N="2582" /> being introduced in the education area should take account of legislation being introduced in the industrial area at the same time because there are areas where there is overlapping, where there could be a joint approach, where things being done in both areas could be going in the same direction to achieve the same end. That is, perhaps, what Deputy Bruton's Bill is highlighting here tonight; the need to stop legislation simply emanating from a Department on its own without due cognisance being taken of what may be happening in other Departments.</P>
    <P>There is a great opportunity to develop skills in conjunction with the third level education institutes.  This ranges across regional colleges and even into universities. Because of the large numbers emigrating it behoves us to gear the education facilities and the courses as much as possible to what is happening in the education area.  We have all been talking about the developments in technology and the developments which are taking place here and yet we do not have any specific area of any university or any regional technical college beginning to seriously develop linkages with companies who are developing in technology and who could utilise research and development facilities and, indeed, who would invest in them if they were available in conjunction with third level institutes.  There is an attempt to do this in the pharmaceutical area and I hope it will be a forerunner of how people in third level education can work in conjunction with industry to develop.</P>
    <P>Research and development is, by its nature, a very expensive and costly business. It is a myth to suggest that suddenly Irish companies, particularly small companies, can start investing huge sums of money in research and development.  It is also a fact that research and development in, for instance, the United States, is an extremely expensive business.  There may well be opportunities for many of those companies not to locate their total research and development in this country but, indeed, only elements of what they may be doing in that respect.  That would benefit the advancement of third level <Col N="2583" /> education but it would also benefit us to the extent that as a result of these programmes of research and development, students who qualify would then have employment opportunities here instead of having to go abroad to work and leaving this country at the loss of the huge cost of their education and their potential as business people.  There are opportunities for us to take that road now.  We must not delay and then find ourselves suddenly in 1992.</P>
    <P>The national roads authority should be established on a statutory basis.  The development of the basic infrastructure is essential to minimise the disadvantages of this being the only country which will not have a land link into Europe.  I am heartened that it is now emerging that we are not necessarily at the disadvantage in distribution costs to mainland Europe that we might have thought we were by reason of being an island off mainland Europe.  It is now beginning to emerge that with a proper road network in Ireland and, indeed, a proper rail network we could be in a position costwise to land goods in mainland Europe as cheaply as goods that will be transported across the mainland of the UK and through the channel tunnel.  If that is the case and if it can be achieved with the type of powers the national roads authority should have, it is something that all businesses in Ireland would welcome. This also begs the question as to what we are to do with our rail network.  It is ridiculous for a country of our size that the whole area of public transport, that is, the bus sector and the railway network should all be in the control of the State. It is too great a burden for the State to bear and there is no need for it to do so.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the bus sector.  I believe that the railways must remain within the control of the State.  Railway development, if there is to be development, should be looked at from the point of view of how we transport goods throughout this country and how we move goods out of the country in the most efficient manner.  I am not saying it should totally abandon its role in the <Col N="2584" /> transportation of people but it should concentrate on how goods are transported to ports to be shipped out of the country.  That is an area which the Government should look at.  If they do so, as mentioned in this Bill, the whole question of privatisation and the sale of shares, some, if not all, in commercial semi-State bodies must be looked at by the Government.  I do not understand why this Government continually ignore this issue.  The Government are, in some way, hostages to the concept that you can never sell a semi-State company because it somehow weakens the Fianna Fáil view of nationalism or whatever they aspire to.  This is obviously a load of rubbish and is seriously hampering development within our economy. Why can they not sell off State assets, products or companies which have reached their full potential within the domain of State control and have this money to invest in new projects?  I am not against the State being involved in public enterprises.  The Progressive Democrats are not against such involvement despite what certain people are trying to put across.  I would like to see a rolling plan of development in which the State could be involved, on a continual basis, in developing companies to their full potential, selling them off, realising a profit in the market place and reinvesting that money in other ventures.  That could be of great benefit to us.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Social Welfare Bill, 1989: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated already, I am glad the Minister has decided to end the urban-rural anomaly in regard to the rates of unemployment assistance.  In addition to the obvious benefits to the individual it is also a further step towards rationalising and streamlining the whole social welfare system.  When demands are made for streamling or simplifying the system it is always on the basis that the <Col N="2585" /> most generous rates are the ones that should be used for this purpose.  The only difficulty with this approach is that it has very considerable cost implications.  The cost of raising the rural unemployment assistance rate to the urban rate will be £3 million.  This is a considerable commitment by the Government and they are to be congratulated for taking this positive and welcome step.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, undertook in the budget to review the urban-rural differential in the rates of unemployment assistance and to have new arrangements in place in July.  The Bill provides that 107,000 social welfare recipients will get an extra increase in July over and above the budget increases already announced.  Of these, 95,000 are on the rural rate of unemployment assistance and 12,000 are on supplementary welfare allowance. For the first time all unemployment assistance recipients will be paid at the same rate regardless of where they live. The lower rural rate will be increased to the urban rate, an increase of £1.20 per week for a short-term claimant and £1.30 per week for a long-term claimant.  The new personal rate for unemployment assistance which will come into effect in July will be £42 per week for a short-term claimant and £47 per week for a long-term claimant.  A family with three children on long-term unemployment assistance will get £107 per week from July as compared with £96.90 if they are currently on the rural rate, an increase of £10.10 per week.  The new rate of supplementary allowance will be £42, the same as for those on short-term unemployment assistance.  Because of the abolition of the rural rate of unemployment assistance, people on supplementary welfare allowance will get an additional increase of £1.20 next July.  Taking account of budget increases, people on this rate, the lowest payment, will receive an increase of £4.20 in July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the abolition of the rural rate will be much appreciated by people in some parts of my constituency, for instance Mayfield, part of which is on the outskirts of the city, and Dublin Hill <Col N="2586" /> where there are many new housing developments and which up to now were on the outskirts of the city.  All those people in Cork who are on supplementary welfare allowance will benefit from this new arrangement.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to widowers and deserted husbands and I take this opportunity to welcome the introduction of a new social assistance scheme for widowers and deserted husbands with dependent children.  This is a major improvement for men who lose their wives and who are left to look after their children.  At present they have to fall back on supplementary welfare allowance. When we consider the provision we make for widows and deserted wives, there was a need to introduce this scheme for widowers and deserted husbands so as to create greater equality.  When one speaks of equality it is normally in the context of improving the position of women <i>vis-à-vis</i> men.</P>
    <P>The discrimination against widowers and deserted husbands needed to be tackled and I am glad that the Minister has taken the opportunity to introduce this new scheme.  It will mean a very significant increase for widowers.  Compared with what they receive under supplementary welfare allowance at present, a widower with four children will receive £29 extra per week.  I know that the introduction of this new scheme for widowers and deserted husbands will be a great help to people in Cork who find themselves in this unhappy position.  A widower or deserted husband with dependent children will now get the same rate of social welfare social assistance payment as a widow or deserted wife.</P>
    <P>With changing work and life patterns in society, we have to face the reality that men are left to take on the responsibility of looking after their children when their wives die or desert them.  It was unfair to penalise them for doing so or to discriminate against them.  Many are unable to go out to work or unable to find work. This new scheme will be a major help for such people and has been warmly welcomed.  It is a major step towards a single parent allowance scheme and is a <Col N="2587" /> first step in a series of measures necessary to introduce equality between men and women in the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>We have already had some experience of the effects of European Community equality directives.  When the Coalition introduced the equality provision in 1986 they had to make special alleviating payments to people on social welfare who would otherwise have lost out.  They had intended that those payments would last for one year only but this Government have continued them.  Rather than abruptly stopping them in one go, as the Coalition were going to do, the Government decided to phase them out on a gradual basis.  This was a caring and sensible approach to adopt.  I would ask the Minister to consider the possibility of introducing a single parent allowance scheme and to bring about the necessary rationalisation of the system to achieve this.  This is the direction we should be going in.  It is better to face the issue and not wait until we are forced to take action by the EC</P>
    <P>The Minister has introduced very welcome and desirable improvements for people on social welfare but I would like to consider the position of the unemployed and the other measures that could be taken to improve their situation.  Some of these, like the pre-retirement allowance, are dealt with in this Bill but others are dealt with at an administrative level. The Minister has introduced the part time job incentive scheme, the educational opportunites scheme and the voluntary work option.  These are all very important helps for the unemployed but we need to make more progress in this direction.  In order to be entitled to unemployment payments, a person must be available for and actually seeking work and must be free and willing to take up full time employment.  One of the conditions or means of monitoring this availability for work is signing on, usually on a weekly basis, at the local employment exchange or other signing office.</P>
    <P>The schemes I have just mentioned involve some suspension of the criteria of being available for and genuinely seeking <Col N="2588" /> work.  If a person is to undertake, say, the educational opportunities scheme, they devote the period of the course to their studies.  They are, in theory, available for and actively seeking work but in reality the majority do not seek work during that time.  They use the opportunity of the course to acquire an additional educational qualification so as to improve their long-term job prospects.  This is a very sensible approach but it means accepting that such persons need not continually establish that they are available for work.  While the Government are succeeding in creating an environment for jobs and growth in the economy it appears we will have the problem of unemployment for some years to come.</P>
    <P>Representing as I do a constituency with more than its fair share of unemployment, I have a particular interest in any means of improving the position of those who are unemployed particularly the long-term unemployed.  The Government have made great strides in improving the income position of the unemployed and this Bill gives effect to substantial increases.  We must take this further and increase flexibility in the system so as to create a wide range of options for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>While some unemployment groups are mainly pressure groups, I should like to compliment one of the unemployed groups in my constituency for the practical and sensible approach they have adopted in coming up with proposals to improve the lot of the unemployed.  The unemployed group in Knocknaheeny have produced a preliminary document suggesting that there should be a transition period between unemployment and employment, especially for the long term unemployed.  The basis of their proposal is the establishment of a co-operative for unemployed people.  The Minister will be well aware from his interest in cooperatives of the immense role they can play in society.  It should not be forgotten that the co-operative movement was started in Ireland by Sir Horace Plunkett. It proved an excellent idea for the people of Ireland and swept the country.  It is <Col N="2589" /> based on the concept of people helping themselves.</P>
    <P>The Knocknaheeny Support Group in their preliminary submission, a copy of which has been submitted to the Department of Social Welfare, have said that there is a connection between unemployment and poverty and I am sure we would all agree with that.  They recognise the need to express the views of the disadvantaged in society, but they place a greater emphasis on the need for imaginative and positive responses which might have some chance of making an impact on the problem of unemployment.  They consider that their submission is in the category of such a response.  &ldquo;Support&rdquo;, as they are called, claim that the extent of the problem imposes an obligation of co-operation on all people, whether in Government, the public service, or in community or voluntary groups.</P>
    <P>The Knocknaheeny Support Group provide mutual support and a commitment to community enterprise and job creation.  They consider this is a difficult but viable route forward.  The unemployed have to play a part in tackling the overall problem of unemployment for society.  The group tackle the psychological aspects of unemployment and help people to get back into circulation.  They believe there is an obligation on the Government to recognise in some practical and substantial form the efforts of groups such as themselves to find some way out of unemployment. They are trying to highlight how unemployed people feel about their situation and to set the scene for greater flexibility to give them a chance to return to work.</P>
    <P>At this stage it is as well to state that the support group claim no monopoly on wisdom, commonsense or initiative and that the group are completely open to suggested improvements or changes from any quarter.  The basis of their proposals involves the recognition both in principle and in practice of the concept of a transition period, that is a period between unemployment and full employment.  They feel from their own experience of long-term unemployment <Col N="2590" /> that this is an essential element.  It is vital to the success of this specific proposal and of any sustained community effort to rectify the problem.</P>
    <P>During this transition period they propose to set up a services co-operative with a mixture of skilled, semi-skilled, unskilled and professional services being provided.  This would be done on a competitive commercial basis.  All funds generated by the co-op would be held by Support Limited, a company limited by guarantee which is currently in the process of formation.</P>
    <P>During this transition period all those engaged on the project would keep their full social welfare entitlements and, in addition, would be paid the appropriate family income supplement.  Local authority rent payments would be held at their current levels on commencement of the project.  When the accumulated funds and income flow have reached predetermined levels, all those engaged in the project would leave the social welfare system.  All payments would be made from the accumulated funds from that point on.</P>
    <P>That, in its basic form, is the proposal which is being suggested as a pilot project. I would strongly urge the Minister to give serious consideration to this matter. The people involved in this project are unemployed for a long number of years, some of them for up to seven or eight years.</P>
    <P>What is wanted is some system which would enable these people to be exempted from having to meet the criteria of being available for work for a period of, say, up to one year.  There would be no real cost to the State.  The people involved have no immediate prospects of obtaining employment.  What they want is an opportunity to create for themselves the chance of setting up in business, while having at the same time the security of knowing that their social welfare payments will continue.  I know that the Minister is actively considering this proposal and I would like to take this opportunity to thank him, on my own behalf and on behalf of the support <Col N="2591" /> group, for his interest in the work of the group.</P>
    <P>The Government have a major part to play in helping people in need.  It is much better if Government can work in tandem with voluntary groups to improve the lot of the unemployed.  This Minister is committed to that approach.</P>
    <P>The technical requirement of being available for employment presupposes the availability of employment opportunities. In times of high unemployment the strict enforcement of this condition has been questioned.  Considerable progress has been made over the past two years in introducing flexibility to the unemployment payments system.  I would ask the Minister to consider further modifying the system so as to allow for the transition period.  This could also apply to educational courses where those under the educational opportunities scheme are unavailable or unsuitable. The essential control would be that this flexibility would only be available to people who were unemployed for, say, two years.  In this way the likelihood of this proposal costing the State any money would be very small, if it existed at all.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister has taken the necessary powers in this Bill to make a man liable to maintain his wife and any dependent child.  A similar obligation is placed on a woman to maintain her husband and any dependent child. This is a major and very significant departure from the position that has existed up to now.  A deserting spouse previously was not obliged to maintain his wife and children.  All that is to change under this Bill.</P>
    <P>While the State provides &mdash; and will continue to provide &mdash; for the deserted wife, the State will take on part of the responsibility for getting a contribution from the husband towards the maintenance of the wife and children.  At present, a deserted wife must take steps to obtain maintenance from her husband before she will be entitled to social welfare. For wives left in such a vulnerable position, this can be a very harrowing experience.  Going to court is a difficult <Col N="2592" /> experience for ordinary law-abiding citizens. It is much more so if it is to try to force a deserting husband to pay maintenance. Entitlement to deserted wife's payments depends on the wife trying, and continuing to try, to get maintenance from the husband.</P>
    <P>The number of deserted wives in receipt of payments from the State has grown enormously and is now over 13,500.  The cost to the taxpayer is estimated at over £52 million in 1989.  This increase in payments is due to the increased breakdown in marriage.  In many cases the husband walks away from his obligations and the taxpayer is left to foot the bill.  This must stop.  Those who can afford to pay maintenance for their families must be made to do so.  There is no good reason why the taxpayer should continue to take the husband's responsibility when he is in a position to meet it. By imposing a liability on a deserting spouse to maintain the other, the first step is being taken to reduce the burden on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare will now be able to seek a maintenance order against a person who fails to pay maintenance to the deserted spouse.  The District Court will be able to make an order compelling that person to make the necessary payments to the Minister.  In this way the State will be able to reduce the cost to it of paying deserted wives.</P>
    <P>In common with the Minister's general approach to preserving the entitlements of people at present in receipt of payments, the new arrangements will not affect any payments that deserted wives are at present receiving.  This is a very sensible and practical arrangement. People will have entered into commitments on the basis of their anticipated income and we should recognise that any change would impose hardship on those deserted wives.</P>
    <P>The Minister is introducing a procedure to simplify and streamline court procedures in matters of evidence in social welfare fraud cases.  These measures are to be welcomed, as is his crackdown on subcontractors.  For too long the public have been complaining about <Col N="2593" /> fraud and abuse in the social welfare system.  The Minister is to be complimented for having the initiative to deal seriously with this problem.  He has had considerable success to date, saving tens of millions of pounds of taxpayer's money.  These new measures are designed to further improve his power to tackle people who fiddle the system.</P>
    <P>There are many other major positive developments in this Bill and in social welfare matters generally that I have not had time to consider in detail.  The bottom line, really is that this Minister and this Fianna Fáil Government care about the needs of people on social welfare. The Minister has successfully managed the resources of his Department. He has the backing of the Government in providing additional resources so as to give major increases in real incomes for the unemployed and maintain the position of all who depend on social welfare.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should remember, in a time of economic difficulty, the problem that the present Minister and Government inherited from the previous Administration.  I was disappointed at the contribution of the main Opposition speaker.  His contribution to an extremely important matter was very negative.  More progress has been made in two years than was ever previously envisaged.  Both speakers of the Labour Party and the Progressive Democrats recognised and acknowledged the progress made by the Government and particularly by Deputy Woods, the Minister for Social Welfare, in that time.  It is a pity that we could not have had a more positive approach because, whether we like it or not, it must be recognised that we inherited a major problem.  There had been no activity for almost four and a half years.  This Government are tackling the problems, we are on the right road. There is an awful lot to be done but we have made progress in streamlining the system and giving better benefits.  I am confident that with the continued efforts of the Minister and the Government &mdash; and of each one of us in the House &mdash; we will face the responsibility in an honest and serious way, not in a political way.  If <Col N="2594" /> we do that we will live up to what is expected of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am normally a very positive person, at any rate I have often been accused of that.  However, when we talk about the national debt, the cry we hear often nowadays is that it doubled between 1982 and 1987.  The national debt increased from 1977 to 1981 by about 27 per cent per annum.  In order to avert its obvious direction, certain measures had to be taken without the full support of all parties in this House.  They were taken by the Government at the time in the teeth of very stiff opposition which is a far cry from the situation prevailing in the House today.</P>
      <P>As I have said, I am by nature a positive person and I welcome the positive aspects in the Bill, particularly in regard to the provision for widowers who had made a valid case for a number of years.  It is unfortunate that their demands were not acceded to long before this.  Provision has been made for them.  A widower who stays at home to look after children used to get £56.80 per week and under the new system he will get £74.80.  It is a help and an improvement but it is not a huge step forward.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, there have been instances in the past where supplementary welfare was more beneficial to the recipient than unemployment or other types of assistance.  I wonder if a case will arise where individual widowers may suffer a fall in income because of a mortgage or other liabilities, and the Department of Social Welfare or a health board would decide that they cannot exceed the statutory social welfare benefit available to the recipient.  As the Minister knows, that applies in quite a number of other cases and, as public representatives, we have come up against individual instances where we advise people to remain on supplementary welfare instead of going on to some other system which could result in a deserted wife, deserted husband or a widower being worse off.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify this later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also made provision for <Col N="2595" /> the inclusion of public servants in the new PRSI proposals.  There are negative as well as positive elements in that area and I am sure the Minister will realise that in due course.  I do not propose to go into them too deeply tonight, suffice to say that it will not be the smooth operation which the Minister has in mind.</P>
    <P>I know that legislation should not be introduced to deal with hard cases but, inevitably, you will find that such cases must prompt legislation.  Widows are a case in point but it took a very long time before their case was recognised.  Notwithstanding all the accolades conferred on the Minister I can assure him that there is a great deal of hardship, deprivation and poverty.  I am not speaking about the kind of poverty illustrated on television programmes but a poverty affecting people who do not look poor. That has not been obvious in years gone by but I find &mdash; and I am sure the same applies to all public representatives &mdash; that more and more people are seeking assistance.  Their appearance does not put them in the social or economic category in dire need but, when you investigate their case carefully, you will find that they are widowers or people on low incomes who are in a bind out of which they are unable to extricate themselves.  They are on fixed incomes and if anything goes wrong which disrupts the harmony of their budget they have great difficulty. For instance, Confirmation or Communion can be a huge trauma because their children feel that they have to keep in step with their peers.  We all know that children are very sensitive but they can also be very cruel to one another.  The children of people on low incomes often feel that they are not equal although under the Constitution we are supposed to cherish all the children of the nation equally.</P>
    <P>I do not want to spend too much time on this subject but I have never before received such a volume of cases of people in that category as I have over the past 12 months.  I do not know whether that applies to all public representatives but I presume it does.  Some people deprecate <Col N="2596" /> the clinic system but one of the best places to learn how legislation affects the people is by listening to people's problems at first hand.  Generally speaking, you will find that all the legislation passed in this House goes over most people's heads except in the way that it affects them on the ground.</P>
    <P>We all know that there has been fraud in the social welfare system.  Of course that is not to be encouraged or supported but the problem is that fear can be created in the hearts and minds of people in receipt of social welfare assistance in particular.  They may be scared into leaving the country or refusing to go through an investigative system which they feel will find something that is not in order. Perhaps one would say that if they have nothing to hide they should not be worried. However, I have come across cases &mdash; and I am sure other Members have too &mdash; where people had nothing to hide, and it could be proved that they had nothing to hide, but they were terror-stricken at the prospect of an investigation into their social welfare payments,</P>
    <P>There is also the question of young people living at home and the assessment of board and lodging in their parents home which works against them in determining the level of social welfare payments. Deputy Bell spoke eloquently about this before Private Members' Business.  He said that it benefited them to leave home and to live in rented accommodation, away from the supervision of their parents, and they then qualified for maximum benefits.  That is a flaw in the system which should be corrected.  Let nobody tell us that it is better or desirable to encourage young people to leave home.  It is not, for two reasons, first, they are not around to help in the house and to look after their parents as they might be expected to do in many cases. We have often come across cases where an unemployed young person living in a household with two elderly parents in receipt of social welfare payments has found it much more beneficial to leave home and to leave it up to the State to <Col N="2597" /> maintain their parents.  That flaw in the system needs to be tackled.  The Department should look at how it affects the running of the State's affairs and also how it affects the lives of some people.  The Minister should look at this area very carefully in the future.</P>
    <P>While other speakers have been very supportive of the Minister in the efforts he is making &mdash; and we must all encourage the fair running of the country in difficult times &mdash; we have removed from the payroll over the past two years in one way or another roughly 100,000 people. Generally speaking these are young people.  I mention this because they have been humiliated into accepting a paltry sum if they happen to be unfortunate enough to be living at home.  They have been humiliated into going through a very stringent investigative and assessment system following which they find that the only options open to them are to either accept this paltry sum and remain dependent on the State or to go elsewhere. They choose to go elsewhere.  I am not so sure I would be happy with that kind of development if I were a Government Minister.</P>
    <P>It has been said that our young people are our greatest asset but they are not of much use to us if they are living across the water in London or in New York, Montreal or somewhere else.  I am sure that other Members of the House have had similar experiences but during the past 12 months I have had the rather peculiar experience of constituents writing to me from places such as New York, London and further afield.  I had never experienced this before.  Admittedly, I have only been a Member of this House for the past seven or eight years but I have been in public life for somewhat longer.  On one occasion a man came to my clinic and stated he had been out of work for seven or eight months with little prospect of obtaining work.  He was not a shirker but rather someone who had eagerly sought work.  However, he had failed to find it and had decided to give up the ghost.  Given the possibility that he would not be able to obtain work for up to five or six weeks he asked if I could <Col N="2598" /> ensure that the welfare services would operate in such a way so as to protect his wife and children in his absence.  This can happen quite often and I am sure every other Member of this House has had similar experiences.  This is sad because it indicates we have returned to a time which I had hoped had long since passed. Unfortunately we seem to have returned to it again and the incidence seems to be much more pronounced than previously.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer to our appeals system.  Let me say first of all that I do not condone the issuing of certificates to people who are allegedly ill and possibly able to work so that they may obtain illegally benefits of any kind.  A particular case comes to mind.  Take the case of a person who had lived most of his or her life in the United Kingdom and who had been deemed to be unfit for work.  This person decided, being an Irish citizen, that since the cost of living was somewhat lower here to return home.  There was some merit in this as given the exchange rate it would have been much more beneficial for that person to return home and to receive his or her social welfare payments from the DHSS.  What happened next?  One of our investigators deemed that individual fit for work or to quote the phrase used &ldquo;not incapable of work&rdquo;.  This person was then cut off with the result that instead of a payment being issued from the UK, the Irish taxpayer had to step in and pay supplementary welfare to this person.  A running battle took place for several weeks until we were eventually able to prove that the consultants were right to deem the person unfit for work some two or three years previously and the case was upheld.  I could not understand how an appeals officer could come up with a decision such as that which was of no benefit to the State and at complete variance with the decision, recommendation and considered medical opinion of the consultant who originally deemed that person as being unfit or incapable of work.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the weird cases which come up from time to time.  With a little bit of thought, care and individual attention a lot of trouble and trauma <Col N="2599" /> could be avoided later on if some of the rough edges in the system were rounded off.</P>
    <P>I should also mention, even though the increases are welcome &mdash; 3 per cent in the case of widows and old age pensioners &mdash; that they only amount to a nominal increase and barely match the rate of inflation.  There are other costs on the householder which place them in a less favourable position.  It is unfortunate that it was not found possible to increase those levels somewhat more.  Here I have in mind the case of an old age pensioner living with a younger member of the family, a son or a daughter, paying a large mortgage.  In this case a son or daughter buys a house and decides to bring the parent to live with them.  The son or daughter could find themselves being taxed as a single person and, as at present, find mortgage interest relief diminishing.  That type of household would have two set incomes, one of which would be controlled by the repayments on the mortgage and the other, in the form of a single person's or widow's pension, controlled by the State.  Because the parent is living with a son or daughter, they would not be in receipt of the usual free fuel allowance or other concessions. Therefore, that particular household could find itself in a rather difficult position simply because a member of the family has had the courage, guts and commitment to try to help out and to take care of a parent.  This is not an isolated case.  In fact, it is quite common.  Perhaps the Minister would look into this matter to see if anything can be done to assist these people.  I do not think it would cost the Exchequer a huge amount of money to do so and it would help to alleviate the misery being experienced by such households.</P>
    <P>Giving increases from July onwards is like saying to somebody at Christmas-time: &ldquo;I will give you a Christmas present after the summer&rdquo;.  While from a budgetary point of view it can be very beneficial and from the point of view of balancing books it can have a good, rounded off effect, it does not have the same effect <Col N="2600" /> on the recipient of the alleged gift.  In future years the Minister might try to bring Christmas forward a little and instead of promising next year's Christmas gift in July he will try to give it as near as possible to 1 April or 5 April, the beginning of the tax year.</P>

      <P>I welcome the exemption of the fostering allowance for assessment of means for unemployment assistance and other social welfare payments.  The Minister may not be aware of something that should be borne in mind which I mention in passing.  A problem has arisen in recent times in relation to insurance covering foster children which has caused considerable concern to foster parents. The foster parent may well be deemed liable in the case of a claim if something is not done to alleviate that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point that must be borne in mind is the old question of somebody deciding he or she wants to qualify for a social employment scheme or enterprise allowance scheme by virtue of being a specified length of time in receipt of unemployment benefit or assistance or whatever the case may be.  Lo and behold, one or two weeks before that person is about to qualify, what happens? The person is cut off, amazingly and miraculously. I cannot understand why a little co-ordination could not foresee that.  All it does is save a few pounds.  It quenches any ray of hope of the individual concerned who just leaves the country, vanishes, goes to New York, Edinburgh, London or somewhere else. It is sad that people should leave with a <Col N="2601" /> sour taste in their mouths.  Often they will say they were willing to try the enterprise allowance scheme or the social employment scheme, which have many limitations. I am not suggesting them as a panacea for anything.  As a matter of fact, there are many limitations in the social employment scheme but at least there are people willing to try it when nothing better is available.  When their hope is killed the only option they have left is to emigrate, and they do not emigrate with fond memories of this green and luscious land where everything is in order.</P>
    <P>I want to give a personal view on another matter.  Where redundancies occur, redundancy lump sum payments are made in some cases, supported by social welfare etc.  From my experience in some cases the payment of a lump sum does not do the job it was intended to do. A case can be made for spacing out the payment over a period of time whether by weekly payment, monthly payment or whatever.  Some regard should be had as to whether it is in the interest of a family and the individual to pay out a lump sum of £10,000, £20,000, £30,000 or £40,000 as the case may be &mdash; there are not too many cases at present where the last amount is paid&mdash;or whether it would be better to pay the redundancy figure over a period of years on a weekly basis, thus guaranteeing for a couple of years at least an adequate level of income in that household.  In some households home management or home economics might not be a major factor.  That has been brought to my attention by people in the St. Vincent de Paul Society and in other places, and they speak with some authority on that matter.  I mention this in passing.</P>
    <P>Another point along the lines of my last reference relates to payment of social welfare assistance to the travelling people.  The first priority in any family unit is to ensure adequate food and shelter in that order.  From my dealing with cases in that area I feel a greater use of the food voucher system should be made rather than total dependence or too great a dependence on the weekly payment of benefit or assistance.  It has been brought <Col N="2602" /> to my attention by social workers, St. Vincent de Paul and various concerned people that in many instances if they compare the income of a family where there is somebody employed with that of unemployed people, in many cases the employed people are far worse off.</P>
    <P>Because of the inability of the family unit to run their finances properly and the lack of proper home economics &mdash; through no fault of theirs &mdash; greater use of the food voucher system would ensure that basic needs in terms of food would be met in the first instance.  Basic needs in terms of heating, lighting and shelter could be met similarly if there was a greater reliance on that type of system.  I understand that applies in some countries and there might be some progress in that area.  We do not want to leave the family without spending money, but we want to ensure that the family's basic needs are met.  Whether anything else happens after that is a matter for the families concerned.</P>
    <P>The age old fact that anybody qualifying for unemployment benefit or assistance must be &ldquo;available for work&rdquo; is peculiar.  In many instances, when people in public offices are under pressure there is not sufficient time either for the person outside the counter or the person inside the counter to explain the situation.</P>
    <P>In a case I dealt with recently a person did not qualify for unemployment benefit for the past three years simply because a form was not filled out properly.  The person worked every time he got an opportunity to do so, worked in the same industry and was available for work anywhere work was available, but because a question was posed in a particular fashion &mdash; like one of the questionnaires one gets from time to time &mdash; a particular answer was given and the result was that that person did not qualify.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to refer to was referred to by Deputy Bell.  There have been a number of incidents, isolated, I am glad to say, of State contracts being awarded to people who have been known to employ persons in receipt of social welfare either in this jurisdiction or in another jurisdiction.  That fact was well <Col N="2603" /> known.  I ask that in future all recipients of State contracts be asked to declare the names and addresses of people working for them and if they are known to be in receipt of social welfare either in this jurisdiction or elsewhere.  I am not as enthusiastic as most of the backbenchers who have spoken on the other side of the House, but I am sure the Minister will pardon me for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his efforts over the past few years to streamline the social welfare system. Despite difficult financial constraints he has managed to protect payments to social welfare recipients generally.  He has set about tackling the problems of the lower paid in society.  This is to be welcomed.  Families in receipt of social welfare payments find it very difficult to make ends meet and in many cases they are barely above the poverty line.  The Government have managed in the past two years to provide over £250 million extra for families on low incomes. Resources have been directed to families in the greatest need and extra provisions for children in this year's budget will amount to £42 million.</P>
      <P>The Minister has introduced a number of worthwhile changes in the social welfare system during the past two years.  He has brought in many new schemes and ideas which will benefit the weaker and less well off in our community.  This Bill provides a new social assistance scheme for widowers and deserted husbands.  It abolishes the lower rural rate of unemployment assistance by applying the higher urban rates throughout the country.  It also extends the liability on a deserting husband to maintain the deserted wife.  The bill radically streamlines and restructures social welfare payments. The number of different rates for children, for example, has gone down from 36 to 12 and the rates of unemployment assistance have decreased from 17 to six.  All this has been done within a two-year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes being introduced will benefit everybody in receipt of social welfare <Col N="2604" /> payments, especially those in receipt of long-term benefits.  The general increase of 3 per cent will more than maintain the position of all claimants since the rate of inflation is only 2 per cent.  The special increases of 12 per cent for the long-term unemployed and 8 per cent for people in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance give them a substantial rise and, coupled with last year's increase, will help those people who found it practically impossible to survive on the income they had in the past few years.  The increase of 3 per cent in widow's and old age pensions, unemployment and disability payments is welcome.</P>
    <P>I welcome the special increase for the long-term unemployed.  This has been a bone of contention for many years with different Governments and for various reasons no Government set out to tackle the problem.  I am glad this Minister has recognised the serious imbalance in this area.  Last year the long-term unemployed received a substantial increase, while this year they are to receive an extra 12 per cent.  The increase since last July is 25 per cent, which represents a considerable improvement for people depending on this payment.  I hope that in next year's budget the Minister will again increase this payment very substantially.</P>

      <P>There is definitely a need to improve the entitlements of those people.  The improvements in benefits for families are also welcome.  There will be only two rates of adult dependant allowance for the unemployed, one long term and the other short term.  The number of rates is reduced from five to two.  It is important to have only a small number of rates because otherwise people become confused as to their entitlements.  I would be happy to see only one rate for all people on social welfare.  I hope the Minister will continue to streamline the system and bring about more improvements in budgets to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2605" /> This Government are firmly committed to improving the position of families. This is done through social welfare payments and the family income supplement. I am glad the Minister has recognised that the family income supplement has not been working effectively. He has had a study carried out and a number of recommendations have been put forward which I hope he will implement as quickly as possible.  Many people are not aware that the family income supplement exists.  When people come into a clinic and are encouraged to make a claim, more often than not they are found to be eligible.  The Minister outlined the conclusions of the report. The retention of the scheme was recommended, subject to improvements in its structure with the aim of moving towards a family credit variant in due course, increases in the income limits for recipients and an increase in the maximum payments, together with additional payments to families with more than five children.</P>

I hope the Minister will encourage people to apply by highlighting the scheme through the media and other channels available to him.</P>

      <P>The new scheme will be of major benefit to men looking after families on low incomes.  In many cases they were claiming unemployment assistance with a child dependant allowance, but the amount of money available was very small.  Many families in those circumstances were living below the poverty line.  I welcome this scheme which I hope will be of major benefit.  The Minister stated that the supplementary welfare allowance received at present by a man with two children amounts to £56.80.  He will get £74.80 under the new scheme, an increase of £18.  I welcome that decision by the Minister and the Government.  It is worth noting that almost 6,000 men will benefit from this change.  We have heard a lot of talk over the years about equality for women and I am glad the Minister has recognised the need for equality for men in regard to this scheme. I have no doubt that as a result of the change the families of those men will enjoy a better standard of living.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increase in the rural rate of unemployment assistance.  In County Wexford, particularly in the town of Enniscorthy, we have been aware of an anomaly between the rural and urban rate.  People in rural areas receive less than their urban counterparts although they have to provide for their families in the same way as those living in the towns. I should like to compliment the Minister on pushing at the Cabinet table for a change in that scheme.  He has won a big concession for those living in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the delays in processing unemployment assistance claims.  In County Wexford people have to wait for between 18 and 20 weeks to have a claim dealt with and this is causing severe hardship. It appears the social welfare officers concerned care very little about the person who makes the claim.  If one rings their office one is told that the file is on their desk and that the applicant will be interviewed within two weeks but when one inquires two weeks later one finds <Col N="2607" /> that the matter has not been dealt with. That is not good enough.  Claimants should not be subjected to such long delays and should not be expected to endure such hardship.  I appeal to the Minister to take an interest in this and encourage social welfare officers to speed up the decision-making process.  Indeed, some of those social welfare officers should be given lessons in courtesy and manners.  They should bear in mind that they are dealing with people who through no fault of their own cannot find a job. Those people should not be subjected to harassment or criticism by those officials. It is important to stress that I am referring to some of the officials in the county.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the self-assessment scheme and I hope it will reduce the delays.  I am aware of people who will not make claims for unemployment assistance through fear of the social welfare officers.  I welcome the decision of the Minister to extend the free fuel scheme with effect from October to old age pensioners who live with a person who is in receipt of unemployment assistance.  There is no doubt that those people are in need of assistance under this scheme.  This is another example of the Minister's commitment to the less well-off in our society.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to give consideration to the disability benefit scheme particularly in regard to the attitude of some of the medical referees.  I have no doubt that I will not be too popular for criticising the medical referees but I find it hard to understand some of their decisions.  People who are seriously ill have been cut off from benefit.  One of my constituents had an appointment card for a hospital in his possession when he went before a medical referee but the disability benefit was stopped in his case. I wonder if some of those medical referees have much medical knowledge. The Minister should ensure that medical referees adopt a more caring attitude when dealing with people who are genuinely ill.  I accept that many of those who are claiming benefit do so on the basis of a bad back or a bad pain somewhere <Col N="2608" /> and that they are swinging the lead.  The Minister is trying to get the balance right but the decisions of some of the medical referees are not correct.  They result in applicants having to appeal the decision, being examined by another medical referee and later attending an oral hearing. By the time most cases are referred to an oral hearing the applicant is in hospital and the disability benefit is restored.  The system should always work in favour of those who are genuinely sick.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the introduction of a school children's allowance to be paid in September.  When the schools opened last September many families on social welfare or on low pay found it difficult to provide books and uniforms for their children.  Some years ago a double week's payment was made in September to those on social welfare and I should like to appeal to the Minister to consider reintroducing it.  Those in receipt of social welfare, and those in receipt of the family income supplement, should be given a special school children's allowance so that they can purchase uniforms and books for their children.  I have no doubt that such a move would be welcomed by all sides of the House. There is no reason the children of the less well off should not be togged out as good as the better off in the community.</P>
    <P>The Government are providing a good social welfare system.  I heard Deputy Durkan complaining about the Government providing payments from July but he omitted to say that when the Coalition Government were in power payments were made from November.  We have succeeded in giving the less well off their increases six months earlier.  The improvements introduced by the Minister in the past two years have been welcomed by all.  We would all like to give more to those people but we cannot do so because of the financial difficulties we found ourselves in on taking office.</P>

The Minister should continue to work in the best interests of those who depend on social welfare.  Many of our problems would be solved if we had more jobs for our people and I hope we will see an improvement in that area in the near future.

      <P>The Minister should realise that Deputies are frustrated at what is happening around them and that this is the only platform they have to highlight the anomalies that exist in social welfare. Every Social Welfare Bill introduced into this House must be regarded as important, particularly in the light of present day circumstances when there is an appalling level of poverty.  The recent ESRI report, the reports by the Combat Poverty Agency, the Vincent de Paul Society and the major religious organisations here have shown that 1.3 million people are living in poverty, their only source of income being what they obtain from the social welfare system.  It is in this context that certain provisions of this Bill must be judged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide increases in rates of social welfare payments and other improvements in social welfare schemes announced by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech. There will be a 3 per cent increase in payments generally with higher increases in the lowest payments.  A minimum child dependant allowance of £10 a week is <Col N="2610" /> also provided for.  However, when one closely examines the number of people who will benefit from the minimum child benefit allowance of £10 a week the list is very short indeed.  The main beneficiaries will be those in receipt of supplementary allowances.  They will receive a miserable 50p for each of the first two children and £2 for the third and subsequent children. Those with only two children stand to gain absolutely nothing.  Those on unemployment benefit, on social welfare disability benefit or on injury benefit, with three or more children can expect something in the region of 70p per child.  Those with dependent children and receiving non-contributory old age pensions or blind pensions can expect to gain £1.30. This is a miserable response to families with young children who are living in absolute poverty.  It says very little for the Government who claim to cherish all the children of the nation equally.</P>
    <P>Other improvements in this Bill include the introduction of a new social assistance scheme for widowers and deserted husbands with children.  I certainly express my thanks and congratulations to the Minister for bringing this in at last as this has been advocated by Deputies from all parties over the years.</P>
    <P>The extension of the child dependent allowance to children between the ages of 18 and 19 in full time education is also to be welcomed, as also is the further extension of that to children up to 21 years of age who are attending any third level establishment.  However there is an anomaly.  It would appear that there is no provision for children over 19 years of age who are still attending second level education, and the number over 19 still in secondary schools will increase because of the poor prospects of employment and the need to repeat leaving certificate examinations in order to obtain higher marks.  I would ask the Minister to give this area serious attention because parents encourage their children to stay at school until they can get some kind of employment.  I will be advocating this from now on because I know of the number of young people who want to <Col N="2611" /> stay at school since they have no prospect of getting employment.</P>
    <P>Sections 3, 4 and 5 of this Bill provide for increases in social welfare payments across the board.  At the end of 1988 the Government had a whopping £500 million over what they had budgeted for. This was an opportunity for a caring government to try to alleviate the appalling levels of poverty that I referred to earlier.  Sadly for those caught in the poverty trap the opportunity was missed.  I was not surprised at the level of increases, however, after hearing the Taoiseach last Sunday week on a radio interview dismiss the figures that were produced by the ESRI report on poverty in Ireland.  The Taoiseach had the audacity to say he believed these figures were exaggerated. Does the Minister for Social Welfare believe that these figures were exaggerated? Knowing the Minister and knowing of his dedication to such people I do not believe he does.  Is the Minister prepared to admit that he accepts the figures as a factual commentary on life in Ireland for over 1.3 million people?  Will he explain to this House how he sees increases in weekly incomes that vary between £1.10 and £2.05 per week? People coming to my clinics inform me that their families are living on tinned food and only once, at the end of the week usually, can a substantial meal be given to those, families.  What on earth is going to happen in the years ahead?  At what cost will all this be to the health services?  Unless young people have proper nourishment their future is very dismal indeed.  Would the Minister like to outline to the House what effects sections 3, 4 and 5 of this Bill will have on poverty?  Can he say how many people will be taken out of the poverty trap as a result of these increases?</P>
    <P>I cannot vote against these increases because to do so would be to condemn those on social welfare to a more appalling standard of living than they currently have.  However, the fact that I am voting for these provisions does not mean that I approve of them.  The amounts are miserable. They are an insult to people on <Col N="2612" /> social welfare who are trying to raise families.  To add insult to injury they were given at a time when the Government had £500 million to spare.</P>
    <P>I would like to move to section 6 of the Bill which provides for the introduction of a new social assistance scheme for widowers and deserted husbands with children.  We are told that these schemes will be along the same lines as the existing non-contributory schemes for widows and deserted wives and would be subject to the same means test and the same rate of weekly payments.  I welcome the introduction of these two schemes.  Anything that improves the plight of a widower or a deserted husband trying to rear children is to be welcomed.  However, this section, and these two new schemes in particular, are the most blatant and discriminatory ever to be put on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>If we look at the conditions under which the deserted wife's allowance and the non-contributory widow's pension is paid, we will see that one of the important factors to be taken into consideration before a person applies for a deserted wife's allowance is that she does not have an entitlement to deserted wife's benefit. The same applies to the widows' non-contributory pensions.  How can the Minister come into this House and tell us he is going to deny a contributory widower's pension to a man with dependent children, who has paid PRSI contributions for many years?  A deserted husband who has paid PRSI contributions for many years is also to be denied the deserted husband's benefit. Yet if a man deserts his wife she can qualify for a deserted wife's benefit on his contributions.  Now the Minister is telling us that the deserted man cannot qualify for the deserted husband's benefit on the same PRSI contributions.  This is something I fail to understand.  Why the discrimination?</P>
    <P>I doubt if this meets EC standards in relation to equality in social welfare matters. This House would be wrong to allow such legislation on the Statute Book. While the legislation goes some way towards improving the plight of these <Col N="2613" /> people I am quite convinced that the provisions of this section could be found to be unconstitutional and challenged in the courts.  It is extraordinary legislation and I hope the Minister will explain the reason for the discrimination.  A man who pays PRSI contributions over the years will not get the benefit of his contributions if he is a widower or a deserted husband.  I am asking the Minister to seriously consider changing section 6 of this Bill to include contributory widower's pension and deserted husband's benefit.</P>
    <P>Section 15 is to be welcomed.  It provides that payments by health boards in respect of a child who has been boarded out to foster parents will be exempted from the assessment of means for social assistance purposes.  I am very consious of the fact that in recent times there has been an increase in the number of children taken into care, both voluntarily and under order of courts.  We owe a great debt of gratitude to the many thousands of foster parents throughout the length and breadth of Ireland who, in conjunction with the health boards, provide a very important and valuable service to the State by acting as foster parents to these unfortunate children. The economic recession and long term unemployment has had its effects on these foster parents.  A substantial number of them now find themselves on long term unemployment assistance and social welfare payments.  It has always been very difficult on these people when they were refused allowances for fuel, footwear and other State allowances because they were regarded as having the foster parent's allowance.  This amount of £35 a week per child barely covers the additional cost of meeting the needs, in some cases special needs, of foster children. I know the provisions in this section will be a welcome relief to many of them. However, I would like the Minister to reassure me that the exemption will include assessment for medical cards and other allowances, such as free fuel and free footwear allowances.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill is also to be welcomed. It enables such amount of social <Col N="2614" /> welfare payment as the Minister considers reasonable in the circumstances to be paid directly to the spouse of the recipient.  This section will enable a greater portion of the overall payment to be made to the dependent spouse in such circumstances.  Too often have I seen a husband and wife and two children separating. The husband would claim £42 long term unemployment assistance, urban rate, while the wife would get £48.40 which is below the supplementary welfare allowance rate and frequently this would have to be subsidised by the local community welfare officer.  I fully accept that under any regulations proposed by the Minister the recipient will have to be paid at least the basic supplementary allowance rate.</P>
    <P>It would also be more convenient for the spouse of the recipient to get all the money in the one office rather than is the case at present where the wife has to go to two separate offices &mdash; the health board office and the social welfare office &mdash; to get the minimum income to which she is entitled under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the provisions of section 18 of the Bill which provides that coverage for occupational injury benefit will be extended to members of the Garda Síochána.  The Garda will be covered for a restricted range of occupational injury benefit, taking account of the benefits payable under the sick pay schemes, on similar lines as apply in the case of civil servants.  This is the thin edge of the wedge.  In his budget speech, the Minister for Finance put forward a proposal that he was going to consider the extension of full PRSI to civil and public servants.  I am amazed that the Minister talks about a restricted range of occupational injury benefits.  What does he mean by this?</P>
    <P>My understanding is that the only way these people can be accommodated is under clause (b) or (d) of the PRSI code.  Under clause (b) the benefits include contributory widow's pension, contributory orphan's allowance, <Col N="2615" /> deserted wife's benefit and limited occupational injuries benefit.  Clause (d) covers full occupational injury benefit in addition to the other three.  However, a garda, under the sick pay scheme, is entitled to 365 days sick leave with full pay in any four year period.  I am sure the Minister is aware that occupational injury benefit lasts for a period of six months only from the date of the injury. The vast majority, 99.9 per cent of the Garda, will be paid full pay under their own sick scheme and will not be eligible to claim full occupational injury benefit. The only other benefit they may be entitled to in cases of serious injury is a disability pension.  Such pension will be very small because few people are found to be wholly disabled.  If a garda were found to be disabled to any substantial degree he would be compensated under the provisions of the Garda Síochána (Compensation) Acts, 1941 and 1945.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 18 of this Bill are unclear if not dishonest, from a cursory examination.  It would appear the Minister is extending the provisions of a scheme to a group of State employees knowing that they will never benefit from it.  I would appeal to the Minister to reexamine the overall position.  I have checked and have found that no garda will benefit from the provisions of this section.  Perhaps the Minister has other reasons for the insertion of this section but, on having checked with members of the force, I have discovered that no garda will be claiming that occupational injuries benefit.</P>
    <P>I want to comment briefly on the provisions of sections 12 and 13.  It would be appropriate for the Minister to have his colleague, the Minister for Justice, reexamine the procedures in relation to the enforcement of court orders.  Where a woman satisfies a local officer or departmental official that she is married to the person making the claim and has a maintenance order against him, then automatically, without the consent of her spouse, the Department should issue separate payments thus alleviating much anxiety and stress on the part of the wife <Col N="2616" /> and children who very frequently must go from office to office in search of an income to sustain them.  I am sure the Minister has had much experience of cases in which, when an allowance is awarded to a wife, a week or two later the husband ceases to pay maintenance. On checking with her legal advisor she may well be told she will have to come back to the court.  Therefore, it is essential that the Minister discuss with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, how best that kind of hardship can be alleviated.</P>
    <P>I hear this evening much repetition of comments made in this House over the years.  I want to deal with one or two.  I totally support the Minister in any action he takes to eliminate abuse because, whether we like it or not, abuse does take place.  However, whenever one throws out a net to catch offenders, innocent victims will always be caught.  I would also appeal to the Minister to redirect any savings effected through the elimination of abuse back into social welfare in order to provide a reasonable income for those unfortunate people in need of it.  I do not think that is happening.  For example, I do not think the £40 million saved last year on the elimination of such abuse was redirected to those in need of social welfare benefits.  I go along with the Minister in any action he takes to eliminate abuse as long as the relevant savings go to the benefit of those in need of them.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that may be worthy of examination and to which I may have referred earlier in this House. Thirty-three thousand young people emigrate annually, some to countries where they are considered to be illegal immigrants, where they take up employment but cannot register for any benefits.  I have often wondered whether they could be accommodated in contributing to our social welfare system while away so that, on their return, they would be entiteld to something from the State.  It is a proposal I have been turning about in my mind for some time.  Perhaps the Minister would seek the advice of his officials as to how we might accommodate those people.  If <Col N="2617" /> they could be included in our social welfare system it would be a worth-while exercise rather than leaving them to return from, say, America, Australia or elsewhere, cap in hand, to the State to help them when they should be legally entitled to some benefits.</P>
    <P>A number of Members commented this evening on our inability to prevent young people leaving their homes.  I have decent parents coming to me complaining that their son or daughter has left home, gone into some type of flat or what might be described as dosshouses in order to ensure they get full unemployment assistance. We should remember that young people need and demand independence. Young people who leave home and the advice and protection of their parents often become involved in the perpetration of the vandalism that abounds, not to mention drugs.  If young persons entitled to the maximum unemployment assistance are refused, they tend to leave home and go where they will receive the maximum benefit.  I have seen examples of young persons receiving meagre amounts of £2.10 because their fathers or mothers may be working.  I appeal to the Minister to examine this problem because anything that can be done in that respect would be to the benefit of our youth, would afford them independence and perhaps prevent them emigrating.  When replying, perhaps the Minister would clarify the point I have raised.</P>
    <P>It is not my wish to come into this House and accuse the Minister of being uncaring or anything of that nature.  I know it is the Minister's desire to meet people's needs.  The Government collectively must accept full responsibility for what is happening in our country today and the poverty that exists.  It is sad to see families living on tinned food, awaiting the weekend for something more substantial.  Believe me, that type of poverty does exist.  I heard a Member of this House, whom I know to be a tremendously dedicated worker, speak this evening, I refer to Deputy Wallace who lives in such an area.  He is witnessing <Col N="2618" /> the type of poverty I am prepared to stand up and say exists in my city and in the country generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare Bill, 1989.  I would like to comment briefly on aspects of the Bill.  There have been many other speakers this afternoon and evening, and I will endeavour not to be repetitious.</P>
      <P>The level of attention, and indeed the priority, given to the entire area of social welfare by the Minister and this Government is without precedent.  Over the past two years, the Minister, Deputy Woods, has addressed himself to the mammoth task of streamlining the system in the specific interest of genuine recipients.  He has striven to reduce, with a view to ultimately eliminating, numerous anomalies in the social welfare sphere.  Simultaneously, he has waged his own brand of war on those who contrive to defraud the system.  The Minister's efforts have been hugely successful in both these aims.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that the Minister has given priority to ensuring that the needs of people who depend on social welfare are adhered to in the most practical way, thus ensuring an improvement in living standards for the less well off and needy sector of our society.  This is merely a continuation of the long standing <i>modus operandi</i> of Fianna Fáil.  While we have heard certain promises and undertakings from other regimes with regard to improving the social welfare system, and correcting anomalies that have existed down throught the years, only Fianna Fáil have consistently prioritised the welfare of the needy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have long lists of firsts in this regard.  Free travel was first introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government in 1967. The free electricity scheme was also introduced in 1967 and the free television licence was introduced in 1968.  Free telephone rental was first introduced by Fianna Fáil in Government in 1978 and the free bottled gas scheme was introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government in 1978.  Again, the national free fuel schemes were introduced by Fianna Fáil <Col N="2619" /> in 1980 and in 1988.  Old age pensioners, for instance have always been treated extremely well by Fianna Fáil in Government. The importance of the well being and dignity of our older citizens has never ceased to be a priority.  Testimony to this is the 25 per cent increase in the old age pension in the period 1980 to 1982 under a Fianna Fáil regime.</P>
    <P>For me one of the most praiseworthy and meritorious aspects of the Minister's policy on social welfare is the significant and positive attention he has given to the plight of the long-term unemployed.  This has resulted in this sector being provided with a cumulative increase of 25 per cent over the past two budgets.  We all know how distressing unemployment can be and how it can adversely affect the individual, the family and dependants.  It is even worse for those who are in this position for a long period of time.  The economic implications and effects on one's dignity causes serious stress.  It is gratifying therefore for these people to realise that someone cares and appreciates their position in very tangible terms &mdash; a 25 per cent increase at a time when the inflation rate is approximately 2 per cent is a very substantial increase in real terms.  In effect, it means that a family consisting of a father, mother and five children, where the breadwinner is long-term unemployed, will receive an income of £145.90 per week, when one includes child benefit.  This represents an increase of £26.80.  This must have the effect of raising morale and making for a happier home life.</P>
    <P>The special emphasis on the needs of the family, particularly the larger family on low income, is a most welcome aspect of the Bill.  In this regard, the payment of the higher rate of child benefit, £21.75 for the fifth and subsequent children, will be of great assistance to larger families. The child benefit payment has come to be regarded as an important contributor to the support of the family, and particularly to the mother because this is a specific allocation to the mother.  The introduction of the child dependant allowance in respect of children up to <Col N="2620" /> age 19 of the long-term social welfare recipients where the child continues in full time education is particularly welcome. I would very much like to see a further extension of the age limit, and indeed the Minister indicated in his speech that he will consider this as the availability of resources permits.</P>
    <P>Among the many anomalies in the social welfare system which this Minister has tackled is the difference in rural and urban rates of unemployment assistance. Heretofore two rates of unemployment assistance have obtained &mdash; one for persons residing in urban areas and another for those in rural Ireland.  People categorised as rural residents received a lower rate than their urban counterparts. This distinction is now being ended and a standard level of payment will obtain throughout the country.  This will result in those in the heretofore rural category receiving an additional £1.20 and £1.30 per week for short-term and long-term claims respectively.  This will be particularly welcome to the people who will benefit in my own neck of the woods, County Wicklow.  I am very pleased to be able to relay this information to them.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána will now be able to avail of occupational injuries insurance on a par with that provided to civil servants. Heretofore a garda had recourse to compensation for malicious injuries but now injuries, other than malicious injuries, received in the course of their official duties will qualify for disability and survivors benefits.  Heretofore this was only available to civil servants and not to the Garda Síochána.  It is gratifying to see that this omission was rectified by appropriate action.</P>
    <P>A very important and welcome element of this Bill is the introduction of a new scheme for widowers and deserted husbands who are left with children to provide for.  Over the years there has been provision for the support of deserted wives.  It is recognised at last that husbands and children can also be deserted.  This is the first time that this recognition has been accompanied by positive action resulting in deserted husbands with dependent children receiving <Col N="2621" /> State support.  The loss of a wife whether by death or otherwise can have a devastating effect on children.  This new social welfare system scheme will give practical help to these people.</P>
    <P>I am particularly enamoured with the Minister's appreciation of and attention to foster parents.  Child care is very topical at the moment.  In certain circumstances fostering can offer much more to the child in need of care than can institutionalisation.  Fostering provides a family environment, a more natural environment than institutional care.  Fostering is also much more cost effective in that it costs only about one third of the cost of keeping a child in an institution. The problem is that the recruitment of people willing to foster is difficult.  Therefore, any measure to ease this difficulty is praiseworthy and is to be welcomed. The Minister, with a view to endeavouring to overcome disincentives in this area, is providing for the exemption of fostering allowances from the assessment of means for social assistance schemes. Section 15 covers this innovation.</P>
    <P>The total to be spent on social welfare in 1989 is £2,600 million.  This comes from the hard working taxpayers so it is imperative that it be effectively and efficiently controlled and distributed.  It should only go to those genuinely entitled to it.  It must not be permitted to be siphoned off by tricksters, defrauders or others who would attempt to lay hands on what is not rightfully theirs.  Since coming to office, the Minister has demonstrated that he is ultra-conscious of fraud in his area of responsibility.  Over the past two years, he has taken positive action to curb fraud.  A variety of measures have been introduced with the express purpose of eliminating fraudulent activity and abuse of the various schemes. I am pleased that in this Bill the Minister is continuing along that road.  Mechanisms have been included to control untoward activities in certain specified industries in which these activities are known to occur.  It is well known that fraud obtains whereby people work and draw a wage while drawing social welfare benefit.  This malpractice must not be <Col N="2622" /> allowed to continue.  Apart from the undue strain it puts on the system, it is grossly undesirable in that it militates against the genuine conscientious employer endeavouring to carry on his business with integrity, providing valuable employment under the law while competing with the illegal or cowboy operator.  In these circumstances, the cowboy has an obvious financial advantage. This must be ended.</P>
    <P>Another important point to highlight is that moneys paid out as a result of fraud do not emanate from a mysterious bottomless supply source.  It comes directly from the taxpayer who is trying to live in a honourable and legitimate fashion.  I have always held that the main thrust of any endeavours to combat abuse should be aimed at the employer, the rogue employer who has so much to gain at the expense of others.  I am particularly pleased that these wrongdoers are being specifically targeted.  I congratulate the Minister on the legislation introduced in this regard which in effect is an escalation of his battle against fraud.  I wish him well in his sterling efforts.</P>
    <P>Another area of abuse now being addressed relates to deserting spouses. This practice has been rampant.  One spouse, usually the husband, leaves the home, and abandons his responsibilities leaving the State to pick up the tab for providing support for the dependants. Once again the genuine taxpayer has to pay the piper.  This Bill provides measures to pursue these deserters and force them to contribute to the support of their dependants.  The State will be in a position to recoup from these people part of the cost of the social welfare moneys paid to their deserted kin.</P>
    <P>This Minister has portrayed an amazing grasp of his subject.  He is totally in touch with the real world and understands precisely what it is like to depend on social welfare benefits.  The Minister does not need to depend on socio-economic reports to know what is going on. He knows the basic needs of the people. That is his strength.  It is what spurs him to provide for that sector for which he has accepted responsibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2623" /> There are many imaginative and innovative aspects to this Bill which is part of the ongoing strategy of this Minister whose plans are to proceed along this road with a view to pinpointing poverty as a target to be reduced and, one would hope, ultimately eliminated so that the under privileged and the needy will be provided for in a progressive way.  All in all this Bill portrays the underlying caring approach of this Government and this Minister to the needy in society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be wrong of anyone to argue that the Minister has not made advances in dealing with the social welfare system or that he has not eliminated some anomalies and introduced certain improvements.  Despite these improvements, however, mainly administrative improvements, the poor remain poor and overall the best that can be said in relation to this Bill and the budget is that the poor will be no worse off.  Doubtless some will be slightly better off.</P>
      <P>The problem of fraud was referred to by Deputy Wyse of the Progressive Democrats and the last speaker from Fianna Fáil praised the Minister's efforts to eliminate fraud.  I do not have any great complaint about that, but the idea of social welfare fraud should be kept in proportion. When you consider that the tax amnesty brought in some £500 million in unpaid taxes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Hugh Byrne gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the incident involving the sinking of a Belgian trawler in the Irish Sea allegedly by a submarine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2624" />
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for giving me permission to raise this vital issue of submarine activity in the Irish Sea.  There is as I have said on many occasions before as much submarine traffic in the Irish Sea as there is vehicular traffic in O'Connell Street.  The loss of the Belgian trawler and the five crew members is the latest in a succession of incidents involving submarines with various seagoing vessels mainly fishing trawlers.  The list is endless, a Cheann Comhairle, but it is necessary at this stage to list them.  It is my intention to go through them in chronological order.</P>
      <P>On 18 April 1982 we had the sinking of the <i>Sheralga</i> by <i>HMS Porpoise</i> with all fishermen on board left to drown.  Britain at first denied that they were involved but when they were flushed out they admitted it.  On 18 April 1982 a fishing vessel, <i>Crimson Dawn</i>, had nets entangled, was towed along by a submarine entangled in the same nets, and the nets, costing £15,000, were eventually lost.  In the summer of 1982 the <i>Galvanor</i> disappeared losing all its crew with the suspicion of interference by submarines.  On 12 January 1983 the <i>Site d'Aleth</i>, a Breton vessel was lost off the Wexford coast with ten crew members drowned and there was clear indication of interference by a submarine.</P>
      <P>In 1983 a yacht was struck by a submarine, believed to be the <i>HMS Opos-sum</i>, off Wexford.  On 3 February 1984 the vessel <i>Jeanne de Lorraine</i> was towed backwards arising from an entanglement with a submarine.  In December 1984 a fishing vessel, the <i>Algrie</i> became entangled with the <i>HMS Spartan</i> off the Cornwall coast.  On 8 April 1984 a fishing vessel became entangled with a submarine off the eastern Irish coast, between Dublin and the Isle of Man &mdash; its nets were cut and it was towed for three miles by the submarine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1984 also a US submarine surfaced in the middle of a fishing fleet which was working from Kilmore Quay off the coast of Wexford, in my own constituency, and thank God there was no accidents.  When those fishermen contacted me they told <Col N="2625" /> me that as soon as the submarine surfaced they left that area for home in absolute fear of their lives.  On 30 July 1984 a submarine was in tow off the Isle of Man leading to a suspicion of a serious submarine accident or incident at sea.  On 11 August 1984 another submarine was seen to be in a tow off the Isle of Man's south coast, again giving rise to speculation about accidents or incidents at sea. It has been confirmed since then that the submarine was the <i>Nathaniel Greene</i>.  She had lost a propeller and was returned under tow to Holy Lock.  That submarine went back into commission and in 1986 she was returned under tow once again to Holy Lock, minus a large section of her bow.  She had lain on the sea bed for three days.  That submarine contained two reactors.  I thank God we did not have a release of radioactivity.  That submarine was eventually towed to the USA where she has since been decommissioned.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank today's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> for the following information. In may 1984 from Portavogie, County Down, the <i>Willing Land</i> and the <i>Family Friend</i> cut their nets to avoid sinking while being towed astern.  In the same month the <i>South Stack</i> disappeared south east of the Isle of Man with all hands lost.  On 20 February 1985 a Scottish fishing vessel the <i>Mhari L</i> disappeared off the Isle of Man with all hands, in good weather and no distress call was made.  A damaged British submarine entered Fastane base 24 hours later.  The Ministry of Defence said that the <i>Mhari L</i> was dragged under by a telephone cable on the seabed.  The relatives of those lost are still investigating that incident and pressing for an inquiry.</P>
    <P>On 18 February 1987 a Northern Ireland boat, <i>Summer Morn</i>, was towed astern for several hours by a US submarine. The submarine surfaced after RAF helicopters were alerted by using a hydrophone.  In fact, the media were invited to see the final goings on in that incident.  On 20 September 1987 four were drowned when the <i>Boy Shaun</i>, a crab fishing boat, was sunk by a &ldquo;freak&rdquo; wave off County Donegal.  A submarine <Col N="2626" /> was later spotted in that area by <i>Irish Press</i> reporters.  On 9 November 1987 there was another incident involving the loss of £20,000 worth of nets off the Isle of Man.  On 16 July 1988 the yacht <i>Drum</i> collided with the <i>HMS Oberon</i> leaving a 20ft. gash above the waterline.  In July 1988 the yacht <i>Dalriada</i> was sunk by the <i>HMS Conqueror</i> off the Northern Ireland coast.  This is the infamous submarine which sunk the <i>Belgrano.</i></P>
    <P>On 5 September 1988 the crab fishing boat <i>Inspire</i>, sank off the Welsh coast when hit by a freak wave.  Submarines on exercises were known to be in the area. Four people were drowned.  On 3 January 1989 an Ayr based trawler was struck near the Clyde by the US submarine <i>Will Rogers</i>.  On 22 January 1989 a Fleetwood trawler the <i>Lau Ann</i> was towed astern by a submarine for three-quarters of an hour off the Mull of Kintyre.  That brings us to the latest incident.  A Belgian trawler, a relatively new trawler, a 1973 beamer 143 tonnes, almost the size of a small coaster, the <i>Tijl Uilenspiegel</i> sank in the Irish Sea. It appears that the <i>Tijl Uilenspiegel</i> was towed under with the loss of all five crew members.  One body and some fish boxes is all that has yet been recovered.</P>
    <P>I have now established from contacts in various locations that a Posoidon class submarine left its British base at Faslane on 3 March.  It was in the area of the accident and returned to base on Monday, 6 March &mdash; three days at sea for a submarine which normally stays at sea for a month.</P>
    <P>The Celtic League in the Isle of Man, under the leadership of Mr. Bernard Moffatt, keep a very close eye on all submarine activity in the Irish Sea.  They know full well that it was an incident involving that particular submarine.  The British Ministry for Defence, as they always do, have denied involvement and claim complete innocence.  We all know from the <i>Sheralga</i> incident that the British denied responsibility in that case but when evidence was produced they were forced to admit they were to blame.  It took some four years for the British Government to recognise and pay Ray <Col N="2627" /> McEvoy, the skipper of that trawler, for his losses.</P>
    <P>I have listed 25 incidents and, of course, there are many more involving innocent fishing trawlers and the furtive movement of British, American, German, Dutch, Russian and French submarines all playing war games in the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>Fifty fishermen have lost their lives in nine years as a result of this activity and the value of property lost has been colossal. The most recent trawler to be lost cost in the region of £1 million.  Despite pleadings by our Government, individuals, fishermen's organisations, the International Maritime Organisation and the Opposition parties in Britain, the British Government continue to ignore the loss of life and to respond with a &ldquo;how dare you ask questions&rdquo; attitude.  The attitude of the British Government, who contribute most to this devastation, baffles me because of their arrogance towards their people, particularly towards their fishermen.  Their arrogance can be clearly seen by the fact that every day they pour one million gallons of nuclear polluted waste into the Irish Sea, a stretch of water regarded as the most filthy and polluted in the world, and a stretch of water lapping their shores as well as ours.  If the British people are prepared to live in their own squalor then so be it, but they cannot and should not impose it on us.</P>
    <P>It is well known that the Irish Sea is used for the shipment of nuclear wastes to Sellafield for reprocessing from as far afield as Japan and other countries where nuclear power is used as a source of energy.  Many ships use the Irish Sea for this purpose, carrying this lethal cargo. God forbid that any of them should collide with a nuclear submarine.  It is unthinkable what the results would be if this happened.  While this may sound alarmist the same might have been said of all accidents, those reported, unreported, and few admitted to, before such accidents occurred.  As I have said, fishermen are operating in fear of their lives because of the record of death and <Col N="2628" /> destruction in the Irish Sea.  That Sea is a well-known fishing ground and as such it should be respected.</P>
    <P>Appeals made by the Celtic League, our Government and fishing organisations to the International Maritime Organisation have had a poor and watery response in that resolutions were passed at that organisation's gathering calling for a cessation of submarine activity in the Irish Sea but unfortunately these amounted to little more than a public relations exercise.  There would appear to be an international conspiracy to cover up all activity and submarine incidents. The question must be posed: are the NATO member countries engaging in coordinated exercises in the Irish Sea?  If that is the case, and I suspect it is, obviously the Russians are keeping a close watching brief.  We are now in the position that the game is being played on our ground but we are not even allowed to see the match.</P>
    <P>Last year was an historic year in that tremendous progress was made towards international peace when President Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev agreed to a scaling-down of nuclear weaponry.  Not alone was there an agreement but there was a physical reduction in Cruise missiles. This move was hailed worldwide as a wonderful step forward by the Super Powers, alleviating considerably the fears of every person on this earth.  The Russians are now pulling their submarines from the Irish Sea for economic reasons but they are also taking another step forward in the peace process.  I ask the Minister to call on the British Government and the Government of the USA to reciprocate by closing their bases at Faslane and Holy Lock and rid us on this side of the Irish Sea of this terrible menace against which we are helpless.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to have the accident which occurred last Sunday night followed up to establish what precisely happened, who was involved and how and why it happened.  We must remember it might have been five Irish fishermen who lost their lives.  I ask the Minister to make contact immediately with the offending nations to ensure that the Irish <Col N="2629" /> Sea is as it should be &mdash; free from the furtive activity of submarines whose orders are to &ldquo;steam on regardless&rdquo;.  It is time to call a stop.  Again, I appeal to the Minister, now armed with a litany of death, destruction and fear, to demand a response from Britain, the USA, the USSR, France, the Netherlands and Germany. It may be a tall order but our concern must be for our fishermen and our people.</P>

      <P>The incident to which Deputy Byrne has referred involved the Belgian registered trawler <i>Tijl Uilenspiegel</i> which sank in the Iris Sea on Sunday night.  As the Deputy correctly said, the vessel involved which was built in 1972 was 143 tonnes and 30.7 metres in length.  While it is difficult to be absolutely precise, the incident is thought to have taken place 35 miles west of the United Kingdom and 20 miles south-west of the Isle of Man at the approximate co-ordinates 54 degrees north and 4 degrees west.  The incident thus took place outside Irish territorial waters.  Some debris from the vessel was found floating in the area and, as Deputy Byrne said, one body has been found and four are still missing.  The incident occurred in the UK area of responsibility for search and rescue.</P>
      <P>There is no information available to the Government that would suggest that the sinking of the trawler was caused by a submarine.  Until the exact cause of the sinking of the vessel can be fully and accurately determined, suggestions that its sinking may have been caused by a submarine must be regarded as speculative. It will be a matter for the Belgian authorities to undertake the necessary investigations regarding the incident as the vessel involved was Belgian registered. The Irish Government deeply regret the loss of life involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the sinking took place in the Irish Sea Deputy Byrne will have noted that it occurred outside Irish territorial waters which extend to 12 miles off our coast.  The location of the incident and the fact that the vessel involved was not <Col N="2630" /> of Irish registration means that there is no direct involvement or role for the Irish Government in this case.  We will, however, be keeping a watching brief.</P>
    <P>It is important to state that while Deputy Byrne has listed a very long number of incidents in relation to submarines, it is known that to date there have been only two confirmed incidents involving submarines and Irish registered vessels.</P>
    <P>The Government are of course, conscious of submarine activity in the Irish Sea and elsewhere off our coasts and of the potential hazards this traffic gives rise to.  As Deputy Byrne is, no doubt, already aware because of his very long interest in this problem, the Government's concerns about safety of fishing trawlers in these circumstances have already been brought to the attention of all parties concerned, through the channels of the International Maritime Organisation, which the Government consider is the most appropriate and effective means of pursuing the matter. Ireland sponsored a resolution at the IMO aimed at focussing attention on the problems posed to fishermen by submarine traffic.  The initiative resulted in the unanimous adoption on 17 November 1987 by the General Assembly of the IMO of a resolution entitled &ldquo;Avoidance by Submerged Submarines of Fishing Vessels and Their Fishing Gear&rdquo;.  It is our hope that this resolution will make a significant contribution to the avoidance of incidents involving surface vessels and submerged submarines at sea.</P>
    <P>While under international law, submarines exercising the right of innocent passage travelling through the territorial seas must remain on the surface and show identification, under international law, all nations have free access to the international waters beyond the territorial sea and submarines may remain submerged in these waters.  Like Deputy Byrne, I also should like to see submarines leaving the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will recall that in the course of his address to the Third Special Session on Disarmament in New York in <Col N="2631" /> June 1988 the Taoiseach used the opportunity to voice his concern about the dangers posed by nuclear submarines.  He referred to nuclear submarine traffic in busy coastal shipping and fishing zones. Such as the Irish Sea, and emphasised that this was a matter of considerable concern to Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2632" /> Let me assure Deputy Byrne that the Government will continue to pursue all opportunities to draw attention to the hazards to vessels from submarine activity and, in general, to enhance the safety of vessels at sea.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 8 March 1989.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that greater competition and the operation of the market offer the most satisfactory means of ensuring fair price levels throughout the economy.  The Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987, has improved the implementation of competition policy by strengthening the agencies involved and extending the scope of their activities.</P>
      <P>The Act has brought together enforcement functions under the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the reference to higher prices here than in the UK, I would refer the Deputy to the report by the Restrictive Practices Commission into alleged differences in retail grocery prices between here and <Col N="2402" /> the UK which was published in January 1988.</P>
    <P>The chairman, in his report, found that most of the price differences were accounted for by differences in taxes, movements in currency rates and by monetary compensatory amounts (MCA) on certain products.  When these factors were excluded, the differences shown by the surveys were comparatively small &mdash; generally from less than 2 per cent to about 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence available to me which suggests that prices of British products sold here are increasing at a higher rate than in the UK.</P>

      <P>I understand the cable licensee has been ready to begin cabling Ennis since last September, and at that time the area was canvassed for subscribers. However, because of the extensive availability of illegal rebroadcasting signals in the town, the response to the canvass was very poor and furthermore there was an unprecedented number of people unwiling to allow the cable to cross their property. The cable licensee has indicated his readiness to proceed immediately with the installation of the cable system as soon as the illegal rebroadcasting system is closed down.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>At a meeting in Rome in December 1975 the European Council decided that Community Ministers of the Interior and Ministers for Justice should meet to discuss matters arising in the field of their responsibilities, in particular matters relating to law and order.  The first such meeting took place on 29 June 1976 at which Ministers affirmed their common will to strengthen co-operation in the fight against organised international crime and terrorism.  Ministerial meetings have continued to be held at regular intervals since then and successive Irish Ministers for Justice have participated in them.  In addition meetings involving police officials and officials of the Ministries of the Interior and/or Justice are held to discuss different aspects of the matters with which the TREVI organisation is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both through the TREVI network and through Interpol, the Garda Síochána cooperate with other police forces in combating international crime and terrorism, and this includes, where appropriate, the exchange of information that may be of assistance.  Exchanges of this nature take <Col N="2411" /> place on a bi-lateral or multi-lateral basis, as necessary.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that the local divisional officer is aware of a recent spate of crime affecting an area of the Mayorstone Garda sub-district and that measures are being taken to deal with it.  The Mayorstone sub-district receives attention from patrols operated from Mayorstone, Henry Street and Mary Street stations and the Divisional Officer is currently reviewing the deployment of these patrols in order to provide an improved police service to the area which is of particular concern at present.  The Garda authorities welcome the proposal by residents of the area in question to form a neighbourhood watch scheme and assure them of full Garda support for their efforts.</P>

      <P>Recruitment to the Prison Service is by way of open competition conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners.  Forty-one prison officers have been appointed this year from panels of qualified persons established from the last recruitment competition and a further small number of staff are expected to be appointed in this way.  However, it will be necessary for the Civil Service Commissioners to hold a new competition to enable further posts to be filled.  I understand that advertisements for posts, in the prison officer grade, will appear in the national daily newspapers on 8 March 1989.  Persons who wish to apply for this competition should contact the Civil Service Commission, 1 Lower Grand Canal Street, Dublin 2, from whom application forms will be available.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he will consider the introduction of <i>pro rata</i> pensions for those who do not qualify for an old age contributory pension because they have not started paying social insurance for the first time before reaching the age of 56.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The requirement under the old age contributory pension scheme that a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age in order to be eligible for pension has applied to this scheme since it was introduced in 1961.  The purpose is to ensure that a reasonable period of social insurance coverage has been completed before entitlement to the old age pension is acquired.</P>
      <P>The possibility of modifying the conditions governing entitlement to old age contributory pension to enable persons over age 56 to qualify for this pension was examined in detail by my Department when social insurance was being extended to the self-employed.  Following consideration of a number of possible options, including that of paying <i>pro rata</i> pensions to those affected, it was considered that the net cost of such arrangement would be prohibitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing contribution conditions for entitlement to pensions under the <Col N="2424" /> social insurance system are being examined at present by the National Pensions Board and the general question of whether provision should be made for the award of <i>pro rata</i> pensions is one of the issues being studied.  The final report of the board is expected to be completed by the end of the year and I will be giving full consideration to their recommendations on this and other issues at that time.</P>

      <P>The legislation referred to by the Deputy provides that every person who is liable to maintain a recipient of supplementary welfare allowance shall be liable to contribute to the health board according to his ability towards any allowance granted.  The following information was obtained from the health boards:</P>
      <P>Eastern Health Board</P>
      <P>Sums totalling £3,490 and £3,575 were recovered from persons liable to maintain in 1987 and 1988 respectively.  Two court orders were made in favour of the board in 1988 following application to the District Court.  The amounts recovered in each of these were £180 and £110.  In both cases recovery is ongoing at the rate of £5 per week.  Information is not available up to 1987.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of the long-term rate of unemployment assistance until 12 March 1987 when he commenced a prison sentence. While he was in prison his wife was in receipt of prisoner's wife's allowance at the weekly rate of £60.10 in respect of herself and one child.  This allowance was <Col N="2427" /> terminated on 11 January 1989 when my Department was informed that the person concerned had completed his sentence. He renewed his claim to unemployment assistance on 18 November 1988 and, because he had broken his claim by more than 20 weeks, he became entitled to the short term rate of unemployment assistance at £74.60 a week. Therefore no financial loss was incurred by the person concerned on his release from prison.</P>
      <P>Unemployment assistance at the long term rate is payable in respect of any day of proved unemployment which forms part of a continuous period of unemployment during which the applicant has received payment for at least 390 days. For the purpose of unemployment assistance, any two periods of unemployment not separated by more than 20 weeks are regarded as a continuous period of unemployment.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions of the national fuel scheme is that to qualify for a fuel allowance a person must be in receipt of the long term rate of unemployment assistance.  As the person concerned is in receipt of the short term rate he is not eligible to receive the fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>Only those unemployment assistance applicants in receipt of the long term rate of payment during the week ending on Thursday 29 November 1988 qualified for the Christmas bonus.  As the person concerned was not in receipt of the long term rate he did not qualify for payment of the Christmas bonus.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals at present to amend the provisions governing the definition of a continuous period of unemployment.</P>

      <P>An oral hearing of the appeal of <Col N="2428" /> the person concerned against the disallowance of disability benefit for the period from 9 February to 21 July 1988 was held on 23 September 1988.  The appeals officer decided that the person concerned was capable of work during this period and thus she was not entitled to payment of benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 21 January 1987 but did not qualify for payment as she did not have the required number of contributions in 1985-86, the contribution year governing her claim.</P>
      <P>From 4 January 1988 the contribution year governing her claim was 1986-87. Based on her insurance record in that year she qualified for payment at the maximum personal rate from 4 January 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a person has less than 260 contributions paid since entry into insurable employment, entitlement to disability benefit is limited to 52 weeks.  According <Col N="2430" /> to the records of the Department the person concerned has only 235 contributions paid on her behalf since entry into insurance.  Payment of benefit was made from 4 January 1988 to 31 December 1988 on which date she had been paid her maximum entitlement of 52 weeks' benefit.</P>
    <P>To requalify for disability benefit it will be necessary for her to have at least a further 13 weeks of insurable employment for which the appropriate contributions are paid.</P>

Where, however, a person who is entitled to a pension from another EC member state is also entitled to a <i>pro rata</i> Irish contributory pension under EC regulations or to an old age (non-contributory) pension on the basis of means, a living alone allowance would be payable by virtue of the fact that an Irish pension is being paid, where the basic conditions for the allowance are fulfilled.</P>

      <P>These discussions were part of the process of consultation between the Government and the EC Commission which has been maintained throughout the preparation of Ireland's regional development plan.  This process which enables the Government to ascertain and take account of the views of the Commission has been most valuable to the Government in their work on the plan.</P>

If the taxpayer remains unemployed, he may submit further claims for repayment of tax deducted in the current year.</P>

      <P>There is no policy to concentrate the <Col N="2433" /> Office of the Revenue Commissioners on the south side of Dublin.  Where a need for accommodation arises, all suitable office space available within the State's existing stock or on the market is objectively considered, irrespective of where it is situated.  There is no bias in favour of any particular area.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a number of Revenue staff from Teach Earlsfort have been transferred to Earl Court, Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin 2.  Earl Court forms part of the State's existing stock of office accommodation, whereas the space in Parnell House, Parnell Square would involve a new lease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 97 to 103, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Companies whose financial problems are related to poor management may be assisted by a number of State agencies, such as the Industrial Development Authority, SFADCo, FÁS, Córas Tráchtála Teoranta and the Irish Productivity Centre which all supply management training and advice, whether a firm is in financial difficulty or not.  In addition, the Irish Management Institute, which receives substantial State assistance, also provides management consultancy services, and management training courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only manufacturing companies are affected by the decision to wind-up Fóir Teoranta.  Such companies experiencing financial difficulty may approach other financial institutions or seek equity finance with a view to having their financial requirements met.  The business expansion scheme may be of assistance to firms in this situation.  NADCorp, or the private sector venture capital companies, may also be in a position to provide equity finance to suitable firms.  The Industrial Development Authority has power to <Col N="2435" /> provide, in the interests of promoting the restructuring of Irish industry, financial assistance where an industrial concern is being merged with or acquired by another industrial concern.  There is, of course, a range of State services, which includes the provision of financial advice, for industrial firms generally.</P>
    <P>There are 30 companies at present being assisted by Fóir Teoranta by way of management assistance.  This assistance is generally of a part-time nature.</P>
    <P>Suitable arrangements will be applied for the collection of debts due to Fóir Teoranta after the company has been wound up, and for the ongoing administration of Fóir's portfolio of loans and equity holdings.  The detailed arrangements have still to be worked out.  The Department of Finance will not be directly responsible for collecting debts due to Fóir Teoranta or for the administration of its portfolio.</P>
    <P>The records of the company are not kept in such a way as to supply the information in the way sought.  The amounts of money due to Fóir Teoranta were as follows on the dates indicated below:</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the present position regarding the proposed management plan for Killarney National Park, County Kerry; whether provision will be made for recreational activities including the provision of playing pitches within this national park; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Work on the management plan for Killarney National Park is well advanced and I hope that the document will be published within a year.  The question of provisions for recreational activities will be covered in the plan but it is too early to make a detailed statement on particular aspects of it such as the provision of playing pitches.  I should say, however, that it is an objective of the Killarney Urban District Council Development Plan to facilitate the provision of playing pitches in their area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Funding for arterial drainage works is provided in the Vote for the Office of Public Works.  Although the Brown Flesk River is situated in the River Maine catchment area, it was excluded, on economic grounds, from the Maine catchment drainage scheme carried out by the Commissioners of Public Works between 1959 and 1963.  The Commissioners' responsibilities in the catchment area are now statutorily confined to the maintenance of the completed scheme works and they have no plans to undertake works on the Brown Flesk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to a reported decision by Eolas to suspend testing of certain furniture products; the fact that public service offices and Government Departments will not purchase furniture products unless they have certificates of adequacy in a variety of respects; to the fact that advice was given to Irish manufacturers that in future they would have to seek such a certificate in England; and if he will ensure that the services of Eolas in this respect are continued in order to ensure that Irish manufacturers can have independent verification of standards, without having to go outside the country, particularly in the context of the approach to 1992 where the certification of Irish products abroad would leave Irish industry very vulnerable.</P>

      <P>While I have no direct <Col N="2444" /> function in the day-to-day activities of Eolas such as the allocation of its staff and resources, I understand that that agency have decided to close down the furniture testing service.</P>
      <P>There are now over 1,000 standards in the catalogue of the National Standards Authority of Ireland and this number is expected to increase substantially over the next few years.</P>
      <P>It would not be possible for Eolas itself to provide the testing services for all of these.  Nevertheless, it is a function of Eolas to arrange to have alternative testing carried out in situations where it does not have in-house testing facilities.</P>
      <P>I am assured by the agency that arrangements will be made to have any products, including furniture, submitted to it tested to the relevant standard. These arrangements which might in certain circumstances entail testing abroad, should provide for the certification needs of Irish producers generally including suppliers of furniture to public service entities.</P>

      <P>As is clear from that reply, no decision has been taken by the Cablelink shareholders to sell the company and the action taken to date has, therefore, only the status of a market testing exercise.  As such, I have no function in the matter and will not have, unless or until a proposal to transfer the Cablelink licence actually arises.  Nevertheless in the context of the market testing exercise, Telecom Éireann have, as a matter of courtesy, informed me of their intention to make a bid for the company.  At this point in time there is, of course, no competition between Telecom Éireann and Cablelink whose business are quite separate and, accordingly, the question of reducing competition does not arise.</P>

    <P>Neither AnCO nor the Youth Employment Agency have as yet submitted annual reports and accounts for 1987. <Col N="2459" /> Both these bodies are now part of FÁS. In the case of the YEA the delay is due to the fact that the liquidator is still winding up the agency's affairs.  Until this process is finalised audited accounts will not be available.  As regards AnCO, the delay is due to the fact that the accounts for 1987 have not been finally audited. Both the Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal are funded out of the Department of Labour Vote.  Annual accounts are therefore not required.</P>

      <P>Prior to 1986, health boards placed their recruitment advertisements on an individual basis, using various agencies and newspapers.  Realising that considerable savings could be made by adopting a unified approach, they asked the main advertising agencies to submit presentations/tenders and finally selected an agency whose main strategy was to confine advertising to one newspaper group.</P>
      <P>I understand that the anticipated savings have been realised to the amount of 40 per cent approximately and the system, which is working well, has drawn no adverse criticism from groups representing health staff interests.</P>

It was never envisaged that the routine supply of replacement batteries would form part of the hearing aid service, although such a practice developed in a number of health boards. Due to the high administrative cost of supplying these relatively low cost batteries, some of these health boards have now discontinued the practice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under my Department's schemes of assistance to sport, from the national lottery funds, grants are made available to vocational education committees to assist in the promotion of youth and sport activities at local level.  These committees in turn, allocate grants to voluntary youth and sport clubs in their administrative areas to assist towards the cost of equipment, training, administration and the organisation of special projects.  Clubs in the Dublin 9 and 11 areas have benefited from the grants made available to the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  A special fund exists in my Department for the development of special services to disadvantaged young people.  Grants from this fund are allocated in support of local and national initiatives through national youth organisations, vocational education committees or other approved agencies, on the basis of recommendations made by an inter departmental committee which was set up for this purpose.  I would refer the Deputy to the national lottery beneficiary compendium which gives all the <Col N="2465" /> grant allocations under the aforementioned fund in 1988.</P>
    <P>No allocations have yet been made from this fund in 1989 as no decision has been announced as to the extent of the budget for youth affairs for this year.</P>
