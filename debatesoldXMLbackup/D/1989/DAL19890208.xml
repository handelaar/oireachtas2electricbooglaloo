On a number of occasions the Taoiseach has promised that this matter would be discussed through the Whips but my information is that these discussions from the Government side have been, to say the least, desultory and no serious intention has been displayed to bring forward the debate.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1686" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. Before the Adjournment, I was saying that the Minister, in dealing with the extended powers that he gives himself and the Central Bank in relation to the functioning of building societies as encompassed within the framework of this Bill might usefully apply himself to ensuring that building societies at least introduce an element of consistency into the demands they place on depositors who are applicants for building society loans.  In the past we have seen wide fluctuations in demands as requirements of building societies.  It relates very much either to loss of revenue within the building societies or, as currently is the case, the bulging coffers caused by the numbers of people who have availed of redundancy terms, lump sum payments, severance pay and so on and have lodged such money with building societies.  We have seen on the one hand, for a period of time a requirement of £1,000 for a minimum period of six months.  On the other occasions, the applicant for a mortgage must have £2,000 deposited for a period of a year.  This has put house building and loan qualifications outside the scope of many a depositor and many a mortgage at a particular time.  I urge the Minister to use his powers to ensure consistency in relation to such requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, in regard to the very expensive cost of bridging, this is an area to which the Minister might usefully apply his powers.  Part III of the Bill extends the range of services and powers of building societies.  It gives them the power to hold and develop land.  Like many Members of this House, I would much prefer if it were possible to restrict the activities of building societies to the building of houses only.  However, being realistic in view of the increased competitiveness, the need to expand and develop and particularly the onset of 1992, it is of vital importance that building societies <Col N="1687" /> be enabled to develop, to become more competitive and play a much fuller role in the area of financial services.</P>
    <P>The societies' powers to invest in and acquire shares in bodies corporate, is again an extension of their powers to provide general financial services as done by the banks.  This puts them on an equal footing with the other financial institutions, particularly with the associated banks.  Conveyancing services, auctioneering services and operating outside the State greatly extend the role, the value and, indeed, the image of the building societies.</P>
    <P>I should like to put a general query to the Minister in relation to one or two other aspects.  One relates to the desirability of allowing building societies to diversify into some of these areas, bearing in mind that in many cases they have no particular expertise in such areas, having regard to the experience in the United States with the collapse of the American Saving and Loan Corporation. I would query the effectiveness of section 35 of the Bill under which building societies can offer a housing loan subject to a condition that the person utilises the new additional services such as conveyancing provided by the society. Does that provide the consumer with the necessary protection?  Is it not luring and cajoling the consumer into using building society services in circumstances where he or she would be better off obtaining and would prefer to obtain independent advice?</P>
    <P>Like many Members of the House, I have major reservations about a tiered loan system.  As already indicated by our spokesman on the environment, we shall be looking at the possibility of putting down some amendments on Committee Stage in this regard.</P>
    <P>In relation to the control and supervision of building societies by the Central Bank, section 38 deals with this matter. It is of some concern that it appears to envisage ministerial interference with Central Bank controls.</P>
    <P>By and large this is a good Bill which <Col N="1688" /> addresses the reality of modern competition and the need to reinvigorate and revamp the building societies in anticipation of increased competition as deregulation is introduced and protective barriers are dismantled in the approach to 1992.  The Bill is unclear as to who will benefit from the conversion of a building society to a plc.  The Minister might clarify that point.  We endorse the Bill, the thrust of which is good.  We will be putting forward a number of considered amendments of Committee Stage which we hope the Minister will accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this comprehensive and coherent Bill which will allow building societies to build on their past success.  The Bill will achieve a good balance between supervision and the commercial freedom of all interested parties, between the societies and their members, between the rights of investors and borrowers.  It will also give a better deal to the house purchaser, to the building society investor and to various customers of these financial institutions.  It can bring benefits to the housing area and the construction industry and I hope it will stimulate urban renewal.  It is a progressive move in the development of the building society movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past ten years more than six out of every ten people who have financed the purchase of their own home have done so by means of a loan from a building society.  Membership of these societies is now approximately 1.25 million, while the total assets of the societies are in excess of £3.5 billion.  They hold almost 20 per cent of the total accumulated savings in the country.  In 1976 total assets of the building societies were in the region of £350 million, scarcely one tenth of today's figure.  While total assets have grown, the number of societies has declined from 17 in 1960 to ten today. Clearly building societies have grown in tandem with the rapid increase in the rate of home ownership.  The existence of a healthy building society movement has been a major contributory factor to our having one of the highest rates of owner occupation in Europe.  The present scale <Col N="1689" /> of the operations of the societies is a measure of the confidence which the investing public and house purchasers have come to place in building societies.</P>
    <P>In 1987 the dismal condition of the national economy had driven mortgage rates up by three percentage points. Other countries had been modernising their legislation in regard to building societies.  At that time the societies were feeling the effects of the termination of beneficial composite tax rates on investments and the introduction of the DIRT tax.  The banks were for the first time offering aggressive competition in the contracting mortgage market.  Other challengers have loomed much larger &mdash; continuing and rapid changes in the financial services sector, new technology and the imminence of competition from abroad in the EC internal market.</P>
    <P>One of the first decisions taken by this Minister was to set up a working party involving the Government, the Central Bank and the Registrar of Building Societies.  They reviewed the existing legislation and this Bill is the result of their deliberations.  There is a need to remove the legal restrictions on societies by having this Bill passed into law.  Building societies must be allowed to compete more effectively.  There is scope for the societies to become involved in a broader and more direct way in the housing market and in the provision of services associated with it.  Developments abroad, particularly in the EC, make it imperative that all sectors of the Irish financial services industry be in a position not only to defend their home markets but also to avail of the opportunities that will arise in 1992.  A basic prerequisite for the development of societies to deal with these challenges is a modern legislative code.  The main constraint will be their own capacity to broaden and intensify their business without prejudicing the funds of their investors.</P>
    <P>The broad objectives of the Bill are to allow societies to compete and develop in the context of the internal market by offering new services and broadening the scope of their business.  The Bill also seeks to establish a modern and effective <Col N="1690" /> supervisory regime for the societies.  This will mean the replacement of the Registrar of Building Societies by the Central Bank, who will have a bigger input in the workings of the societies.  The Bill is also designed to encourage societies to broaden the extent of their involvement in housing and to provide a satisfactory mechanism for conversion to company status.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to 1992.  On 24 January 1985 the EC Commission adopted a proposal for a Council directive on the freedom of establishment and the free supply of services in the field of mortgate credit.  This was submitted to the Council on 28 January.  Following consideration by the European Parliament and the economic and social committee of that parliament and in the light of the recommendations made by these bodies, the Commission adopted an amended proposal in May 1987, which was submitted to the Council on 27 May.  The proposal covers freedom of establishment, that is the right to establish a branch in another member state, and the freedom to provide services, that is the right to provide mortgage credit in a member state without establishing a branch there.  The proposal is under examination at working party level in the Council.  Progress has been slow so far, with many different viewpoints remaining to be reconciled.  An amendment of the Commission's draft can be anticipated within the next few months.</P>
    <P>Mortgage credit institutions already enjoy a right of establishment and to some extent a right to provide services by virtue of Articles 52 and 59 of the Treaty.  These are legally enforceable by those institutions by virtue of the Treaty's provisions alone.  However, the institutions which the Commission's present proposal is designed to benefit already come within some of the Council's directives. Directive 77/780 stipulates the minimum requirements for the authorisation to credit institutions in a member state and provides for the supervision to be exercised by the appropriate authority in that member state where the business is being carried out.  National <Col N="1691" /> laws may not discriminate on the grounds of nationality.  Nationals of other member states can establish a building society in Ireland by complying with the provisions of the Building Societies Act, 1976.</P>
    <P>However, there is a wide difference between the methods of funding and lending employed by mortgage credit institutions throughout the EC member states and between national laws governing these institutions.  The main beneficiary of the 1977 Directive has been the credit institutions which are engaged in general commercial banking while institutions specialising in mortgage credit have been confined to their national markets.  Hence, according to the Commission, a need for a new directive arises.</P>
    <P>The making of loans on security of a mortgage or property is common in all national systems but there is a wide variation between the savings and lending techniques employed in these systems.  In Ireland and the United Kingdom building societies accept short term deposits at market rates and lend long term, also at market rates.  In other countries, for example in the Federal Republic of Germany, a borrower from the bank may qualify for a loan but he must first save a substantial proportion of the sum required at a rate of interest below the market rate.  The interest on the mortgage eventually granted by that institution to the individual is also below the market rate.  Moreover, the provision in Irish and British building society mortgages, that the rate of interest is variable at the discretion of the building society, would be illegal under some of the continental systems.</P>
    <P>In the area of mortgage credit the EC Commission has rejected harmonisation as being impracticable and commentators have accepted that it would be an enormous task, if indeed possible.  The Commission has adopted for the mutual recognition of the financial technique operated in different member states so that if the proposed directive is adopted <Col N="1692" /> mortgage credit institutions will be free to operate throughout the Community in the same manner as they do at present in their home countries.</P>
    <P>The question of exchange control also arises.  Effectively the objective of the proposed directive will not be achieved unless obstacles presented by exchange control restrictions are removed in member states, such as Ireland, where those restrictions still exist.  This problem has not been addressed in the present proposal but the Commission has indicated its intention to propose a new directive which will liberalise those capital movements and which are related to the operations mentioned in the present EC draft directive.</P>
    <P>The credit institutions covered by the proposed directive are those which raise finance by taking deposits from the public or by issuing mortgages or other bonds or securities and which grant loans secured by mortgage for the purpose of acquiring or retaining property rights in building land or in existing or projected buildings.  The amended proposal makes it clear that the directive will apply not only to specialised institutions such as building societies but also to institutions such as licensed banks whose activities consist, in part, of the foregoing activities. The Commission also stated that the activities covered by those constitute essentially the granting of mortgage credit for the purpose of building or acquiring residential property but they also cover commercial properties.</P>
    <P>The key provision of the directive will enable credit institutions to operate mortgage credit business in other member states in accordance with the funding and lending techniques authorised in their home member states.  The home and host member states will be obliged to amend or adapt their national laws to whatever extent may be necessary to secure these objectives.  In this process the existing rights of institutions are not to be restricted and where the introduction of new techniques affects the competitive position of home institutions, they may be permitted to adopt these new techniques.  However, by way <Col N="1693" /> of exception to the general rule and pending further consideration, the host member state may require the issue of bonds in its own territory to be subject to its own laws.</P>
    <P>All branches of mortgage credit institutions whose head offices are in member states will, under the proposed directive, be under the supervision of the competent authority of the host member state and after this Bill is passed it will be the Central Bank in Ireland.  This is in accordance with the national laws of the host country but close co-operation with the supervisory authority of the home member state will also be required.  The credit institution which proposes to transact business in another member state must notify the supervisory authority in its own State indicating the type of business proposed and the conditions under which funds will be raised and loans granted.  Unless it has doubts as to the financial soundness of the institution, the supervisory authority will send the information to its counterpart in the host member state but a refusal to forward the information will suspend the institution's right to provide the proposed services. Supervision will be carried out by the home country supervisor in consultation with its counterpart in the host country. There will be a greater emphasis on the role of the former supervisory authority in so far as supply of services is concerned.</P>
    <P>The commercial implications of this directive are worth noting.  If the directive is adopted in its present format it may provide an opportunity for house buyers in this country to borrow foreign currency in ECUs at attractive interest rates from continental institutions. However, exchange rate risks would be likely to be an inhibiting factor for most borrowers.  Moreover, it is not anticipated that continental institutions are likely to be attracted by the relatively small Irish market.  Many of them would find it difficult to compete if they had to adhere rigidly to the techniques employed here.  It seems more likely that large British institutions might, from <Col N="1694" /> their home base, seek to provide mortgage credit facilities here.  It is thought that such competition could create considerable problems for Irish institutions, building societies and banks.</P>
    <P>The flexible techniques employed by Irish building societies could prove attractive on the European market provided, of course, that they are free to operate there as they do at home.  Of course, they would have to develop the expertise to market their products, raise funds at competitive rates and minimise exchange risks exposure.  They may well find it more attractive, at least in the short term, to seek entry to the British market if the proposed directive is adopted.</P>
    <P>Irish banks already enjoy under EC law the right to establish branches in other member states in order to transact banking business, including mortgage credit, and foreign EC banks enjoy a corresponding right here.  Banks, therefore, will be affected only to the extent that the freedom to provide services without establishing a local branch here is extended.</P>
    <P>A new banking directive is proposed by the Commission and this will radically alter the position of the banks.  The whole question of a supervisory authority is dealt with at great length in the Bill and the concept of the authorisation is now, to a large extent and in so far as societies are concerned, taken out of the hands of the register and put into the hands of the Central Bank.  Under the new arrangements a society will be required to obtain the authorisation from the Central Bank before it can raise or solicit funds other than from its founding capital.  The Central Bank will be able to impose whatever conditions it considers necessary on an authorisation which will correspond to a banking licence.  The proposed approach brings the procedure for authorising societies to raise funds into line with the requirements of the first EC banking directive.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill sets out the powers of the building societies.  As well as restating existing proposals it contains extensive and important new powers which will enable societies to compete much more <Col N="1695" /> effectively in the marketplace.  It will give them the chance to offer a better range of services to their members, house purchasers and the general public.  These new powers will enable societies to develop and thrive in the rapidly changing financial services sector, and thus continue to be a major source of funding for housing through the provision of mortgage loans and direct investment in residential property.  In addition to traditional lending secured by the mortgage of land, societies will be able to offer loans on second mortgage, bridging loans, loans for payment of deposit for the purchase of property and loans backed by other securities or guarantees as may be approved by the Central Bank. These provisions will also allow the building societies to offer more flexible types of house purchase mortgage, such as low start, index linked and equity type mortgages. This Bill will enable building societies to set up subsidiary companies or to take a stake in the equity of other companies.  It will probably transpire that the best way to provide some of the proposed new services will be in the form of a partnership with an existing company or to set up a subsidiary of the society in question.  It should be noted that the power to invest in companies is generally limited to the companies whose objects do not allow them to engage in activities outside of the powers of the society.  This Bill will also permit societies to link up with and assist voluntary housing bodies. This is a very positive part of this legislation. The societies will also be able to offer a wide range of financial services to their members and to other persons, and to offer a range of services relating to the acquisition, development and disposal of land.  This is a natural progression from the existing powers of societies based on their long experience in the housing sector.  It is important that we should build on the experience the building societies have had in this area.</P>
    <P>This Bill will enable them to provide conveyancing services subject to regulations to be made by the Minister for Justice.  This is a new departure and I <Col N="1696" /> compliment the Minister for bringing this proposal forward.  The Minister has stated that he will be very careful about this provision and that the Minister for Justice will be brought into the discussions on this matter.</P>
    <P>This Bill will allow building societies to provide auctioneering and other services relating to property, such as valuation, surveying and management.  Thus societies will be able to offer a package of services to the home buyer.  The Bill has potential for conflicts of interests in these areas, and the need to prevent building societies from taking undue advantage of their position in the housing market must be of prime consideration for the Minister. He has acknowledged that fact.  This is an area that will need to be monitored very carefully.  The Bill contains a number of provisions aimed at avoiding these problems.  In the case of conveyancing services, the provision of such services to both the vendor and the purchaser of the same property is prohibited, thus removing the greatest potential source of conflict of interests.</P>
    <P>The regulations which have to be made before societies can offer conveyancing services will be able to make further provision in relation to conflict of interests, compensation for negligence, qualifications of persons providing these services, and so on.  Similar regulations can be made in relation to other property related services if this is shown to be necessary.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made in this Bill to allow societies to operate abroad.  Even with this power a building society incorporated and authorised in Ireland could not under the present legal position, set up, for example, in the UK on the same basis whereas UK societies can set up subsidiary companies here without the authorisation of the Bank of England. However, with the implementation of the proposed EC second banking directive and mortgage credit directives, which I have already referred to, all this will change and the Irish building societies will be able to operate throughout the Community under the supervision of the home supervisor, the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1697" /> There are disciplines in relation to the exercise of these powers.  Basically all powers other than those relating to secured lending, must be adopted by special resolution and must have Central Bank approval.  We must bear in mind that the diversification of societies into these new activities would involve new and different kinds of risk and raise prudential issues.  Accordingly, the Central Bank will have wide powers to control the investment of societies in the provision of new services and to impose whatever conditions and requirements it considers appropriate.  The Central Bank will be able to require societies to maintain specific ratios, and to impose requirements relating to the structure and composition of liabilities and assets, for example, liquidity requirements.  It will also be able to revoke a society's authorisation in certain serious circumstances and to give direction to a society to suspend for a specific period the raising of funds or the making of payments.</P>
    <P>Section 40 of this Bill outlines in considerable detail the circumstances in which the Central Bank may either revoke an authorisation or suspend the operation of a building society.  The Central Bank will also have wide powers to carry out an inspection of a society's books and records, to obtain information relating to the activities of the society, to control the form and content of advertising by building societies and to call a special meeting to mount a formal investigation of a society's affairs.  These are very wide ranging and detailed powers which the Central Bank as the regulatory body will have and the Minister is to be commended for giving the Central Bank these powers.  The powers available to the Central Bank will be more extensive and flexible than those currently available to the registrar.  It is important that they should have this extension of power.</P>
    <P>It is in line with the completion of the internal market by 1992 that there be a common market in mortgage credit.  In the area of mortgage credit for house purchase, there is a need for adequate supervision of the institutions involved in providing that credit so as to ensure the <Col N="1698" /> financial stability of those institutions and the protection of the customers of those institutions.  Under the régime proposed by the EC Commission, institutions operating various techniques will be exposed to exchange rate risks and foreign financial systems of which they may have little experience.  In my view, the supervision of the activities of these institutions should at least, in the first instance, rest solely with the host country.  The supervisory authority of the host country should be entitled to satisfy itself regarding any mortgage credit institution seeking to establish or provide services in the host country.  The commencement of such activities should be subject to the prior authorisation of the supervisory authority of the host member state which should also have the right to exercise supervision over these activities as long as they are carried out in the host country.</P>
    <P>What constitutes a financial technique needs to be clarified.  Article 10 of the draft directive before the Commission at present, enables a host member state, after certain preliminary stages to determine the provision of services by a mortgage credit institution which does not comply with local legal requirements.  If the proposals for supervision are left unchanged it seems essential to know where the line is to be drawn between the provision of services through an intermediary and the exercise of the right of establishment.  The Joint Committee on secondary legislation have been informed that for the purposes of the Council's working party the definition of mortgage credit being used is confined to loans secured on residential property. However, the definition of mortgage credit clearly indicates mortgages on commercial property.  Presumably this type of business would be of more interest to the banks than to building societies.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for bringing this Bill forward in such style.  The working party set up by the Government did a fine job and this legislation is in everybody's interest.  It brings the building societies into the 20th century.  It is also of great benefit to the customers of building societies be they investors in the societies <Col N="1699" /> or people who have acquired mortgages from them.  I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the Dáil and I hope it will not be too long before it is enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important legislation which replaces the various existing Building Societies Acts and contains a number of new provisions some of which The Workers' Party welcome but some of which we have great reservations about.</P>
      <P>The significance of the role of building societies in Irish society can be seen from the figures quoted in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill which shows that the combined assets of ten building societies operating in this State amounted to £3,500 million at the end of 1987 and they had approximately 165,000 mortgages in operation at the end of the same year.  The vast majority of these would be held by families in respect of their homes, so the provisions of this Bill touch directly on the lives of a great many people.  For very many families the purchase of a house is the single biggest expenditure they will ever incur.  People who take out building society loans are effectively mortgaging their lives for a period sometimes as long as 30 years, so it is essential that borrowers have the maximum possible protection.</P>
      <P>This Bill cannot be considered in isolation from the Government's overall housing policy.  This Government have denied local authorities the money to play a significant role in local authority house building, and we are now regularly hearing claims from Fianna Fáil that the housing crisis is over.  The reality is different. As local authority house building grinds to a halt housing lists are beginning to grow again and tens of thousands of dwellings are substandard.  The Government first of all failed to ensure that local authorities met their statutory obligations to carry out a housing condition survey and then effectively removed the obligations on them to do so at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty in meeting mortgage repayments, largely as a result of long term unemployment, is causing an increased number of repossessions by the <Col N="1700" /> Housing Finance Agency, building societies and local authorities.  Private landlords are still being allowed to charge immorally high rents for what is often substandard accommodation.  Successive Governments have failed to come up with any coherent housing policy but have staggered on from one <i>ad hoc</i> decision to another, prodded on as often as not by the vested interests in the building industry. The close association between certain big builders and whatever Government are in power seems to have more impact on determining national housing policy than the needs of our people.  In this regard we do not want to see the SDA loans system, which as we know has been operated very successfully by the local authorities, being eliminated as at present seems to be the case.  From my experience of the time factor in getting approval it looks as though the finance is not being provided for the SDA loans.</P>
    <P>In the past 30 years the physical face of Ireland has changed almost beyond recognition, with sprawling suburbs to our cities and erratic ribbon development in rural areas.  Despite this we have not had a White Paper on housing for more than 30 years.  As far as The Workers' Party are concerned, the housing crisis is not solved as long as there is a housing need in our society.  According to present criteria for allocating public housing, the crisis may seem to have eased, but thousands of families remain living in poor, overcrowded conditions, and in the private rented sector many endure extortionate rents and substandard facilities.</P>
    <P>The poor law mentality has dominated the approach of successive Governments to public housing.  The belief that the only obligation on local authorities is to house people who cannot afford to house themselves is central to the 1966 Housing Act. It is an excessively narrow approach that seems to have its origins in out-dated, Victorian attitudes rather than in an understanding of the real housing needs in modern society.  Every aspect of our housing policy from allocation systems, loans policy and structures, to housing <Col N="1701" /> design and estate lay-out and management, is dominated by this poor law approach.  The view is outdated and unimaginative and totally incapable of meeting the complexities of the housing needs of modern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Given the political realities of the present system with Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats competing with each other to see who can propose the more extreme cutbacks, it is likely that the reduction in local authority housing will continue, with the result that more and more young families will end up in the clutches of the building societies. Against this background this Bill is more important than ever.</P>
    <P>Theoretically seven out of the ten building societies operating in the State are mutual societies controlled by their members.  The practice, of course, is very different.  They are very big business controlled by a self-perpetuating clique and in living memory no ordinary shareholders have been elected to the board of any building society.  People like Henry Murdoch who sought election to the board of the First National Building Society on a platform of mild reform were met with fierce resistance by the existing board and substantial amounts of money were spent and staffs of the societies used in a most unprincipled way to keep these people off the boards.</P>
    <P>There is a major question mark over the way building societies spend money. Management expenses of the building societies here are consistently higher than in the UK.  They are now well in excess of £40 million per year and management expenses rose from 1.6 per cent of mortgage assets in 1975 to 2.19 per cent in 1984.  One of the greatest costs is in the massive duplication of the fancy offices around the country by the various societies. There is hardly a crossroads in any city or town that does not have at least two building societies staring across at each other.  Building societies are among the biggest advertisers in the country. One society is rumoured to have had an advertisement on RTE television every night since the station was founded.  As there is virtually no real competition <Col N="1702" /> between the societies such a level of advertising can hardly be justified.  There is in some cases an unhealthy overlap between the boards of building societies and the boards of advertising agencies and PR companies with whom the societies deal.</P>
    <P>Huge sums are paid out in fees and expenses to society directors.  The payments made to directors are normally lumped together in one sum in the annual report, and no detailed breakdown is ever given.  I understand that sums between £25,000 and £30,000 would not be unusual.  In the case of non-executive directors this would be simply for attending a couple of board meetings and lunches throughout the year.  The managing director of one society, the Irish Permanent, is reported to be paid more than £250,000 each year.  There should be full disclosure of all amounts paid to all directors, whether by way of fees or expenses.</P>
    <P>While the 1986 Act attempted to address some of the worst excesses of building society abuse, there is still much to be done.  The societies, despite their alleged mutual status, have little respect for the rights of borrowers.  Only recently in the newspapers there was a report of a case in the High Court of one society, the Irish Civil Service Building Society, being ordered to deliver up possession of a County Dublin home which it had improperly repossessed allegedly on the grounds of mortgage arrears.  While the householder was in arrears, evidence was given to the High Court that the society had effected entry to the property while the householder was away, and that he and his family were now prevented from returning to the house.  The householder was only four months in arrears with his repayments at the time.  The same society made £1.2 million in profit last year.</P>
    <P>I hope that this sort of activity will be tackled by the Central Bank who are being given new supervisory powers over the building societies in this Bill.  The decision to give the Central Bank this role is good in principle, but we will have to wait and see how the practice works out.  It has been clear for some time that <Col N="1703" /> given the growth of the building societies that the Registrar of Building Societies did not have the staff or resources to adequately monitor the societies.  The registrar reported as far back as June 1987 that he did not consider that his staffing levels were adequate for the proper performance of his statutory functions.</P>
    <P>The reservation we must have about the move is that the Central Bank have failed totally to exercise any real control over the commercial banks, and have failed to live up to the obligations placed on them by the 1942 Central Bank Act to ensure that they acted in the interests of the community as a whole.  Given the predominance of the representations of private profit in general, and the commercial banks in particular, it has not been clear if the Central Bank have been supervising the commercial banks, or the Commercial Banks supervising the Central Bank.  The claim made by the American economist, Milton Friedman, that regulatory bodies are generally captured by those they seek to regulate has certainly been true of the relationship between the Central Bank and the commercial banks.  This is a matter The Workers' Party will be returning to in some detail when the Central Bank Bill is taken later this week.  All I will say for the moment is that if a number of directors of building societies are now appointed to the board of the Central Bank, the exercise of giving the Central Bank a supervisory role will be largely self defeating.</P>
    <P>One issue, which is of most direct interest to most householders, is not addressed in this Bill, that is the question of interest rates.  This may not seem such a big issue at the moment as interest rates have declined, although why interest should still be running at more than three times the rate of inflation is not clear to me.  The fact is that while successive Governments have been prepared to bring in regulations on this matter, the one area that has remained untouched is interest rates.  Successive Governments <Col N="1704" /> have failed to take any legislative measures which would control interest rates. As far as the parties of the Right are concerned, interest rates are the great untouchable of economic life.  In 1985 and 1986 when interest rates were going through the roof, neither the Government or the Central Bank were prepared to do anything to hold the disastrous trend for tens of thousands of families. So far as the parties of the Right are concerned the money market is to be allowed to do what it likes, irrespective of the consequences for society as a whole. Governments are prepared to take on the poorest and weakest sections of society. Workers' wages must be frozen where necessary and estimates for Health, Social Welfare and Education are cut, but the banks and financial institutions must be allowed a free hand for their anti-social activities.</P>
    <P>Section 31 is to be welcomed.  It gives the Minister for Justice power to make regulations, in consultation with the Minister for the Environment and the Central Bank, enabling societies to provide conveyancing in their own right. Section 58 of the Solicitors Act, 1954 restricts the preparation for reward of certain essential documents in relation to conveyancing to solicitors.  When section 31 is in force it will prove a great help to those who are seeking mortgages.  In this context I should like to refer to the system of providing bridging finance.  Bridging finance in respect of house purchase is an unnecessary evil.  It is payable by a house purchaser in the period between getting loan approval from the lending agency and the receipt of the cheque for the loan. The period involved can vary from six to 12 months, and that is no exaggeration. Loan approval is granted by the lending agency when it is satisfied that the house in question exists, is in sound structural condition, that the applicant for the loan has fulfilled the requirements of the lending agency and has adequate means to repay the loan.</P>
    <P>Bridging loans are provided by the banks where the house purchaser has been approved for the loan but the rate of interest charged on such loans can be <Col N="1705" /> between 5 per cent and 7 per cent greater than the mortgage rate.  Amounts paid on bridging finance are wasted as no capital is repaid and the period of the mortgage, be it 20 years or 30 years, does not commence until the bridging loan is cleared. There is no good reason the period between loan approval and payment of the cheque cannot be reduced and that the lending agency giving loan approval cannot provide bridging finance at ordinary mortgage rates as if the final legal technicalities had been concluded.  The number of cases where there is any risk is minimal.  The Minister should address that question in the interests of those seeking loans and seek to eliminate the need for such loans at very high rates of interest.</P>
    <P>There is a number of other aspects of the Bill that need to be referred to.  We are concerned at the provision which will allow building societies the option of investing directly in residential and other development.  I understand that this is happening and that at least one building society is directly involved in the Custom House Docks area.  If commercial development proves to be financially more attractive to building societies housing will suffer accordingly and young couples will find it more difficult to get loans.</P>
    <P>We are concerned too about the provision to allow societies to convert from mutual status to private limited company status in certain circumstances.  While the current mutual status of most societies is little more than a joke, a complete change of limited company status would make democratic accountability even more difficult to achieve.</P>
    <P>We are particularly concerned at the provisions of section 4 which give the Minister sweeping powers to effectively change the terms of this Bill by regulation. If the Minister is being allowed to have the power to change the Bill by regulation there should be an obligation on him to come back here and seek the approval of the Dáil and the Seanad for such changes.  To do otherwise is to give the Minister a blank cheque to change the Bill as he sees fit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1706" /> The provision to prevent staff members of the building society from putting pressure on members to vote in a certain way in the election of directors is welcome, but does it go far enough?</P>
    <P>This is a very complex Bill and the detailed examination of it will be crucial. On Committee Stage we will be tabling a number of amendments aimed at strengthening the protection available to borrowers and depositors.  The Workers' Party believe that everyone has a fundamental right to a decent standard of housing and until the Government provide sufficient accommodation people will continue to rely on building societies. The private enterprise nature of the business of lending money to people to put a roof over their heads has all the worst elements of moneylending or loan sharking.  It must be properly and fully controlled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which touches on the fundamentals of our society, the right of a person to own his own home.  We have the highest rate of home ownership in Europe and this Bill seeks to underpin that and make it easier for people to own their own homes without having to pay extortionate rates for them.  The original building society concept was that of people coming together in a mutual society for a specific benefit &mdash; to provide housing at reasonable rates for their members.  This mutual aspect has worked very well over the last 100 years but a changing framework in the financial services sector has put building societies at a disadvantage when competing for funds with banks and other financial institutions.  It is very important that building societies in so far as it is possible should be put on an equal footing with other businesses in the financial services field, while not losing sight of the benefits of mutuality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his speech set out six broad objectives which are hard to quibble with but I have a slight reservation about the sixth objective outlined.  The Minister wishes to provide satisfactory mechanisms for conversion of a mutual society to a public or private company. <Col N="1707" /> Changing a mutual society, a society where members' saving are invested for the common good, to company whose purpose is to make profits for its investors, is a very big step.</P>
    <P>Up to now building societies have had more than a fair track record in dealing with members who for one reason or another fall into arrears with mortgage repayments.  That will change radically if the building society becomes a private company based solely on profit without any social dimension to its business.  On Committee Stage the sections dealing with this proposal will be dealt with in greater detail.  We in this House must remember that we are here solely to protect the interests of the ordinary people. These mundane considerations do not impinge too easily on those working in the building society when they are dealing with multi-million pound deals.</P>
    <P>One of the great aspects in this Bill is that it will allow an element of competition into the house purchase marketplace. Anybody who tried to buy a house in the boom years of the sixties and seventies when the building societies alone were in control of home loans will remember how difficult many of them made it for people who were trying to borrow money to buy a house.  Loans were granted but one had to use a particular solicitor and there was bridging finance extending over many months so that many married couples were put to the pin of their collar to survive until the loan came through.  Those days are over now.  One can walk into a bank, put one's case and get a quick answer.  If one is acceptable for loan purposes one gets a letter of intent and on that basis one can go out and buy a house.</P>
    <P>Until the passing of this Bill the only person entitled to make any inquiry into the running of a building society is the Registrar of Friendly Societies who has neither the staff nor the expertise to police the activities of what are now multi-million pound business.  It was only when public spirited individuals stood up and started questioning the way these societies were being run that they <Col N="1708" /> got the full blast of publicity, not all of it to their credit as many of them were being run like private fiefdoms.  The first blast of reality to hit the building societies was when banks and insurance companies started loosening the purse strings and went out looking for the business of the ordinary punter.  I remember one insurance company in the house loan business opening to give house loans on Christmas Eve.  That indicated to me that they were particularly interested in that business.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note the Minister has gone out of his way to protect the ordinary members of building societies in that he has made provision for dealing with directorships of building societies so that dealings between the societies and their directors will be fully regulated with accountability to their members.  I note also that directors of the building societies can be deemed to be liable and penalised for engaging in dealings that contravene the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another of the provisions of the Bill will allow the conversion of building societies from mutual societies to public limited companies.  Such conversions can take place only after a special conversion resolution has been passed.  I agree with the Minister that it is only fair that borrowers be given an equal say with shareholders in any decision to convert since any such conversion could have serious consequences for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the provisions of section 105 contain an important safeguard, in the form of recourse to the High Court, for individual members who may consider that the terms of conversion do not respect their rights.  The Minister will be aware that recourse to the High Court is an expensive, time-consuming exercise, that an average borrower who may feel aggrieved would find the cost of any High Court action prohibitive.  For example, if one has a £30,000 mortgage one would find it very difficult to meet the £1,000 or £2,000 that would be required daily to sustain a High Court action.  Perhaps the Minister would consider on Committee Stage inserting a section to the effect that any member or borrower <Col N="1709" /> who takes a High Court action testing the conversion of a building society from a mutual society to a public limited company be recompensed the cost of such action if he or she, in the eyes of the Bench, raises legitimate or non-controversial points of law or principle.  That is a safeguard that could well be written into the provisions on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Another point that occurs to me &mdash; here I may be misreading the provisions of the Bill &mdash; to have clarified is: do the Central Bank have powers to send in rescuers to a building society that appears to be getting into trouble, or do the Central Bank have to wait until a building society is in obvious financial trouble before they can take action?  In other words, is the sheriff sent in only when matters have gone beyond redemption? Perhaps the Minister could clarify that point for me.</P>
    <P>There is also the provision which would enable the Minister to make regulations requiring building societies to set up, either individually or jointly, a scheme for the investigation and determination of complaints &mdash; a type of Ombudsman arrangement &mdash; by customers in relation to the services provided by societies.  I welcome that provision.  In the past people have felt very aggrieved with certain actions of building societies but had no recourse.  There are actions that a building society or any other company can take that, strictly speaking, may not be deemed to be illegal but which nonetheless in the eyes of a member or borrower may be vexatious.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is a commentary on changing lifestyles here <i>vis-á-vis</i> financial services, demographic changes, family numbers and so on that this will have been the fifth Bill since 1976 before the House regulating building societies' activities.  The last such Bill was passed in 1986.  No doubt, before the end of the century the Minister or his successor will have another such Bill before this House.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 31 deal with conveyancing so that building societies may have their solicitor act for one party in the conveyancing of a dwelling.  It is my view that it is good practice that <Col N="1710" /> societies act on behalf of their borrowers. However, one must ask will this reduce costs?  One must remember that in the case of an average mortgage of £30,000 a person's costs will amount to approximately 5 per cent.  Does the Minister envisage that this will lead to a reduction in the overall costs of house purchase? There is a new provision contained in section 60 requiring the disclosure of business volumes between a building society and any company or firm which has as a director or partner a director of a building society.  A building society will be required to maintain a register showing the aggregate amount of fees paid in respect of certain services provided to the society by companies or firms in the last financial year and in each of the preceding five financial years.  The services involved will be conveyancing, surveying, valuation of land or property, insurance and advertising but one has been omitted, namely, building.  For example, will builders or directors of building companies be included in the provisions of this section or is there a reason for their exclusion?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few aspects of the provisions of this Bill I welcome in so far as they afford the House an opportunity of reviewing the operations of building societies which have given rise to much public concern and media comment in recent years. However, to be fair to the building societies, many people prominent in them have themselves made a major contribution to their development.  Nonetheless lack of democracy within the societies has shown them up in a very bad light.  The provisions of this Bill &mdash; which go some way towards rectifying that position &mdash; are to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned particularly about the provision which will allow building societies to convert to public limited companies. Deputy Dermot Fitzpatrick said that the percentage of home owners here is the highest in Europe.  National statistical figures issued comparing countries in the 1970s show that Ireland had the highest proportion of home owners in the <Col N="1711" /> world, higher even than Japan, higher than the USA &mdash; the second highest &mdash; and higher than any other country in Europe.  It should be remembered that building societies constitute very profitable business.  They are no longer the mutual societies they once set out to be.</P>
    <P>For example, if one examines the figures for return on gross assets in respect of the banks and building societies &mdash; I have the figures for the years 1981, 1982 and 1983; unfortunately I do not have the relevant figures for later years &mdash; it becomes very clear that all of the building societies are much more profitable than either the Bank of Ireland or Allied Irish Banks and that generally they have been hiding these profits in a proliferation of branch offices.  For example, in my constituency at the Sundrive Road crossroads there are now five building society branch offices.  It appears to me that much of their profits have been hidden in real estate.  For 1982-1983 the return on gross assets ratio is as follows: Bank of Ireland the ratio would be 0.54 and for the AIB, 0.71.  The only building society with a ratio of less than 0.71 is the EBS at 0.64 but that is even higher than the profit ratio for the Bank of Ireland.  It goes on from there, to the First National, with a figure of 0.80, the Irish Permanent 0.89, the Irish Civil Service Building Society, 1.13, Irish Nationwide, 1.84 at the top of the scale.  Therefore, it is very clear to me that what we are talking about here are no longer small, mutual building societies but rather very substantial vehicles for making profits which are not very democratically controlled.</P>
    <P>We have to ask ourselves what is the best way forward at this time, particularly when reviewing this legislation. It seems to me that the building societies are going to continue along these lines.  Not only that, there are very vague provisions in this Bill which I feel certain would allow the directors of the building societies to take over these mutual assets which the Bill itself puts at £3.5 billion to control and use for their own benefit.  I have no objection to the directors of the building <Col N="1712" /> societies taking over the building societies if they are not going to remain as mutual societies, provided they pay for the assets they are taking over, provided the interests of the real owners, the account holders, the 165,000 mortgagees, are properly protected and that those who are no longer account holders but who have contributed over the years for the benefit of the building societies get something from it as well.  That would not be possible in some cases because some of the people who contributed over the years will have passed on.  There is a case to be made for the Government to compulsorily acquire building societies and to sell those building societies to the directors, if they want to buy them, or to anybody else who wants to buy them, and to use the funds so raised to the advantage of the mortgage holders, the account holders, the hard-pressed investors, and let us make an honest day's work of it.  If that is what we want to do then let us do it.</P>
    <P>The present provision which allows individuals to hold up to 15 per cent in building societies is a charter for a small number of people becoming millionaires and multi-millionaires at the expense of the assets which are not in the ownership of any small clique in building societies but in the ownership of the mutual investors. If the Minister wants to convert building societies into public liability companies so they can become like banks, let them become like banks, but let those who are gaining the advantage of controlling them pay for that and for the benefits that go with that control.  Let us do it honestly.  I hope the Minister will look at this question because nobody has consulted the mortgage holder or the account holder.  The Minister has closetted himself away with the directors of the building societies and their legal and financial advisers and has come up with this very detailed and technical legislation of 127 sections without any consultation with the person who pays the mortgage or who has put money on deposit or otherwise invested in building societies. It is time that the case for the mortgage payer was put.  This is the same mortgage <Col N="1713" /> payer who is now to be exposed again to tiered mortgage rates which Deputy John Boland, as Minister for the Environment, abolished, the same mortgage payer who has had his interest relief reduced, first to 90 per cent and then to 80 per cent.  It seems to me that we are out to screw the mortgage payer.  Nobody asked their advice on this Bill though there is an account holders' association which could have been consulted.  Let me say in passing that it seems to me that the account holders' association of ACRA or anybody else concerned with residents associations and mortgage holders or anybody remotely in contact with them were not consulted before this legislation was published, and it is time they were. I hope, on Committee Stage, that the Minister will be able to give this House assurances with regard to the mutual holders of interest in building societies.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly that the audit provisions of this Bill should be looked at.  I am unhappy with the controls that, allegedly, are in this Bill.  The Central Bank is mentioned as having a role similar to the role it has with banks.  The role the Central Bank has did not prevent Allied Irish Banks from getting involved in ICI which nearly brought down the whole banking system.  The provisions there are not strong enough.  The Minister, in addition to the role given to the Central Bank, should take a hand in deciding who is appointed auditor of these companies.</P>
    <P>I note that one of these building societies changed their auditors quite recently and since it was done outside of the AGM the building society board themselves nominated very reputable auditors in the interim; but there is a precedent for the Minister to involve himself in the process of appointing auditors and this was done under the Gas Acts where the Minister wanted to protect the interests of the shareholders and investors.  The Minister should be consulted on the appointment of auditors to ensure that those who are so appointed are reputable, independent and primarily taking account of the interests of the shareholders and investors. I would ask the Minister to look at <Col N="1714" /> that provision before we come back on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am one of those people who feels that local authorities should be allowed compete with building societies for mortgage business.  In fact local authorities are already in the building society business, albeit at the lower end, the risk end of the market, the end of the market which the building societies themselves have not displayed an interest in.  They do already act as agents in lending money under the SDA provisions and the Housing Finance Act provisions.  Building society legislation should allow local authorities, particularly large authorities like Dublin Corporation, the choice of competing for this very profitable business so that not only will they have the opportunity to take up the risk end of the market but also the end of the market where there is profit to be made which could be used to the advantage of the citizens of the city. There is no problem with Irish Life, which is owned by the State, competing with the private sector.  I see no reason local authorities should not be empowered to compete with building societies for business.  The legislation should be amended to give that power to local authorities who want to take it up.</P>
    <P>I earnestly hope that more time will be devoted to the Committee Stage of this Bill than is devoted to most Bills so that all its provisions can be teased out.  The Minister may feel that he has tied up the various areas of responsibility in this Bill and has safeguarded the public interest but I feel he has taken the building societies into his confidence, that they have written most of this legislation and have convinced him that this is in the public interest when in fact certain sections of the Bill are very vague.  I am particularly concerned about the possibility of the building societies' assets getting into the ownership of a small number of people who make no payment for that ownership.</P>
    <P>That is one of the vague parts of this Bill that needs to be addressed and considered in detail.  I would ask the Minister to give it particular consideration and not be afraid to consider the suggestion I <Col N="1715" /> make regarding the possibility of the State compulsorily acquiring the building societies, selling them off and using the funds raised to the advantage of mortgage holders.  I would ask the Minister also&mdash;he need not reply to this now&mdash; to at least take advice on that suggestion. He should find out if it is a viable suggestion because it seems that it is.  It is something that should be considered, something that would bring the whole position of building societies into the open so that everybody could see precisely what is happening and nothing would be done by sleight-of-hand or in an under-hand way to the advantage of any individuals without primary consideration being given to the whole question of mutuality.  I will leave my contribution at that because I want to put emphasis on this one point.  I would ask the Minister to please take advice on this matter from some of the other financial advisers to see if there is a possibility of doing what I suggest.  He may find to his surprise that it is a better way of approaching the matter than is this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is both welcome and timely because it is essential that legislation such as this should come before the House at this time.  This is one of a series of Bills introduced in the past two years, a series that will continue no doubt in the next three or four years, and designed to gear the business community towards the realities of 1992.  It also addresses itself to one of the areas we have given least consideration to in the past ten or 15 years, that of consumer protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will be welcomed by the consumers for two reasons.  First, it will give them greater protection when dealing with financial institutions, particularly building societies, and it will also afford them a wider choice of financial institutions in which they can transact their business.  All of us at various times in the past have been highly critical of the banking community where there has been <Col N="1716" /> a monopoly by virtue of the cosy arrangements among the big five banks.  The legislation before us, if it does nothing else, will remove some of the complacency from the banks and will remove the monopoly that has existed in that area in the past ten or 15 years.  Perhaps when the building societies get the powers that are being offered to them in this Bill and start competing with the banks in the area of cheques, current accounts and so on, the banks will take a more realistic attitude to their customers and not do as they currently appear to do, charge people for going in the door to withdraw or lodge money to their own account.</P>
    <P>The legislation will also be welcomed by the building societies because, as Deputy Mitchell has said, it will allow them greater freedom and flexibility in the highly competitive financial services markets.  The Deputy seemed to be critical of the Bill on the grounds that it is wide and flexible in relation to building societies.  The phrase he used was that the building societies wrote the Bill or certainly had a large hand to play in it. Knowing the Minister as I do, I do not think the building societies would have written anything for him but he certainly would have consulted with them as would be good practice for any Government Minister.  While I agree that the Bill is very wide and allows a great deal of flexibility, that is absolutely essential for the future.  One could not come before this House with a Bill similar to previous Bills which attempted to fiddle around with legislation that was totally inadequate and out of date and expect to address the major problems that will face all institutions, whether financial or otherwise, over the next number of years.</P>
    <P>I see the Bill as a very vital preparation for building societies and financial institutions in the open market that will result from the Single European Act, post 1992. Anybody who has read or is in any way familiar with the EC banking directives will know that the legislation is not just welcome at this time but is absolutely vital for the survival of our building societies.  The societies have operated in a very closed segment of the financial <Col N="1717" /> services market.  It is clear to anybody who is familiar with this area in a European context that without this legislation the building societies would not be able to survive and that would cause many more problems for mortgage holders and members of building societies than the matters mentioned by Deputy Mitchell in relation to the powers given to building societies under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very comprehensive, as has been mentioned.  There are 127 sections which deal with all aspects of building societies such as their formation and authorisation, their various powers, the control and supervision of building societies, their management, meetings and resolutions, accounting and auditing, a new provision for a savings protection scheme and provision for amalgamation of societies.  I would like to congratulate the Minister on the approach he has adopted to the legislation.  He has introduced a Bill that is comprehensive and that meets the challenges of the changing scene.  The key to the Bill as I see it is the flexibility that will allow changes to be made as circumstances change.  It will prevent the laws from becoming out-dated as could happen very easily with the changes that are occurring at present.</P>
    <P>The Bill is particularly welcome considering that although building societies have been in operation since the middle of the last century they were relatively small up to about 20 or 30 years ago. There are now ten major building societies with total savings in the region of £3.5 billion.  There are 165,000 mortgage holders.  Almost 70 per cent of those who finance the purchase of their own houses have done so by means of a building society loan.  It is estimated that there are about 1.25 million members in building societies.  If those facts and figures do not underline the necessity for introducing this kind of legislation to ensure that the consumer is adequately protected, I do not know what could.</P>
    <P>The legislation under which building societies operate at present is the Building Societies Act, 1976, which is very <Col N="1718" /> restrictive.  It provides the legal framework for societies to look after a particular segment of the market, that is, they were allowed to accept funds for shares and deposits and to lend that money to the members of their society. The amendment in 1986 for the first time ever allowed for unsecured loans for bridging and home improvement works. That was heralded as a major change at that time but experience has shown that, because of the other problems that face them, building societies have not taken on that extra power in a significant way.</P>
    <P>The year 1992 is just around the corner and it is obvious that the building societies could not operate in the same way as they did in the past.  We are all aware that the building societies have been actively seeking an extension of their powers and the facilities they could offer to customers. The passage of this Bill will give them probably even more than they campaigned for but the other side of the coin is that the legislation imposes obligations, statutory and otherwise, on the building societies which are long overdue.</P>
    <P>The fears expressed by Members of the Opposition at various times were that the building societies would write their own charter.  Indeed, Deputy Mitchell mentioned the fact that he thought they had done so.  Any kind of objective reading of the legislation shows that the Minister has kept a very important balance between the needs of the building societies, the flexibility they need to compete, and consumer protection which is vital.</P>
    <P>I refer in particular to the area of control of the Central Bank of building societies which will be running parallel in the Central Bank Bill.  That is a welcome move and should lead to much tighter controls, and I have no doubt that with all the technical provisions in the Bill it will lead to tighter controls.  It is a more fitting institution to monitor and control building societies, which are handling so much money, than the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  In fact, I am not sure that the Registrar of Friendly Societies is in a position or is capable of keeping tabs on all the other friendly societies which he has to keep an eye on.  In relation to <Col N="1719" /> building societies we are talking about vast sums of money and major investments, and it is a Central Bank function to look after moneys of that magnitude.</P>
    <P>The benefit of the Central Bank control is that all institutions of a similar nature should have the same controlling body. This Bill will allow building societies to be a banking position and to provide full banking services.  It would not be a good idea to have building societies controlled by the Registrar of Friendly Societies and banks subject to the control of the Central Bank.  That would not be good for the banking system or the financial system generally and, based on past experience, it certainly would not be good for the consumers.  The Central Bank has the power and the expertise in this area.  I welcome the provision in the legislation that will result in control being passed over to the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The other important point about Central Bank control is that everybody will be on an even playing field in relation to the provision of financial services.  That is very important not only for the financial institutions themselves but also for the consumer.</P>
    <P>I welcome Part V of the Bill which contains provisions relating to the management of societies.  Part V is concerned with the election and conduct of directors and there are a number of provisions spelt out in the legislation in relation to this, and not before time.  Any institution or organisation that has over 1¼ million members needs to have its management looked at again.</P>
    <P>The public perception of building societies is one of organisations that have remained remarkably aloof from any semblance of real democracy.  They are seen as organisations where power has been gained by particular cliques or families and where ordinary members have little or no hope of having a major say. Over the past number of years, the activities indulged in at annual general meetings by the management and chairmen of various building societies have been extraordinary to say the least.  If this legislation puts a stop to what appears to be <Col N="1720" /> a very autocratic system, which operates particularly in relation to the election of directors to the board of building societies or to AGMs, that will be a welcome move.</P>
    <P>A cause of scandal over the past number of years has been the manner in which the election of directors to boards has been handled.  Building societies send out the notice of the AGM with all the other paraphernalia about accounts, income and expenditure, and will virtually canvas for a particular person, normally a person already on the board or who is a close associate of those on the board.  It would not happen in the most backward club or organisation in any part of the country that the management, or those in charge, would send out the notice saying this is the person one is to vote for at the AGM.  It is extraordinary and it has been a cause of scandal.  The requirement in this legislation, particularly that a poll be held as opposed to the present system of a show of hands in a contested election, is very welcome.</P>
    <P>In relation to the appointment of directors to the board, there was open canvassing by members of staff of the building societies' branch offices around the country for particular candidates.  As a member of a building society I was canvassed on a number of occasions by local branch managers.  It is very important, not least for the image of the building societies themselves that the system which pertained should be done away with and that there should be seen to be a fairer and more democratic way of electing directors to the board.  It has been argued that this Bill will not change essentially the top management or what happens, but it will certainly remove the cause of scandal in relation to the election of directors.  I think the Bill will stamp out a great deal of the activities I have mentioned and will at least give some semblance of democracy to the overall image of building societies.</P>
    <P>With regard to consumer protection, I particularly welcome the move for an investor protection scheme.  The most important issue that will face building societies in the post-1992 era is that <Col N="1721" /> depositors can have confidence in the building society or financial institution with whom they deal.  The investor protection scheme as outlined in the Bill will go a long way towards giving depositors that confidence so that they can put their money in the building society and the money will be there when they need it. It is a most welcome provision.</P>
    <P>The building societies are getting a good deal.  Most of what they want will be satisfied by the Bill.  While the Bill provides that building societies will have greater flexibility, extra powers, and the freedom to engage in various financial services, it also brings extra responsibilities. While the building societies will have greater freedom, this is balanced to a certain extent by bringing openness into the accountancy practices and audit procedures of building societies.  There is a provision in the Bill where fairly simplified accounts will be available to members so that they can see what is going on; whether directors are getting loans, and the relationship between directors and the shareholders.  This balance between the extra powers and the openness in accountancy practices is welcome.</P>
    <P>As a result of this Bill, the extra dimension which will be brought to the building societies should allow for greater competition in the financial and property services. However, I have mixed feelings about the move to allow building societies to purchase land and to provide their own houses.  I think there are dangers inherent in this and this will have to be very carefully monitored by the Minister when the legislation is going through.  There are dangers inherent in allowing building societies to become property speculators. We could then find that loans are only available for building society houses or for particular customers.  I would hate to see the building societies going away from their basic rationale, that is the provision of housing.  I would not like to see depositors being refused loans for housing, simply because the building society have spare capacity in the houses they have provided or because they are plugging a particular development they want to <Col N="1722" /> market because they have an interest in it.  This is an inherent danger in the Bill. It is an issue which should be looked at again and if possible it should be written into the regulations or into the legislation that this type of thing cannot happen.</P>
    <P>The reason I enter that caveat with regard to the Bill refers back to the 1986 Building Societies (Amendment) Act.  At that time, the Minister felt it was important to end the building societies' monopoly in the provision of insurance and he introduced regulations so that a customer could take out insurance on a mortgage with whatever insurance company he wanted to and that if he wanted to move away from the insurance company that was tied up with the building society, he should have freedom to do so.  While the regulations are in place, in effect what has happened is that the building societies have got around this by producing a document which must be signed by the insurance company and by the insured person, which absolutely and totally indemnifies the building society against every possible risk that might arise.  No insurance company, not even the insurance companies that the building societies were using, would sign an indemnity such as the one that is being sought by the building societies.  It was simply a device by which people would be put off using their own insurance companies. I know that in a number of cases the building societies threatened to call in loans from various people who held mortgages if they could not get the papers signed or if they changed their insurance company.  I would not like to see that stick being wielded at a later stage with regard to the type of houses or particular developments that building societies would like people to buy.  I would rather that things are left as they are so that people can get loans for any house that is suitable.</P>
    <P>On a general note, after the legislation has been enacted, there is no doubt that building societies in common with all other financial institutions will face huge problems&mdash;if you want to take a negative view, or great opportunities, if you take <Col N="1723" /> a positive view &mdash; in the post-1992 situation. In the past there has been a great deal of competition between the building societies.  Indeed, many people would argue that a great deal of depositors' money was wasted by the building societies on advertising and marketing campaigns. Leaving that aside, there always has been a very healthy competitive spirit between the building societies, and I do not think we should knock that.</P>
    <P>However, after the enactment of this legislation, building societies&mdash; especially the major building societies&mdash; will have to start talking in terms of co-operation rather than competition.  The competition will always be there but I do not think it will be feasible for each building society to operate a complete range of financial services on its own.  It is not going to be possible for them to have separate clearing houses, as it were, if they go into the area of current accounts and so on.  It will not be possible for them to provide such services as the ATM cash dispensers for providing money on a 24 hour basis.  There are other areas where I do not think it will be possible for each building society to provide a full range of services to their customers.  For that reason building societies should think in terms of co-operating with each other.  There is provision in the Bill for facilitating building societies in mergers, takeovers and so on, but failing mergers and takeovers happening, the building societies should be sitting down and talking about provisions that will help to provide a full range of financial services for their customers. I do not think any building society will be strong enough or powerful enough to do it on their own.  They should talk now to ensure that in the post-1992 era, when we will be covered by EC banking directives, they will be in a position to compete with those institutions that come in from outside.</P>
    <P>Up to now building societies have been more interested in trying to get a proper legislative framework which would give them more powers.  They will have these powers as a result of the introduction of <Col N="1724" /> this Bill and it is time for them to think about their customers, clients and depositors, whom they are supposed to think about at all times.  They have to get together and co-operate in order to provide the best possible service for their customers and depositors.  If they do not do this and stay separate and compete as separate entities they will not be able to provide the services they want to provide both economically and efficiently.  If they do not do this the Bill will have been a waste of time because other companies will come in from outside and provide the services.</P>
    <P>This is a complicated Bill and I have made some general points in relation to it.  I will end my contribution by again appealing to the building societies not to waste the opportunities they are being given in this Bill.  They have been looking for these powers for a long time and now that they have got them they should make full use of them and co-operate rather than compete with each other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any doubt that this Bill is introducing major changes in so far as the building society world is concerned.  I use the word &ldquo;change&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;reform&rdquo; because I am not totally convinced that the change will be for the better, and the word &ldquo;reform&rdquo; implies an improvement for the better.  This Bill is moving building societies totally away from the original conception of mutuality &mdash; a group of people coming together, pooling their savings and making loans for the purposes of providing houses, which I understand was the original rationale behind the building society movement.  They are moving a long way from that concept, and built into that concept was the understanding that the mutual movement would be conducted in the most economical and spartan way possible to ensure maximum financial benefit for the mutual investors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose it was inevitable that as the societies grew that the pressures of commerce and the introduction of sophisticated financial and commercial techniques would impel a movement away from that original spirit but we <Col N="1725" /> should recognise what we are now doing in this Bill: we are now saying goodbye to that original spirit and, by way of legislation, turning building societies into financial corporations no different in essence from the banking corporations which already operate in the State.  I query whether that is a desirable development. It is common knowledge that there has been pressure on the Minister for the building societies to do this but I wonder whether the attitude of the Department and the Minister should have been to look at the fundamental nature of building societies to see if the changes needed in that area should have addressed more vigorously the essential nature of building societies.</P>
    <P>It seems that a policy decision has now been taken to move away from the old concept of mutuality and to turn these societies into financial conglomerates, with all the financial and commercial advantages that would bring to the bottom line, but I wonder how much it will benefit the consumer, the ordinary person whom we are sent here to serve. The objective of mutuality was to provide the cheapest possible loan to the investor but when I read the huge range of sophisticated powers now being given to the building societies I wonder if the borrowers of modest means, who want to house themselves, will be forgotten about.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that in recent years building societies have expanded their businesses hugely.  In the past decade or two some societies have grown from being small institutions into major financial houses.  I would be invidious to name them but the fact that they have been able to do that and that the already existing large societies have progressed apace seems to suggest that there was nothing inherently wrong with the environment in which these institutions operated.  This environment has enabled them to progress and grow rapidly and significantly while at the same time keeping the idea of mutuality as part and parcel of their ethos.  The first sign that there was a <Col N="1726" /> movement away from the idea of providing the best possible value for the consumer was the introduction some years ago by a society or societies &mdash; I have forgotten how many were involved &mdash; of the tiered interest loan.  That was the first crack in the concept of mutuality and &ldquo;benefit of the consumer all the time&rdquo;. The bill is going to get bigger for some people.  Undoubtedly there have been significant changes in this area during the past two decades.  These societies have grown and there has been nothing in their legal framework which apparently has inhibited them because their rate of growth has been spectacular.  That rate of growth has understandably fuelled the ambition of societies to grow even more and to put themselves on a par with other financial institutions.  That ambition has now been answered by the Minister in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The eight objectives of the Bill are set out in the Explanatory Memorandum. The first objective is to strengthen the competitive position of building societies by extending their powers so that they can provide a much wider range of services. If the basic role of a building society is to provide housing finance at the best possible price I should like to see written into the Bill some guarantee that the profits from the new range of services and powers being given to the societies will come in ease of the consumers, the people of modest means, who want to house themselves.  I would like to see that concept put into the Bill so that the original concept of mutuality could be expressed through it.</P>
    <P>The range of services that have been proposed for the building societies is extremely wide.  The societies will now be able to operate as property developers, landlords, bankers and they could be behind the scenes in retail, wholesale, or even industrial business.  In this Bill we are providing the potential for a level and extent of growth that I do not think we can foresee at the moment.  I know that the Central Bank will be in the background as a controlling agent but, quite frankly, having read the Bill and having <Col N="1727" /> seen the reliance that the Minister is placing on the Central Bank to control the new bodies which he is creating&mdash; because they will be new bodies, have no doubt about that; they may have the same names but they will be significantly changed in essence &mdash; I wonder how the Central Bank will be able effectively to discharge the huge range of controls that they are being given to operate.</P>
    <P>Certainly, the Bill is providing a wide range of extra services but I wonder if the object to strengthen the competitive position of the building societies will be achieved.  Competitive with whom and for what?  Certainly, competitive with other financial institutions.  They will be placed in a much stronger position and will be able to compete for customers who want banking services.  They will be able to compete with property companies. They may supersede local authorities in providing housing.  I wonder to whose benefit, at the end of the day, will all these extra powers be?  I have some doubt that it will benefit the small investor. I presume what he is paid will be subject to all the controls that are already there, statutory and commercial, on the rate of return on money invested.  I doubt if his position will improve significantly, if at all.  Likewise the person who wants to borrow money for his own house, is anything going to happen to his benefit?</P>
    <P>Perhaps a property developer will be able to operate more efficiently with less bureaucratic controls through a building society, but I doubt that, because the need to make sure such investments are prudent will always imply the need to impose proper controls.</P>
    <P>To get back to a point I made earlier about the growth of building societies in recent years, they have been able to grow because they have been able to compete for deposits and for borrowers, year by year in an ever increasing way.  We have to question if that growth was not sufficient for the ambitions of the building societies and why do they want to grow even more?  These are fundamental background questions that the Minister needs to address and to deal with in his reply. <Col N="1728" /> To talk about making the societies competitive <i>vis-à-vis</i> 1992 is not good enough. We will have to hear precisely why 1992 &mdash;if that is going to be the reason for it &mdash; and why that particular new régime will impose pressures on the building societies that necessitate giving them these extra powers.</P>
    <P>Another objective of the Bill is to transfer the monitoring responsibility from the registrar to the Central Bank.  I have already mentioned the huge range of specific powers being given to the Central Bank.  If they are to be exercised in the way that I read the Bill envisaging the need to exercise them, the Central Bank will have to have a vast or quite substantial number of new personnel to devise the regulations and to oversee their implementation, pretty well on a continuing basis in a whole range of areas.  I have no doubt the Central Bank will have the capacity to do this but it does seem that if the Minister is so apprehensive about the child he is creating in this Bill that he has to provide this sophisticated and complex monitoring system, he should perhaps have another look at his creation.  I welcome the changes proposed with regard to the running and management of the societies, their accounts and audits and the very practical provision whereby a layman's balance sheet can be issued.  That is a good development.</P>
    <P>To pick up a point made by Deputy Dempsey on the election of directors, the Deputy seems to think that what is proposed here will be a change for the better, the better being contrasted with the past when we had unseemly annual general meetings arising out of the efforts of the members of societies to become elected to the boards.  There are obviously two views on this.  One view must be that societies of the magnitude of a building society or public companies of that size need continuity in their directors. They need personnel with experience as directors.  It should not be open to every member who has the personal ambition to be a director of a building society to be able to become a director. I think that is commonsense.  I wonder <Col N="1729" /> how much of the motivation behind the controversy over the directorships of building societies is due to the simple and basic human feeling of envy.  It may well be.  It must be said that building societies, because of their responsibility and the amount of assets that they control &mdash; the destinies of so many people involved in the prudent management of those assets &mdash; there must be continuity at directorship level.  That is not to say that there should not be change and that appropriately qualified people should not be entitled to be elected to the building society.</P>
    <P>What is proposed in the Bill may make the matter somewhat different but I do not think it will make any significant difference, for the simple reason that, speaking as one having to go through the process of election, there is only one way to be elected and that is to get the votes. If people want to become directors of a building society or a public limited company, they must first have their shareholding qualification and must then get the votes of their fellow members or their fellow shareholders.  In the nature of things, shareholders and members are not organised in homogeneous groups that are very easily contacted and mobilised to vote in a particular way.  The shared administrative task of doing that will ensure that what is proposed in this Bill will not make any significant change.</P>
    <P>So far as building societies or public liability companies are concerned, the directors will, when all is said and done, have the direct means of communication with their shareholding fellow members and will be able to advise them that it is in their interest and in the interest of their company or institution that A, B, C or D should be re-elected or elected, as the case may be.  Most shareholders, looking at their funds and knowing that the safety of those funds will depend on the collective wisdom of the directors, will be conservative and will go along with the recommendations of the board.  I do not think we will see anything significantly different.  People who think this Bill will provide a ready-made and easy means of <Col N="1730" /> ousting present boards of directors will have to think again.  There are good reasons why that should be.</P>
    <P>The provision whereby members of staff will be prevented from canvassing is possibly a good one, although I do not think there is anything altogether wrong in such cavassing.  Would there be anything wrong in a bank manager talking to shareholders if there was a controversy about the election of a director of the bank and suggesting that their interests as customers and shareholders and the interests of the bank would best be served by complying with what the directors wanted?  I do not see anything obnoxious in that.  I do not see anything wrong in the staff of a building society canvassing at the behest of their directors, even less so if the building societies were mutual associations of people to form a common cause for their mutual benefit.  It would be entirely appropriate for that to happen.  It is possibly even more appropriate, now that we are putting the building societies into the raw world of commercial competition and international banking, that their staff should be mobilised to protect the interests of the society at corporate level.  I regard the provision in the Bill as a cosmetic gesture in response to matters which received a fair amount of publicity during boardroom and AGM battles in the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey referred to building societies investing in residential schemes of houses.  Naturally if they do so they will sell the houses and if a person in that town or suburb seeks a loan from that building society there will be a great temptation to direct him or her towards the building society scheme.  I know that controls are to be provided but I wonder, having regard to the nature of things, how effective such controls would be. Deputy Dempsey gave the well known example of the controls to provide competition in insurance having been got around by the building societies in a most reprehensible way.  They did not like that control and I think there was a personal animus behind that dislike.  Nevertheless the Bill was passed by this Parliament <Col N="1731" /> and should have been observed in the spirit and the letter.  I echo what Deputy Dempsey has said.  The building societies have got around that control, which was designed to ensure competition and better value for the consumer.  One is disappointed at the lack of public spirit displayed by the societies in ignoring not just the wishes of Parliament but the law of the land as expressed in the 1986 Act. If that is an indication of the attitude of the building societies to controls imposed by this Oireachtas, I must pose a cynical question about the effectiveness of the various measures scattered throughout the Bill to ensure competition and to ensure that a service provided by a building society will be voluntary for the consumer or member.  I am apprehensive that many of these things will turn out to be if not compulsory certainly verging on that.</P>
    <P>The power to enable building societies to invest in residential development may provide a ready-made conflict of interest in a significant number of areas.  A particular building society scheme of houses may be slow to sell because the location or design may not be right and there must be a great temptation on the part of a society to nudge people looking for loans in the direction of their own scheme.  This is an inevitable consequence of making these societies commercial conglomerates rather than mutual societies existing for the benefit of their members. It is well to know the consequences of going down that road.  I am somewhat saddened that this seminal change is being made without a detailed thought being given to its consequences.</P>
    <P>One of the objectives set out in the Explanatory Memorandum is to enable societies to invest in commercial development. I had the impression that building societies already made loans for commercial development and perhaps even invested in commercial development themselves.  Possibly in providing a new headquarters they might have had surplus space available for such development.  I should be glad if the Minister would deal with that aspect of the present activities <Col N="1732" /> of societies.  I suppose it is essential to give the societies this power if we are to allow them to move into the general area of commerce and financial services.  It arises inevitably from the logic behind the Bill but it is a far cry from the concept of mutuality which is being buried by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another objective is to help keep down the transaction costs associated with house purchase.  I do not know what that refers to in particular.  I suspect it may refer to the new power being given to the building societies to provide conveyancing and auctioneering services, but I do not see how a society will be able to provide those services at a significantly cheaper rate than that charged already.  I have to declare a vested interest as a country attorney.  I recognise the momentum for breaking the conveyancing monoploy of my profession, but I regret that because it raises very basic questions as to the role and place of an independent legal profession in a democratic society. People are cynical about lawyers and say that talk about the place of an independent legal profession in a democratic society is window-dressing by solicitors trying to protect their vested interests. However, it is not as simple as that, it is more fundamental and serious because any citizen&mdash;hopefully, the fewer the better &mdash; who comes into conflict with the bureaucracy of the State or another citizen must have an independent remedy available to him.</P>
    <P>I cannot over emphasise the need for independent advice, assistance and support. If the profession who offer that are unable to continue commercially a serious gap will emerge in our democratic structures.  If the commercial viability of their profession is interfered with by taking away what is very much a bread and butter part of their commercial existence, there are downstream consequences, maybe not immediately visible or apparent, but they will be apparent in a couple of decades.  I do not want to go on at undue length about the role of small practices in rural areas but they serve an important social, legal and commercial function in the communities in which they <Col N="1733" /> operate.  I do not know where the push for this power came from, I do not think it was from the societies because I am sure they have enough to do in getting on with all the mainstream activities in which they want to engage without being involved in setting up conveyancing departments.  Having regard to the way the Bill envisages tight regulations in that area I hope that many of them will decide to pass that particular cup and I encourage them to do so.</P>
    <P>I do not see the point in providing auctioneering services and how it will put the societies in a more competitive position if the services are at arms' length from the main activities of the societies. They will have to be at arms' length from the main activities because, arising from the power to provide auctioneering and conveyancing services, there must be a danger of a conflict of interests.  In that conflict of interests, Mr. Strong will inevitably benefit at the expense of Mr. Weak. The strong person in such a conflict will be the society and the weak person will be the individual of modest or limited means.  There is a danger of a conflict of interests and it would be altogether in the interests of the societies, their reputation and their status as they go into the financial banking world to be different from those already in it.  They can get a first here by ensuring that there will never be a conflict of interests between the interests of the corporation or society and the interests of the customer.  I ask the Minister to again look at those two provisions and I certainly expect him to spell out in some detail his justification for the statement in his explanatory memorandum about improving competition.  I suppose power to provide an extra service makes one more competitive but if that extra service will not result in reduced costs or bring with it a conflict of interests &mdash;or the impression of a conflict of interests &mdash; I wonder if it is a good power to give.  The Minister must tell us in some detail his thinking behind the conferring of these two powers on building societies.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I want to refer is the power to give societies the right to charge tiered interest rates.  This <Col N="1734" /> is a contentious power and I regret its arrival in statutory form because it is the final nail in the coffin of mutuality.  I am not totally inconsistent in regard to this idea but if mutuality was to procure the best possible deal in the most economical and spartan way, providing for tiered interest rates totally conflicts with that idea.  Obviously it would enhance the profitability of the societies because they would be able to charge higher rates to certain levels of their borrowers with a consequent impact on their final profit figure.  Competition from the banks, who are now heavily into house mortgages, may inhibit the growth of tiered lending. On the other hand, the introduction of the power here may well start a lobby on the part of the banks for something akin to tiered lending.  If that happens, none of us could then say that the consumer had been well served.</P>
    <P>The consumer is the person for whom we should all be concerned, not the bottom line of mutual societies or the banks.  competition between lending agencies to get in a charge here and there and higher interest rates in vulnerable cases is not a good development and I very much regret it.  It shows how much influence the building societies have been able to exert on the Minister that this pet project&mdash;indefensible in social and commercial terms&mdash;has been so readily taken on board by the Minister and written into the Bill.  If that is the way the Minister wants to use his power, fair enough, that is his prerogative but it is a pity because the Minister and all Members have a responsibility, not to financial conglomerates and anonymous corporations, but to our fellow citizens, particularly our weaker fellow citizens of modest means.  We should never introduce legislation which gives a position of dominance to strong financial corporations as against the ordinary individual citizen.  That may be wheeling and dealing but there is a fundamental, philosophical objection to it and it is an obnoxious development.  I regret it coming from a party like Fianna Fáil with their origins of support from the man with no seat to his breeches, which used <Col N="1735" /> to be the proud boast of Fianna Fáil.  The party opposite have gone a long long way from that concept exemplified by the introduction of the power to charge tiered interest rates.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a fundamental change in the whole concept of building societies and mutuality.  I have doubts as to whether a change of this magnitude is necessary.  The societies have been able to grow at a significant rate in the past two decades.  They do not seem to have suffered competitively <i>vis-à-vis</i> other financial institutions and are still attracting a high level of investment and making a significant number of loans.  Deputy Dempsey had the statistics which were impressive in spite of the fact that the banks are now heavily into the mortgage business.  Is the answer then to put the building societies into the banking business? I do not think it is because building societies were never intended to be banks.  Building societies were intended to be mutual associations for people of modest means to provide building finance at the lowest possible level.  That was the concept, but we are living in changing times.  This is the era of the ad-man and sophisticated commerce.  Building societies now feel that they have to keep up with the Jones' in the banks.  The Minister obviously agrees with them, but I have some regrets about this.</P>

      <P>Having listened to Deputy Cooney's contribution I must say that there were parts with which I agree and parts with which I did not agree.  I re-echo one of the points he made, that is, that we have a moral obligation to ensure that any legislation enacted in this House protects the person of modest <Col N="1736" /> means.  That has to be our first priority. I would like to think that the Bill before the House contains as many protections as possible.  If we find loopholes in the legislation which was introduced with the best will, to protect society, we should ensure with all urgency that amending legislation is introduced.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooney pointed out that building societies and co-operatives were set up by small groups to provide support for persons of modest means who wanted to purchase their own homes or to sell their produce to the co-operatives at the best possible rates.  In fairness, the building societies have achieved that objective.</P>
      <P>The question has been asked why we have to put so much of our earned income into bricks and mortar given that in many other countries people are into the renting and leasing of more modest dwellings. I will not take up the time of the House trying to find reasons for this.  The Minister indicated that we probably have the highest rate of house ownership in Europe and he indicated that over the past ten years more than six out of every ten persons who purchased their own homes did so by way of a loan from a building society.  This Bill is of fundamental importance to the majority of those living in this country.  Therefore, we must ensure that this legislation, which we hope will work to the benefit of the consumer, will be mentioned.  I would like to think that this Bill will lead to more competition in the marketplace and will work to the benefit of the house purchaser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooney wondered why we had to move from the more comforting image of mutual building societies to that of conglomerates, but times are changing and with the breaking down of barriers between this country and others in regard to all types of lending transactions and the harmonisation of standards, by 1993 at the latest, it is probably worth reminding the House that this is probably the first of a series of legislative measures which will have to be introduced.  As I said previously, and I am sure other Members have also pointed this out, we must try to ensure that we enact the most <Col N="1737" /> just legislation possible for our own citizens.</P>
    <P>There are a number of queries I would like the Minister to answer.  A number of other speakers have also raised these queries.  Without going into too much detail as a legislator and a protector of the consumer, I would like to say that I share the fears expressed about the introduction of tiered interest rates and the proposal to give building societies the option to change their status and become public liability companies with all that that entails.  An assurance would have to be given that there would no creaming off of profits at management level to the detriment of the shareholders in the building society.</P>
    <P>We have to guard against the emergence of cartels or conglomerates who would enter into arrangements to suit themselves while still claiming to be competitive, especially in the area of advertising. In the transport area we have several examples of cartels being established and price agreements reached with the result that smaller companies were shut out.  We have to ensure that there is fair competition and that smaller companies are not shut out.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware that one of the objectives of the Treaty of Rome which established the European Community is to prevent multinational companies from becoming too big and too powerful and to ensure that they do not threaten the sovereignty of countries.  Up to now we have not succeeded in controlling this.  While I am not claiming that building societies would grow to such an extent, there is an underlying fear that in introducing legislation which would allow companies to become bigger and more powerful, they would become monopolies with the result that not alone would they be uncompetitive but the consumer would suffer as a result.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The Blasket Island Foundation, which was launched in 1986, has as its principal aim the creation of a national historic park on the Great Blasket Island.  The foundation is actively supported by my Department and the Office of Public Works to attain this aim.  I understand that significant progress has been made by the foundation towards achieving its fund-raising target.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the House on 24 April 1987, the preservation of this unique part of our cultural heritage and its great natural beauty is of prime national importance. In pursuance of Government policy to that end, the former homes of the authors Tomás Ó Criomthain, Peig Sayers and Muiris O Súilleabháin have been listed as historic monuments under the National Monuments Acts.  In addition, the Office of Public Works have set aside a sum of money which will be used for restoration works on the island.</P>
      <P>I am at present awaiting the views of the foundation on the question of promoting legislation to ensure the future protection of the Great Blasket Island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that it will take some time to provide legislation for the protection of our national heritage and national parks, will the Taoiseach be prepared to accept a proposal put forward by the Blasket Island Foundation which was distributed to all Kerry <Col N="1739" /> TDs today which would enable the Blasket Island Foundation to acquire the Great Blasket and go ahead with developments on it?</P>

      <P>I think we are talking about the same thing.  In my reply I referred to the views of the foundation on the question of promoting legislation. I am reasonably satisfied that if Kerry County Council, the planning authority, are vigilant and enforce the planning regulations, we will have no problems in the short term, but I think the Deputy will agree with me that what we really want to do is provide a statutory basis for the future development of the Great Blasket.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>My Department have not carried out research or analysis into the overall impact on employees' net disposable income of the various taxes, PRSI contributions, expenses and deductions from pay referred to in the question because it raises issues outside my area of responsibility. Research and analysis by my Department have been limited to the relationship between social welfare allowances, in money and kind, and allowances on training and unemployment schemes.</P>
      <P>Statutory deductions mentioned in the question dealing with PAYE and PRSI are the responsibility of the Ministers for Finance and Social Welfare.  The major additional cost to an employer who was paying an employee the average manufacturing industrial wage of £201.88 at June 1988, was the employer's PRSI contribution of £25.03 (or 12.4 per cent of the employee's gross earnings).</P>
      <P>In so far as trade union subscriptions are concerned, the rates vary between employments and trade unions.  Generally, the amounts involved are small and, in general, are graded according to the level of income.  Other deductions mentioned in the question such as VHI contributions and transport costs to work, would be matters for negotiation between the employer and his employees and are not regulated by legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it any wonder that 73,000 people left the country last year leaving 242,000 people still on the unemployment register when the Minister for Labour has done no studies into the net disposable income of those in employment <i>versus</i> those on social welfare?  I want to make it clear that I consider those on social welfare not very well looked after at all, but it is very clear to anyone who has done research in this matter that persons on the average industrial wage <Col N="1742" /> or less can be severely worse off.  Will the Minister agree that that trend has been accentuated by the budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the results of the research carried out by the Deputy and while I have found it interesting I could dispute some of the figures from my own experience, apart from the areas of my responsibility.  In the budget the Government endeavoured to take those in the low categories of pay out of the tax net thereby increasing their take home and disposable pay which, presumably, is what the Deputy would wish the Government to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Minister is primarily responsible for employment or has another Minister that responsibility?  What shocks me is that the Minister does not seem to understand why, despite four years of low inflation &mdash;below 3 per cent &mdash; and four years of trade surpluses we have had no perceptible increase in employment.  That comes as no surprise to me because the Government do not seem to understand what is involved in trapping jobs and what is preventing their creation.  The Taoiseach, in a non verbal intervention, indicates &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I did not get an answer to my question.  I should like to ask the Minister why, despite four years of inflation below 3 per cent and trade surpluses for four years, we have had no perceptible reduction in unemployment. In fact, unemployment among those over 25 years has gone up in the past two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The labour force survey of last April, the source of the latest figures, showed a reduction, not a major one.  The live register returns last week indicated that for the fourteenth month on the trot there was a reduction.  I do not think that answers the Deputy's question because he is trying to prove that people on low pay can end up with less than those on social welfare benefits thus highlighting a disincentive to work.  The Deputy has raised some interesting points but, as I said in my reply, they are budgetary and Revenue matters.  The Deputy will be aware that the generation of employment is primarily a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I have answered any questions that come within my ambit.  I should like to repeat that the decision to increase the thresholds and allowances for those on low pay will help those people.</P>

However, a grant cannot be paid until an amalgamation has been completed.  Accordingly no grant has been paid to the ITGWU or the FWUI in relation to the proposed merger of the two unions.

There are about 20 unions involved in talks on amalgamation, formally and informally, and if those talks are successful that figure will be reduced to 11. <Col N="1746" /> A number of other groups are either fraternal delegates to or relate to a SIPTU trade union in one form or another or related to other major unions.

      <P>Immediately following the explosion, industrial inspectors of my Department carried out a series of investigations and had extensive consultations with the company. Following their inquiries, the inspectorate reported to me that the incident occurred due to metal fatigue failure of a weld and subsequent rapture on a section of 24 inch pipe which was conveying process gases, resulting in an explosion and fire.  There were no personal injuries as a result of the incident and damage was largely confined to the plant.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, the company gave full information about works they proposed to carry out in order to ensure safe operations at the plant.  The inspectorate examined those proposals and satisfied themselves that appropriate remedial measures had been taken to allow a restart of the plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should explain for the Deputy's information that the plant at Marino Point <Col N="1747" /> comes under the requirements of the European Communities (Major Accident Hazards of Certain Industrial Activities) Regulations 1986.  The company are required to submit a notification under these regulations to the industrial inspectorate by July 1989.  This notification comprises a comprehensive safety case in which the company must demonstrate that an assessment has been made of all potential major accident hazards and that appropriate preventive and mitigating measures have been implemented.  In common with all such notifications under these regulations, the notification to be submitted by the IFI for the Marino Point Plant will be examined closely by the industrial inspectorate and will form the basis for the ongoing monitoring of the operation of this plant under the powers contained in the regulations.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the information.  It is of vital importance to the workers and the people who reside in that area.  They need to know that every possible precaution is being taken to ensure that there is not a recurrence of this.  Apparently the workers believe that a possibility still exists that there might be another explosion.</P>

      <P>I know that the explosion on the day before Christmas Eve caused great anxiety in the area. I would reassure the Deputy that the industrial inspectorate were satisfied with regard to the measures taken before they allowed a re-start at the plant.  The industrial inspectorate are also concerned about the implications of the incident and they intend to closely scrutinise the company's operation on an ongoing basis using their powers under the EC regulations mentioned in the reply.  The incident constituted a major accident as defined in the EC Directive 82/501 and it has been reported to the EC Commission under Article 11.1 of that Directive.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour (a) the number of people <Col N="1748" /> interviewed under the Jobsearch programme up to 31 December, 1988; following on from these interviews, the number of people placed in full-time, permanent jobs; the number sent on FÁS courses; and whether these Jobsearch course placements were net additions to the normal work of the National Manpower Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of people interviewed under the Jobsearch programme during the period 1 January, 1988 to 31 December, 1988, was 58,349. The number of job placements recorded by FÁS following Jobsearch interviews in 1988 was 6,266.  A total of 45,084 persons obtained places on FÁS courses and programmes under the 1988 Jobsearch programme broken down as follows:&mdash; Jobsearch Training Course, 11,656; FÁS mainline training course, 16,915 and FÁS employment schemes and programmes, 16,513.</P>
      <P>The National Manpower Service was absorbed into FÁS with effect from 1 January, 1988 and all the activities mentioned are now part of the normal work of FÁS.</P>
      <P>The Jobsearch interview and the Jobsearch training course were new initiatives specially developed for the National Jobsearch Programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister conceded that the figures for 1988 exceeded his expectations.  He said in the House that he had anticipated that 30,000 or 40,000 people would be interviewed under the FÁS scheme.  We now discover that 58,000 people have been interviewed.  In the first nine months since the introduction of the Jobsearch programme 140,000 people were interviewed.  In view of the fact that to date, 6,266 people only have been successful in securing employment, will the Minister agree that the Jobsearch programme has not been a success?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The actual figures for 1988 were slightly less than the figures given.  The Jobsearch programme was to try and help unemployed people, to give <Col N="1749" /> them skills, training or re-training as the case might be.  FÁS cannot guarantee jobs that are not there for the people they interview.  Since FÁS were established they have found 10,000 real jobs.  That is not to say they are the only jobs arising from the efforts of FÁS.  A survey of the social employment schemes has shown that a large number of people on those schemes obtained employment in their own right.  The 10,000 people I referred to were recorded on the FÁS register. FÁS, from an employment point of view, have been quite successful but it would be wrong to view Jobsearch from the point of view of employment alone.  The people who are referred to FÁS for training derive great benefit from that.  While the survey shows that a lot of people are not happy to be on the scheme and that some people do not want to be in any scheme, the majority are happy with it. Our latest survey on social welfare schemes shows that only 12 per cent of the people who worked on social employment schemes last year were unhappy. That is not a high percentage.</P>

Some of the people who partook in FÁS courses did not benefit a great deal from them. A young lady I know would not be entertained at the local employment exchange simply because she would not go on a FÁS course, She did not see why she should go back and do another course with them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare.  If we were only to train people for the jobs we have we would not train many people and our young people and people who require re-training would lose great opportunities to get a second chance.  The Deputy would not wish that to happen.  Jobsearch, along with the other programmes, has been very successful.  Naturally, I would like to see more people employed but that relates to the pick up in the economy and it is a slightly different matter.  In the meantime we should not avoid training people.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreements on pay negotiated in conjunction with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> provided that in October 1988 discussions would take place at national level between the Government, the FUE, the CIF and the ICTU on a general framework to allow for the implementation of a one hour per week reduction in working hours over the three year period of the national programme <Col N="1751" /> in cases where the normal working week is at or above 40 hours.  The discussions resulted in the successful conclusion of an agreement.  The agreement provides a framework within which employers and unions may negotiate a reduction of one hour per week.  These negotiations are to be carried on at the level at which basic pay and conditions of employment are normally negotiated.  Any further reduction in working hours would, of course, be primarily a matter for negotiation between the relevant interests.</P>
    <P>Deputies may also be aware that I have initiated a review of the Conditions of Employment Acts which specify statutory maximum permissible working hours for employees in industrial work.  I am at present in consultation with the FUE and ICTU in the matter.  It would not be my intention to reduce below negotiated norms maximum hours of work under these Acts.</P>

Can the Minister give any indication of the time-scale for the implementation of this recommendation which he has referred to as discussions to reach agreement over the three year period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery?</i> We are fast running out of time.  Will the Minister indicate when these proposals may come into play?  Has he or his Department any intention of promoting the idea?  While it has been agreed at national level one can anticipate a certain degree of resistance at local shop floor level, particularly from the employers side, at the start of the implementation of this very innovative idea.</P>

      <P>It will require some promotion and I will promote it.  The working group finished their deliberations on 27 January.  The Congress of Trade Unions at national executive level ratified it on 30 January and the FUE National Executive ratified it on 31 January. I am awaiting a meeting of the CIF next Tuesday.  As soon as they ratify the <Col N="1752" /> agreement it can be launched formally and it is open then to all the social partners to enter negotiations immediately to try to achieve the one hour reduction.  It will be subject to the points set out in the document when it was agreed that they would take into account productivity, the state of the company and other matters which would normally be taken into account when discussing pay and conditions. There should be no delay; certainly with regard to companies doing well there should be no delay at all.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour, in light of the proposed merger of the two largest unions in the State, if he will outline the proposals, if any, which he has to encourage further rationalisation within the trade union movement in the national economic interest.</P>

    <Col N="1753" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the voluntary nature of our industrial relations system, responsibility for trade union rationalisation rests largely with the trade union movement itself.  The role of the Government is one of encouraging and facilitating the process.  The Trade Union Act, 1975, was specifically introduced to facilitate and encourage the amalgamation of trade unions by simplifying the procedures and by making grants available towards the costs involved.</P>
      <P>While the response to the Act in the first few years of its operation was less than was anticipated, I am encouraged that a number of amalgamations have taken place in recent years and that many more are in progress or under active discussion at present.  Since 1970 the number of unions has declined from 95 to 74.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Act, grants may only be paid at present where trade unions successfully complete an amalgamation or transfer of engagements.  I accept that this can be a considerable obstacle to inducing unions to consider amalgamation options.  The Bill on industrial relations reform which is at present being drafted will provide that financial assistance may be available for expenses incurred in attempting an amalgamation or transfer of engagements even if the proposed amalgamation or transfer does not eventually go ahead.  I would hope that this measure will encourage further amalgamations among unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the proposals that the Minister says will be contained in the forthcoming legislation which I will support.  Would the Minister accept that the proliferation of trade unions here can present a problem to foreign investors contemplating this country as a place for investment?  Would he not consider that there is need for a more active part to be played by his Department in encouraging amalgamation as some interesting mergers are now taking place?  Finally, would he not accept that some of the most difficult <Col N="1754" /> industrial relations disputes tend to be those where there are a number of trade unions involved in the same workplace and that such disputes could be greatly reduced by an amalgamation process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with everything the Deputy says, with the exception of the suggestion that my Department are not taking an active role in this matter. Indeed, there have been more amalgamations of trade unions within my few years in office than in the period of office of all former Ministers for Labour. However, I am still not happy; I should like to see many more.  As I said earlier, there are approximately 20 unions engaged in negotiations of one form or another.  I agree with what the Deputy says that, looking here from abroad, foreigners are not impressed.  Indeed our records show that worker-<i>versus</i>-worker and inter-union disputes have been the cause of many industrial disputes over the years.  Where possible I am totally committed to the amalgamation of unions, as indeed is the trade union movement itself.</P>

      <P>I could not give the Deputy the figure off the top of my head but it would not be a large number. However, there has been concern expressed in recent years that that figure may grow.  Its prevention probably pre-empted some of the more recent amalgamations. However, there are not an awful lot and it does not present a great difficulty.</P>

Has the Minister been in contact with his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to ensure that there will not be any delays at that level?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>To what extent does present legislation provide for matters such as pension rights of existing trade union officials involved in amalgamations? Would he envisage some legislative provision to cover that aspect which I think is one of the difficulties hindering the implementation of a merger?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the difficult areas.  The present legislation does cover trade union officials over the age of 55 in the event of amalgamations, in that they could be assisted either by way of pension or early retirement.  It does act as a disincentive for small trade unions particularly. It should be borne in mind that there are a huge number of trade unions, particularly small ones which could not afford to provide attractive pension rights for their full-time officials.  Therefore, there is no incentive for them to become involved because, since they would have no money starting off, they could not resolve the difficulty.  That is one of the greatest difficulties the present legislation presents.  It is interpreted to mean that only when an amalgamation is signed, sealed and delivered by the office of the <Col N="1756" /> Registrar of Friendly Societies can they receive any moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>The Executive Bodies of the ITGWU and the FWUI have announced their intention to amalgamate and have expressed the hope that the new union will formally come into existence on 1 January 1990.  However, the final decision in the matter rests with the membership of both unions and the proposals will be circulated to all members for consideration and voting upon later this year. It would, therefore, be inappropriate for me or the Government to anticipate the results of the ballot and the questions of marking the merger does not arise at this stage.</P>
      <P>I would like, however, to take this opportunity to welcome the proposed amalgamation and to congratulate the leadership of both unions on this historic development.  I think this development bodes well for the rationalisation of Irish trade unions and it is my fervent hope that it will lead to an accelerated process in the direction of a unified and cohesive trade union movement.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if and when he commissioned a study on pension transferability in accordance with paragraph 4.30 (ii) of the White Paper on Industrial Policy; the outcome thereof; and if it has been published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of pension transferability, in the context of job mobility, was the subject of a study carried out in July 1984 by a firm of consultants at the behest of the then Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  A survey carried out at the time by the consultants involved did not show any significant impediment to job mobility as a consequence of the absence of transferability of pensions between occupational superannuation funds.</P>
      <P>In 1985 the Economic and Social Research Institute conducted a national survey of occupational pension schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In February 1986 the Government appointed the National Pensions Board whose terms of reference required them <Col N="1763" /> to submit to the Minister for Social Welfare detailed proposals as to the priority requirements for regulation of occupational pension schemes including, <i>inter alia</i>, transferability of pension entitlements. The board submitted their report which was published in April 1987.</P>
    <P>Following detailed consultations with the various interests involved, I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, will be bringing forward proposals shortly based on the board's recommendations.  In the circumstances it was felt that there was little to be gained from the commissioning of an expert study, such as that envisaged in the White Paper on Industrial Policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have a vested interest as well.  Those issues will arise when the Minister brings forward his legislation.  It is with issues like that that difficulty arises for people who at a relatively young age pay superannuation contributions to private insurance companies because when they change jobs they lose all their rights.  That is the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is broader and we will be discussing it at a later stage.  I have in mind people who are interested in entering politics and have spent maybe ten or 15 years in jobs prior to this.  Such people are debarred from transferring their pensions and they might be only four or five years here.  These people should be kept in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Commission first transmitted proposals for a directive on voluntary part-time work to the Council of Ministers in January 1982. Following consultation with the European Parliament, the Commission submitted revised proposals in January 1983.</P>
      <P>The proposals of the Commission are basically aimed at ensuring part-time workers should be treated the same as full-time workers, except where differences in hours of work objectively justify otherwise e.g. pay.  The proposals also sought to give priority to part-time workers in respect of full-time vacancies occurring in the establishment in which they work.</P>
      <P>The proposed Directive was discussed in detail in the Council in subsequent years but no agreement was reached.  A basic problem was the far-reaching consequences of the Commission's proposal, notably the fact that the Directive required legislative protection for part-time workers in areas where full-time workers are not covered e.g. in relation to occupational pension schemes.  The Directive was last discussed in the Council in January 1986 and the issue has not been on the Council's agenda since.</P>
      <P>As regards the situation in Ireland, I have initiated a review of the situation regarding part-time employment and, as part of the consultative process, have sought the views of both ICTU and the FUE.  When I have completed my discussions with both sides, I will decide on what action, if any, I should take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purpose of consultation with <Col N="1767" /> the FUE and the ICTU, I prepared a short note on part-time work and I can let the Deputy have a copy of this for his information.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that as a result of our PRSI system and of legislation, many employers tend to opt for part-time work below 18 hours a week to avoid the rigours of the legislation. This is causing a grey if not a black economy and is also very unfair to many employees.  In the circumstances will the Minister bring forward legislation as a matter of urgency, following his consultations, to attend to this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Deputy says.  Part-time work is a complicated area.  Some people work part-time because it suits them and there are certain thresholds and benefits for them but a large number of people are kept on part-time employment.  Some &mdash; I do not think there are too many &mdash; major employers use this system and it is not unknown that rosters of 17 hours, 50 minutes are drawn up in some of the major companies.  The people in that category work year after year for less than 18 hours a week and have no entitlements whatsoever under unfair dismissals, holiday, or maternity protection legislation, and this is wrong.</P>

      <P>That is correct.  It is unfair to those people and my proposals will be designed to help them.  Employers are concerned that any change in this area will rule out all part-time work but that will not be the objective of the proposals that I will bring to the House; it will be to give long-term part-time workers protection under legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the steps he intends taking to encourage employers in a drive against cancer in the workplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Commission has designated 1989 as European Year Against Cancer.  As part of their 1989 activities directed towards protecting the safety and health of workers, the industrial inspectorate and occupational medical service of my Department will be highlighting in a special programme for employers and workers the manner in which substances, which are used at work and could cause cancer, should be controlled and used.  One of the principal objectives of my Department during 1989, will be to encourage as many employers as possible to promote cancer information programmes at their workplaces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Industrial Safety Organisation (NISO) in conjunction with my Department and co-operation with the Irish Cancer Society have developed a more general cancer prevention information programme which will also be relevant to workers who share equally with the wider population risks from general life-style cancers.  This joint programme was launched last November and <Col N="1769" /> has already visited all regions with the objective of increasing awareness of European Year Against Cancer and also to let persons and bodies know what information, advice and resources are available for cancer prevention programmes.</P>
    <P>The National Industrial Safety Organisation, in collaboration with my Department and under the sponsorship of the European Communities has announced an International Conference on Cancer Prevention in the workplace to take place in Dublin next June.  Several European Communities Directives have been adopted or are under negotiation which, when implemented, will add to the measures aimed at preventing cancer amongst workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that measures are being taken at present in this field and every encouragement should be given in this regard.  There should be a greater awareness among employers in this battle.  I am not classifying all employers but many of them seem to lack the necessary awareness about cancer.  There are now quite a number of chemical industries in this country which were unknown to us in the past and it is important that every possible information is available to us on such industries in relation to cancer. The Minister should impress upon everybody concerned that the mobile X-ray unit should be again made available to industry so as to ensure that cancer can be detected at a very early stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his positive remarks.  The industrial inspectorate and the occupational medical service of my Department as well as individuals, even in their own time, are doing great work in conjunction with the Irish Cancer Society.  The opportunity should not be lost to try to highlight the difficulties involved and the results of modern research which are reflected in the Directives.  At European Social Affairs Council meetings the question of carcinogenic substances is dealt with and there is a far greater awareness than ever in this regard.  This year should be used <Col N="1770" /> to highlight the matter and I would ask for the support of the House in doing that.</P>
      <P>On the general front we have had regional seminars.  Indeed, I have participated in some of them, particularly those launched in Dublin.  There have been others which my colleagues in Government have launched around the country.  We are trying to get the workforce to carry out their own work programmes and their own awareness programmes.  That is something we are actively pursuing.  Some companies have been very helpful but there is a need to heighten awareness.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any thoughts on the problem of passive smoking and the implications of passive smoking for non-smokers who must work in places where there are many smokers? Would it be his intention to make provision in the forthcoming health and safety legislation to regulate the situation which aggravates many non-smokers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Deputy has probably seen the Draconian measures which he proposes to bring forward.  I would ban smoking completely but I do not think that would be acceptable.  The measures which the Minister for Health will shortly bring before the House will go a long way towards meeting the Deputy's wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

We have consulted with all the agencies, the Congress of Trade Unions, the Federated Union of Employers, Labour Court equality officers and a number of interested parties, including the Women's Political Conference where I raised my proposals.

Would the Minister not agree that the real value of the equality legislation which he undertook and on which a great many groups made submissions, shows the glaring gaps that still exist and need to be strengthened urgently?  Does he not share the concern of all the other Members of the House that the gap between men's and women's earnings is as large, if not wider, than it was ten or 12 years ago?  That is proof that the equality legislation as it now stands is inadequate.  I am concerned and would ask the Minister not to be talking in terms of 1992 but rather in terms of 1989.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 29 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>There are at present 67 trade unions of workers which hold negotiation licences with a total membership of 481,000. These are listed together with their membership in the tabular statement which I am circulating.  The unions are grouped into the following categories: General Unions (4), White-Collar Unions (36) and Craft and other Unions (27).  As many unions and in particular the general unions operate in a large number of sectors, it is not possible to say how many unions operate in each sector or industry.</P>
      <P>Figures on the number of unions are not available for all EC countries.  The position in each member state is outlined in a separate statement which I am also circulating.</P>
      <P>Number of Unions in EC Countries</P>
      <P>A report entitled: &ldquo;Trade Union Membership &mdash; methods and measurement in the European Community&rdquo; by Kenneth Walsh and published by Eurostat concluded that, because not all of the nine countries examined had strict definitions for what constituted a trade union, simple comparison of international figures on the number of unions was not possible. The Irish system of licensing is not the norm in Europe.  A number of other European countries have a strong confederated structure with affiliated organisations that by themselves would not be considered separate unions in the context used in other countries.  Extreme caution is advisable in drawing precise conclusions from the information which follows as it was gleaned from a wide range of published sources with different publication dates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1775" /> In Belgium, there are three major confederations. The two larger federations between them are organised into 31 national trade unions.  Figures are not available for the number of trade unions in the third federation.</P>
    <P>In West Germany there are four confederations of unions.  The two largest confederations have 17 unions each. There are also two smaller confederations &mdash; one for white collar workers and one for public service workers.</P>
    <P>In Denmark, there are 115 unions with over 500 members each, affiliated to six confederations.  There are also a number of unions which are not affliated to any confederation.</P>
    <P>In Spain, there are five confederations of unions and two main unions.  Three of the federations for which information on structures is available are organised into about 50 national industrial federations.</P>
    <P>There are five representative trade union confederations in France which have special legal status.  There are four other trade union confederations.</P>
    <P>In Greece, the trade union system is organised into three tiers.  The first tier is <Col N="1776" /> comprised of 3,500 associations, the next tier of 108 worker centres and 120 federations. The third tier is comprised of confederations of worker centres.  Confederations of worker centres are bodies which can conclude national collective agreements.</P>
    <P>In Italy, there are three confederations with 104 affiliated organisations.</P>
    <P>There are at present 67 licensed workers, trade unions in Ireland.  These are listed in a separate tabular statement.</P>
    <P>In Luxembourg, there are three main confederations.  Eight trade unions account for the bulk of trade union members.</P>
    <P>In the Netherlands there are three confederations with 48 affiliated unions and there are a further 243 trade unions which are not affiliated to any of these confederations, giving a total of 281 unions.</P>
    <P>There are 360 registered trade unions in Portugal.</P>
    <P>In the United Kingdom 367 trade unions were on the list of trade unions held by the British Certification Officer on 31 December 1987.  There are at present seven trade unions registered in Northern Ireland, giving a total of 374 unions.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the number of persons who have participated in the enterprise allowance scheme in 1987 and 1988 and who have successfully completed their first 52 weeks, thereby bringing about a situation where the employment which they created was self-sustaining and therefore did not require them to go back on the social welfare system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The numbers of people recruited to the enterprise allowance scheme in 1987 and 1988 were 2,381 and approximately 2,700.  The numbers who left the scheme having completed 52 weeks in those years were 4,118 and 1,974 respectively.</P>
      <P>A recent sample survey of individuals who entered the scheme between late 1984 and early 1986 indicates that (1) approximately 88 per cent of entrants to the scheme complete the full 52 weeks; (2) a further 21 per cent of businesses failed during the 13 weeks after the end of the enterprise period.  After that the failure rate tailed off; (3) two years after entering enterprise approximately 60 per cent of businesses were still in operation, 55 per cent full time.  There is no data on where drop outs go.  They may take up other employment, emigrate or return to the live register.</P>
      <P>Based on the survey recommendations, a programme providing an integrated package of training, advice and aftercare to assist enterprise participants is being piloted in the FÁS north-east region.  The scheme will be examined in the light of the results of this pilot.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister state if CERT or the hotel industry have paid their full contribution?  In the past they fell short of what was expected of them.  The Minister has not given me the figures orally which, frankly I would have preferred, in a tabular statement.  He said they have made an increased contribution but have they made the contribution in full?</P>

      <P>What I set out to do was to negotiate somewhere between £300,000 and £500,000 of a contribution from them.  Most of the hotels and guesthouses are now paying.  There is a change in the Finance Bill on the liquor licences for a contribution which will come back from the licence trade.  That is already agreed and it is in this year's Finance Bill. Is it only the hotel section the Deputy is interested in?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying essentially is that the industry have not paid a fair contribution and there is no reason they should get preferential treatment and be taken under the umbrella of FÁS.  One of the reasons they were kept out of FÁS was because they were supposed to increase their contributions but they have not done so.  The hotel catering industry are in a very privileged position inasmuch as they are the only section of the community whose staff are trained at <Col N="1782" /> a very small cost.  They have not honoured their obligations and for that reason the Minister should have a fresh look at the future of CERT to see whether they should continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the action taken by him in respect of second chance education in accordance with the Government decision announced in paragraph 4.29 of the White Paper on Industrial Policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The initial response to this particular provision of the White Paper on Industrial Policy was taken by my predecessor when he introduced the social guarantee in 1985.  More recently this has been up-dated by a joint initiative, announced by myself and my colleague the Minister for Education in October 1988 entitled Youthreach.  This programme became operational on 1 January of this year.  Youthreach is designed to give unqualified early school leavers the opportunity of special education and training programmes for a period of up to two years.  The ultimate aim of the programme is to assist these young people in getting a job or in re-entering the educational system so as to acquire further qualifications and thereby improve their chances of access to employment with a potential for advancement and progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that both of the measures to which he referred are concerned with young people who have recently left school? Would he further agree that there is a requirement for second chance education <Col N="1783" /> in regard to those who may be older and may have been at work for a number of years but who have become unemployed and who need retraining and, in some cases, an improvement in their basic education if they are to re-enter the workforce? Would he consider extending the provision of second chance education to include such people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly look at those areas.  Apart from Youthreach, many of the other FÁS training schemes cater for such people.  Only a very limited number of people can continue on social welfare and get back into second chance education.  There is a great need to expand that scheme and I will take a look at the areas where FÁS can help in second chance education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree the in many cases the problem is that people who were formerly manual workers find that manual work of the kind they were trained to do is no longer available, is technologically obsolescent, and that such people need to improve their basic education as distinct from skilled training?  Would the Minister agree that there is need for an active programme to be carried out by the Department of Education particularly as the numbers now entering schools are reducing and resources should be available to remedy the educational problems of the 100,000 or 110,000 people who have been unemployed for more than a year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health, in view of the grave concern caused by the latest outbreak of salmonella in County Donegal and to ensure that there is no repetition of the unnecessary panic and economic loss caused by the last reported incidence of salmonella in County Cork, if he will furnish all details concerning the Donegal outbreak, including the source and likely cause of the disease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The outbreak of salmonella food poisoning in County Donegal is under investigation by the North-Western Health Board.  The outbreak first came to the notice of the health board on 20 January 1989.  Eleven cases in all have been reported to the local director of community care and five of these cases required hospitalisation.  Seven of the cases were clustered in the New-towncunningham-Lifford-Raphoe area of County Donegal and the other cases are in South Donegal.</P>
      <P>The health board immediately took steps to phage the strain of the salmonella, to trace its origin and to prevent any possible spread of the infection.</P>
      <P>In seven of the 11 cases reported the infection has now been identified as salmonella enteriditis phage IV which is the same type as caused the recent outbreak of food poisoning in the Cork area.  In five cases the people who became ill had bought food from a mobile take-away and chicken has been implicated in two of these cases.  The health board are pursuing their inquiries to identify the source of the infection in the remaining cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1785" /> My Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food are closely monitoring the situation at central level.  As a reassurance to the general public I would like to reiterate assurances which I gave last month.  The public need have no concern about the consumption of poultry or poultry products once these products are cooked thoroughly.  They should purchase poultry from a reliable source and observe proper hygiene practices in preparation and cooking, particularly with regard to thawing out times and cooking at the correct temperatures.  Once these practices are observed there need be no concern.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, food purchased from a mobile take-away van has been implicated in five of the cases reported.  I have instituted measures to tighten up the food hygiene regulations in so far as they apply to mobile take-away operations and as from 1 March an annual licence will be required to operate mobile take-aways. A range of new provisions will apply including, in particular, a requirement that vulnerable foods will have to be stored at correct temperatures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his most reassuring reply.  Naturally I am delighted that he has taken on board the operation of certain types of cooked food outlets which seem to operate without any control.  I should like to ask the Minister what steps he has taken to ensure that the code of practice which he issued on 7 December has been fully and adequately implemented.  Is he satisfied that the cooking instructions embodied in that code of practice &mdash; which I believe are too general &mdash; are satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the health boards are carrying out their responsibility through their environmental health officers.  On 25 November 1988 we communicated to the chief executive officer of each health board and the secretary-manager of each voluntary hospital and other health institutions a communication reiterating the basic hygiene measures necessary in handling poultry and other foods.  I am satisfied <Col N="1786" /> that that is being done by the health boards.</P>
      <P>As regards the new food hygiene regulations that are coming into effect for outlets such as the mobile take-aways involved in this case, one of the regulations will be that transport for food can be used only for food.  It will also be necessary for all these take-aways to be registered; they will all be licensed.  It will also be necessary for them to report where they are buying their supplies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that when each case is reported a case history of the person involved is compiled?  If not, would the Minister accept the proposal that such a case history should be compiled covering the previous week's consumption of food by the person, where it was purchased, whether it was raw or processed, or whether it was consumed inside or outside the home, so that immediate and conclusive progress could be made in discovering the source of the contamination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>When a case of salmonella poisoning comes to light, it is reported to the Director of Community Care, the director in each health board area investigates either the single case or a number of cases such as in this particular outbreak.  The Director of Community Care makes every effort to trace the source of infection and deal with it. That has always been the practice.  As the Deputy mentioned earlier, we communicated with the health boards at the end of November and reiterated what is good practice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister now consider it desirable that a health <Col N="1787" /> warning be issued with all poultry and poultry products highlighting the need for proper cooking and proper defrosting? Could the regulations extend also to mobile ice cream parlours, for instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter is a separate question with regard to the food hygiene regulations.  On the question of the basic hygiene measures in handling poultry and other foods, these have been fairly widely circulated.  The health boards and environmental health officers provide facilities for advice to persons on the cooking of food.  Certainly, our Department, with the health promotion unit, can look into the possibility of further information being given.  For the benefit of Members of the House, I might go through the basic hygiene measures in regard to handling poultry and other foods.  These are: to obey the &ldquo;best before&rdquo; and &ldquo;eat by&rdquo; labels which are on the food; to refrigerate chilled or frozen foods as soon as possible after purchase; to store eggs in a cool place, preferably under refrigeration and to separate raw and cooked foods when storing.  The measures included the advice that eggs should be stored away from possible contaminants like raw meats and that cooked foods must be kept on a higher fridge shelf to avoid contamination from raw meat drips.  People were advised to thoroughly wash their hands, chopping boards, knives etc. used with raw food, to thaw all frozen meat, particularly poultry, totally before cooking, that stocks of eggs and frozen foods should be consumed on a &ldquo;first in, first out&rdquo; basis and unnecessary handling of food avoided.  It was recommended further that refrigerated food be stored below 10º celsius and that fridges be checked to ensure they operate effectively, that if hot food cannot be served immediatey, it should be kept above 63º Celsius, otherwise it should be cooled quickly to below 5º Celsius and stored in a fridge or freezer.  The remaining recommendations are: avoid contamination within the kitchen after cooking is complete; wash the hands thoroughly before and after preparation <Col N="1788" /> of food and always after using the toilet; do not touch the mouth, nose or hair while dealing with food; avoid coughing or sneezing near foods; keep cuts or burns covered with waterproof dressings; wooden surfaces are not easily cleaned and should be avoided when handling fresh meat; preparation surfaces, utensils and containers should be cleaned regularly and cleaned between the preparation of different dishes; all vulnerable foods, for example, cream cakes and desserts should be refrigerated; poultry should always be cooked thoroughly; do not have cooked food at warm temperatures or let it linger in a cooking oven or on the top of a hot cooker; protect all foods against insect contamination; cracked or dirty eggs should not be used; egg dishes should be consumed as soon as possible after preparation and egg dishes should be stored in a fridge.</P>
      <P>They were the recommendations that went out and, as the Deputy will appreciate, most of these are commonsense and are adhered to.  I agree that from time to time it may be necessary to promote these regulations.</P>

    <Title>Building Societies Bill, 1988: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members of <Col N="1810" /> the House who have spoken already on Second Stage of this Bill, I was raising some caveats regarding the extended powers and extended business being given to building societies in the Bill.  I was making the point that with the extra powers goes corresponding responsibility. The size of house mortgages, their length of term and the property value of the house itself are directly linked with the cost of building land.  The direct involvement of societies, according to the Minister, in the development of land for residential and other commercial purposes is a logical extension of the traditional business of these societies, namely the provision of loan finances for such development while the new power to own and develop land will, he hopes, be the basis for a new departure on the part of building societies in the housing sector.  I certainly hope it will be a new departure and I shall talk about that subject presently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meantime, with extra competition and very well-funded building societies now being able to trade and compete for building land, I am afraid that prices may be even more exaggerated.  Members of this House are aware that at times the cost of the building land alone is comparable with what the house should cost fully built.  The site represents a tremendous portion of the house purchase price.  We must be very careful about trying to control building land.  It has always been a matter of amazement to me, even in a free market such as ours, that overnight, building land can represent such a tremendous profit by being zoned, or through local authority services making it building land.  It is the purchaser of the land and the house purchaser later who pay the price for that.  The entrance of building societies into his competitive field may it is hoped ensure that building land is kept more reasonably priced than some of the escalating prices we have seen recently.  Such escalation would put the land out of the range and residential choice of a great many people.  All of us socially would hope for, and believe that we should have mixed housing and not <Col N="1811" /> ghettoes of high value and of low value houses but that is something we can explore further.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome Part VIII of the Bill which contains the promise of regulations by the Minister, if necessary, with regard to dealing with complaints of customers or abuses in the services being provided to consumers by building societies. I take the Minister's point that an Ombudsman-type arrangement could apply in relation to consumer complaints about services provided by the societies. The Minister suggests that perhaps the societies should set up a voluntary arrangement for dealing with these complaints, although he has rightly held the power to bring in statutory regulation in this context.  All of us like positively to encourage people to set up self-regulatory machinery but if these voluntary arrangements are not seen to work or if one or two of the building societies are reneging on their obligations, the Minister can act promptly to bring in regulations to ensure consumer protection. Perhaps if the building societies publicised arrangements for dealing with complaints in their widespread advertising householders whould be aware of their rights in this respect.  Too often the consumer who most needs protection is not fully informed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the whole thrust of the Bill with regard to mortgages.  There is an attempt to ensure fairness and justice for everyone.  During his speech the Minister said it is vital that societies should be seen to be run in the interest of their members. All of us would applaud that.  He also said it is important that the law should protect the rights of the ordinary members of building societies as mutual bodies and should give them a democratic say in the running of affairs.  There is a tremendous striving for representation and democracy and consumer rights running through this Bill.</P>
    <P>Up to now we have not had that sense of democracy with regard to directorships and decision-making in building societies due to the lack of representation of half the population, namely women.  I am <Col N="1812" /> referring to women as shareholders and house purchasers.  It is astonishing that in 1989 we can look at the boards of the various building societies and see either no women or the one token woman.  Since family homes are, on the whole, jointly owned, one of the joint owners is a woman.  Many single women are economically independent and can purchase houses in their own right.  It is of vital importance that women should be involved in the decision-making areas of these companies.  I particularly ask that affirmative action should be taken by the building societies to ensure fair representation.</P>
    <P>I would refer the building societies and anybody else interested in highly qualified, skilled women to the <i>Women in Management Directory 1988-89,</i> compiled by Network.  It is introduced by very successful and highly qualified women and contains over 600 names.  This is merely the first edition.  The glib reply that we do not have suitably qualified and experienced women is no longer acceptable. We cannot believe that any organisation is run in a democratic or representative fashion as long as the exclusion of women continues.</P>
    <P>I want to highlight another point which will require further legislation because of the loophole in the Family Home Protection Act, 1976.  On being tested in court it was found that a judgment mortgage had priority where a loan was defaulted upon in respect of a family home.  Women found, very often without knowledge of this legal precedent, that the family home had to be sold.  Up to 1976 the breadwinner was traditionally the sole owner of the house and the woman found herself in a totally unprotected and vulnerable situation without any legal entitlement to the house once the sale was forced.  We have been asking that the Bill dealing with the property of married couples should be introduced as quickly as possible to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>The building societies have been more than just business organisations.  They have been mutual societies, almost extended credit unions, which have given <Col N="1813" /> opportunities to people who, through their personal saving, would not have been able to raise the price of a house. The building societies have enabled a high level of home ownership and of security.  We must however, protect fundamental rights so that the family home does not come under threat from the building societies or the banks, if they engage in lending for house purchase. Judgement mortgages should not take priority over the central unit of society as they do at the moment, where property is more important than people.</P>
    <P>As chairwoman of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights I have received letters from many women all over the country who, as single people with a career and economic independence, have been turned down in regard to mortgages from house building or lending agencies or have been treated less fairly to the extent that when a sister and brother in comparable circumstances applied for a loan he got a mortgage and she was turned down.  That is obvious discrimination and if we are bringing in legislation to ensure justice and protection for consumers, we must demand fairness.  I know there have been improvements in some of the building societies, which I acknowledge. However, there is room for improvement and perhaps an Ombudsman-type tribunal could be set up to deal with the matter.  If further legislation is needed it should be introduced and debated here to ensure that there is justice for everyone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief because our general attitude towards this legislation has already been expressed by our spokesperson on the Environment, Deputy Quinn.  There are, however, two or three small points in the Bill on which I seek further clarification.  I am encouraged to do so by the rather ambitious opening sentence in the Explanatory Memorandum at which I looked this morning and which states that this Bill proposes to reform substantially the law on building societies and to replace with <Col N="1814" /> one comprehensive Act all existing building society legislation, namely, the Building Societies Acts, 1976, 1980, 1983 and 1986.  I certainly welcome that spirit of adventure which informs people in approaching an area like this.</P>
      <P>However, the ambition of the legislation having been expressed so generously, I was encouraged to reflect on some things which have not been clarified and which need clarification in relation to building society legislation.  Some of these have been touched on indirectly already by Deputy Barnes.  One point that seems to be still unresolved is an attempt to reconcile both the spirit and effect of some of the judgements based on the Family Home (Protection) Act, 1976. The thinking behind that Act &mdash; I remember it very clearly &mdash; was that it was an early and simple attempt to try to protect the family home.  Obviously it was not able to deal in an extended way with the concept of family property.  I was a Member of Seanad Éireann in 1976 when this matter was debated.  What emerged was the concept of the contribution of both spouses to the home and so forth. At that time there was a debate about the tremendous importance of the family and the enormity of their being dislodged from a home.</P>
      <P>In recent judgments based on the 1976 Act the concept was amplified and someone who was married to a person whose actions clearly damaged the family property could go to court and seek a certain kind of protection, that the asset, the family home, could not be endangered or eroded.  It went much further than that in relation to a number of cases.  I am thinking in particular of one judgement in which the judge spoke about the different efforts being made by the spouse to retain the house after the defaulting spouse had disappeared.  The judge gave a clear indication that we were straying into the area of building societies' legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill aims at amalgamating many different Acts and it is unresolved whether the legislation is founded on the concept that the building society and the person taking out the loan, have a central, contractual relationship.  I can make <Col N="1815" /> what I am saying very much simpler by giving a practical example in my own constituency.  It arose in the case of a couple who entered, in their joint names, into an arrangement with a building society.  Then the husband lost his job and made several attempts to find another in different occupations.  Automatically, I am raising another issue; we are facing into a situation concerning employment where this will become much less rare. How protected is such a person in relation to changing income standards? However, that is not the nub of my argument.  Later, the marriage of the couple to whom I referred got into difficulties and the woman was soon entirely reliant on social welfare.  She proceeded to make the payments to the building society and when the entire issue came to court the argument was made by the society that the contributions by the woman, because they were made from social welfare from her deserted wife's allowance, were not payments from income as envisaged in the original contractual relationship between the building society and the two spouses in better times when they had a single main income.  This crux as to whether money received through State subsidy constitutes an income in the same way is a problem in reconciling the spirit of the Family Home (Protection) Act, 1976, and the building societies' legislation. It is an unresolved dilemma for me.  That does not mean that a building society would not be reasonable with a client.  That is not the point.  The anomalous relationship between a society's relationship and their client is brought further by the difference between that and a new tenant purchase scheme being administered with the widespread recommendation of the Minister and the Department of the Environment.  The Minister for the Environment said yesterday in the Dáil that he was encouraging managers not to refuse any applications on the grounds that the person was not employed and was receiving social welfare.  However, I look in vain at the building society legislation to see where it is stated that an income <Col N="1816" /> derived from social welfare would be accepted as an adequate guarantee for a mortgage.</P>
    <P>That is not as simple a problem as the one of changing circumstances.  What is the position in relation to both spouses when they start? Let us say that he has an adequate income, a secure job.  You can take it in different stages as jobs are disappearing.  He then falls on more difficult times and perhaps the payments can be kept going.  However, let us say he abandons his responsibilities altogether and his wife is in receipt of the deserted wife's allowance.  Let us say she can manage some of the time.  What is the position in relation to what constitutes income in terms of what will be stated in court? I am making a legal point, that a statement as I understand it can be made that while she has made payments to the society they are not instalments within the definition of that word in the original relationship between a society and its member.  There is no point in imagining that that legal difficulty does not exist. I would welcome the Minister of State commenting on the difficulty I have described and perhaps tackling it through the use of a simple form of words.  Maybe I am misconstruing the matter.  I am not a legal person but I am dealing with the interpretation of the words, as I understand it, in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other points I would like to make.  The provisions contained in many parts of the Bill are welcome. Above all else, the purpose of this Bill is to create a level playing field on which the banks and the building societies can flake away at the public for their benefit and the benefit of their shareholders and I am sure that this will appeal to the primitive sense of equity which informs such people who pursue profit. With reference to the origins of the building societies, I think we would all be living in the land of illusion if we thought that their origins were philanthropic.</P>
    <P>I am intrigued, and other speakers have referred to this, by the use of Central Bank in such a wide role.  This to some extent is welcome provided we also retain control over the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1817" /> We may need, however, to amend the Central Bank Acts so as to make them more amenable to the credit policies of the Government.  A very interesting set of circumstances arises in this land of the absurd.  Effectively the rate of credit, as constituted by a housing loan, a mortgage or whatever one may wish to call it, is fixed by the marketplace and relates to the price of money at a particular time. It is as if people then have an afterthought and start to operate a system of mortgage interest relief which, as we know, is massively regressive.  Its regressivity is not entirely mitigated by the lowering of the ceiling, as occurred in recent budgets.</P>
    <P>If we are to create such a relationship between the Central Bank and the building societies, referred to so comprehensively in so many sections and expressed so minutely that it would be able to act as an advertising standards agency, we may also be able to whisper to them in relation to the overall rate for housing finance.  The public might welcome this.  The bundle of assets, as constituted by the housing stock of a country, is quite different in its character from all other kinds of assets.  One of the appalling failures of the Irish banking system is that it has been unable to establish any discriminatory levels, in terms of risk, in interest rates.  The only thing we know about the Irish banking system, apart from its deep dependence on a British model of banking, is that it has a limited concept of collateral.  Traditionally, the Irish banking system has required more collateral and required it in an asset form defined in a very limited way.  It does not accept long term risks or technology's patents as collateral for investment and so on and its interest rates are also sloppily high as a result of high administrative costs.</P>
    <P>The money of the banking system is now going into the financing of housing. Many say that this is a good thing, perhaps it is but that is an argument for another day.  I want to be very straight-forward about what is happening.  At present we are living with a statistical fallacy that because of the decline&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is that this legislation will be directed more and more at the total volume of homes that will be occupied in the decades to come.  We are moving away from a position where the State provides a certain component of housing. The invitation to the banking system to become involved in financing the provision of homes cannot be understood outside of the context of the retreat by the State from the provision of housing. People have justified the State's retreat on what has been suggested is a decline in population.  But that misses the point that even though we have a declining population, the age at which people marry is lower, there are more marriages and couples have fewer children, with the result that there are more households. Therefore, the market for houses is getting bigger and this will be serviced by the building societies.  If the State is to play a smaller role, the conditions we define for the marketplace will have to take into account the conditions of the larger society and that society will be characterised by a decreasing long term security of employment.  In the United States, for example, the average person holds three different occupations during the course of his lifetime.  A number of insecurities may also have to be addressed by way of transfer payments and a different kind of social provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am now back at the point where I started: how useful is the principle of simple contract in informing the relationship between the client of the building society and the society without taking into account the responsibility of meshing <Col N="1819" /> this legislation with the other types of security that are offered in social legislation, however narrow it may be, such as the Family Home Protection Act?  I quoted only one model case, I could think of many others, but I would like the Minister when replying to state what would be the position of those in receipt of transfer payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great interest to the contributions of Deputies Higgins and Barnes.  I have also read the contribution of the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>Some of the provisions of this Bill are welcome, but there is a necessity for our building societies, banks, financial institutions, insurance companies and so on to gear themselves up to face the challengers which they will be confronted with on the advent of open competition in 1992.  The relaxation of exchange controls has meant a greater flow of money, both into and out of this country, for investment purposes.  During the next few years it is quite likely that British building societies and those of other European countries will establish in this country in direct competition with our building societies, who need to gear themselves to face this competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the House that we may face a number of dangers.  We are gearing ourselves towards the American, British and European economies, all of which have been geared in large measure towards affluence and what on occasions can be regarded as enterprise and sometimes as greed.  The building societies are profit making organisations at present but they were not originally designed for making profit.  The concept of building societies was of a group of people coming together with the objective of setting up a society to provide for purchase of their own homes.  Entrepreneurship is wonderful, but the main business of building societies is to provide mortgages for families who are setting up their own homes. That is the basic line of business of these societies, but they have strayed.  It is all right to stray a little bit but they should <Col N="1820" /> not lose sight of their original objective. Look at section 29 in the Bill &mdash; financial services.  Section 30 is in regard to bonds and sureties.  Section 31 provides for conveyancing services and section 32 for auctioneering services and other services relating to land.  It appears now that a building society will provide you with the finance to buy your home.  It seems too they will provide you with the funds to take out life insurance on yourself and your wife, carry out conveyancing in regard to your house, and finally will be able to action your house.  That must seem like utopia for many people, but let us see what lies behind it.</P>
    <P>A young couple of 22 to 24 years of age marry and they may be innocent about what is involved in setting up home.  They know little about finance. They go to a building society and are told there to get their fire insurance in whatever company the building society recommend.  They are told to go to another insurance company to take out life assurance and to an auctioneer if his services are required.  The building society will say they are doing the conveyancing too.  That could be very dangerous.</P>
    <P>Let me give the Minister an analogy related not to his Department but to the Department of Industry and Commerce. It is as near as I can go to drive home the point.  The PMPA were set up originally with one objective, to provide motor insurance at a reasonable price for the Irish motorist.  That seemed simple, beautiful and ideal and everybody moved towards them.  Everything was going well and then they started to go into different areas.  The bought numerous garages in which they carried out repairs to cars. Then they bought a Sunday journal &mdash; they were into the newspaper business. Then they presented their own magazine which the could circulate to motorists.  If the Minister will excuse me for saying so, around election time they were an excellent propaganda machine for a political party of which he happens to be a member.  I do not say that in any disrespectful way, but that happened to be the facts of life at the time.  The <i>Sunday <Col N="1821" /> Journal</i> was not a success for them, but they went on from there.  They bought McBirney's and property in Wolfe Tone Street and other properties &mdash; you name it.</P>
    <P>The PMPA were good when they were dealing with car insurance alone but they strayed from their objective and wandered all over the place.  Who now is carrying the can for their mistakes?  Poor Sean Citizen right across rural Ireland and in Dublin is carrying the can for people who lost sight of their original objective.</P>
    <P>The Minister is here with his advisers from the Department of the Environment, and they are most welcome.  As a humble backbencher I want to ask whether the building societies have lost sight of their original objective.  I think they have.  I will give an example.  Tiered interest rates were to be done away with; they are back.  No fee was to be levied on the borrower by the building society. That was provided when Deputy John Boland was Minister for the Environment. In regard to any couple buying a house no legal fees were to be paid to the building society.  Perhaps some societies are not charging fees, but I have proof of two who are doing so.  I have that proof here in black and white and I can show it to the Minister.  I do not intend naming any people involved. However, it is time this was highlighted.</P>
    <P>In regard to a building society here in Dublin the society's solicitor's fee &mdash; which they say is restricted &mdash; is £80; stamp duty on the purchase deed is £330 &mdash; that outlay is understandable.  The Land Registry fees on the mortgage are £50.  The Land Registry fees on the transfer are £100.  The land Registry fee on vacate is £10 and the cost of the Land Registry folio map is £6.  Those are all outlay, but the fee for attending, closing, stamping and registering the deeds is £25, postage, telephone, printing, forms and sudries £15 and stamp on policy £5.  The total for the solicitor's fee, stamping etc. of deeds and postage etc. comes to £120 plus VAT at 25 per cent, £30, a charge of £150.  There was to be no charge by building societies on loans.  Charges were <Col N="1822" /> to be absorbed.  The other items I have given total £501.  The total due from that poor young couple was £651.  That is a mountain of money, a huge headache for them.</P>
    <P>I have another bill here from a different building society to prove, as the saying is, &ldquo;They are all out of step except my son John&rdquo;.  In my view they are all in step.  This is going on across the board. Stamp duty on the mortgage is £25; the stamp duty on the deed of variation is £5; Land Registry fees and transfer, £150; fee for attending at closing of purchase, stamping and registering deed and completing registration in Land Registry, where necessary, £8; requisition for land certificate, £10; postage and incidentals, £10, making a total of £208.  There is a further bill for the same couple on the following lines: fee for stamping and registration of purchase deed £50; outlay not chargeable to VAT, which included a considerable amount of stamp duty on the deed, £1,280.  Between outlay, VAT and so on the bill came to £1,587.</P>
    <P>I was under the impression that those charges would be done away with but that does not appear to be the case.  The real danger is that building societies will act for the auctioneer, the vendor and the purchaser.  We must all remember that once legislation is passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas it is very difficult to have it amended.  There is no doubt that the road the Minister is travelling is filled with land-mines.  People are in danger of having the independent and objective advice that has been available to them until now whittled away.</P>
    <P>Members will have read the story in yesterday's national newspapers under the heading, &ldquo;Building society ordered to give home back&rdquo;.  In regard to that story I should like to quote from a deed of mortgage for the information of the House.  The Minister of State, as an auctioneer, has dealt with many of the issues being raised in the course of this debate down the years and he will be familiar with the points I am raising.  The deed of mortgage states:</P>
    <P>(A)  Notwithstanding the covenant <Col N="1823" /> hereinbefore contained for payment of the principal sum and interest by monthly subscriptions the whole of the principal sum, interest and other moneys payable under this mortgage shall immediately become due and payable by the borrower to the society and shall be recoverable by the society with interest thereon at the current rate (as well after as before any judgment) from the time of the same so becoming payable and the power of sale and other powers and authorities conferred on mortgagees by the Conveyancing Acts, 1881 to 1911, the registration of Title Act, 1964, and the provisions of the said Acts except in so far as the same are hereby varied and extended may (subject to any order of the court thereby required and subject to the provisions contained in section 20 of the Conveyancing Act, 1881 restricting the powers of sale) be exercised without notice to the borrower in any of the following events&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the conveyancing powers and so on that it is intended to give to building societies.  My concern is that when building societies are given total control of conveyancing young couples will not be in a position to get independent advice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Deputy's intention to point to a weakness in the proposed legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  The deed continues:</P>
      <P>(i)  If the borrower shall fail to comply with the convenant for payment on his part contained in clause 2 (A) hereof;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  If default shall have been made for three months in the payment of <Col N="1824" /> some monthly subscription interest or other money hereby secured;</P>
    <P>That deed entitles a building society to enter the property.  In the High Court in Dublin on Monday the Irish Civil Service Building Society were ordered to deliver up possession of a County Dublin home which it had repossessed because of mortgage payment arrears.  In that case Mr. Colm McCormack of Shenick Lodge, Skerries, County Dublin, borrowed £38,000 in 1980 and had made sizeable repayments between then and 1988.  The arrears due, including interest, was £1,879 and, without notice or a court order, the building society entered into possession of his home.  According to the report of the court proceedings, Mr. McCormack had left his family possessions in the home.  In my view there is a danger that we will give too many powers to building societies.  If we allow them into auctioneering and conveyancing I have no doubt that the next thing that will happen is that they will get involved in life assurance.  That will be a minefield.</P>
    <P>I wonder what will happen if a building society runs into financial difficulties.  As far as I am aware, the existing societies are financially sound and I accept that there is a proposal in the Bill to bring them under the control of the Central Bank, but if something goes wrong there is no doubt that the taxpayer will be asked to take up the tab.  The Department of Industry and Commerce were responsible for supervising the PMPA; yet that company ran into financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be told in years to come that I am being wise after an event. We are asking the Central Bank to undertake a huge task when we are making them responsible for the control of building societies.  It is dangerous to give them that responsibility.  In the event of mistakes arising it will be the taxpayer who will have to pay the bill and that is not good enough.  I suggest to the Minister that the majority of the big societies are not seeking the powers he is conferring on them.</P>
    <P>The Minister was pressured by a select <Col N="1825" /> number of building societies to pursue this measure.  The Minister should hasten slowly as he is entering into a very dangerous area.  Family homes and farms are near to the hearts of Irish people.  We have had a most difficult history.  There is plenty of money to be had from building societies at the moment, but I would not like to see people make the mistake that the farmers made, by over-borrowing. Radio, television and newspapers are constantly advertising for building societies. Those advertisements are paid for with investors money.  I fear that many people will borrow too much and the advice given to people will be very limited. Difficulties will arise for many people.  In the future the High Court will not give possession of a house to a person like they did yesterday in Dublin.  In a lot of instances peoples' homes will be repossessed.  That is not a desirable development.</P>
    <P>We have to gear ourselves to cope with the entry of foreign finance companies and building societies to Ireland, but we have to be careful in granting new powers to building societies.  We should ensure that we put a curb on any foreign society conducting business here.  In the long run families who are unable to pay their loans will be in most difficulty.  Because of the availability of building society money and the limited number of local authority houses being built I would urge people to exercise caution.</P>
    <P>The south of England is the boom area in Britain and many of the rich people in the south are buying houses in Wales and Scotland.  They are buying holiday homes and second homes and so on in the seaside resorts.  Many of the local people do not accept this trend.  I am sure the Minister and people in the Department of the Environment are aware, although it has not been publicised to a great degree, that there is a widespread arson campaign in parts of Wales and Scotland due to the fact that people in the middle income brackets who have lived in those seaside resorts all of their lives are not able to buy homes at a reasonable cost. An ordinary house worth £30,000 in these areas is now selling at £60,000 or £65,000, <Col N="1826" /> double the market value, to people coming from the south of England.  A number of houses bought as holiday homes and second homes have been burned.  That fact can be checked and verified.  If house prices here become too high and if local authorities do not provide the necessary houses there will be a shortage of houses coming on the market. In that climate it is likely that young couples will over extend themselves in borrowing.  While some of this legislation is necessary it is going too far and the Minister would be wise to re-assess it.</P>
    <P>We need to take greater care in dealing with building societies.  An inordinate amount of money, investors money, is being spent by the building societies on advertising and on building huge office blocks.  I have criticised some of the measures and I have criticised the building societies but I take this opportunity to acknowledge the contribution of the building societies to Irish society.  We have the highest percentage of home ownerships in Europe.  We are way ahead in that field.  Building societies have contributed enormously to this and we owe them a debt of gratitude.</P>
    <P>Many in the building society movement are not anxious to expand into the fields being opened up in this legislation. Some of the senior people in the building society movement will have great reservations about this Bill.  The Minister would be wise to re-examine the Bill and to withdraw some of the sections.  The building society movement has served us well but let us be careful with regard to the powers we are granting them.  These powers have been requested by only a limited number of building societies.</P>
    <P>This is the first opportunity I have had to speak in the House since Deputy Connolly was appointed Minister of State.  I wish the Minister continued success in his Department and I compliment him as a hard working and sincere man.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Mine will be a two minute contribution arising from the fact that I came here proposing to speak on the Central Bank Bill.  While waiting and <Col N="1827" /> listening to some of the interesting contributions my mind strayed to the substance of the Bill.  My two worries are that the control on advertising provided for in the Bill does not seem to extend to actually controlling the proportions of money to be spent on advertising.  Is there not, particularly in the case of the building societies, a good ground for giving the Central Bank the right to control in gross terms, or in proportionate terms or in some form of ratio relative to assets, the amount of money that can be spent on advertising in any given year?  Secondly, I noticed when reading a book on the Central Bank and its role, that it has required of the banks over which it has control that they must seek permission before they open any new branches.  This was done in 1981 on the basis that the Central Bank believed at that time that there was a superfluity of branches and that this was an unnecessary cost in the banking system.  I get the feeling that a lot of money has been invested in building society branches, that there is an enormous number of these branches.  I wonder if the Central Bank will have the same power &mdash; this does not seem to me to flow from anything contained in the Bill &mdash; to say to building societies that they must get permission before they start opening up additional branches or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems with regard to building societies is that they are not really accountable to their shareholders in the sense that shareholders do not look to them for a dividend income in any real sense of the world.  Therefore, there is a tendency on the part of the controlling group, the board of directors of a building society, to spend more than I think is a justifiable amount on competition with other building societies and in endeavouring to increase their share in the marketplace, which is not really in the interest of their members.  That is not an absolute interest for building society shareholders in the same sense as it is for competing banks' shareholders.  I am <Col N="1828" /> worried sometimes, looking at the buildings bought by societies in Dublin, at the amount of money spent on them, the amount of money ploughed into their branches.  For instance, in Rathmines there was a very elaborate branch built recently on the corner of Rathmines Road and Castlewood Avenue.  I wonder whether it was a financially prudent investment, just from the look of it, and the amount of money it appeared to consume in its construction.  Indeed I wonder whether the investors' interests were being looked to first or whether it was not in that case &mdash; which is only representative of every building society; I do not want to single it out &mdash; indicative of a desire to empire build, with a huge cash flow, a huge set of assets rather than provide money for house purchase and property-related finance.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the Central Bank have sufficient powers under the provisions of this Bill to really direct building societies to keep their costs down, to keep down their management costs, cost of investment in offices, in advertising and cost of competition between building societies.  I wonder whether it is right or wrong in such circumstances that, for instance, Barry McGuigan's fight in Las Vegas should have been sponsored by a building society.  One wonders whether a bank would sponsor a fight in those circumstances if there were shareholders going to an annual general meeting who really felt the loss of dividend.  I wonder, too, whether there is the same degree of accountability.  Because I do not believe there is the same degree of competitive pressure on building societies to minimise their costs there is a greater case to be made for giving the Central Bank the right to force building societies to behave themselves in relation to the expenditure of money on promotion advertising, infrastructure, management and the like. There is an element of waste there I would find difficult to justify.  Indeed the volume of television advertising sometimes frightens me.</P>
    <P>In that context, and because shareholders' interests are not as strong a force in the building society movement as they <Col N="1829" /> are among the commercial banks, should there not be some pressure from the Central Bank to stop competition among building societies because the societies are not there to compete with each other? It does not matter to the average investor in a building society whether his society grows or contracts, or has three-quarters of the market or one-quarter at the end of any given year.  He has not invested in the building society to gain an increased market share.  In that sense it concerns me that there does not seem to be, within the provisions of this Bill, a controlling power on the part of the Central Bank to keep down those costs and ensure that building societies &mdash; which are not at present commercial concerns, unless they turn themselves into public limited companies under the provisions of this Bill &mdash; are not really expected to operate on commercial grounds.  Therefore, I wonder whether it would not be right for the Central Bank &mdash; at any rate as long as building societies remain mutual societies as opposed to public limited companies &mdash; to put huge pressure on them to keep their costs down.  Their shareholders &mdash; and probably every Member of this House is a shareholder in a building society &mdash; never really are consulted to the extent to which their moneys are used to advertise for an increase in market share, or whether their moneys are really necessary to double the size of the branch network.  I should like to hear the Minister's views in relation to those issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I join previous speakers in welcoming many provisions of this Bill. Overall it is to be welcomed.  I am convinced that the powers of building societies should be extended because it is my firm belief that, in recent years, they have been operating somewhat within a strait-jacket. After all, they have played a major part in the development of the private ownership of houses here.  We have the highest number of privately-owned dwellings anywhere in Europe. That progress is to be welcomed.  It is also important that the building societies be in a position to compete with the Central Bank in the marketplace because <Col N="1830" /> competition is healthy.  Therefore, it is only right and proper that their powers be extended in this regard.</P>
      <P>There are a couple of points which concern me and which have been raised by each of the last two speakers.  One has to do with the question of advertising for funds.  One's attention is drawn regularly to such advertising whether on the part of the commercial banks, the building societies or any other financial group seeking funds.  There appears to be tremendous competition for those funds without any reference whatsoever to shareholders.  I have never known of any shareholder to be consulted about this type of advertising campaign.</P>
      <P>When one travels through any town or city today one cannot but notice one premises bigger and better than another owned by one of those different financial groups.  One cannot but ask if there is any need for this type of empire building, these massive office blocks to be seen in the capital and other towns throughout the country.  For example immediately funds became available, when the money market freed up why was it necessary for building societies to switch over to investment in such large office blocks? Such investment is questionable.  We all witnessed what happened the ACC.  This took place in my county, as it did in the Minister's, when some ten years ago the ACC built and staffed a chain of offices across the country, many of which have had to be sold resulting in the loss of vast amounts of money.  It has been clearly stated that the same body lost a lot of money on account of the depression in agriculture.  However, what was never emphasised was the amount of money they lost because of their efforts to build those office blocks throughout the country. These are matters the Central Bank should have power to control &mdash; what I might describe as empire building &mdash; also the competitive element and advertising for funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point has been well made about the level of sponsorship.  We witnessed one building society becoming involved in a very expensive sponsorship.  One must ask whether that was the purpose <Col N="1831" /> for which the building societies were established and whether it was necessary for them to have become involved in such sponsorship.  Was it necessary for them to have expended such huge amounts of money on a particular sponsorship?  It is my belief that it would never have been the wish of their members that they should have become so involved.  Again one wonders how often the wishes of their members are taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>We need to be extremely careful about the conveyancing of property and about the possibility of introducing amendments, because the system that has obtained to date, has served the country and its people well.  I do not think that handing these powers over to building societies will improve the speed, efficiency or effectiveness with which conveyancing can be carried out.  Deputy Enright has already outlined the charges being imposed by building societies for it.  We should be very careful about extending the powers of building societies in that regard.</P>
    <P>I find that the major difficulties in conveyancing lie with the Land Registry where registration is held for months or years, leaving people on bridging finance at very high interest rates.  We all know what happened some years ago when interest rates were high and people were crucified paying the interest on bridging finance because deeds were held up in the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the question of building societies getting involved in the property market, in building apartments and so on.  Some 12 or 14 months ago the Minister expressed the wish that building societies would get involved to a greater degree in funding mortgages for those building houses privately, so much so that the SDA loans scheme was practically closed down because, to get a mortgage from the county council under the fixed interest loan scheme, one had to have a letter from the building society and the bank stating that one had been refused by them.  That has extended to a <Col N="1832" /> very large degree the number of mortgages granted by building societies over the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>There were also a number of people who changed to endowment mortgages. I wonder is the suggestion that building societies get involved in the property market another step from the removal of SDA loans from private individuals by and large, to the handing over of responsibility for local authority housing? Are we going to find building societies building local authority housing which would be rented out at subsidy?  The Minister said he sees building societies getting involved in this market.  I wonder if he envisaged transferring to building societies some of the responsibility which prior to this lay with the Department of the Environment?  Perhaps the Minister would refer to this when he is replying.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes talked about the cost of sites.  That is probably something the Minister and I, because of the part of the country we come from, are not very conscious of.  I wonder if the building societies getting involved in development and building land will fuel the price of these lands so that we will end up eventually with higher cost housing than we have today.  This is something we need to avoid.</P>
    <P>I believe the new powers in this Bill will eliminate the peaks and valleys in the way building societies get their finances and will leave them in a position to get a greater flow of funds throughout the 12 months of the year.  Healthy competition is a good thing, and these new powers will help to create that.  I hope that in the years ahead building societies will be able to compete with the commercial banks for the business of county councils, health boards, vocational educational committees and the like and provide a service at a keen rate.  Nowadays all these bodies are paying considerable charges to the commercial banks which, when they were set up, were trying to get business and there were no complaints about charges. However the boot is on the other foot now and they want to charge for every service.  I look forward to the day the building societies will be able to compete <Col N="1833" /> and provide a better service at a cheaper rate than some of the commercial banks are doing at present.  In addition banking hours at present are from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and I have no doubt that the competition created by the building societies will eliminate that.</P>
    <P>Another area for concern is tiered lending.  It is envisaged that it will be reintroduced.  I object to it.  I do not agree with the principle and I believe we should keep as far away from it as possible.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the delays in the Land Registry and I would ask the Minister if there is anything either he or his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, can do to eliminate the long delays in that establishment.  People are often held up on bridging finance for quite a long time, unable to get their deeds out of the Land Registry.  This has caused major hardship for many young families starting out.  I hope the Minister will be able to use his good offices to have that cleared up as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the Bill.  I have the reservations I have already outlined and I hope the Minister will introduce amendments on Committee Stage to prevent my worst fears coming to pass.</P>

      <P>First I would like to thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate on this important Bill.  I found their contributions generally useful and constructive.  I am glad to note that there is general support in the House for this new legislation.  Nevertheless, quite understandably, many Deputies raised questions and had suggestions to make.  I will try now to respond to as many of these as possible. I can assure Deputies that all their suggestions have been noted and will be considered in detail prior to the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter expressed some concern about the regulation making powers contained in sections 4 and 5 of the Bill. I do not see that this will have the feared effects.  Section 4 gives the Minister a limited power to remove, by regulation, difficulties in bringing any provision into <Col N="1834" /> effect.  This applies to other legislation also, namely, the Farm Tax Act, 1985, the Canals Act, 1986.  As has been said already, this is a complex Bill but we will be able to tease out all these matters on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Many of the provisions in the Bill correspond to provisions in companies and banking legislation.  Section 5 simply provides the mechanism by which the building societies legislation can be kept in line without the need for amending primary legislation.  Deputy Shatter was very concerned about tiered rates.  As was mentioned in the Minister's opening speech, section 24 will ensure that existing loans will not be affected and that future borrowers can only be charged a tiered rate where such a rate is charged from the day the loan is drawn down, the mortgage provides for a tiered rate and the borrower accepts in writing that he will have to pay a tiered rate.  When section 24 is brought into force societies will have the choice of charging tiered rates but this is no more than other financial institutions have at present.  I firmly believe that to maintain the ban on tiered rates would not be to anybody's advantage.  Whatever justification there may have been for it in 1986 there is none for continuing the ban on future loans having regard to the substantial changes in the market conditions since then and to the whole thrust of the Bill which is to allow societies to compete on an equal basis.  It is open to the person who is applying for the mortgage to decide if he is prepared to pay a tiered rate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter indicated that he thought the Bill was unclear as to the respective responsibilities of the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank.  Briefly, under the Bill the Central Bank will be the regulatory and supervisory authority in relation to societies.  It will regulate and supervise societies on a day to day basis and is being given many powers for that purpose including the power to make regulations in relation to certain key matters such as rules to be adopted by societies. The bank will exercise its power as an independent authority.  Neither the <Col N="1835" /> Minister for the Environment nor the Minister for Finance will be able to tell the bank how to do its job.  The Minister for the Environment, in addition to being responsible for legislation in relation to societies will also have the job of making regulations in a limited number of key areas such as securitisation under section 18 (6) and in regard to the application of the deposit protection scheme under Part IX.  The power to make regulations in these areas is being reserved to the Minister for the Environment because they involve issues of policy extending beyond the regulatory and supervisory responsibilities of the Central Bank.  The same argument applies to the even more limited number of areas where regulation making is reserved to the Minister for Finance &mdash; conversion regulations under section 108 &mdash; and the Minister for Justice and regulations on conveyancy and auctioneering under sections 31 and 32 respectively.  Regulations to be made by the Minister for Justice on conveyancing or auctioneering or by the Minister for the Environment on securitisation will not be confused with or undermine the job of the Central Bank but will complement it.  It will be a matter for the bank to decide on prudential grounds whether a society should undertake a particular activity.  In doing so the society will have to comply with any regulations that may apply.  It should also be noted that ministerial regulations must be prepared in consultation with the Central Bank.</P>

      <P>Many Deputies spoke about the new powers that would be given to building societies.  It is a matter for them as to how they will transact their business in the future.  Deputies can take it that under the supervisory powers being given to the Central Bank a close eye will be kept on the Societies' operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDowell raised the point about advertising by the building societies. That is a matter for the societies.  If <Col N="1836" /> any member of a building society is not happy with its advertising and the amount that is spent in that way, it is open to that member, at the annual meeting of the building society, to question it and to put forward a proposal.  As Deputies know, all the financial institutions engage in high powered advertising.  Many people say this is a good thing because it is freeing up the market.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with housing in which I am directly involved.  It gives the house purchaser a greater opportunity to see what is available to him or her and then it will be a matter for him or her to decide.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn referred to the need for a wider range of mortgage products to cater for specialist needs in the housing market.  I agree that there is scope for a range of mortgage products tailored to the needs and circumstances of certain categories of people.  This is recognised in the Bill.  I appreciate the point made by Deputy Quinn on the scope for mergers between societies.  I am not too sure, however, that there is much that a Minister for the Environment can or should do in this area except provide a sound statutory basis for mergers.  The provision on mergers and transfers have been updated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Farrelly expressed concern about the implications of the Bill for family firms in areas such as conveyancing and auctioneering services.  If societies choose to get involved in these areas it will give rise to additional competition. On the other hand, it should be noted that at present there is no restriction on who may provide auctioneering services provided they obtain a licence under the Auctioneering and House Agents Acts.  The provisions for these and other services in the Bill are logical extensions of the existing functions of societies.  There is no good reason why societies should not be enabled to provide these new services.</P>
    <P>Existing businesses in the areas in which societies choose to become involved have nothing to fear if they are providing a service efficiently and, of course, at a reasonable price.  That must <Col N="1837" /> be taken into consideration also.  On this subject I would like to say &mdash; and I am not in the legal profession &mdash; that what I have noticed of late and for the past few years is that those who are purchasing homes are shopping around, even in the legal field, to see where they will get it at the best price.  That is the reality.  They are coming to me and I am sure so many members of the House also and saying that there has been a difference in the price.  That is how life has now become. Provided the work is carried out well and according to the regulations laid down that must be welcome also.  The purchasers have a choice now and that is something we all welcome.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey suggested that the Ombudsman should be assigned the job of investigating complaints against societies. The Office of the Ombudsman was set up to deal with complaints against public sector bodies and is fully occupied in that respect.  The best approach, as the Minister suggested in his opening speech, would be for societies to voluntary establish their own scheme.  I hope that societies will act on this and become the first sector of the financial services industry to establish a formal arrangement for the investigation and determination of complaints against them and their associate bodies.  If they do not do so and it becomes clear that a scheme is necessary, then the Minister will have no hesitation in exercising the powers available under section 92 to require the establishment of a scheme.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that many people have requested that this Bill be brought in.  Some say it has gone too far but when we were putting this Bill together all organisations with an interest in housing were asked for their comments; some gave them but others did not.</P>
    <P>The past year, 1988, was an excellent one for mortgage lending.  The total lending increased from £657 million in 1987 to £894 million last year.  That was almost £900 million that was being loaned by the financial institutions, which was an enormous amount.  We are very grateful to the building societies and to the banks <Col N="1838" /> and other financial institutions for lending that amount as it gave house purchasers a marvellous opportunity.  That has been of enormous help and no doubt has been greatly appreciated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright asked some questions about legal and other charges involved in the preparation of the title.  As the House is aware most of these charges were for legal work.  I now find, and many people have called to me for advice, that before they enter into any legal commitments in regard to a mortgage of any kind, they are finding out from the person who is legally representing them what the total cost will be.  They are making that up in the purchase price of their house.  When they go purchase that house they know exactly what the legal fee will be.  As I have said earlier, they are having a look around in the market and that applies to auctioneers and all the others involved. Of course different societies have different rates.</P>
    <P>Last year saw a big swing over to endowment-type loans.  Almost 50 per cent are now endowment-type loans.  This shows the remarkable change that is taking place and I am very glad of that. I would point out here that I have been advocating for some time that anybody taking out a substantial mortgage with a financial institution should have an endowment insurance policy to cover it in case of mortality.  That is the logical thing to do and it can be done at a very low cost.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to say that, as the Minister is present now, any amendments being put forward on the Bill will be given very careful and favourable consideration within reason and we will be as co-operative as we can.  I am pleased with the debate which has taken place during the past two days.  It brought to light many of the matters about which we are all concerned.  The Bill will give building societies more authority and I hope that some of the urban renewal schemes operating throughout the country will get some assistance in the areas of in-fill housing, etc.  I look forward to the co-operation of the building societies in that <Col N="1839" /> regard.  Once again I should like to thank everybody who took part in the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is one of the more important pieces of financial legislation to come before the House in recent years.  The Bill is only the second major change proposed in banking legislation since the passing of the Central Bank Act, 1942 under which the Central Bank of Ireland was established.  Taken together with the Insurance Bill, the Companies Bill and the Building Societies Bill, it represents convincing testimony to this Government's resolve to equip the Irish financial sector with an up to date commercial code of law and regulation to meet the challenges of 1992.  The Explanatory Memorandum indicates that the Bill covers a very wide area of financial services. Banking is the core element of the Bill, but the Government are also proposing to give the Central Bank the power to regulate firms in the International Financial Services Centre, moneybrokers, and financial futures and options exchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opportunity is being taken in the Bill to update the legislation in relation to currency and coinage.  There are also provisions included to modernise the legislation, some of which goes back to Victorian times, on bills of exchange, <Col N="1840" /> bank and public holidays, exemptions from Moneylenders Acts and trustee authorised investments.</P>
    <P>The primary functions, of the Central Bank, as set out in section 6 (1) of the 1942 Act, are to protect the domestic and external value of our currency and to control credit.  The bank seek to achieve this principally by formulating and implementing monetary policy, having regard to national economic policy which is, of course, the responsibility of the Government. To help carry out this function the bank act as custodian and manager of Ireland's reserves of foreign currency, the official external reserves, and oversee the financial markets.  They also have to be consulted on matters relating to exchange rate policy.</P>
    <P>The bank's other main functions are to ensure that there is a stable and efficient system for taking deposits, extending credit and making payments within the State and to act as an agent and banker for the Government.</P>
    <P>The principal elements of the Bill relate to banking, including the supervision of banks, the establishment of a deposit protection scheme, control of acquisitions by and of banks and the powers, functions and operation of the Central Bank itself.  Given this primary aspect of the Bill, I think it is worthwhile to review briefly the development of banking in the State in recent years and to sketch where this sector may be heading in the future.</P>
    <P>There are 33 licensed banks in the State with gross assets of over £24 billion.  The two main banking groups are Irish controlled and have a dominant position in the market.  Compared to 1971, when the last Central Bank Bill was enacted, gross assets of all banks in the State have grown by over 1,200 per cent.  Banks continue to be significant employers, with total staff of over 17,000 and the banking and financial sector are important contributors to the GNP of the State.</P>
    <P>The development of the banking sector has not been simply a matter of an increase in size.  The whole ethos of banking has changed radically.  Banks generally have become more customer <Col N="1841" /> oriented and have developed new financial services in response to the needs and demands of clients.  The introduction of more complex financial products is a worthwhile phenomenon.  The economic environment has helped foster these changes.  The need to cope with interest rate, exchange rate and asset price uncertainty has brought about new financial products to reduce exposure to risk.  The expansion of Irish firms overseas, through trade and direct investment, has introduced many Irish managements to the usefulness of these financial tools.</P>
    <P>The Irish banks have not lagged behind in the introduction of new financial techniques. They are expert participants in the domestic and international currency markets.  They have built up a pool of expertise comparable to the best abroad. The Government know that this expertise is a key factor in promoting our success in the international financial services arena, and more particularly in the achievement by the International Financial Services Centre of the goals we have set for it.  I hope that all Deputies will take note of this.  Some seem too ready, for their own reasons, to be dismissive of our strengths in this field, but this does us a disservice in trying to build a brighter future and carve out an international reputation in financial services.</P>
    <P>Within the domestic market we have seen many changes since 1971.  The impact of new technology and computerisation has revolutionised the retail banking sector.  Competition between banks for clients has increased.  The &ldquo;cartel&rdquo; on interest rates was abandoned in 1985.  Banks are trying to attract customers by offering a greater range of financial services suited to the individual's needs.</P>
    <P>Much has been written about the blurring of distinctions between different financial sectors.  Banks now compete actively for mortgage business.  Building societies are seeking new powers to provide the type of services which are at present offered by licensed banks.  Life assurance companies have been designing products to attract the ordinary saver. <Col N="1842" /> The banks have responded by establishing their own life assurance arms. Banks have become involved also in insurance broking and stockbroking.</P>
    <P>These developments are not confined to Ireland.  We will see a continuation of this overlapping of functions as we move towards the creation of the single internal market in the EC.  The Government will be anxious to ensure that financial institutions in the State should be able to compete with one another on an equal footing.  The present supervisory arrangements in relation to the financial sector are currently under review with a view to reducing, where possible, the number of bodies involved in the supervision of the major financial institutions.  The Building Societies Bill is an important first step in this direction by transferring responsibility for supervision to the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>At EC level, 1992 will see important steps in the creation of a single market in financial services throughout the Community. The aim of the Community is to give a greater freedom of choice for persons to do business with any properly authorised financial institution wherever located in the EC.  There is already a large measure of freedom, under the First Banking Directive of 1977, for banks to set up offices in other member states and to transact business through these offices.</P>
    <P>The further steps being taken aim to allow banks to provide services in any part of the Community.  Thus a bank will need to have just one banking licence to operate throughout the Community and not 12 licences as at present.  The realisation of this freedom is dependent on the adoption of a number of important directives which are currently under discussion. These directives will set up a shared regulatory system to protect depositors and other investors.</P>
    <P>The draft Second Banking Co-ordination Directive is the most important of these initiatives and has wide implications for banking in the internal market.  Its aim is to remove the remaining barriers to freedom of establishment in the banking sector and to provide for full freedom of banking services.  This <Col N="1843" /> approach is based on the concepts of harmonisation of the essential features of supervision, the mutual recognition of regulatory and supervisory standards for banks and home country control.  Other directives propose to lay down harmonised rules for capital and solvency for banks within the Community.</P>
    <P>Irish institutions operating in the internal market will be required to meet these standards.  This should not pose particular problems for the Irish financial sector as the regulation of banking here already conforms to required international levels.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank have an important role to play in the development of banking and related financial activities within the State and in how these developments relate to what is happening internationally. Since 1971, the bank have acted as the licensing and supervisory authority for banks.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank's role in this regard relates not only to the regulation of banking within the State; under both EC and other international arrangements, it supervises the solvency of Irish banks in respect of the totality of their business here and overseas.  The bank, therefore, must work closely with other banking supervisors in the EC and, for example, in the USA, where the two main banks have acquired subsidiaries.  The bank discharges its duty in accordance with the high standards of banking supervision to which most developed countries subscribe. I know that the financial markets value the professionalism of the bank in this regard.  It is vital that nothing should undermine the bank's ability, or independence, in the exercise of that function.</P>
    <P>In addition to the licensing and supervisory role over banks, deposit-taking institutions and financial services conferred on it in the 1971 Act and proposed in this Bill, the Central Bank performs a number of other functions, most of which are characteristic of central banks generally. It acts as banker to the licensed banks and to the Exchequer and is currently responsible for registering and <Col N="1844" /> paying dividends on certain Government securities and for acting as the Government's agent in certain short-dated Government securities.  As the statuory issuing authority for the currency it produces and distributes legal tender notes and coin to meet the needs of the public and is responsible for conducting transactions and relations between the State and EC and other international bodies concerned with financial and monetary issues.</P>
    <P>During the debate in this House on the Central Bank Bill, 1942 the then Minister for Finance stated that the bank</P>
    <P>...will be independent in the carrying out of its functions.  This independence is possessed by almost every central bank throughout the world and is a very desirable provision.</P>
    <P>It is generally acknowledged that the most important element in central bank/government relationships is the degree of independence accorded to a central bank in the formulation and implementation of monetary policy.  In Ireland, the relationship between Government and the Central Bank rests as much on mutual confidence as on Statute. It has worked well since the bank was established nearly 50 years ago and I know that the bank has always had regard to national economic policy in considering matters relating to monetary policy and I have no doubt that it will continue to do so.  Therefore, I see no reason to consider that the provisions in the present Bill will impinge on the ability of the Central Bank to exercise its functions in accordance with the large degree of independence granted to it by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the detailed proposals in the Bill but I do not propose to comment on each and every one of those.  I will try, rather, to highlight the main features and the principal changes being made to banking legislation.</P>
    <P>The first 11 sections of the Bill call for few remarks, except in relation to sections 8 and 9 which provide for increases of penalties under the existing Central Bank Acts.  I am proposing to <Col N="1845" /> increase substantially the penalties for offences, generally, under existing legislation. Fines of up to £1,000 are provided in relation to summary conviction, and of up to £50,000 for conviction on indictment. Terms of imprisonment of up to 12 months on summary conviction, and five years on conviction on indictment, are specified in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have taken the approach of applying a higher monetary penalty in cases where the offence is likely to be committed by a bank or other financial institution rather than by an individual.  Under section 11 of the Bill, persons responsible for directing the affairs of a bank or other institution can also be proceeded against and subjected to a fine, or term of imprisonment, if found culpable and convicted.  It is only right that the possibility of criminal proceedings should apply in this way to persons in positions of responsibility.  I have provided also for continuing offences in cases where a person might profit, if not proceeded against, by a continuing infraction of the law.  I am confident the House will support this approach.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 to 24 relate to the Central Bank itself.  Many of the sections re-enact existing provisions of the Currency Act, 1927, which is being repealed.  However, there are several important new elements to which I wish to draw the attention of the House.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is new and empowers the bank to take certain specific measures, where necessary, to safeguard the interests of depositors.  This will empower the bank to make funds available to a licence holder in a rescue situation. Section 62 of the Bill, which relates to the establishment of the deposit protection account, will allow such sums as are expended to be charged on that account. I will go into the question of how the bank rescue powers will operate when explaining later the functioning of the deposit protection scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 12 also clarifies that the bank has always had the legal powers to make funds available in the same way as ordinary banks can do.  This provision relates to the bank's role in providing funds to compensate depositors in the case of the <Col N="1846" /> Irish Trust Bank, which went into liquidation in the seventies.</P>
    <P>I am proposing in section 13 of the Bill to remove the requirement that the Minister appoint banking directors to the board of the bank.  This requirement has existed in Central Bank legislation since the bank was set up in 1942.  The incumbents of the office throughout the years, and up to the present time, have contributed valuable banking expertise to the direction of the bank and have helped establish and maintain the deserved reputation of the bank for professionalism and competence.</P>
    <P>However, I have given considerable thought as to whether it is appropriate, in present-day circumstances, to preserve in legislation a specific requirement that two places be reserved for the directors of a licensed bank.  In coming to a decision to remove the present legal requirement, I took into account the expanded responsibilities for supervising financial institutions being entrusted to the bank by this and other legislation.  I think it would be invidious to have the representatives of one particular financial sector on the board of the bank as of right, to the exclusion of others.  No doubt there would be calls for a special seat for all classes of financial institutions.  A board selected on this basis would not be conducive to the proper discharge of the functions entrusted to it.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that the present incumbents will vacate office within three months of the passing of the Bill.  I had considered that the present banking directors might continue until the end of their terms, but I felt on balance that the new board constitution should come into operation within a short period after enactment by the Oireachtas.  I might say that while the Minister will no longer be required to appoint particular persons to the board as of right, he will have the discretion to appoint persons of suitable banking expertise to the board.  As with any board, the Government will be anxious to ensure that the Central Bank board contains the right mix and balance of expertise to enable it to discharge its functions adequately.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1847" /> Because of its pivotal role in financial and commercial affairs, it is vital to protect the confidentiality of information which comes into the possession of the bank.  At present, the officials of the bank are required to take an oath of secrecy not to disclose information.</P>
    <P>Section 15 will replace the oath by a general provision relating to all staff of the bank.  This confidentiality provision will be no less stringent than the existing requirement, but will allow for exemptions in specified circumstances.  These are set out in the section, one of the main exemptions being to allow the exchange of information between duly authorised supervisors, both domestic and international. The section provides for stiff penalties of up to £25,000 and five years' imprisonment for breach of confidentiality by a member of the staff of the bank.</P>
    <P>Sections 21 and 22 wind up the legal tender note fund and consolidate the assets of the bank in one fund.  This change is primarily book-keeping and has no effect on the issue of the currency or the soundness and sufficiency of the assets backing the currency.</P>
    <P>Section 23 deals with the exchange rate arrangements for the Irish pound.  The monetary unit of the State is declared to be the Irish pound.  The Minister, after consulting with the bank, is being empowered to vary the general exchange rate arrangements for the pound and to make specific exchange rate adjustments consistent with these arrangements.  This does no more than give legislative effect to the existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>This section replaces the more cumbersome procedures for varying the exchange rate of the pound of the 1971 Act.  The 1971 Act provisions were drafted with much different circumstances in mind, and at a time when international monetary conditions were altogether more stable.  Given our membership of the EMS, and the need to act quickly and decisively with our partners where exchange rates are involved, the law must allow for flexibility in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1848" /> This is not to say that decisions to vary the general exchange rate arrangements or make specific exchange rate adjustments consistent with those arrangements will be made without due consideration, or that the House will not be given the opportunity to debate these decisions.  For example, in the case of exchange rate adjustments within the EMS, the practice of the Minister coming to the House to explain the Government's actions will continue to apply.</P>
    <P>The current system of supervision of banks in the State was introduced by the Central Bank Act, 1971.  Experience has shown that the requirements have worked well, but this does not exclude the need for certain modifications and adjustments to meet particular problems that have arisen.</P>
    <P>The changes proposed in Chapter III of Part II of the Bill are designed to strengthen the Central Bank's powers in the grant and revocation of banking licences, in the issue of directions to licence holders and in the provision of information by licence holders on their activities or the business of any subsidiary or associated company.  The bank's supervisory powers over bank charges are also being placed on a formal footing. The bank is being empowered in the Bill to apply to the courts to enforce compliance with the supervisory régime and to ensure that any directions given by the bank are followed by licence holders.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the new powers which are included in the Bill in respect of auditors of banks.  The Bill requires the auditor of a licence holder to report to the Central Bank on any specific shortcomings he comes across in the operations of a licence holder during the exercise of his auditing function.  I think it is generally accepted that the auditor of any financial institution plays an important role in being able, at an early stage, to uncover deficiencies which, if left untreated, can lead to unfortunate consequences.</P>
    <P>It is only right that auditors should be required to report on these to the supervisory authority.  Other countries have also recognised this situation and <Col N="1849" /> have included provisions in their own legislation.  I do not see this as an unnecessarily burdensome duty on the auditor.  It is one which is justified in the public interest.</P>
    <P>Given the central role of the auditor, and the enhanced duties we are placing on the auditor in this Bill, the Central Bank requested that it be given the legal power to object to the appointment of a particular person as auditor if it is not satisfied with that person's suitability.  I propose to give the bank this right to vet appointments.  This is not meant to reflect in any way on the auditors currently appointed to licence holders, or to undermine the licence holder's right to appoint the auditor of their choice.  The power is meant simply as a safeguard for the legitimate concerns of the Central Bank as supervisory authority.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes a provision to broaden the definition of banking business given in the Central Bank Act, 1971, both to conform with the relevant definition in EC Directives and to improve the protection of the public from unauthorised deposit taking.  Because of the rapid evolution of financial markets and the introduction of new and unfamiliar financial techniques, I have included in the Bill a provision allowing me, by regulation, to apply the supervisory powers in this Bill to any new financial activities which, if left unregulated, would cause a loss to the investing public, or disrupt the operation of financial markets in the State.  I believe it is wise to take these powers now rather than wait for the damage that unregulated financial markets might cause before seeking the necessary legal powers.</P>
    <P>Chapter IV of Part II of the Bill contains provisions which I hope will have to be used very infrequently, if at all.  These relate to the winding up of licence holders and seek to copperfasten the right of the Central Bank to play a key role in the evolution and determination of the winding up of a bank.</P>
    <P>Chapter IV will allow the bank to receive notice of winding up, to be heard in court, to be represented at meetings of creditors and to have a licence holder <Col N="1850" /> wound up on certain specific grounds. The provisions in this chapter are, for obvious reasons, necessarily tied into the provisions in the next chapter which establishes the deposit protection account.</P>
    <P>Before going into details of the proposed deposit protection scheme, I think it useful to make some observations on the rationale and operation of these schemes in general.</P>
    <P>The primary goal of deposit protection is to provide a safety net for depositors in the case of a bank failure.  Such schemes protect individual depositors, especially smaller ones, and help preserve confidence in the integrity of the financial system.  There is, however, a notable body of opinion which feels that deposit protection lessens the role of market discipline in deterring banks from undertaking unsound or risky policies.  Proponents of this view can point to practical examples in other states, where the cost of funding the protection of depositors and keeping insolvent banks from closing places a heavy burden on the financial system.</P>
    <P>I recognise these concerns and the viewpoint of those who feel it unfair that well run institutions should bear the costs of inefficient competitors which get into difficulty.  I believe, however, as I said earlier, that the banking community gains from having a clear mandatory régime to allay public fears where failures occur.  I expect never to have to operate Chapter V of this Bill, but I believe that it is best to have the tools available to cope with such a contingency should it arise.</P>
    <P>Many of the more developed countries have deposit protection schemes in place, for example, the UK, France, Germany, the USA, Canada, Japan and the Netherlands. The EC Commission has recommended that all member states introduce deposit protection schemes.  Indeed, some member states which previously objected in principle to deposit protection have since decided, in the light of experience, to implement such schemes. The coverage of deposit protection <Col N="1851" /> schemes varies substantially in the different countries.  Most, if not all, have cut-off points beyond which deposits of a specified size are not protected.  The cut-off point in some cases seems quite generous.  The type of deposit protected also differs but, in the main, it is &ldquo;consumer&rdquo;, i.e. non-commercial, deposits which are covered.</P>
    <P>The Government have examined the issues carefully before deciding on the course of action proposed in the Bill. We have listened to and considered the misgiving voiced about deposit protection. The system we have settled on is, in my view, reasonable and affordable and will contribute to the already high standing of, and confidence in, the financial sector in the State.  I know that Deputies will join with me in this assessment.</P>
    <P>The way in which the deposit protection scheme will work is set out in Chapter V of the Bill.  I will be happy to answer particular questions on Committee Stage, so I will confine myself to outlining the general operation of the scheme in my remarks at this stage.</P>
    <P>The scheme aims to protect ordinary bank depositors in respect of deposits of a particular size.  The Bill excludes certain classes of depositors, notably those persons connected with the insolvent licence holder, while deposits eligible for compensation are defined to exclude both deposits by other specified financial institutions and deposits in a form which are normally only available to the larger, commercial depositor.</P>
    <P>The deposit protection account will be funded by the licensed banks through a contribution to the deposit protection account related to the size of the licence holder's deposits.  The relevant percentage is 0.2 per cent of Irish pound deposits, with a minimum contribution of £20,000.</P>
    <P>In the event of an insolvency, the liquidator of the insolvent licence holder will have access, firstly, to that licence holder's deposit in the deposit protection account.  Where this deposit is insufficient to pay to depositors the compensation <Col N="1852" /> amounts set out in this Bill, the Central Bank will pay the shortfall and charge it to the deposit protection account.  The bank will also advance payments and charge the deposit protection account where the liquidator is likely to take an unreasonable time in realising assets to compensate depositors.  The bank will be able to claim these advances from the proceeds of the liquidation in due course and credit the deposit account with the proceeds.</P>
    <P>The compensation amounts are based on the following formula.  A depositor may be compensated for 80 per cent of a deposit of up to £5,000 (or of the first £5,000 of a larger deposit), 70 per cent in respect of the next £5,000 of a deposit and 50 per cent in respect of the next £5,000.</P>
    <P>Maximum compensation therefore will be £10,000 for a qualifying deposit of £15,000 or more.  Account is taken in the formula of any amounts paid or payable by the liquidator to depositors other than out of the deposit protection funds.</P>
    <P>To give a practical example, if one had a deposit of £15,000, with no amounts being available to compensate from the proceeds of the liquidation, the maximum compensation which can be paid from the deposit protection account is £10,000.  If the proceeds of the liquidation allowed the payment of, say, £4,000 to the depositor, the balance to be paid by the scheme would be £10,000 less £4,000, i.e. £6,000.</P>
    <P>The purpose of placing these graduated limits, and setting an overall cap on the amount of compensation, is to keep the scheme within reasonable financial proportions and to retain a risk element for depositors, so as to encourage prudence. As I have said earlier, this feature is not unique to our scheme.  Cut-off points apply in schemes abroad also.</P>
    <P>For certain depositors excluded from compensation because they were connected with the insolvent bank, there is the right to appeal to the High Court.  To save expenses to individual depositors, the Central Bank itself can appeal to the court on behalf of particular depositors where it feels that the stringent exclusion <Col N="1853" /> provisions in the Bill should be waived and the depositors compensated.</P>
    <P>In the event of payments being made from the deposit protection account, I am providing for the reconstitution of the account by further contributions by licence holders, subject to a maximum contribution in any one year of 0.2 per cent of each bank's Irish pound deposits; but the Central Bank will be permitted to waive the extra contribution in the case of individual banks in particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>The bank is allowed under the scheme to use the deposit protection account to advance funds to a licence holder where it is in the interests of depositors to do so.  Let me say that the particular cases in which this power will be used will have to be weighed carefully by the bank.  I would expect that if the bank saw that the application of funds would have a good chance of success, and would cost less than having to compensate depositors should the licence holder fail, then it would consider the use of the account in this way.  The Bill leaves this decision entirely to the bank.  The bank must, however, inform me, and licence holders generally, of the principles which will guide it in the exercise of these powers. In addition, the holders of licences will have the right to make representations to the bank in relation to the application of those principles.</P>
    <P>It will, of course, be necessary to review how the deposit protection scheme works in practice.  Chapter V places a statutory duty on the bank to conduct such a review and to recommend to the Minister what changes, if any, should be made.  Section 68 of the Bill allows the Minister by regulation to give effect to such changes.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I hope never to see this scheme actually being operated, but we must provide for the contingency. This does not rule out the need for other measures, legislative or otherwise, in the event of any bank failure, depending on the nature and size of the failure. However, we cannot anticipate such matters in legislation now.  This chapter in the Bill at least lays the groundwork for <Col N="1854" /> a co-ordinated response to problems of this sort, should they arise in the future.</P>
    <P>The move towards the completion of the Community's Internal Market has seen considerable interest on the part of all firms in the possibilities of acquiring shareholdings in other firms, either on the basis of outright or substantial control, or mutually beneficial cross shareholdings.</P>
    <P>I do not think that it is possible to read the business press these days without seeing one or other such link-up between different institutions in the member states, and indeed between non-EC firms and firms already established in the Community.</P>
    <P>Some would say that this is the inevitable consequence of the creation of a Single Community market for products and services.  The quickest, and possibly the cheapest, way to enter a new market is to acquire an existing market participant. One way to forestall unwelcome entry to one's home base, as well as to develop new markets, is to enter into a mutually supportive shareholding arrangement with other appropriate firms.</P>
    <P>The financial sector is no less touched by these developments than others.  The work proceeding at EC level on the completion of the internal market will reinforce these trends.  Already, domestically, the main banks have been expanding by acquisition into other related financial areas, constructing broad financial conglomerates.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to prejudge the issues involved here.  The purpose of the provisions in this Bill is not to signal a hostile attitude towards acquisitions, nor to place obstacles in their way, but to allow the authorities to make an informed and prudent judgement on the acquisition by others of major interests in a licensed bank, or acquisitions by that bank of other concerns.  The supervision provided for in the Bill is based on the need for prudential control by the Central Bank; for example, is this acquisition good for the security of depositors or would it conflict with the orderly and proper regulation of banking in the State?  But there is also an important national interest in <Col N="1855" /> certain cases and this is reflected in those sections where the Minister for Finance, and other Minister where relevant, have a role to play.</P>
    <P>The provisions in Chapter VI of Part II of the Bill give statutory backing to the control already being exercised by the Central Bank over (a) the ownership of licensed banks and (b) acquisitions by licensed banks in both the banking and non-banking areas.  With regard to the first objective, the Central Bank is concerned to secure an appropriate ownership structure in order to facilitate the maintenance of the capital adequacy of banks.</P>
    <P>The bank is also anxious to minimise the risk of appreciable holdings in a bank coming under the control of unsuitable persons or institutions.  The second objective is equally important in the context of the orderly and proper regulation of banking.  It is advisable in the interests of protecting depositors that the Central Bank should have adequate powers to control acquisitions by licensed banks so as to ensure that banks do not expand in a manner that might weaken their capital base, dilute their management resources or increase to imprudent levels the risk associated with their operations.</P>
    <P>Under the proposals in the Bill, the bank must be notified of proposed acquisitions in or by banks.  The relevant minimum percentage holdings in the shares or voting rights which must be notified to the bank for approval is 10 per cent.  I will be able, by order, to alter this figure, but any alteration will have to be approved beforehand by both Houses. The bank must also be notified of acquisitions of less than 10 per cent of shares if the shares confer any rights over the appointment of some or all of the directors of the undertaking concerned.  The provisions in Chapter VI are framed so as to include direct or indirect holdings, e.g. via a subsidiary company or in concert with other persons.</P>
    <P>For an acquisition to go ahead the bank must either give its approval in writing, or refrain from objecting to the acquisition, within the period laid down in the Bill. <Col N="1856" /> This period is three months in the case of an acquisition requiring only the bank's approval, and six months in cases where the approval of the Minister for Finance is required.</P>
    <P>Ministerial approval will be required where the proposed acquisition would result in over 20 per cent of the assets of all licence holders in the State coming under the direct or indirect control of one person, whether that person is another licence holder or not.  The Minister may attach conditions to any approval which he may give.  The bank, in addition, may prescribe its own conditions as it sees fit. These latter conditions can be applied to all cases and not just those acquiring transactions required to be approved by me.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, the bank may conduct such detailed inquiries as it see fit, either on its own behalf or at my request, into the circumstances of the proposed acquisition. Stiff penalties are prescribed for any persons who do not assist in the inquiry or who try to impede its progress.</P>
    <P>The Bill imposes penalties for the contravention of any approval given under the relevant sections but also provides that where an approval is refused the aggrieved parties may appeal to the court.  I am sure that the House will find the powers being taken in this part both necessary and reasonable.  They will be applied in a fair and practical way with the aim of protecting the interests of depositors and the wider public good.</P>
    <P>Chapters VII to IX of Part II of the Bill give the bank the responsibility for supervising IFSC companies, financial futures and options exchanges, moneybrokers and other entities designated by the Minister for supervision by the bank. The broad terms of the supervisory provisions are similar in many respects.  The purpose is to allow the bank to specify particular regulatory requirements to be followed by the financial institutions concerned.</P>
    <P>The bank is at present undertaking the supervision of certain financial institutions which have been licensed to operate in the International Financial Services Centre.  The provisions of Chapter VII <Col N="1857" /> place this supervision on a statutory footing.</P>
    <P>Chapter VII allows the bank to supervise the firms directly, or, if need be, through the establishment and recognition of self-regulatory bodies.  The Government are committed to the application of the appropriate regulatory standards to firms in the IFSC.  It is important that the reputation of the centre should be safeguarded.  The bank may apply to the court to enforce compliance with its regulatory requirements and may also notify the Minister of non-compliance; the Minister has the power, under the Finance Acts, to withdraw a tax certificate of the company operating in the centre or to vary the terms and conditions of the certificate.</P>
    <P>The establishment of financial futures and options exchanges in the State is a very recent development.  The bank has already undertaken the informal surveillance of the rules and activities of the exchange which has already set up here. The powers being given to the bank in Chapter VIII confirm this supervisory role over not only the existing exchange but also over any others which may establish in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there will be any disagreement that this supervision is required.  Futures and options exchanges transact significant financial dealings, which, if unsupervised and unregulated, could have grave effects on the reputation of the State and on the operation of all financial sectors in the State.  The role of the bank as supervisor will extend to the relevant activities of members of the exchanges as well.  No exchage will be allowed to establish unless the bank has approved its rules.  The bank will be empowered to issue directions to the exchange to suspend trading in particular circumstances.  Severe penalties are provided for unauthorised trading or for breach of the bank's supervisory requirements.</P>
    <P>Moneybroking is a small but important sector of financial activity.  Moneybrokers act as intermediaries arranging the disposition of funds between institutions on the interbank market.  Chapter <Col N="1858" /> IX of Part II of the Bill gives powers to the Central Bank to supervise moneybrokers and to allow the bank to gather information for statistical and supervisory purposes.  One particular provision prohibits licensed banks from acting as moneybrokers.  This is to reduce the potential for conflicts of interest and to maintain competitive markets.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will not object to the expanded role envisaged for the bank.  We are embarking on new and unaccustomed aspects of financial supervision. We may need, as mentioned earlier, to extend this supervision to other financial activities.  I know that the bank will bring to this new supervision the skills and expertise which it has gained in many years of banking supervision, and I am confident that it will follow its usual high standards of supervision.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for the issue of the currency rests with the Central Bank. The bank has had this function since the 1927 Currency Act, when the forerunner of the bank, the Currency Commission, was established by law.  Because we are repealing the 1927 Act, it is necessary to re-enact those sections in that Act dealing with the issue of the currency.  The relevant provisions in the 1927 Act are re-entered with only minor changes, which I can detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank issues the coinage on behalf of the Minister.  I am proposing a number of small changes to the Decimal Currency Act, 1969, under which the current coinage is issued.  The Decimal Currency Acts require that every order to introduce new coins, or to amend the size, shape, design, or composition of existing coins, must be approved in draft by both Houses before the order can be made.  The Bill proposes to retain this requirement, generally, but to allow the Minister to make certain minor changes to the weight and standard composition of coins by order without the need to seek prior approval.  This order would, of course, be subject to annulment by each House within the usual 21 days.  The Bill also proposes that the legal tender amounts for coins should be standardised at a ratio of 20 times face value.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1859" /> I hope the House will accept these amendments.  For the information of Deputies, I should add that the Government are considering further changes in the coinage relating to the size, composition and design of existing coins and, in particular, the introduction of a new £1 coin.  Whatever proposals emerge from this review will be brought before the Houses and there will be an opportunity for a full discussion before any new coins are issued.</P>
    <P>The final provisions in this Bill are by way of up-dating miscellaneous Acts governing particular financial transactions. These are the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1879; the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882; the Money-lenders Acts, 1900 to 1933; the Trustee Acts, 1893 and 1958, and the Stock Transfer Act, 1963.  The explanatory memorandum to the Bill explains the amendments which are being made.  One notable provision, however, is contained in section 128 which empowers the Minister for Finance to direct the closure of banks and other financial institutions or exchanges where the protection of the currency or the national interest so requires.  These are very much emergency powers.  They are not new in that the Government have always had the power to declare bank holidays.  Bank holidays, however, are also public holidays which are regulated by the relevant public holidays legislation.  It has been decided to repeal the existing legislation on bank holidays, which exists in various Acts from 1871 to 1973 and, in so far as the traditional bank holidays are now superseded by the law on public holidays, to leave this aspect to the Public Holidays Act, 1973.  The particular powers of suspending financial transactions by, for example, declaring a bank holiday are thus being re-created in an expanded from in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have gone into more detail than is usual in Second Stage comments, but I felt it was useful to do so because of the scope of the Bill, and the new powers which are being taken.  I hope that the House has found this useful and that my <Col N="1860" /> remarks will contribute to an informed debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Minister for a very informative speech in which he went into great detail. It was very worth while to do so.  Even though this is a Bill which will arouse little public interest it is still a very important one and does require detailed examination. I would also like to thank those who drafted the Bill and those who drew up the Explanatory Memorandum which I found very helpful.  This is more of a Committee Stage Bill than a Second Stage Bill and I have no difficulty with the principle.  In the first instance, the Bill aims to strengthen the powers of the Central Bank in relation to the licensing and supervision of the banking business. No one could disagree with this.  Secondly, it proposes to introduce a deposit protection scheme for bank depositors. While I will comment on the details of this scheme later I also believe that there will be agreement on this.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, the Bill makes provision for the prior notification to and approval by the bank and the Minister of proposals to acquire specified holdings in a licensed bank in the State and of proposals by banks to acquire holdings in other corporate bodies.  Again, nobody could disagree with this.  There would have to be a regulatory body to supervise such acquisitions and it seems that the Central Bank both <i>de facto</i> and <i>de jure</i> should be that regulatory body.  I will comment on this in greater detail later in my contribution.</P>
      <P>Fourthly, the Bill contains proposals to extend supervision to certain companies in the International Financial Services Centre, to the financial futures and options exchanges, if established, and to moneybrokers.  Again, there would have to be a regulatory body and the appropriate body is the Central Bank.  I agree that this must be enshrined in law at a time when a variety of new financial activities are being undertaken by institutions, both domestic and foreign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fifthly, the Bill contains proposals to update, re-enact and amend provisions in the currency and coinage legislation. <Col N="1861" /> Again, I have no problem with these. If the legal tender note fund is being abolished for accountancy reasons, naturally we would accept the advice of the bank and the Department of Finance.  If certain changes need to be made in the legislation and if it is the Minister's intention to bring in a one pound coin, again, we have no problem with this or with the detail of this Bill since he has already committed himself to bringing whatever scheme he may wish to introduce before the House for approval.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to make a number of other miscellaneous amendments, the most important of these, to which the Minister has drawn attention, is contained in section 127 which would allow for the closing of banks and financial houses so as to protect the currency or in the national interest.  The proposals the Minister is putting forward in this regard are satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I would now like to go through the Bill as presented, in the process commenting on certain aspects which I intend to draw more attention to on Committee Stage. Part I of the Bill contains the usual provisions on citation, commencement, interpretation and repeals.  I do not think there is any need to dwell on these.  Part II of the Bill outlines the penalties which may be applied to both institutions and to those managing the institutions.  It is curious that the penalties are outlined upfront.  It is rather like showing someone the rope before the regulations are introduced so as to encourage them to behave. There is a need for penalties and the only question I have is whether it would be appropriate in all circumstances to apply penalties to the employees of institutions as well as to the corporate entity itself and what should the balance be as between the person who makes the decision in the institution and the institution itself?  How would one decide where culpability lies and what should the balance be as between the employees and the corporation itself?</P>
    <P>This Part of the Bill also proposes to remove the necessity for the Central Bank to have two banking directors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1862" /> Viewing this legislation against the background of other legislation which has come or is before the House &mdash; I am referring particularly to the Building Societies Bill &mdash; I accept what the Minister says.  It would no longer be appropriate to give an inside track to the board of the Central Bank to one type of financial institution and not come under pressure to extend it to others.  It would be not appropriate to have a Central Bank board consisting of delegates from the different financial institutions.  The Minister has followed the right course here in deciding he will maintain his independence and apply people of expertise and experience as he thinks fit, from the banking sector and elsewhere, to the board of the Central Bank.  He could have brought these arrangements in at the end of the period of office of existing directors, and I have some quibble with the provision to allow existing directors serve for three months. I will return to this on Committee Stage. However, I have no quibble at all with the principle here.</P>
    <P>There are items in the Bill on which I have strong views and items that are just curiosities.  Section 14 authorises the bank to make appropriate arrangements for the purchase of leasing of office space and for the hiring of staff.  Of course, this is only proper but when it comes to the manner of hiring staff section 14 (3) (a) provides that: &ldquo;...every appointment under subsection (2) of an officer or servant of the bank shall be made by competition (including a qualifying or competitive test in Irish)&rdquo;.  I am one of the Deputies in this House who never hesitates to use Irish if the occasion is appropriate, but it seems a curiosity that the only academic requirement of an employee of the Central Bank is knowledge of Irish.  I envisage people with fluent Irish down in the basement of the Central Bank with a ball frame, with no knowledge of mathematics, economics or finance, nothing except they have to do a qualifying test in Irish.  Whatever the appropriateness of having qualifying tests in Irish, having competitive tests in Irish for employment in the Central Bank is a bit much.  All things being equal, if the <Col N="1863" /> job goes on a competitive test in Irish it is carried a bit far.  I remark on it as a curiosity.  I am not sure why it is included. Maybe when the Government Memorandum reached Roinn na Gaeltachta this amendment was taken on board by the Department of Finance.  I would like the Minister in his reply, without giving more weight to it than as a curiosity, to explain why this provision is in the text of the Bill.  I am not quibbling with the fact that an Irish test might be required in the public service but I am wondering why it is in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 15 is included in the Bill to replace the provision in existing legislation which requires employees of the Central Bank to take a secrecy oath.  This section deals with the disclosure of information. There is an absolute prohibition on employees of the bank from disclosing any information relating to the business of the bank.  The section provides that, &ldquo;A person ...shall not disclose during his term of office or employment or at any time thereafter, any information concerning the business of the Bank or the business of any other person which came to his knowledge by virtue of his office or employment unless such disclosure is to enable the Bank to carry out its functions under the Central Bank Act...&rdquo; That is all very proper but then it comes to lists of exceptions, two of which call for comment.  One relates to the provision of information to other central banks elsewhere in the world.  That is acceptable. The second relates to institutions of the EC.  Again, that strikes me as prudent if it is required to divulge information.</P>
    <P>My concern arises from a priority question on 31 January last week to the Minister for Finance.  Deputy McDowell was somewhat concerned about his inability to get information about the Central Bank and he asked:</P>
    <P>the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the annual accounts furnished by the Central Bank in the form required by regulation are inadequate to determine whether or not the resources used by <Col N="1864" /> the bank are properly allocated and, whether the expenditure on salaries and other items by the bank are necessary; that the bank's reports including the proceedings at the Central Bank set out therein afford no opportunity for public representatives to judge the efficiency of the bank and the necessity for the expenditure made by it; whether he has had consultations with the bank as to the level of reserves held by it; and the procedures which exist between his Department and the Central Bank in respect of determining the necessary level of reserves; and if he will make a statement on his Department's view on the present level of reserves held by the Central Bank and their possible repayment in part to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied to the effect that the bank was an independent body.  Deputy McDowell said he was not questioning the independence of the bank, he was questioning the right of this House to examine whether money is well or badly spent anywhere in the public sector, and what he had in mind would have been no intrusion on any of the powers which make the Central Bank independent or any of the powers which make its activities confidential, but was merely to know, if they bought an office, leased an office or employed 100 extra head of staff, whether the public sector was getting value for money.</P>
    <P>The disclosure-of-information provision in section 15 is putting into law in a very rigid way the attitude portrayed by the Minister in reply to Deputy McDowell's question.  While employees of the Central Bank can divulge information in seven different circumstances, they are now expressly forbidden from divulging information to this House or to any committee of this House.  While there are still provisions, in section 19, for its reports and returns to be laid before the House, a certain rigidity is being enshrined in this Bill which goes beyond confidentiality and independence.  This will make it impossible for this or a future Dáil, either in plenary session or through <Col N="1865" /> one of its committees, to seek or inquire, certainly to require, an employee or director of the bank to provide any information about anything that goes on in that august institution.  I question whether this is necessary or whether the relationship between Parliament, the Executive and agencies such as the bank could not be organised in a manner which allows each to carry out its constitutional and legislative statutory functions where one does not encroach on the other but where institutions do not expand their legitimate rights into areas which are the rights of Parliament.  I will question this section of the Bill quite strongly on Committee Stage and I would like the Minister to comment on it in his reply to Second Stage.</P>
    <P>A certain attitude comes through parts of this Bill which goes beyond any requirements of independence or confidentiality. It amounts to almost a closing of the door against any inquiry.  There is another example of this in section 17 which provides that: &ldquo;No provision of the National Debt Act, 1870, or of the Central Bank Acts, 1942 to 1988, or of any other enactment shall be construed as requiring the Bank to preserve any document or other record for a period of more than 6 years after the latest date of the period to which such document or other record relates...&rdquo;&ldquo;Any other enactment&rdquo; seems to refer directly to the National Archives Bill.  It is not so long since that Bill was put through the Houses of the Oireachtas; a requirement of that Statute is that State papers would be held. One can argue grounds of expediency, pressure of space or lack of filing systems but in the days of computer discs and microfilm it is not physically difficult any more to store records or to keep a file of records in a very small space.</P>
    <P>Again, I question the necessity to enshrine in law a provision that runs counter to a provision that is already enshrined in law for the Civil Service and the institutions.  I do not know of any good reason why it should be in the Bill but it is indicative of an attitude of mind which is extending the concepts of confidentiality and independence, with <Col N="1866" /> which we all agree, beyond the boundaries of what I think is proper in the relationship between the Central Bank and this House.  I will return to that point at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Chapter III, a very important part of the Bill, deals with the licensing and supervisory provisions of the banks.  It is a proper provision and is thoroughly and tightly drawn.  I do not have any great objection to it but I will be examining it on Committee Stage.  To paraphrase the opening remarks of the Minister for the Environment when introducing the Bill dealing with building societies, those societies will be free to get involved in virtually all banking activities and for that reason there must be control and a regulatory agent.  The Central Bank is the proper authority to have such control.  If the activities of other agencies are extending into the banking sphere, it is only right that the powers of the Central Bank should cover the new activities.</P>
    <P>Section 40, which is in line with some of the provisions I referred to, states that cases referred to the court may be heard otherwise than in public.  That is probably necessary.  I can recall one of our financial institutions having an injunction heard <i>in camera</i> and even the fact that they sought the injunction was considered to be a matter that should not be divulged publicly.  I agree with the section in so far as it is an enabling provision but, again, the courts have a specific function to perform and as a general practice court hearings should be in public.  The activities of the courts should be exposed to public gaze and scrutiny.  It is a cliché but, like most clichés it is true, that justice should not only be done but be seen to be done, and that applies to the relationship between the Central Bank as a regulatory authority and any licence holder carrying on financial activities in the State.  If the relationship between them is in conflict and becomes a matter to be arbitrated on by the courts then, as a matter of general practice, it should be open to public scrutiny and should be reported on.  I dislike justice behind closed doors, although I can see circumstances where it would be necessary to protect the institution and <Col N="1867" /> the clients of that institution.  It should not be a general principle.  I will return to that issue later.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister is seeking power in Chapter III to extend the duties and powers of auditors.  Certainly, he is imposing extra duties on the auditors of financial institutions &mdash; I will deal with that issue on Committee Stage &mdash; but I do not have any difficulty with the principle involved.  It may put a certain burden on auditors which they do not have at present but on balance the provision is probably correct.  At this stage I have no great objection to it.</P>
    <P>Chapter V deals with the deposit protection scheme which is being introduced by the Minister.  A similar scheme is widespread in other European countries.  One has been introduced in the UK and many people involved in banking here will be familiar with it.  I welcome the measure and although I have no difficulty with the principle, I question the scope of the provision.  It is very open-ended.  Those who behave themselves do not have anything to gain from the contribution they make while those who live dangerously can be the beneficiaries.  I do not think that that is necessarily the correct way to proceed.  The scheme with which I am familiar, the one that operates in the UK, seems to envisage a fund of between £5 million and £6 million sterling.  They are applying a maximum payment from each institution of £300,000 and a minimum of £10,000.  The Minister has suggested that his deposit protection scheme should have a minimum of £20,000 but he has not announced a maximum amount.  An institution here will pay 0.2 per cent of all eligible deposits.  According to the figure I have come across in Central Bank reports, applying 0.2 per cent to eligible deposits suggests a fund of about £22 million.  I wonder why, if the UK, with activity 20 times our banking activity, feel that a fund of between £5 million and £6 million sterling is sufficient protection, we should talk in terms of a fund of £22 million.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the UK scheme picks a slightly higher percentage, not more than <Col N="1868" /> 0.3 per cent of eligible deposits is their take and, obviously, that will increase and decrease with changes in the balance sheet of the amount of eligible funds on deposit in any individual bank.  However, it is subject to a maximum of £300,000 sterling.  It is worth looking at the scope of that provision to see if it is too widely drawn.  A fund is probably necessary but since the Central Bank Act, 1971, was introduced we have only had two banking collapses here.  One was the Irish Trust Bank, referred to by the Minister, and the other was a merchant bank.  The Minister may be able to give us details of the total exposure as a result of both collapses, but I understand that the total liabilities of the two were something less than £6 million.  That is a very good record for our banking system.</P>
    <P>It would be easy to approach this by saying it was nice to have a protection scheme, that anyone should have one and the bigger the safety net the better, but the trouble about protection schemes, like all schemes, is that they will not be paid for out of bank profits.  Ultimately, there will be a charge on the bank customer who will have to pay increased charges, accept a slightly reduced interest on deposits or a marginally higher rate of interest in certain circumstances.  The issue is whether the cost of banking should be put on the customer to build up a fund of £22 million, if that fund is not necessary.  The Minister should consider something along the lines of the UK scheme, where an upper limit was placed on the amount to be paid by any institution.</P>
    <P>Between now and Committee Stage I will be considering what we should do against the background of the Minister's reply to the Second Stage debate.  I am not knocking the principle but I wonder about the scope and the manner in which it is being introduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also providing that if a bank collapses and the £22 million envisaged is spent he can reconstitute the fund and seek 0.2 or 0.3 per cent from the banks all over again.  The Minister is also taking the power by order to vary the percentage take.  The Minister is looking <Col N="1869" /> for 0.2 per cent on the basis of the Bill but he can vary that upward or downward by order.  That is questionable.  I will dwell on this section to some degree on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Basically, while I agree with the proposal that we should have a deposit protection scheme underpinning small depositors in the banking system, I would prefer that we do not put one in place that is more extravagant that the circumstances warrant, because extravagant schemes cost money and the people who pay are the customers of the prudent banks who do not go chasing the last percentage of risky interest returns on their deposits.  The customers of prudent banks should not have to pay for people who play very close to the wire and go for the last single 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>Chapter VI deals with acquiring transactions by a licence holder of over 10 per cent of the shares in another financial institution and to the acquisition of holdings of the same size by another party in a licence holder in the State.  That is a matter to be reported to the Central Bank for adjudication.  If the amount in question is 20 per cent or more, then the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank get involved.  The section also states that when adjudicating in circumstances such as these, the Minister has the power to consult with other Ministers.  As the Minister pointed out in his speech, one can hardly open the financial pages of any paper without seeing mergers and acquisitions reports from all over Europe.  We will not be immune from that.  Indeed, we had a couple of very high profile mergers as leading news stories for most of last year.</P>
    <P>The power the Minister is seeking for himself and the bank is appropriate.  My only quibble is that the whole business of regulation can inhibit activity.  In circumstances where regulation is required we should ensure that there is only one regulator.  I would not like it if a bank which acquires 20 per cent of another institution would have to go to the Central Bank, the Minister for Finance and, under the Mergers Take-Over and Monopolies Act, 1978, to the Minister for <Col N="1870" /> Industry and Commerce.  I would like the Minister to clarify this.  I agree with the section but if we are to regulate along the lines the Minister proposes, the Central Bank and the Minister for Finance should be the regulators and it should stop there. I do not see the necessity to have different Ministers as heads of Departments having powers under different legislation. I am not clear whether what I am saying is correct, but I would like the Minister to clarify that he and the Central Bank will be the sole regulators under the powers sought under the provisions of Chapter VI of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In Chapter VII the Minister looks for authority to supervise certain institutions in the International Financial Services Centre.  Chapters VIII and IX look for similar authority in the case of financial futures and options exchanges and moneybrokers.  The Central Bank is the appropriate authority here.  I have no objection to the principle of this.  The only part of the Minister's speech to which I have an objection was where he said:</P>
    <P>The Government know that this expertise is a key factor in promoting our successs in the international financial services arena, and more particularly in the achievement by the International Financial Services Centre of the goals we have set for it. I would hope that all Deputies will take note of this.  Some seem too ready, for their own reasons, to be dismissive of our strengths in this field, but this does us a disservice in trying to build a brighter future and carve out an international reputation in financial services.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East)</i>: &mdash;&mdash;there are some difficulties in the approach that the Minister and the Government are adopting to the International Financial Services Centre.  It would be a very good thing if the Minister would strengthen the financial services industry in this country.  There are opportunities for many young people to be employed in the International Financial Services Centre.</P>
      <P>I have, in common with other Deputies, received a copy of the report that was submitted to the Financial Services Committee of the Irish Government by the Lafferty Business Research Organisation. It is a fair evaluation despite some attempts by spokespersons for the Government to rubbish it.  It sets out the purpose and objectives of a strong financial services industry.  The first objective is to offer a high quality and stable employment to university and high school graduates and attract back some of those who have been forced to emigrate to the United States and to the United Kingdom for lack of opportunities here.  I do not disagree with that.  It is absolutely fundamental.  The second objective is to exploit the characteristics of the financial services industry &mdash; that is, the demand for an intelligent computer competent workforce and an almost insatiable need for ancillary, professional and technical support services to create a self-made growth point within the Irish economy.  We also support that. The third objective is to justify State policies and expenditure on the development of a workforce suitable for a knowledge economy as well as the IDA's financial support of the computer software industry by the establishment of a broadly defined service industry that would be a major user of such skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report then goes on to criticise the <Col N="1873" /> manner in which the Government are seeking to fulfil these objectives.  The report talks about the well known significant international banking centres in Europe &mdash; London, Luxembourg and the Channel Islands and says we are going in the wrong direction.  The Minister has that report.  The report argues very strongly for bringing into law a confidentiality of banking Act.  The Minister made no reference whatsoever to that in the course of his remarks.</P>
    <P>When we move to the appendix to the report there is talk about relative strengths and weaknesses between Switzerland, Luxembourg, the Channel Islands and Ireland.  It contains a fairly long table to which I might draw the Minister's attention because it points up the inadequacies of our policy in regard to the International Financial Services Centre, if we support the three objectives I have read out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill from the Progressive Democrats represents a straight-forward endorsement by them of a Fine Gael policy.  Fine Gael proposed this precise measure in the Dáil on 7 December 1987 in the debate on Committee Stage of the Restrictive Practices Bill.  We advanced that proposal again in our policy document on 1992 published in June 1988.  As a result of our initiative and of the agreement of the Minister this matter is now being examined in detail by the Fair Trade Commission.  While I support the Bill I would favour awaiting that body's report before finalising its details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our competition law must be shaken up.  Prices here are too high.  Cosy deals <Col N="1874" /> to push up costs abound, particularly in the services sector.  Such abuse should be prohibited outright as Fine Gael, and now the Progressive Democrats in this Bill, propose.  The present law against these anti-competitive practices does not work.  It is too cumbersome, too slow, too narrow in its focus and too uncertain as to its meaning.  For anything to be done in regard to any particular anti-competitive practice, first there has to be a complaint made.  Secondly, there has to be an investigation by the Director of Fair Trade; third, a report by the Fair Trade Commission; fourth a recommendation from the Minister for an order to be made to implement that report from the Fair Trade Commission; fifth, a decision by the Government to approve that order; sixth a decision by the Dáil to approve the order and, seventh, a decision by the Seanad to approve the order.  Only after all of those seven stages have been gone through can anything be done to stamp out an abuse.  This simply takes far too long.  Even then the order refers to a particular trade only, the trade about which the original complaint was made.  Indeed in many cases the Minister is powerless even to make an order after that lengthy process.  For example, action recommended by the Fair Trade Commission on restrictive practices in the legal profession and in the travel trade has been ignored because it represents matters for another Minister.  That is simply not good enough.  An outright ban across the board on unfair trade practices is what we need.  Then everybody will know where they stand.  They will not be dependent on the vagaries of the seven stage process I have just described.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his remarks yesterday, raised some problems in regard to the provisions of the Bill concerning the role, or lack of role, for the Fair Trade Commission and the need for the Minister to retain his order-making powers and other drafting points of that kind.  All of these can be dealt with by way of amendment on Committee Stage.  I would hope that we would have a report from the Fair Trade Commission before the Committee Stage of <Col N="1875" /> this Bill, or whatever Bill is to be used as a vehicle for implementing these proposals.</P>
    <P>In summary, action along the lines of this Bill is needed.  It is urgent because we compete with other countries in the EC who have tough competition laws like this.  Since December 1987, when I first raised the matter here, numerous other European countries have decided to adopt this exact procedure.  This is the case in Britain, France, Portugal and Greece.  We cannot afford to be behind the rest of Europe in ensuring that efficiency is the order of the day in our economy and that that efficiency is achieved by a prohibition on anti-competitive practices as we, in Fine Gael, want to see and this Bill proposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There is cross-party agreement on the need to tighten up Irish competition law in the context in which such is set out in Deputy Cullen's Bill. The main proposals of his Bill constitute major changes in Irish and EC competition law.  They would appear to comprise the introduction of a general prohibition on anti-competitive practices in all sectors of our economy.  There is provision for the courts to award damages, amending the present provisions of the Restrictive Practices Acts of 1972 and 1987, in order that the legality of certain practices should be judged solely by reference to their anti-competitive effects, for example, by ensuring that it would no longer be possible to judge a restrictive practice by reference to unreasonably restricting competition.  It is also proposed to remove the present limitation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome which, as we know, apply only in so far as there is a restrictive practice affecting trade between member states. The application of the full rigours of the proposed new competition law should apply to semi-State bodies while allowing them a statutory monopoly which would not be open to challenge but making it unlawful for them to use their monopoly position to discriminate against foreign firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1876" /> Irish legislation currently approaches competition from the base of control of abuse as opposed to a prohibition basis. It has been fairly evident in recent years that a control of abuse basis is not as effective as a prohibition basis.  I suppose one could contend that our legislation at present is from based as opposed to effects based.  Clearly it would be desirable to have an effects-based form of legislation so that emphasis would be placed on the potential effect on the customer or supplier.  There are too many examples here of detrimental effects on suppliers and certainly on customers.  It is clear that the legislation obtaining is not sufficiently effective to properly protect the consumer and supplier alike.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the best way of achieving the objective of protecting the customer and supplier would be to prohibit agreement and certain practices which are anti-competitive.  Everybody is agreed that it would be desirable to prohibit agreements and certain practices which are anti-competitive.  That system, as opposed to the present one, would concentrate on agreements and practices which had an effect on the market as a whole.  Of course, in a complex area such as this it is difficult to find the perfect solution.  There are disadvantages entailed in prohibition as opposed to control of abuse.  For example, undoubtedly there would be a period of uncertainty for industry and lawyers, although the argument could be advanced that there is no ample precedent in Europe under Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome which could be adapted to the domestic scene fairly rapidly by the Director of Consumer Affairs and the High Court should an appeal be lodged there.  It is, to say the least, a difficult balancing act to weigh up the public interest.</P>
    <P>The underlying philosophy of Irish trade law should be the promotion of competition and the elimination of anti-competitive practices in so far as that is possible.  Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome prohibits anti-competitive agreements if they affect trade between member states.  It is true that agreements, which may be purely internal, may still <Col N="1877" /> fall within the scope of Community law. For example, when two companies within the same country become involved in anti-competitive practices, and if it has an effect on companies outside that country but within the EC, then clearly such anti-competitive practices will come within the ambit of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  However, all too often there are concerted practices and anti-competitive practices performed by agreement within the country which are not governed by Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome and which do result in detrimental effects on customers and suppliers. There are however certain defects in Article 85 and it has been clearly established in Brussels that under Article 85 there are severe delays.  These delays are not ordinary delays but are undue delays. This led France, for example, to reform its own laws.</P>
    <P>It is clearly desirable then to bring Irish legislation into line with EC law.  It is true that agreements can be exempted under EC law.  It is also true that the Irish Government may wish to prohibit certain things under domestic law which are not prohibited under EC law.  In approaching legislation of this kind, because the country is a member state of the EC, compatibility with European law in so far as that is possible is most desirable.  It is fair to point out as well that a general prohibition, while it is certainly desirable, will greatly depend on the way in which the exemption criteria are drawn up and indeed the administrative procedures for operating the law.  In this respect the Director of Consumer Affairs would have power to make his decision on what Deputy Cullen describes in his Bill as the rule of reason basis, that is to say, if the pro-competitive features outweigh the anti-competitive features, then no exemption should be granted.  Many have argued that a list of specific prohibitions should be drawn up and inserted in any Bill dealing with this area.  At first sight that would appear to be the correct procedure but on consideration, while exemptions might be desirable in certain circumstances one would have to become specific and define what circumstances <Col N="1878" /> this would apply to and this of course would obviously generate immediate difficulty. The restrictive trade practices policy in several countries have been examined, and it was examined in Great Britain in a report which was presented in March 1988.  In that document the people who were investigating the situation in England felt:</P>
    <P>the law should state that, in particular, the prohibition applies to the following agreements and concerted practices:</P>
    <P>(i)  those fixing prices and charges including any terms or conditions (e.g. discounts, credit terms) which determine effective net prices (recommendations by trade, professional and other associations on prices or charges are also included if those recommendations have the effect of determining minimum or actual prices);</P>
    <P>(ii)  collusive tendering;</P>
    <P>(iii)  those sharing or allocating markets, customers, raw materials or other inputs, production or capacity;</P>
    <P>(iv)  those prohibiting or otherwise restricting advertising or the provision of other promotional information;</P>
    <P>(v)  collective refusals to supply or to deal with suppliers, collective discrimination in the terms on which different customers or classes of customers are supplied, and collective anti-competitive conditions of supply such as tie-ins, aggregated or loyalty rebates and &ldquo;no competition&rdquo; clauses.</P>
    <P>When dealing with exemptions it is again desirable to have a general test, but if there is to be a general test it would be necessary to publish with the legislation guidance notes in order to inform people or interested parties what is or is not desirable within the context of what should or should not be exempted.  Article 85.3 of the Treaty of Rome has an <Col N="1879" /> umbrella provision which appears to be broadly followed by Deputy Cullen in his draft Bill.  Article 85.3 in its umbrella provision states that it allows otherwise prohibited agreements to be exempted only if they satisfy certain criteria and these are that they must:</P>
    <P>(i)  contribute to improving the production or distribution of goods, or promote technical or economic progress;</P>
    <P>(ii)  allow consumers a fair share of the resulting benefit;</P>
    <P>(iii)  not entail restrictions which go beyond what is indispensable to attain those objectives;</P>
    <P>(iv)  not allow competition to be eliminated.</P>
    <P>Section (1) (3) of Deputy Cullen's Bill says:</P>
    <P>(3)  The provisions of subsection (1) may, however, be declared inapplicable in the case of any agreement, decision or concerted practice or category of agreements, decisions or concerted practices between individuals, trade associations or companies where the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade is satisfied that the agreement, decision or concerted practice or category of agreements, decisions or concerted practices (as the case may be) contribute to improving the production and distribution of goods or to promoting technical and economic progress and which do not&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  impose on the individuals, trade associations or companies concerned terms which are not indispensable to the attainment of those objectives; and</P>
    <P>(b)  afford such individuals, trade associations or companies the possibility of eliminating competition in respect of a substantial part of the product in question.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that we have to agree <Col N="1880" /> that there are serious administrative difficulties with this part of the Bill.  First, one would have to define what constitutes economic progress and, second, what constitutes technical progress.  How far then could measures claimed to promote economic progress or technical progress justify the restriction on competition? This poses an immediate difficulty and is one which would have to be deliberated upon for some time.  For example, an applicant could say that a restriction is beneficial because of public safety, or he could use a whole host of reasons not hitherto considered or perhaps apparent but reasons nonetheless which he could put forward to justify a restriction. Indeed it is interesting to note that when West Germany considered the law in this area they limited the exemption categories. Some commentators feel that this is virtually impossible and argue for a block exemption; but block exemption or no block exemption, the administrative difficulties of definition in connection with technical progress and economic progress and the reasons or excuses which could be put forward by an applicant under these headings cause problems and this is certainly something which would have to be more seriously considered and worked out in far greater detail than is at present the case.</P>
    <P>I think that on balance most people are agreed that block exemptions are desirable and should be introduced.  I would say however that any such block exemptions should, in so far as it is possible, be compatible with EC law.</P>
    <P>The review commission in England felt that categories such as exclusive distribution and purchasing agreements, patent licensing, intellectual property and know-how agreements, R and D agreements, franchising agreements and, interestingly, exemptions for sectors and professional services should be included in the block exemptions.  With the question of sectors and professional services, it was felt that the merits of each individual case should be considered.</P>
    <P>It is only fair that the Restrictive Practices Commission be given some credit for making the first suggestion of change <Col N="1881" /> in this area.  That commission are now known as the Fair Trade Commission. In a 1977 study the Restrictive Practices Commission suggested change.  Clearly, the basis of this Bill is to change over to the EC prohibition system and away from the control of abuse system.  The Bill is certainly modelled on Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  The Minister in his address here last night said that the Fair Trade Commission are at present looking at the position.  He favoured the Fair Trade Commission being allowed to get on with that job and it is fair to say that they are getting on with it.  In March 1988 they invited submissions.  This entire area is by no means simple.  It is, to say the least, extremely complex.  In approaching a drive away from a control of abuse system to a prohibition system and in defining what the exemptions should be and the manner in which they should be granted, it is clear that the House would need to be extremely careful.</P>
    <P>It occurs to me that the first question that arises in relation to legislation such as this is whether it is constitutional to grant judicial powers, of the kind mentioned, to the director.  That is clearly a very important point.  This aspect of the matter would need very careful handling and very careful investigation before one could say with any amount of clarity that this House would be constitutionally entitled to grant judicial powers of the kind mentioned to an individual.  The director is not a judicial personage.  The Bill confers on the director what I would regard clearly as, at the very least, quasi-judicial powers.</P>
    <P>We had in this House in the last number of years tremendous debate as to whether, for example, the Attorney General could or should make decisions in relation to warrant applications under Irish extradition law.  This Bill gives to the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade considerable powers of a judicial nature.  I certainly feel that the conferring of such powers on the director would be questioned under the Constitution. This area needs to be considered extremely carefully.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1882" /> There are other difficult questions to be answered apart from the question of the judicial powers of the director and whether he should or should not be conferred with those powers.  Among the most difficult questions to be answered is which powers at present exercised by the European Community could be exercised by the Fair Trade Commission.  That is a relatively complex and difficult area.  The next question to be asked is which powers could be exercised by the Minister if those powers could not be exercised by the Fair Trade Commission.  The third question is obviously, if it is felt that neither the Minister nor the commission can exercise the powers mentioned, which body could do so.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the most crucial question, having agreed in principle with the broad thrust of what the Bill is designed to do but advising caution until the investigation by the Fair Trade Commission has been completed. A prohibition system of the kind set out in this Bill would be an extremely costly system.  The prohibition system, as I said, is clearly desirable but one would have to question whether at this time this country with scarce resources can agree to a proposal by the Progressive Democrats for the expenditure of what would be a very large amount of money in operating the mechanics of the system proposed.  The difficulties which this presents at a time of scarce resources have to be examined and the question asked as to whether there are other areas which require expenditure more urgently at a time of great difficulty for the country.  That is something the House would have to seriously consider.  Public expenditure constraints being what they are at present, it is fairly clear that there are more urgent areas of activity which require funding.</P>
    <P>The Bill, while conferring great powers on the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade &mdash; this may or may not be constitutional, seems to be silent for some remarkable reason on the position of the Fair Trade Commission.  There is mention of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade in virtually every <Col N="1883" /> section of the Bill but very little mention of the role of the Fair Trade Commission. Are the Fair Trade Commission to work in concert with the director or is there some other reason behind this?  If I had another criticism of the Bill it would be that it is vague as regards where Irish legislation currently on the Statute Book fits into the new prohibition system.</P>
    <P>Because of the constitutional factor, the fact that Irish legislation now on the Statute Book is not really considered in the context of the entirety of competition legislation and the fact that a considerable amount of work must first go into ascertaining what powers can be legally exercised, the Fair Trade Commission should at this stage be allowed get on with the job of delving further into this matter which is of such great importance to consumers and employers alike.  However, there are many parts of this Bill that are extremely welcome but it would be premature, without having sight of the deliberations of the Fair Trade Commission, to pass a Bill such as this at this time because of the dangers, traps and pitfalls I have mentioned earlier.</P>

      <P>I would like to say at the outset, for the purpose of getting the record right, that there is a printers' error in the explanatory memorandum that accompanies this Bill.  The last three sentences that appear in paragraph 8 should have been removed and were so marked in the proof copy but unfortunately it was overlooked.  I mention it because some of the sentences are actually self-contradictory and would be confusing to someone trying to study it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to say at the outset that I am profoundly disappointed by the speech which the Minister for Industry and Commerce made last night on this Bill.  He does not seem to realise what huge anti-competitive problems there are in the Irish economy and, <Col N="1884" /> indeed, deeply ingrained in Irish society as a whole, but exhibiting also serious economic consequences.  In short, he does not seem to appreciate that in this country we have a greater degree of collusion, price fixing and concerted improper practices than in any other Community country or in any other OECD country.  Time and again we are reminded that things that are apparently regarded as normal commercial practices here, however sharp they might be and accepted as such, can be looked on with great disfavour in other countries and can often not alone be a breach of the civil law in those countries but sometimes a breach of the criminal law there.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, the Minister does not seem to realise that we need precisely this sort of legislation to prepare us for 1992.  With the partial exception of Britain, all other European Community countries have applied the principles of the competition Articles of the Treaty of Rome to their domestic law.  Those two Articles, 85 and 86, are in a broad sense themselves based on the provisions of the Sherman Act in the United States.  It is no coincidence that the societies and the economies which least tolerate collusion, price fixing, non-competition and restrictive practices are the ones that are also most successful, most vibrant and most creative of employment.</P>
      <P>We have three years to go before the final opening up of Europe to us, and of us opening up to Europe.  We heard last night from the Minister a negative, cautious, inward looking and protectionist speech that could just as easily have been delivered in the forties or the fifties as it was delivered by him last night in 1989. Whoever wrote that speech for him &mdash; I will give him the credit of assuming that he did not write it himself &mdash; has no conception whatever of what a dynamic economy or a dynamic society is.  If this is how the Government and their advisers think, God help us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regrettably much of what the Minister had to say does not extend beyond somewhat mealy-mouthed nit-picking with the draftsmanship of the Bill.  The truth is that the draftsmanship of this Bill or <Col N="1885" /> indeed any other Bill that seeks to substitute the realities of the modern world for the inherited protectionism of Irish commercial and professional activity, should not and does not matter.  The core of this Bill is in sections 1 to 3 inclusive. The principles are set down there.  After that, all the other sections are relatively minor and can be changed or taken out as necessary, or can be amended or expanded as seen fit.  I am not concerned about any drafting defects that might or might not be in those sections because they can be put right very rapidly.</P>
    <P>We have to produce Bills of this kind without the assistance of any qualified draftsman.  We have, on the other hand, the assistance of very highly qualified practitioners in this particular field which has been of invaluable help to us.  The drafting is only a minor technical aspect; the principle is what matters.  It is the principle we should all be looking at, and the principle is what the Minister should be looking at and asking himself whether he wants to reject or accept that principle. The letter of those sections is of little consequence but the spirit of them is of huge importance, and the spirit of those sections is needed in this country and is a challenge to this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech seemed to give the impression that the existing legislation on restrictive practices in this country, consisting of three Acts and a number of orders made under them, is satisfactory and is working well.  He seeks to give the impression that anti-competitive practices are kept down and under control and that they are not damaging our economy and the consumer.  Of course, the reality could not be more different. Our legislation is minimal.  The 1972 Act, as Deputy Bruton among others pointed out, was cumbersome, bureaucratic and extremely difficult to work and extraordinarily slow to produce anything.  It has been improved by the 1987 Act but, between them, they fall far short of anything that is needed in a modern economy that is outward looking, competitive and not prepared to tolerate improper commercial and professional practices.</P>
    <P>The Mergers and Monopolies Act, <Col N="1886" /> 1978, is quite out of date now because the circumstances today are totally different to those of 11 years ago when that Act was passed.  The Act was drafted and passed in an entirely domestic context. The international, and specifically the Community, context is every bit as important today as the domestic context was in looking at the kind of problems the 1978 Act deals with.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned 11 orders which had been made since 1972 as representing, collectively with the three Statutes which I mentioned, Irish Statute law on competition.  Most of the 11 orders are a joke.  Only two of them, the Grocery Order, 1987, and the Motor Spirits Order, 1981, have any real significance or effectual meaning.  Even those two, as we well know have very limited effect. The activities of some of the multiples in the grocery trade seem to be no less predatory today than they were some years ago.  The position of manufacturers in this country supplying those multiples seems to be as vulnerable and as fragile today as it was some years ago before the latest order was made.  Commercial arrangements in the motor spirit trade in this country have an unusual cosiness about them that would hardly win approval in Wall Street or in Washington.</P>
    <P>What possible use or relevance is the Cookers and Ranges Order?  What is supposed to be the value of the Electrical Goods Order?  In each case the ESB are flagrantly abusing their dominant position within the Irish market.  They are giving customers 12 months free credit, paid for by the general electricity consumer who funds the crazy retail commercial activities of the ESB which are hugely loss making, by paying an unnecessarily high price for electricity. Has any of this legislation, or any of these orders been used to put any curb on these abuses by the ESB of their dominant position?</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us we have a control of abuse system &mdash; as he called it &mdash; and that this Bill would seek to introduce parallel with that the prohibition system that is modelled on Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  I question whether <Col N="1887" /> we have a control of abuse system.  What abuses are we controlling under our present legislation?</P>
    <P>The restrictive practices legislation has applied to services since 1972.  What orders have been made in relation to services?  The answer is none in 17 years. At the same time we have a system whereby many services, professional and otherwise, are provided on a notoriously non-competitive basis and where the interest of the consumer comes a bad last at all times.  Is it not very much better that we prohibit anti-competitive practices rather than give some sort of theoretical powers to a commission and a Minister to make orders after lengthy inquiries and when in practice, they rarely make such an order, and even when it is made, find it very difficult to take proceedings to enforce it successfully? What has been the value of the order on non-alcoholic drinks when the profit margins on non-alcoholic drinks in certain premises is 150 per cent, 200 per cent and at times 250 per cent and more? Has the order prevented improper concerted practices or improper profiteering? Two years ago under the 1987 Act the list of services covered by the legislation was extended to include banks, communications and electricity. This extension was obviously very welcome on paper but what value has it been in practice?  What orders have been made in the meantime curbing improper practices in these fields, of which unquestionably there are many?</P>
    <P>Take the banks for example.  I pointed out a couple of months ago that the two major banks in this country have engaged in a price fixing agreement that is grossly anti-competitive and amounts to improper collusion by any standards in agreeing between themselves identical interest rates and sets of conditions for Visa and Access credit cards.  A smaller bank which also issues Access credit cards does so at a lower rate of interest and is endeavouring to compete but the two major banks have persisted, despite historically low interest rates and extremely cheap money, in charging their <Col N="1888" /> customers 24.6 per cent interest on their outstanding balances.  This rate of charge is more than ten times the rate of inflation.  I remember a few years ago when the rate of interest charged by the banks was less than the rate of inflation, and that happened during this decade.  It is nearly four times the real cost of money here and it is a scandal that these banks are allowed to continue in this collusive manner to rip off their customers.</P>
    <P>I have written to the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade about the matter.  He has acknowledged my letter but when he can get around to doing something concrete about this remains to be seen.  I can sympathise with his difficulties because he is supposed to be the enforcer of this legislation in every field and it is not open, except in very limited circumstances, to injured individuals to take action.  The beauty of this Bill is that it allows an aggrieved consumer to take the necessary steps to rectify this improper and anti-competitive practice if he is affected by it.  Such a consumer could sue, if this Bill were passed, one or the other of the two banks concerned, or both of them.  The damages he would recover would be the difference between the interest he was forced to pay at the exhorbitant money lending rate of nearly £1 in £4 and the amount he would have had to pay at an interest rate the High Court would consider reasonable in the circumstances at the time and given market conditions then existing.  In the case of an individual customer of one of those banks that might amount to only perhaps £200, £300 or £400 in a particular case but if these damages of a few hundred pounds were multiplied by 100,000 customers the banks concerned would very rapidly desist from their collusive practice of agreeing together to overcharge their respective customers by the same amount.</P>
    <P>One of Deputy O'Donoghue's objections to the Bill was that there would be a lot of litigation in enforcing its terms and, therefore, the expenditure of large sums of money and a huge number of officials would be called for.  He misunderstands the nature of the Bill and the <Col N="1889" /> enforcement provisions in it.  The beauty of the Bill is that you would not have to get the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade to enforce the law for you: you would enforce it yourself as a civil plaintiff and, of course, you would do that at no cost to the State.  That is the way it is done in other countries and it is the way in which it is done in the Court of the European Community.  That objection, like some others Deputy O'Donoghue raised this evening, and which I will deal with later, are clearly invalid.</P>
    <P>The type of action which I have described, and the examples I have given, are I suggest the kind of action and the kind of legislation we need.  The examples I have given show the reasons why we need such legislation.  This is what is available to citizens on the mainland of Europe.  Why should we deprive our citizens of the advantages of the same approach?  The Community confers these rights on our citizens where international trading is concerned.  The countries on the mainland of Europe confer these rights on their citizens in relation to domestic and professional activities.  Why do we in this country deprive our citizens of their domestic rights?  We can stop depriving them if the House passes this Bill.</P>
    <P>Our economy at domestic level particularly, and our services which are nearly all provided domestically, are riddled with inefficiencies.  Up to now instead of regulating these restrictive actions and agreements and these abuses of dominant positions we have, both in our laws and attitudes, tended to institutionalise them. We have sanctified things like the scale fee as if no alternative could ever be contemplated.  Our lawyers in particular have sought for generations to bury their heads in the sand.  They are not perhaps unique in this; British experience up to fairly recently was not dissimilar.  The result of the British experience was the action taken by the Lord Chancellor in Britain within the past few weeks which is doing more, and will do more, to change the practice of the law in Britain than anything else that has happened <Col N="1890" /> during the past 350 years.  As always happens when reasonable change is resisted, it bursts out like a floodgate.  That is what has happened in Britain during the past two or three weeks and it may well happen here if we are not prepared to accept the sort of changes I am talking about and the different, more open-minded and outward looking attitude that this Bill represents.  I will give other examples.  Consultant medical practitioners in certain branches of medicine &mdash; and not least one has to think of the branch of pathology &mdash; have sought to preserve in some areas the indefensible at the expense of the public.  Trade unions have sought to impose and enforce agreements relating to deliberate and gross overmanning, as many firms and companies, including semi-State ones, well know and we still in some curious sort of way still seem to pine for that and think that in some respect it is admirable.</P>
    <P>The official Government view here, as exhibited by the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce last night, is that we will move very slowly towards the regulation of these matters, that we will pooh-pooh the basic tenets of the European Community rather than let them upset us or introduce them unnecessarily without compulsion into our domestic law.  Articles 85 and 86 of the Rome Treaty are among the great success stories of the European Community. People like Commissioner Sutherland and others have demonstrated time and again in their speeches and actions what can be achieved in the development of the European economy by the introduction of competition and the suppression of restrictive practices. Are we really open for business?  Are we open to take on all-comers and to let all-comers take us on or is this only Government propaganda when in reality we are trying to retain our protectionist practices? This question I have put will be answered by whether or not this Bill passes through the House.  Drafting problems in it need not and cannot be used as an excuse for not passing it.  Any drafting defects can be and will be made good. The spirit and principle of the first three <Col N="1891" /> sections of the Bill are what count.  Are we for those or are we for lingering protectionism, collusion and restriction?</P>
    <P>In the Federal Republic of Germany there is really only one sector in the economy, whereas in Ireland there are two. There is the internationally traded sector here which has to operate under the principles of Articles 85 and 86 and there is the domestic sector which is still heavily protected, if not by tariffs, at least by all sorts of restrictive agreements and practices and official and unofficial nods and winks.  The result is there for anyone to see, our internationally traded sector is relatively efficient.  It has to be, otherwise it would disappear.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, our domestic sector is extremely sluggish and this includes the provision of almost all services that are supplied in this country.  The purely domestic trading sector is feather-bedded and protected against the cold reality of life in the real world of Europe where anti-competitive practices and the abuse of dominant position are forbidden.</P>
    <P>The net effect of the Minister for Industry and Commerce's speech last night is to seek to pour cold water on Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome so far as one might seek to apply them in this country.  In doing this, he is running directly counter to his contentions that he is making Europe efficient.  The particular feature of Articles 85 and 86 is that they are civilly enforceable by the award of damages.  We would like to see the same here.  The Minister asked last night if we intend that sections 19 and 23 of the 1972 Act which allowed the director to apply for an injunction should be retained.  I see no objection whatever in retaining them, for what they are worth.  I put this question: how often have they been used by the director since 1972 to obtain an injunction?  Is it not infinitely more valuable and more salutary that an aggrieved and injured individual can get damages or get an injunction himself?</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that this Bill, like the relevant Articles in the Rome Treaty, stays in the realms of civil law only.  It does not extend into the field <Col N="1892" /> of criminal sanctions.  Many will argue that it should.  The effect of the efficient anti-drugs laws of the United States, extensive and worthwhile as they are, were found not to be sufficient when their jurisdiction was confined to civil damages and injunctions only.  It was found necessary to create a criminal jurisdiction as well and to enforce it, and it is enforced. People go to jail in the United States of America today, and have done for years past, because they agreed with their competitors to fix prices or to restrict supplies, or to supply certain people only, or otherwise to rig a market.  These practices are neither criminal offences in this country nor even civil wrongs.  They become amenable only if the Minister makes an order and the House, the Oireachtas, has to confirm that order by legislation.  It is not effectual until that is done.  If the Minister makes an order on the advice of the Commission after investigation by the director, even then, how often are these orders enforced?  How relevant are some of them today, as per the list obtained from the Minister for Industry and Commerce last night.</P>
    <P>Only four years ago in this House we had a Bill brought forward called the Air Transport Bill, which made it an offence to compete in the airline or travel agency business.  For the appalling offence of giving 1 or 2 per cent off a fare by way of discount, the travel agent or airline operator faced two years in jail under that Bill or a fine of £100,000 or both.</P>
    <P>At the same time in the same business in the United States, one could face two years in jail or a fine of up to $0.5 million for not competing and for charging the same price as one's competitor.  Who was right?  Was it the Americans or was it us? It has since been proved that it was the Americans and we have accepted that.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us tonight is another instalment in the same saga.  Are we going to be as slow to learn our lesson as we were in 1984 and 1985?  This present Dáil is full of people congratulating themselves on their wisdom in allowing competition to be introduced into air transport in and out of this country.  In 1984 and 1985 there were four Divisions <Col N="1893" /> held in this House in which 165 people voted on each occasion for protectionism and one voted for competition.  We have seen the benefits of that competition since, even if it is our own emigrants who are the main beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>We need above all else to foster an enterprise culture.  This Bill gives us an opportunity to take a fundamental step in regard to it.  For many people their whole upbringing and outlook is anti-enterprise, anti-competitive and protectionist. We have never broken away from that fundamental attitude that has been instilled into so many of our people. We have to make the gesture and it is in the passage of this Bill that we will more effectively and more practically make that gesture than in any other way.  If we really mean what the Government and others say about 1992, we cannot afford not to pass this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a commitment towards progress, competition and European success.  Defeat for the Bill represents a negative introspection and an anxiety to retain outdated practices of restriction and protectionism.  I think we should vote for progress.</P>
    <P>The failure of State enterprises here to compete, and their abuse of their monopoly or dominant position have been severely damaging to the economy.  It has hugely increased our manufacturing costs, particularly.  It has accentuated our natural disadvantages as a manufacturing centre.  It has made us uncompetitive and thereby lost to us a vast quantity of employment.</P>
    <P>Section 10 (9) applies the terms of the Bill to most of those commercial bodies. Many of them are worth looking at.  For example, as consumers and manufacturers of food in this country have we been that well served by the Irish Sugar Company monopoly?  Have industry and the travelling public been well served by the statutory provisions underpinning CIE?  Should legislation dating back to 1932 continue to be retained as the principal legislation governing the provision of internal transport and travel in this country?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1894" /> One of the few real successes in commercial terms in this country, in the public sphere, the Irish Life Assurance Company, continue to have one of their hands permanently tied behind their backs?  Should the ESB be allowed to continue to treat all their consumers in an arrogant take it or leave it fashion in the years to come?  Should Telecom Éireann be allowed to retain their monopoly? Is it in the public interest that their charges are so incredibly high?  Are RTE not in a healthier position when subject to competition than when there is none?  Why did they resist competition for so long and why were they allowed to keep down that competition for so long? Why were Aer Lingus allowed to operate on a non-competitive cartel basis for their first half century?  Have not the economy and the consumer enormously benefited, as well as Aer Lingus themselves, since they partially at least gave up these anti-competitive practices?  Have RTE not improved since competition began to become a reality?  Will CIE not improve if competition of a real kind is allowed?</P>
    <P>Why should different companies and people not compete for the business that local authorities, Government Departments, State boards, etc., can give them in fulfilment of their statutory duty?  Why should local authorities and so on all seek to do work themselves that can be done much more efficiently and more cheaply by others, particularly when the others have to compete for the business?</P>
    <P>Whatever way we look at it, we have to accept that Ireland at present is fundamentally out of step with European law in these matters.  With the advent of the single market in 1992, it is imperative that we update our law dealing with anti-competitive practices of all kinds and thereby prepare this country for the greater competition soon to emanate from Europe.  This Bill will protect both traders and consumers from anti-competitive practices and create a much more competitive environment for the business community.</P>
    <P>At present, strangely enough, there is no general ban on anti-competitive behaviour in Irish law and this factor is <Col N="1895" /> seriously hampering our economy from expanding.  It is wrong that price fixing and price collusion are prevalent, particularly in the professional services sector. The Irish consumer is not being offered the proper range of choice that is available throughout most countries in Europe and is, therefore, being forced to pay in many instances substantially higher prices for goods and services than he or she have to do if a proper competitive environment existed.  That is the bottom line of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to Deputy Bruton for indicating his support and I am hopeful of support from the other Opposition parties.  I see reason that they should not support the Bill.  I particularly seek the support of the Government.  I have dealt with most of the points made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce last night.  He was mainly concerned about drafting points and these are minor matters which can easily be rectified in a very short time.  The principle contained in this Bill is one with which neither he nor anybody in the House or outside it will quibble.  It is a principle which should be accepted and this Bill should be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last contributor's speech there was a great deal of rhetoric and an insistence that the suggestion that there should be some prudence at this point was in some way detrimental to the economy.  There was the assertion that there are huge anti-competitive problems and that we have a greater degree of collusion in price fixing and of abnormalities in commercial practice than any other OECD country.  It was a fine contribution in terms of debate, but the only thing missing was evidence.  With the exception of the banks, where I accept that there are unacceptable cartel arrangements which should be terminated, not a scintilla or shred of evidence was produced.  Not a shred of evidence was produced to uphold the suggestion that the expansion of the economy is being prevented by current practices.  If <Col N="1896" /> that is the case, we were not enlightened as to when the prohibition on the extension of the economy was commenced.</P>
      <P>The assertion throughout the contribution was that the Minister had set his face implacably against the principles outlined in the Bill.  My reading of the Minister's contribution makes it clear that this is not what the Minister suggested. He suggested that it would be prudent to wait until the investigation by the Fair Trade Commission into the possibility of incorporating Articles 85 and 86 into domestic legislation was completed. Deputy O'Malley and his party suggest from time to time that independent tribunals and groups should make welcome contributions and I cannot see why he should finish in such high dudgeon and should whip himself into such a frenzied fury.  The Minister suggested that there is no compulsive argument in favour of a leap in the dark but rather that it is worth our while waiting until the study which was commenced is completed.  That would be a more prudent way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the inclusion of Articles 85 and 86 in domestic law, even if that debate is somewhat premature.  The proposals in this Bill are not particularly new.  It is sad that Deputy O'Malley has just left the House because I could remind him were he still here that the last time these proposals emerged in this House and were subject to common debate was when a report was made in 1977.  It was suggested then that a new direction should be taken and that the prohibition approach adopted here should be considered.  The Restrictive Practices Commission suggested that we should move from the &ldquo;control of abuse&rdquo; means of preventing anti-competitive practice and should look instead at a prohibition system.  That is what is proposed in this Bill.  Deputy O'Malley knows as well as I who was Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1977 and who was in Government.  The then response from Deputy O'Malley and others was that this would impose a huge burden and would be costly and bureaucratic.  Those are the arguments which can be adduced now, <Col N="1897" /> as they were adduced then, against the prohibition system.  I am not saying that those arguments are persuasive, nor am I saying that they are arguments we should accept.  Those arguments were proposed, among others by Deputy O'Malley at that time.  They are arguments which are current.</P>
    <P>I must admit to being in something of a quandary regarding this Bill.  Deputy Cullen dealt in his contribution with a specific type of abuse which is not at all uncommon and does require attention. The abuse I have in mind is the type of abuse which commonly occurs among the so-called liberal professions.  I note that Deputy O'Malley referred also to the professions and their concerted and collusive practices.  Deputy Cullen referred to the problems encountered by solicitors. One of the difficulties here is that a private citizen who runs into problems with a solicitor will find it difficult &mdash; in rural areas well nigh impossible &mdash; to get another solicitor to act on his behalf.  The point is that the kind of collusive practice and closed shop practice which causes most problems for most people is not adverted to in the Bill.  I can give many examples from my constituency case work; so too can many other Members.</P>
    <P>One case highlighted for me the blatant ineffectiveness of the manner in which the professions compete.  Some time ago a constituent engaged a well-known Dublin solicitor to assist in the purchase of some property which was to be her retirement home.  In due course my constituent completed the purchase and sought to retire.  Oddly enough, her solicitor retired at the same time.  His practice was then taken over by a reputable firm of solicitors.  At the same time that the takeover occurred, my constituent discovered that there was a problem with regard to rights of way, secondly that the house had no planning permission, thirdly that there was no by-law approval, fourthly that there was a major problem with the title and finally that the structure, which had been passed by a member of another liberal profession, was in a dangerous condition and was about to fall <Col N="1898" /> down.  The new firm of solicitors confirmed at the outset that they had taken over the business of the first solicitor. Then they discovered that there was a time bomb in this part of the business of the first solicitor and they indicated to my constituent that the firm was no longer representing her.  Naturally the firm denied any liability in the matter.</P>
    <P>A third solicitor was brought into the act and after the passage of an inordinate amount of time and having run up very considerble fees this solicitor withdrew from the case, having reached the conclusion that as there were two solicitors involved in the action my constituent had better save herself any further anxiety or cost.  At least he was candid.  A fourth solicitor was consulted and at least on this occasion there appears to have been some considerable sympathy for my constituent, but there was no progress.  The Law Society was consulted, at first by my constituent and subsequently by me.  That was an interesting experience.  The Law Society are the watch dogs but their efforts were derisory in the extreme.  The constituent was advised to take advice from a fifth and then a sixth solicitor. Ultimately the constituent was advised by the Law Society to take the matter to court.</P>
    <P>I refer to all of this because in the ordinary lives of ordinary people the considerations which bear most heavily are not the sort of considerations which we discuss in the context of Articles 85 and 86.  The problems of collusion and malpractice which are undoubtedly there are not the type of thing dealt with by this Bill or by the Treaty of Rome.  We simply do not police well enough services provided to the public.  In this case the legal profession operated like a cosy club and closed ranks.  This is the case with other professions.  Deputy Cullen referred to this last night but did not say how this Bill would seek to address the problem or help us along the road to improvement.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to bring into law a system of regulation which is based directly on Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  These Articles were intended primarily by the drafters of the <Col N="1899" /> Treaty of Rome to address a pan-European problem of collusion, not so much between members or individuals of professions but among firms.  This is the intention of the Bill.  I do not criticise it because it does not deal with the type of collusion to which I referred.  I simply make the point that the kind of collusion that causes maximum problems and abuse in the lives of ordinary people is not addressed by this legislation.</P>
    <P>Articles 85 and 86, which lie at the core of the Treaty of Rome, are aimed at assisting in the creation of a common market in which goods, services, capital and labour circulate without impediment by the Government, commercial operators or commercial conspiracies of private operators.  Deputies Cullen and McDowell made much of the Bill's value in contributing to what was referred to by one of those speakers as a dynamic economy.  That is indeed the free market theory on which the Treaty of Rome and Articles 85 and 86 are based and that is why it is timely that we should be considering when and how we import Articles 85 and 86 to domestic legislation. However, other than to assert that the proposals contained in the Bill would create a better future &mdash; no great proof of that assertion was provided &mdash; I argue that in the last contribution, which was good from a rhetorical and debating point of view, the only evidence produced was in relation to a banking cartel.  No other evidence was produced to support the inflated charges made that anti-competitive practices, collusion and price fixing have reached a situation where we could be regarded as the most abnormal economy among the 24 OECD member states.  It is worth emphasising this point because, if we are to move in this direction, we should do so for the right reasons.  The right reasons are the timeliness of the movement; the wrong reasons are the rhetoric put forward here tonight.</P>
    <P>As I said, no proof of the assertion was produced last night.  Neither Deputy Cullen nor Deputy McDowell sought to produce evidence of the problems which <Col N="1900" /> the measures would resolve.  Anyone who read their contributions carefully would not assume that there was such a significant need for progress at this stage that we could avoid waiting until the commission's report, which is in train, is produced.  They did not produce any evidence that concerted practices exist to the point where they impede in any way the emergence of the dynamic economy. If there was something in Deputy Cullen's contribution last night which I missed I apologise.  However, reading the contribution I do not feel that this imperative need, to act now and to hell with the consequences, is evidence of that sense of urgency.  I am not saying that we do not need to move in that direction but we do not need to move precipitously because medicine prescribed for non-existent illness &mdash; particularly strong medicine &mdash; can be dangerous and could be fatal.</P>
    <P>I was surprised at Deputy Bruton's willingness last night to go along with this. It struck me as opportunistic because it is not long since Deputy Bruton held the portfolio for Industry and Commerce and if all these anti-competitive practices, these dreadful dangers, exist now they did not start yesterday nor the day before, they existed while he was there and there must be a question mark over why he did not act then.  I do not believe that the case was made tonight or last night for precipitate action in this direction.  I am not saying that we do not need to move in the direction outlined in the Bill and that we will not move in that direction. It is my belief that we will move in that direction.  When the prohibition system proposed in this Bill was suggested in 1987 it was not picked up.  The main reason was that it was felt by the Department of Industry and Commerce and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that a prohibition system would require a very extensive bureaucracy.  That concept was pooh-poohed here tonight by the very man who felt it was the case in 1977.  If that was the case in 1977 when law and business were far less complex than in 1989 I wonder why he pooh-poohed that line of argument tonight.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1901" /> The introduction of this type of prohibition system would be costly and we should not avoid the fact.  One of the major weaknesses in Deputy Cullen's contribution and in the Bill is that that fact has been overlooked.  The fact that an extensive bureaucracy will be needed is avoided.  The fact that there will be costs to be met by the enforcement of these measures is also avoided and that is a weakness.  I am sympathetic to the argument that in Opposition one does not have available all the panoply of draftsmen and so on, which means that errors inevitably occur.  I do not condemn this Bill simply on the basis that it includes very significant drafting errors which were admitted by Deputy O'Malley and I do not want to labour the point. A very significant fact is that the Bill does not look at the costs of implementing the measures it proposed and that is why I was so surprised at Deputy O'Malley's contribution tonight and Deputy Bruton's contribution last night.  There would &mdash; and I will advert to these later &mdash; be major costs to be carried by industry and by the individuals who constitute and contribute to a dynamic economy.  As the Bill draws so heavily on Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty it is worth while to examine them and their impact.</P>
    <P>Article 85 renders null and void all agreements in restraint of trade.  I am sure we all concur with the rendering of agreements which restrain trade as being null and void.  We would also accept that there will be a need for exceptions as contained in Article 85.  Article 86 prohibits all abuses by dominant firms of their dominant positions.  There are no provisions for exceptions or exemptions from this Article.  The system of control and regulation introduced in these Articles is a prohibitive one.  The aim is to say to firms and individuals: &ldquo;You go thus far and you go no further.&rdquo; In theory this has much to commend it.  Deputy O'Malley said tonight that it makes it clear to individuals how far they can go. He rejected Deputy O'Donoghue's view that there would and could be confusion. Deputy O'Malley and the members of his party know that that is an untrue <Col N="1902" /> assertion.  We all know that the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 in the member states has given rise to not just a huge bureaucracy within the Commission to implement and police those Articles but also a whole new service industry such as lawyers who specialise in European Community law, who interpret Articles 85 and 86, and who see their way around those Articles, and spend a good deal of time, at great expense, advising clients on whether they are in line with Articles 85 and 86.  If one reads Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome, particularly Article 85, and the report produced in May of last year for the Department of Trade and Industry, Review of Restrictive Trade Practices and Policy, and paragraph 4.13 which was highlighted by Deputy O'Donoghue, it seems to be very clear what is prohibited and what is meant by a concerted practice. No doubt at some stage we will move down that line.  It is disingenuous in the extreme to suggest that simply putting this on the Statute Book ends the problem. It does not, it creates many additional problems.</P>
    <P>As I said, in theory the system proposed in Articles 85 and 86 has a great deal to commend it.  However, in practice, there may be many drawbacks. Deputy Cullen, who I have no doubt is sincere when he proposes these measures should address them.  By establishing global prohibitions certain inflexibilities inevitably creep into the prohibition system.  If one tries to introduce a prescriptive remedy as suggested in Article 85 or in paragraph 4.13 of the report, or as arises in the law of other member states, inevitably one will create inflexibilities.</P>
    <P>The first point that should be made about these inflexibilities is that on all occasions that companies come together are not necessarily detrimental.  Certain agreements may be positive and may contribute to the development of a dynamic economy.  Article 85 and the Commission recognise that this may be the case and a body of exemptions has been introduced. When a body of exemptions is introduced the crystal clarity of global prohibitions <Col N="1903" /> goes out the window.  Deputy O'Malley suggested here tonight that one could pooh-pooh the arguments put forward by Deputy O'Donoghue that there is less than crystal clarity, and that there are difficulties for firms in this course of action, it becomes obvious because if the clarity that he argues exists goes out the door, then confusion arises.  When the exemptions are introduced the prohibitions are no longer global and when this happens, clarity goes, and whether a practice is acceptable or unacceptable becomes a matter for debate.  If this becomes a matter for debate delays can occur, with the result that economic dynamism to which this is supposed to contribute, can be impeded.</P>
    <P>Something else will happen when exemptions are granted &mdash; doubt enters the picture.  When this happens firms become cautious and this inevitably creates a need for further bureaucracy.  This has been the experience in Europe with Article 85.  There is a layer of bureaucracy in the Commission not just to police Article 85 but to advise and consult with firms and say whether practices are acceptable or unacceptable.  We now have the extraordinary system, referred to here last night as letters of comfort, which have no effect but which are frequently given by the Commission to firms to encourage them to move.</P>
    <P>Because of the sheer volume of applications for exemptions and the sheer volume of applications for advice to the Commission, proposals which should go forward and which would be beneficial are frequently delayed.  The Commission has had to seek ways around these problems by introducing block exemptions.  In spite of these, the EC experience with the Treaty provisions has not been an entirely happy one.  There have been many complaints about delays in the Commission's handling of applications which businessmen said have impeded progress.  It strikes me as wrong that the proposers of this Bill should seek to ignore these facts.  It also strikes me as wrong that Deputy O'Malley should seek to portray everybody who wishes to draw <Col N="1904" /> attention to these facts as being some form of latter day Luddite who is opposed to progress.  Prudence, provided it is balanced, is never ill advised, and this is certainly a case where the prudence suggested by the Minister is advisable.</P>
    <P>The undoubted costliness of proposals in the Bill and their potential to impede rather than assist economic progress are only two of the problems with the Bill. There are others.  I do not think the proposers of this Bill can ignore, and I do not think Deputy O'Malley would have sought to ignore tonight, the possible unconstitutionality of the proposed powers of the expected office of the director of consumer affairs.  Deputy O'Donoghue drew attention to this earlier, that there was a good deal of concern among the ranks of the Progressive Democrats and the diminishing ranks of Fine Gael with the constitutionality of allowing the Attorney General to review evidence.  It strikes me as incongruous, to say at least, that these arguments of concern about the constitutionality of a relatively modest set of proposals could be put forward in this House and propagated in this land while at the same time ignoring the very real constitutional problems with regard to the office of the director of consumer affairs proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I said, there are significant drafting errors which cause serious concern. Deputy O'Malley admitted two errors in drafting.  These are not only minor as he suggested, but rather they shake confidence in the edifice.  Section 9 (1) would abolish the powers of the Minister to make restrictive practice orders.  No reason has been given for this.  Section 8 contains another serious drafting error &mdash; this was adverted to by the Minister and I will not deal with it again.  The Bill's failure to make any reference to the role of the Fair Trade Commission goes unexplained. Perhaps when replying, Deputy Cullen will deal with this matter because I am mystified as to why the Fair Trade Commission should have been ignored altogether.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the present system requires review.  This cannot be denied. The control of abuse system is slow and <Col N="1905" /> cumbersome, and that needs to be pointed out.  There is no point in trying to hype one against the other.  The present system has problems.  It is valid to suggest that we must consider incorporating Articles 85 and 86 into domestic law, and for this reason I have welcomed the Bill.  The investigation by the Fair Trade Commission into the possibility of incorporating Articles 85 and 86 into domestic law is well in hand.  I cannot understand why the Progressive Democrats and their leader should get so het up about this matter.  If the Fair Trade Commission are examining the measures proposed in this Bill, where is the need for urgency and why is there a need for us to jump in the dark at this stage?</P>
    <P>The commission invited submissions from interested parties and representative bodies in connection with the study in March last.  It does not strike me that there has been an inordinate delay. If I believed that the FTC, who have been given additional powers, were dragging their heels, then the speed of action being proposed here would have something to recommend it.  I do not believe that is the case.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> When I moved the adjournment I had commenced quoting from an appendix to the Lafferty report <i>International Private Banking: Ireland's Best Bet</i> on the financial services proposals and the opportunities which Ireland has in this sphere of activity.  I was referring to Appendix 1 which has a table which compares the advantages and disadvantages of Switzerland, Luxembourg, the Channel Islands and Ireland as locations for financial services.  It begins with general concepts: that Ireland is a sovereign state; that is an advantage; that we are not involved in a military alliance, we are <Col N="1906" /> neutral; that is an advantage; that we are a member of the EC; that is an advantage. It goes on to say that our politics are not based on class or race; that is an advantage.  We have an independent tax regime, and that is considered to be an advantage.</P>
      <P>We come to the first disadvantage.  It is considered that our local tax policy favours high tax rates and high tax takes, whereas in Switzerland they are described as average, in Luxembourg average and in the Channel Islands low. The next disadvantage is banking confidentiality. We have no legislation which ensures banking confidentiality. Switzerland, Luxembourg and the Channel Island have it.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Financial services in the Community&rdquo; is the next heading and under the category &ldquo;economic importance&rdquo; it is major in Switzerland, vital in Luxembourg and the Channel Islands and of minor importance in Ireland.  Local market integration is complete in the other three competitors and non-existent in Ireland.  There is a bi-partisan approach in the other three locations and this concept is unknown in Ireland.  The services are official state policy in Switzerland, Luxembourg and the Channel Islands and not official State policy in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Telecommunications are considered to be average in Ireland in this report while they are excellent in Switzerland and good in Luxembourg and the Channel Islands.  Staff availability is considered to be excellent in Ireland, poor in the Channel Islands and good in the other two locations.  Our office capacity is good.  Official attitudes are supportive in Switzerland, keen in Luxembourg and the Channel Islands and unknown in Ireland.  Legal-accountancy services and computer support services are good in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resident tax levels in Ireland are high. Non-resident tax levels are 10 per cent here, whereas they are nominal in the other three locations.  The legal base is acceptable here.  English trust law probably applies, according to this report.  EC investor law is unknown, whether it applies or not.  Physical communications <Col N="1907" /> are considered to be easy here while they are difficult in the Channel Islands and Luxembourg.  The capacity of the existing market is nonexistent here while it is large in Luxembourg and the Channel Islands and enormous in Switzerland. There is expatriate staff availability. Housing here for staff is unknown according to this table.  Bank establishment costs are unknown and banking image nonexistent.  We are talking about banking image for financial services.</P>
    <P>Direct air travel is good.  Hotel rooms, number and quality, are good.  Entertainment opportunities are good.  Education facilities are good.  Shopping facilities are good.  Cultural background and general quality of life are good.</P>
    <P>Overall Switzerland comes out at the top of the league table, Ireland next and the Channel Islands and Luxembourg are behind Ireland in terms of opportunities for financial services.  I quote the report, page 2:</P>
    <P>This paper argues that:</P>
    <P>The necessary legal, physical and psychological infrastructure for the establishment within the Republic of Ireland of a financial services industry already exists in principle,</P>
    <P>It refers then to a tabular statement comparison.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a processing centre for an insurance company at Castleisland is a practical example of the unexploited potential.</P>
    <P>The clearly defined State policy of the Republic of Ireland towards the financial services industry is lacking. This is most clearly seen in the decisions of both Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks to search for growth outside Ireland.</P>
    <P>Without a statement of intent about the role of the international financial services business within the Republic, it will be difficult for the State to attract sufficient number of Banks or other financial service companies to create the `critical mass' necessary for `take-off' as an international banking centre.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1908" /> The four centres mentioned earlier each exploited a particular `window of opportunity' to kick-start their international banking business into above average growth.  Such a `single window' has opened again, and could be exploited by the State given the necessary precondition of a development policy agreed by financial and banking authorities, some minor legislative clarification, and the passing into law of a banking confidentiality act.</P>
    <P>The Dublin financial centre is a valuable, though not sufficient, precondition to the establishment of a large, economically significant, and profitable financial service industry within the State.  Other centres succeeded because they recognised a market need, and allowed this to be exploited by the domestic financial industry jointly with international banking and financial companies attracted by the opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Committee has the opportunity to propose the preconditions described above and ensure that recent competitive developments within what is now the global banking industry are grasped by the State and its financial and banking functions.</P>
    <P>According to the introduction, the report was requested by the chairman of the Financial Services Committee who, of course, is the Minister.  The report argues that the opportunity exists for a significant financial services industry in this country but that will not happen because, first, the Government have not got a clear policy.  Secondly, one of the preconditions is a banking confidentiality Act and, thirdly, we are after the wrong end of the market on the bulk side and we are not going to where the window of opportunity is, the handling of personal accounts.  The Minister has proceeded in the Central Bank Bill in a piecemeal fashion.  Now the Central Bank is being put in place to control industries in the Financial Services Centre.  Of course that is acceptable, but we have no overall statement of policy or attitude.  We have no overall general approach and the <Col N="1909" /> financial services industry in Europe and the US is not very clear as to what our intent is.</P>
    <P>Against that background I take exception to the kind of guff we get from the Minister where those of us in the House who raise these issues as matters of serious debate are given lectures about some Deputies for their own reasons being dismissive of our strength in this field.  We need a serious discussion on the future of the financial services industry. It is extremely difficult to get information from the Minister's Department either by way of question or request.</P>
    <P>We are still not sure whether the Minister intends to proceed with the proposal that some activities down there would be zero rated for tax purposes.  Recently on the Order of Business I asked if this would be proceeded with in the Finance Bill and there was confusion in the benches opposite.  The Minister for Finance seemed to be passing the ball to the Minister for Industry and Commerce who was reluctant to catch it.  What is the position now?  Is that going to go ahead?  If so when, and will it be in the Finance Bill?  If it is going ahead does the announcement of the Commission that they are proceeding to propose a common withholding tax for all financial institutions for money on deposit run counter to the idea of a zero rate on the profits of unit trusts being administered in the Financial Services Centre?</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell too long on it. Here we have a regulatory proposition with which I agree not only in connection with the new firms in the Financial Services Centre but also in regard to future trading in the areas of money broker as the Minister suggests.  I maintain the right to continue to demand a serious policy statement from the Minister for Finance on financial services here and I will continue to demand the introduction of a Bill dealing with banking confidentiality. That is one of the real flaws we have at the moment when we are not attracting industry here to the degree that we might.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough every time we criticise to wheel out the State agencies to ensure that the square footage of <Col N="1910" /> coverage in the newspapers got by the agencies praising the International Financial Services Centre obliterates any criticism which might be in the same editions of the newspapers.  There is a paucity of information and to talk about the number of licences issued does not answer that.  I accept that new licences are being issued every month but I also know that new licences are being issued in respect of the Shannon duty free zone, and have been for a number of years.  However, there is little or no relationship between the number of start-ups and the number of licences issued.  The latest figure for licences from the Minister's Department is somewhere in the high fifties or low sixties.  I challenge the Minister to name one company that has got a licence and has set up, and is employing more than five extra people.</P>
    <P>The test of the financial services proposal in the Custom House Docks site is whether extra incremental business is added or whether extra jobs will be created. The relocation of jobs from various parts of the city to the Custom House Docks site is not job creation.  I had not intended to dwell on that project for so long but I was provoked into doing so by the Minister's remark.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to an omission from the Bill to which the Minister should give some attention.  If we take the Bill and other significant Bills in allied areas, particularly the Building Societies Bill, as one corpus of legislation the idea of competition and the benefits of competition are coming through.  We are allowing building societies, and other institutions, to get involved in banking activities and the presupposition is that the more people involved the better the service will be ultimately for the customer. That is the principle on which we are proceeding.  It is time that the Minister had a look at the way in which the matrix of interest rates is drawn up by the Central Bank.  If institutions can compete with each other, and the building societies after the passing of the Bill will be able to compete with the banks, then the banks and the building societies should be able to compete where they can on interest rates.  As I understand the <Col N="1911" /> system, the reference rate is issued by the Central Bank each Friday.  There is a fairly complex mechanism for drawing up the reference rate but we need not go into that.  The maximum differential allowed between the reference and the prime rate is one half of 1 per cent.  That is the trigger mechanism and it establishes the prime rate, which, in effect, becomes our &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; rate.  The difference between that and the &ldquo;A&rdquo; rate for personal borrowing can be significant but there is an interest rate matrix applied which makes it very difficult for the bank to vary downward interest rates, for example to personal borrowers.  I should like to ask the Minister to have a look at that.</P>
    <P>I am aware that prior to 1985 each and every interest rate increase, or decrease, had to be negotiated and agreed with the Central Bank.  That was not a good idea because there would have been times in term of office of all administrations where there was political pressure to time the announcement of a decrease or increase to suit the Government of the day.  There were deferrals of increases and, indeed, there were deferrals of decreases or decreases brought forward.  The introduction of the reference rate and the interest rate matrix was a major improvement on that system.</P>
    <P>The arrangements introduced in 1985, and arising in the first instance from the 1971 Act, were to protect the borrower, so that the borrower would not be exploited.  The borrower needed to be protected when the number of outlets was limited and there were no opportunities to shop around.  If there were not price controls over interest rates a borrower in a weak position could be exploited, but if in future we are moving towards competition between the institutions it is time to look again at the way interest rates are fixed and the particular matrix of interest rates put on top of the reference rate.  I suggest to the Minister that he have a look at the system that operates in the UK.  There, the base rate is established and if a bank feels like it, they can lend at one half of one per cent above the base rate if they think the risk <Col N="1912" /> is good enough.  I realise that this is a complex area but the arguments put forward by the House on the Building Societies Bill and, by extension, the Central Bank Bill, are that we are introducing a new regime where financial institutions compete for business and that the ordinary citizen can shop around but that will not be possible if there is a strong element of price fixing in interest rates.  I accept that reference rates move up and down but the whole block moves up and down on the matrix.  The Minister should see if a more flexible system can be introduced when it comes to the pricing of money so as to allow the benefits of competition to flow to the borrower.</P>
    <P>A number of miscellaneous proposals are contained at the end of the Bill and I have no particular objection to them.  If the Minister wants to change the coinage that is fine with me.  I have no objection to a £1 coin; I have no particular love for it either but I will not be objecting to its introduction.  The Minister drew attention to section 127 which empowers him to direct the closure of banks and other financial institutions or exchanges where the protection of the currency or the national interest so requires.  He is introducing, in a new and more extended form, certain provisions which deal with bank holidays and that is acceptable.  The general position of Fine Gael in regard to the Bill is that it is well worth while. Certain parts of it have been in gestation for between 25 and 30 years and now is an opportune time to bring them through. I appreciate the fact that the Government have decided to bring this Bill through in tandem with the Building Societies Bill because there is a cross-fertilisation.  It is important that we should be able to see the two pieces of legislation side by side. We have no objection to the principle of the Bill or the principle of the different sections.  However, we will be considering our position between now and Committee Stage and whether we will be tabling a long series of amendments or a few will depend to a great extent on the Minister's reply to the points I have raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is one of a number of Bills which have formed, by way of series, a constitution for our Central Bank.  It is significant in some respects and insignificant in others.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats accept that there is need for a major reform to repair and augment the powers and functions of the Central Bank.  We make one preliminary objection to this Bill, that is that it seems to lack a comprehensive character.  Ireland is now entering into a single European market for capital and it is noteworthy that this Bill does not put Ireland in a position to operate as a jurisdiction in which financial services are controlled by comprehensive legislative measures.  In Britain there is a comprehensive financial services code which covers everything from the point of view of investment advisers, assurance, investment companies and the like.  Here we are doing a stitching and darning job and we are giving all these extra powers to the Central Bank to deal with a restricted number of areas of expansion in the financial services market.  One power relates to the international Financial Services Centre on the docks.  Another relates to the futures and options exchange which is about to be opened in Dublin.  Another power relates to the question of control of the moneybroking business in Dublin in so far as that requires control.  These are three small elements in a large financial market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I am concerned the difficulty that this Bill poses for anybody interested in legislation is that it shows we are playing with fire.  This House has the advantage of seeing how legislation has been introduced in the UK to bring order and accountability into the financial service sector but there is no indication of any urgency on the part of the Government to deal with the same issues in an Irish context.  What protection has an Irish investor against the occurrence in Ireland of an incident equivalent to the Barlow Clowes incident in the UK financial context? What protection has the average Irish investor in respect of representations made in advertisements and the advice given by financial advisers in <Col N="1914" /> respect of deployment and investment capital?  We have virtually no legislation and a free for all.  Although this Bill seeks to bring some coherent control to the banking sector, to moneybrokers, to the financial futures and options exchanges, there is a gaping hole in financial protection for the consumer, the investor. This measure does nothing to close that loophole.  A piecemeal approach to the supervisory functions of the Central Bank will lead to a major investment scandal here from which many ordinary people both Irish and foreign will suffer substantial losses.  Then the question as to why there was not in place financial services legislation will be asked.  We will then want to know why there was not comprehensive legislation giving a controlling and supervisory role to a capable and competent authority to ensure that there was not an abuse of the kind which has caused so much loss to so many innocent people in a much more legislatively alert and controlled environment such as Britain.</P>
    <P>This measure is inadequate.  It is a partial solution to an obvious and growing financial danger in an integrated economic capital market.  It appears that comprehensive legislation in the financial services sector will only come about in the wake of a major and costly financial collapse.  The Minister should say what are his long term views in relation to total protection for the investor by way of financial services protective legislation for the consumer in the Irish context.  I do not want to hear about the little bits and pieces of the jigsaw that are filled in by this legislation.  I want to know what is there to protect the investor from abuse, from misleading advertisements and from the participation in the market of people whose record or propensities are so obviously unattractive as to demand protection for the innocent investor. About a year-and-a-half ago, for example, I read in <i>The Economist</i> magazine about a firm in Dublin offering extra-ordinarily attractive interest rates to investors in the UK.  I remember at the time thinking that I had never heard of this body nor had I seen any mention of <Col N="1915" /> it in any economic journal in Ireland.  I remember wondering why it was that such a body could come into existence and advertise from an Irish base to an English market and yet never have come to the attention of somebody who was showing active interest in the Irish financial market as I was then.  Time went by. I made inquiries in the Dublin money market as to whether they had ever heard of such an organisation and they had not. Three or four months later news came through that this organisation had gone to ground and had collapsed.  There was no legislative framework in Ireland to stop it, to inquire into it and to find out what it was about.  In the absence of comprehensive financial services legislation which investigates competence and the capacity of individuals to handle money and their probity as far as honesty and capacity are concerned, Ireland is, in economic and capital terms, an open season for the worst elements in the European capital market to come here and advertise seeking investment funds from abroad.  There is nothing in this legislation to seal that hole or to offer any protection to Irish or foreign investors from the use of Ireland as a haven for people of that kind.  Anybody who sees an advertisement in a newspaper offering any particular rate of return on investments is entitled to assume that there is some regulatory agency taking an active interest in that kind of advertising and which will offer protection against abuse.  There is no such jurisdiction, no such agency in Ireland.  There is nobody seeking out such companies so as to protect people from abuse.  There is protection in relation to the taking of deposits but in relation to advisory services and to channelling investment funds, which is an extension of the same business, there is no protection for the investor.  This gap in our law is an unacceptable loophole which benefits those who are willing to exploit it and there are plenty who will do that.</P>
    <P>On several occasions, most recently on 31 January this year, I raised in the Dáil <Col N="1916" /> the refusal of the Minister and his predecessor to answer questions relative to the operations of the Central Bank.  On every occasion I have either had a blank refusal or an anodyne and totally bland response to the effect that the Central Bank is an independent financial institution for which the Minister is not accountable to this body and in respect of which he will not give any detailed replies.  That is entirely unacceptable and I have said so as volubly as I can without causing disruption in this House.  I fully accept the requirement for independence for the Central Bank.  I fully accept that the Central Bank should, as the Minister suggested, be afforded a large degree of autonomy.  However &mdash; and this is a point I want to reiterate as I made it on 31 January in hurried circumstances &mdash; independence and autonomy do not exclude responsibility and a measure of accountability.</P>
    <P>Because Dáil Éireann has no worthwhile budgetary, fiscal or financial committee &mdash; which it ought to have &mdash; there is no basis for this House, which is given the role of budgetary and fiscal control watchdog, to come to grips with the policies pursued by the Central Bank or to form any real judgments about the policy options open to that bank and the implications of the choices that the board of that bank make.  On the last occasion the Minister pointed out to me that, in the context of this debate, I would have an opportunity to raise many of the issues I raised in the question to him.  If every ten years a Member of this House is entitled to raise in this House what policies the Central Bank are pursuing or to question the circumstances in which they carry out their various duties, or to raise the procedures whereby they are given what I believe amount to immunity from scrutiny by this Chamber, all I can say is that that is inadequate scrutiny and does not amount to an ample vindication of the people's right to know what public institutions are doing on their behalf.  Were there a committee of this House which met regularly with the members of the board of the Central Bank, and kept up <Col N="1917" /> to date with the thinking of the Central Bank on policy issues, the policies they are following and the plans the Central Bank were making to discharge their duties, there would be an effective channel of communication without, in any sense, compromising the independence of the bank or the integrity of their decision-making powers.</P>
    <P>I have had the opportunity over the last few days to look at the book by Moynihan on the history of the Central Bank, the book by Dr. Ronan Fanning on the history of the Department of Finance and a few other texts on the control of banking in Ireland and the history of the evolution of the Central Bank, as an institution, based on the Currency Commission established in 1927.  Having looked at them as far as I can see there has never been &mdash; despite complex debates on occasion as to the possible role and the possible benefits of having a central bank &mdash; an adequate debate in this House on the accountability of the Central Bank for the discharging of its functions.  I believe it is possible to have an independent institution which is entitled to look at the Oireachtas and the Government of the day, eye to eye, level pupil to level pupil, and say: we are independent; we have our own view; we will not bow the knee to you.  I believe it is possible to have such a relationship based on some communication of information of an adequate nature between the two bodies, some capacity, especially on the part of this institution, to question what goes on there.  It is entirely wrong that Members of this House should be left in the position, as they are very frequently, that whenever they tender any questions to any Minister arising out of the circumstances in which the Central Bank is run, they are told that this is not a matter for the Minister for Finance who, by the way, appoints and will, under this legislation, appoint the entirety of the membership of the board of the Central Bank. We are told that it is not a matter for him to account to this House for its policies. All right, I accept that it may not be his particular duty but, if it is not his duty to account for the policies of that bank, it is <Col N="1918" /> the bank's duty to account for its own stewardship.  If this House cannot, by its laws and procedures, require an account of stewardship of an adequate kind, then there is a deficiency in our level of control.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that the annual reports and accounts that the Central Bank furnish are an adequate response to any interest on the part of any Member of this House as to how the Central Bank is run.  Frankly, that is a bogus argument. Anyone who takes a look at the Central Bank's reports will immediately recognise that they give an anodyne and completely transparent account of what has happened in the Central Bank during the year.  All crises are brushed under the carpet, all thorny issues are ignored. Effectively what is told to this House is that there is nothing but good news in the accounts of the Central Bank.  Those reports amount to an unilateral statement on the part of the bank which leaves Members of this House entirely in the dark on many sectoral issues affecting the bank.  For instance, the annual accounts of the bank furnish this House with two figures in terms of expenditure.  They tell us what is the total amount of expenditure which is divided into two categories, wage and remuneration, and total other expenditures.</P>
    <P>No Member of this House is entitled to know, apart from that, how the moneys of the Central Bank have been expended during the year and to what extent there is good value for money in respect of those expenditures.  It is simply entirely wrong that a major financial institution should be entitled to say that it has specified its own expenditure at a certain level, it has categorised it into two areas, wage and non-wage expenditure, and say to this House: that is the entirety of the information you will have as to the way in which we have expended our moneys during the year and the value the public will receive for that expenditure. That form of accounting is virtually useless.</P>
    <P>It is a sad fact that the form of accounts which the Central Bank are obliged by <Col N="1919" /> statute to render to this House is prescribed by regulations of this House and that those regulations do not actually require the Central Bank to set out, in intelligible and reasonable form, a breakdown of their expenditures with a view to establishing, in the public mind, that that bank are getting good value for money.</P>
    <P>Another example is that it was the habit of the Central Bank until, I think, about three of four years ago, to say in their annual reports how their staff were deployed.  Now we are given only the aggregate number of staff employed which hovers around the 750 mark.  The fact is that, up to about five years ago at any rate, it was the habit of the Central Bank to tell this House where they were deploying their staff for example, how many people were involved in the currency production unit in Sandyford; how many were involved in exchange control; how many were involved in the supervision of banking and how many were involved in other specific areas.  That breakdown has ceased to be given.  Why has it stopped?  It was stopped because it was not statutorily prescribed for the Central Bank to tell us this information, because it became uncomfortable for the bank to continue to reveal that information to us.</P>
    <P>I have here the latest three annual reports of the Central Bank.  Anyone reading those will note that there are somewhere between 720 and 760 employees but what they are doing is entirely obscure from that report, even though five years ago at least the Central Bank did this House the courtesy of telling us how many of their complement of staff were engaged in various tasks ascribed to the particular functions this House has set for the bank.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of importance that we should know whether the bank is over-staffing or under-staffing in specific areas. For instance, if we insist on maintaining exchange control &mdash; which is now slowly ebbing away &mdash; it is a matter of importance that we know how many people are supposed to be charged with the duty of <Col N="1920" /> carrying out the delegated powers of the Minister for Finance to the Central Bank in respect of exchange control.  It is worth while noting that this House has not been told for three, four or five years how many people are carrying out that function at present and, in view of recent developments in relation to Central Bank policy and Government exchange control regulations, how many people will be released from that area to work in others, such as supervision of the building societies, supervision of the International Financial Services Centre in the Custom House Docks area, and control of the moneybroking business and the futures and options exchanges.  We simply do not know.</P>
    <P>We have delegated all these functions, at arms length, to an institution.  We are not even in a position to ask to what extent and in what way that institution is complying with the duty we have laid on them.  That is completely wrong.  For some unknown reason that information has been excised from recent reports so that no one on the outside is aware of the way in which the bank's staff are deployed among the various duties required to be performed by the bank.  As a result, no one can form any judgment as to the efficiency and performance of each aspect of the bank's duties.  We must be satisfied with a global, utterly uninformative, assurance from the board of the bank that all is well every year.  I am not prepared to accept that and I do not think I would be correct in doing so.</P>
    <P>With the scaling down of exchange control one might well ask how the resource of the bank should be redeployed to take account of their new duties, especially <i>vis-á-vis</i> the building societies, companies in the International Financial Services Centre, moneybrokers and the control and supervision of futures and options exchanges.  One might ask these questions but the simple fact is that, as long as ministerial policy continues as it is now, no answer is forthcoming either in the bank reports or from the Minister who, though he appoints the entire board, refuses to answer to this House for any <Col N="1921" /> of their detailed policy decisions or for their performance.</P>
    <P>A recent example which caused me some considerable disquiet is the operation of the bank's currency centre in Sandyford.  The bank has a large facility there with industrial relations problems relating to the redeployment of new technology. I am left with no answer when I ask the Minister's predecessor about the costs of currency production at Sandyford. Is that facility necessary?  Is it necessary that Ireland should produce its own coins and notes?  What is the vital national interest that that be carried on in this country?  Or is that facility carrying our work for any foreign countries?  Is it possible that if we have a secure institution of that kind, and it is necessary for our own interests to have it here in this country, that it could carry out for international bodies, foreign countries and the like, the same functions in relation to security printing?  Are we getting value for money?  Who knows?  Who in this House knows what the industrial relations problems which have come to the fore recently in the newspapers in relation to new technology actually mask?  Is this the tip of an iceberg?  Are we actually running a mint in circumstances where the same could have been done, as it was at one stage by Thomas De La Rue and Company, for much smaller outlay in terms of capital on the basis that their facilities were available to a number of individual countries and not simply to Ireland?  Could that institution be earning us valuable foreign export orders?</P>
    <P>All these are questions which arise but what is known is that upwards of 100 staff &mdash; when we last found out how many people were up there it was somewhere between 100 and 150 people &mdash; are engaged in the production of currency in Sandyford and its checking and so on, and we do not know to this day whether they are necessary, how much they cost us as an economy, whether this work could be done more efficiently by others and whether they could be working for foreign banks which do not have their own currency production units.  We simply do <Col N="1922" /> not know any of these things because the Minister and his predecessor have refused to answer any detailed questions on the activities of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate that there may be good reasons security matters should not be discussed in this House but I do want to know why it is necessary that this country should engage in what is, on the face of it, a difficult area of technology, fraught with industrial relations problems, and does so without any indication as to whether it is necessary or good value for money so far as our taxpayers are concerned.  So far as this House is concerned the Members simply do not know and, what is more, nobody will tell them the answers to these questions.</P>
    <P>The upshot of all this lack of accountability and obscurity in relation to the activities of the bank is that it is not merely given autonomy and independence but immunity from examination. On 31 January the Minister, somewhat disingenuously I have to suggest to him, suggested that because the accounts of the Central Bank are examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General nobody should suggest that there is anything amiss.  Of course he is right in the sense that there is an audit in process which is supposed to uncover any misappropriation of funds but let us stitch this into the record with the greatest of respect to the Minister: his answer shows just how little real accountability and responsibility there is.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has many functions but he has no function in reporting to this House as to whether he believes that the staff costs in the Central Bank are excessive or that the staff is badly deployed, and still less has he any function in determining whether the bank's reserves are adequate, inadequate or more than adequate to carry out its duties.  If, as I suspect, the bank's reserves are greatly in excess of the actual need for such reserves, there is a strong argument to be made for the liquidating of some of those reserves and their restoration to the Exchequer for the purpose of reducing national indebtedness and <Col N="1923" /> consequently reducing interest liability on the part of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Nobody explains to this House the policies by which the level of Central Bank reserves is determined.  There is an independent board who at the end of any given year, having decided on what the bank's operating costs are, including staff and non staff items, and having decided what amount it wants to put into its reserves, decide by a process of elimination, what is its surplus that is available to the Exchequer.  We rely on their good faith, and perhaps rightly so in some respect, that that is the best value the Exchequer can receive from the Central Bank but I doubt it.  In any institution which has as long a history as that, unless there is strong parliamentary pressure to indicate performance ratios, to indicate targets, to indicate a justification for every reserve that is built up and the level of such reserves, there is bound to be a laxity to the disfavour and to the detriment of the ordinary taxpayer as proprietors of the Exchequer of this country.</P>
    <P>Again, there is no basis on which the amount of the reserve is explained or the policy decisions which underlie the maintenance of reserves are examined with a view to determining whether they are correct or incorrect.  Nobody knows why the levels of reserves are fixed as they are and nobody who cares to look at any of the reports and accounts which are furnished to the Members of this House can divine precisely what process of intellectual rationalisation has led to the particular level of reserves which have been fixed for the year in question.</P>
    <P>All of this is of significance to the taxpayer because the amount of money which the bank each year gives back to the Exchequer by way of Central Bank surplus varies directly in accordance with certain decisions made by the board of the bank in relation first to the expenditure of the bank on its staff, second to the expenditure of the bank on other matters, and third on the provision for reserves.  Every Central Bank decision affects the taxpayer directly and whereas no one is suggesting that the Central <Col N="1924" /> Bank should become the pawn of Government or the Department of Finance, or be directly controlled by the Government of the day in respect of the funds at its disposal, there is a halfway house which is not only reasonable but, I would argue, essential.  That is, the position of accountability and consultation among equals, not domination by one body of the State over the other but a relationship of equals and understanding. That is a principle which is entirely lacking in the practice and legislation which governs the activities of the Central Bank at this time.</P>
    <P>I notice, looking back over the records of the Central Bank's history, that the Labour Party have on occasion demanded Government control over the bank in terms of policy.  That is a view with which I disagree.  I must say also that I think the present situation of immunity, which is not independence, autonomy, responsibility or accountability, but is simply immunity from challenge, is indefensible and wrong in principle and probably is working to the detriment of the Irish taxpayer and the economy in general.</P>
    <P>All of that feature of the Central Bank would be bad enough were it not that the Government now plans to worsen considerably the situation because it is noteworthy that section 1 of the Central Bank Act, 1942 required the Governor, every director and every officer of the bank to take an oath before a peace commissioner before taking office or on doing so, swearing not to disclose any information relative to the business or records or books of any bank which might come into their possession in their capacity as a Governor, director or officer, as the case might be, save in circumstances where such disclosure was authorised by Statute.  That is a very simple thing.  Here is a regulatory agency which had an investigative function.  It had the right to ask any bank to disclose to them their records, to require of any bank a considerable degree of information and the State, as a compensatory safeguard for those individual banks, required each and every person who came into possession <Col N="1925" /> of that information to take an oath of secrecy in relation to it on the basis that the Central Bank was a regulatory agency and that such information was only available to it by virtue of its regulatory function. Unfortunately, this Bill has a dramatically different approach to the same issue.  The new Bill proposed to fundamentally alter the manner in which the Central Bank operates as regards disclosure.</P>
    <P>The 1942 Act applied only to information relating to other banks.  Section 15 (1) of this Bill creates a prohibition of a very wide-reaching and deep kind on the disclosure of any information relative to the business of the bank which comes to the knowledge of not only the directors, the governor or the officers but also the servants or agents of the bank in relation to any matter concerning the business of the bank.  A criminal offence is now being created for disclosure of such information to any third party.  I ask why this is needed.  Why is there suddenly a requirement that any information, no matter how trivial, which comes into the knowledge of any servant, officer, director or governor of the Central Bank, may not be disclosed except in the circumstances set out in section 15 (2) of the proposed Bill?</P>
    <P>Section 15 (2) does not allow, for instance, a governor, a director or an officer of the Central Bank to come to any Member of this House and disclose information relating to the business of the Central Bank which might reveal, for instance, gross inefficiencies, errors of judgment or the like.  None of the circumstances set out in section 15 (2) permits a person in the Central Bank who is privy to information which could greatly affect the future running of the bank to come to a person such as a Member of this House with that information with a view to improving the way the bank is run.  The exceptional circumstances surrounding the absolute ban on disclosure of any information are set out in section 15 (1).</P>
    <P>The ban on the disclosure of information set out in section 15(2) relates to information comprising the disclosure <Col N="1926" />&ldquo;required by the Court&rdquo;; &ldquo;with the consent&rdquo; of the person to whom the information relates&rdquo;&mdash; which probably would not affect a major blunder in the Central Bank; &ldquo;where the bank is acting... in the capacity of an agent for a person, made to the person in respect of that capacity&rdquo;&mdash; that is irrelevant too; &ldquo;where the bank considers it necessary for the common good&rdquo;&mdash; that is a laugh, because if the bank has made a colossal blunder and the majority of the board are responsible for that blunder, we will not hear about it because they will not consider it necessary for the common good and it has to be the bank rather than the individual person in question which is at stake; where the disclosure is &ldquo;made to an authority in a foreign jurisdiction duly authorised to exercise functions in that jurisdiction&rdquo;&mdash; that is irrelevant; where it is &ldquo;made to any institution of the European Communities for the purpose of the State's membership of any of those Communities,&rdquo; or, lastly, &ldquo;which in the opinion of the Bank, is necessary for the protection of depositors.&rdquo; If this Bill is passed in its present form in no circumstances can a director of the bank come to a Member of this House and say: &ldquo;Are you aware that the bank has been pursuing an erroneous, loss-making or damaging policy for the last three months and has suffered badly as a consequence?  I want to reveal that to you so that you will raise this matter in public and something will be done about it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This Bill makes such a person not simply a person who must lose his job, not simply a person who may be criminally liable, but a person who is a traitor to his institution.  That is wrong.  There is no basis why it should be so.  Why should there be a cloak of secrecy around the Central Bank with a view to deciding that information in the hands of officers, governors, directors or servants of that bank should never be disclosed except in the entirely restrictive set of circumstances set out in section 15 (2) of this Bill?  That is wrong.  It is not merely a replacement for the provision that was set out in the 1942 Act which related to disclosing information which was got <Col N="1927" /> from subordinate bodies and which they were only entitled to in that capacity; it is trying to drag around the Central Bank a new cloak of secrecy, an Official Secrets Act, which will make the bank more impenetrable.</P>
    <P>For instance, I will not be able, on any financial occasion such as the launch of the new magazine, to talk to any officer, director, servant, agent or the governor of the Central Bank in manner that will allow him to disclose any information about the business of the bank.  For my sins, I am Finance spokesman of one of the parties in this House.  If I and Deputy Noonan are to be excluded from hearing, bona fide from the lips of a director of the Central Bank about any matters dealing with the business of that bank on pain of him and us committing a criminal offence, there is something seriously wrong with the legislation.  It should not be accepted in its present form and it is probably unconstitutional.  Why should there be such a cloak of secrecy dragged around the operations of the Central Bank, around policy issues and errors that are made inside the Central Bank? It is wrong in principle; it would be wrong in practice and it would only compound the problem which I have spoken about earlier, that is, the lack of accountability of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this measure will apply in particular to a director who believes there is something of importance which ought to be disclosed to Members of this House in relation to the bank's affairs or to the policies being pursued by the bank. To say he is prohibited from disclosing such information unless the majority of the board agree, is a gross invasion of his dignity as a member of the board of the bank and goes too far in creating an unnecessary aura of secrecy about this institution.  I can see good reasons why there should be, in certain respects, an obligation of secrecy &mdash; there could be profits to be made or information which is sensitive and damaging to institutions would come to the knowledge of such people &mdash; but section 15 as drafted at <Col N="1928" /> present is absolutely excessive and wrong in principle.</P>
    <P>As I have said before and I repeat, the accounts of the bank which are regularly put before this House and whose contents are regulated by statutory instrument are completely inadequate.  You could study those accounts until you are blue in the face but you could form no judgment as to whether the taxpayer is getting value for money from that institution.  There is no performance target information available in those accounts.  There is no basis on which anybody, no matter how clever, who examines those accounts could arrive at the view that the Central Bank is delivering value to the consumer.  The mere fact that the form of the accounts is decided by this institution is a slight indictment of the Dáil because it is done by statutory instrument and this House is entitled only to such accounts as it is willing to accept.  The Minister should require the bank to give full and proper accounts from which any interested and intelligent Member of this House could deduce whether the bank is being properly, adequately, efficiently and tightly run &mdash; I use the phrase &ldquo;tightly run&rdquo; because, like any other institution, it is not immune from the winds of change or from the economies which the rest of us have had to make in our various capacities. The Central Bank must be subject to the same controls and the same ethics that it seems so often to preach in its financial commentaries to the rest of the economy.</P>
    <P>Would the Central Bank accept for one minute that there should be a Department of State whose affairs and expenditure are not subject to any scrutiny?  It would not.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  If the Central Bank wants to remain independent, the very least it can do is to demonstrate by way of proof positive that it is doing a good job with the resources and the moneys over which it has control and, moreover, that it is doing an economical job in relation to the reserves that are given to it.  So long as the Central Bank purports to lecture others on what they must do in relation to belt tightening controls and at <Col N="1929" /> the same time insist that its own independence requires not merely that it not be questioned but that it be entirely immune from any investigative procedure, apart from the Comptroller and Auditor General's cursory but detailed examination for the purposes of seeing that there was no misappropriation, its position is untenable and indefensible in many respects.  Such an approach would not compromise the independence of the bank but on the contrary would ensure that the ordinary citizen and the taxpayer would have protection for his ultimate interests, both in the way the bank is run and as to what happens to the funds at the Bank's disposal.</P>
    <P>There are many detailed provisions in this Bill in respect of which we have queries and in respect of which we intend to table amendments.  The Progressive Democrats are determined to ensure that this opportunity, which is a ten yearly opportunity at best, will not pass without using the legislative process to the full to ensure that the public's right to know, that the principle of value for money and the principles of accountability are firmly entrenched in the legislation relating to the Central Bank and that the ethics which that institution preaches to others apply equally, and by operation of law, to itself.</P>
    <P>A number of points arise out of the text of the Bill.  I do not want, because this is only the Second Stage, to go into the detail of the Bill.  One point that occurs to me in the context of the Building Societies Bill is that since 1981 the Central Bank has held unto itself the right to determine, by way of veto, the number of branches that any individual bank can operate.  At that stage it was the view of the Central Bank that there was an over-emphasis on branches, on the structures of the various associated banks, and that as a consequence the consumer was losing out.</P>
    <P>If the Central Bank purports to take on a supervisory role in relation to building societies I want that clearly entrenched either in this Bill or in the Building Societies Bill.  Since both Bills are being debated at the same time I hope I am not <Col N="1930" /> straying from one to the other illicitly so far as the procedure of this House is concerned.  I want it clearly stated that the Central Bank can say to any building society: &ldquo;You may not spend more than a certain percentage or your funds or a certain ratio of your assets or whatever &mdash;however it is determined, I do not care &mdash;on advertising.  You may not fly people in jumbo jets to Las Vegas to see boxing matches which you have sponsored.  You may not erect, at any expense, branch offices where you want them and as you want them in every rural town and every urban suburb&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If there is any good reason for the 1981 stricture on the Associated Banks in relation to their expenditure on the opening of branches and the problems that creates from the point of view of keeping costs down, the same applies a thousand-fold to the building societies. It applies especially to building societies because the shares, to a large extent, in the Associated Banks are owned by financial institutions who look to those shares and the money they get out of them with a view to seeing what dividend they get in return.  I am sure that 95 per cent of the Members of this House are shareholders in building societies in one way or another.  How many of us exercise any function whatsoever or have any interest in the amount of money that is spent by the board of that building society on promotional activities, advertising activities, management expenses, administration, buildings and the appurtenances of those building societies?  I believe there is no pressure from within those building societies for control in those areas.  Although the Central Bank has functions of this kind in relation to ordinary associated banks it should be explicitly stated in the legislation that it has the same functions in relation to the building societies.  It may be implicit and the Minister may be so advised but I have grave doubts as to whether it is.  When I look at the legislation that existed in 1981 I have grave doubts as to whether it was open to the Central Bank to start directing the banks under its control at that time that they must apply for permission <Col N="1931" /> before opening an extra branch.  I have doubts as to whether such general prohibitions or regulations were <i>intra vires</i> the Central Bank then.  I would want explicit authority in that regard if such proposals were to be included in future legislation.</P>
    <P>I have objected as strongly as I can to the terms of section 15 because I think it is a mistake.  Section 18 will require substantial amendment.  For instance, the Minister the other day was telling me about his shared misgivings with me about the Revenue Commissioners' failure to furnish adequate reports within an adequate time for their annual doings on our behalf.  Section 18 gives the Central Bank six months to prepare its annual report.  Why should we put up with this sloppy, laid back attitude to reporting requirements?  If there is something wrong let us find out two months after the year is ended.  Why should section 18 give them six months in which to dilly and dally and procrastinate in relation to telling us the bad news or the mistakes they have made in the previous year? Section 18 should be amended to provide that the accounts and records of the bank and the annual reports furnished by the bank should have specific items: (i) clear indications as to how staff are deployed and (ii) clear indications of the relative costs of each of the bank's activities.  I refer in particular to the cost of currency production so that we can see what that particular enterprise in Sandyford is costing the taxpayer and can make our judgment as to whether it is necessary or desirable to maintain it on foot of such information.</P>
    <P>I welcome the winding up of the legal tender note fund and the transfer of its assets to the general fund of the bank.  It is about time we left the era of the currency commission and came into the 20th century.</P>
    <P>Section 26 is doubtful in that it requires the holder of licences &mdash; in other words licensed banks &mdash; to notify the bank of all charges imposed by such holder in relation to the provision of any service to <Col N="1932" /> the public or any class of the public.  I know that is intended in good faith but a requirement and notification of that kind will lead to an approximation rather than price competition among the various licensed banks in relation to the services they provide.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 28 I note that investment trust companies are not included and I would ask the Minister to explain the reason for that.</P>
    <P>I agree with the proposition that auditors appointed to a licensed bank should have an obligation to the world at large as opposed to their individual client and should have the duties and immunities conferred on them by the sections of the Bill up to 44.  There should be a method of excluding certain persons from acting as auditors in the company.  In relation to section 82, I would ask the Minister to accept that that section is very restrictive. It allows only for an appeal to the courts against a refusal of the Bank of its consent to a particular set of circumstances on the basis of a point of law.  A reasonableness criterion should be entered into also.  It should not be simply on the basis that something was not legally capable of being done by the Central Bank but also that in arriving at its decision the bank had acted unreasonably.</P>
    <P>I do not see the necessity for section 82 (6) which prohibits any appeal from the decision of the High Court, in relation to a point of law on the part of an application dealt with under section 82 to the Supreme Court.  I am against any restriction on a right to appeal from one judge to five judges unless there is a clear, coherent and necessary reason for so doing.  If I appealed to the High Court on a point of law and felt I got a raw deal, I would look askance at a statute which said: &ldquo;there is a Supreme Court there to deal with errors of law by the High Court, consisting of five members, whose function is to reconsider decisions of law by the High Court but you, by statute, have been precluded from appealing to it for no reason whatever&rdquo;.  I should like to know why there should be no appeal to the Supreme Court under that section.</P>

      <P>I am not speaking just as a lawyer.  In relation to the financial institutions for the International Financial Services Centre, I support the idea that the Central Bank should exercise a control over these institutions, but Part VII of the Bill, and in particular section 87, is of such a kind effectively as to be making up the law as we go along.  The effect of section 87 is to allow the Minister and the bank to make up the law relative to bodies located in the Financial Services Centre as they go along and as they think desirable.</P>
      <P>We have been rapped over the knuckles once this year by the courts for delegating in an impermissible manner legislative authority to bodies other than this Chamber.  Rather than have the Minister apply laws as he considers fit to what happens in that centre, I would like legislators to take responsibility for what happens in relation to that centre and at the very least for the Minister, when he makes an order under that section, to require the consent of the Dáil to the making of such an order.  This section says that we as a legislature can delegate to the Minister, after consulting the bank or any other Minister he wants to consult, the right to apply any law he likes of a financial kind to the bodies operating in that centre, to such an extent as he likes, and with such exception as he likes. That effectively is making him into a one man legislature, and I am against that as a proposition.</P>
      <P>The establishment of self-regulatory bodies under section 90 &mdash; I will not go into much detail on the section because we will have another day to do that &mdash; is not set out in such a manner as will give any such self-regulatory body teeth as far as individual members are concerned. The Minister could have done a better job on section 90 than he has done.  I appreciate that he is working under time constraints, but this is a very thin skim of margarine on a piece of legislative bread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with the breaking of rules set out in section 103 of the Bill.  I want to point out to the Minister &mdash; and <Col N="1934" /> I am wearing my lawyer's wig for a moment &mdash; that unless there is a system of providing what are the rules, and presumptions in relation to what are the rules that people are supposed to have exchanged, and a system of evidential requirements and evidential rules in relation to what rules actually are, that section will never be applied because a lawyer one day out of Kings Inns, could run a coach and four through it if it still exists when this legislation comes into operation.</P>
    <P>I have a few queries to make of the Minister in relation to moneybrokers. Moneybroking involves a person carrying on a moneybroking business.  A moneybroking business involves a certain set of transactions between any two or more persons who are holders of a licence under section 9 of the 1971 Act &mdash; in other words, licensed banks, a building society or a financial institution &mdash; and moneybroking shall be construed accordingly. I believe there should be a wider definition of moneybroking.  It is important that as the moneymarket develops corporate institutions are attracted into it and moneybroking transactions should not have a restricted meaning.  I appreciate that by orders under section 105 it is possible to extend the meaning of a moneybroking transaction, but again I think that is a very loose and inadequate mechanism for setting out what the law is.</P>
    <P>There are provisions in this Bill relating to the Bankers' Books Evidence Act.  I have prosecuted cases for the poor benighted people who have been unfortunate enough to have me as their counsel, and I can tell the House that the Bankers' Books Evidence Act is a mess. To prove that bank records are accurate and to make them admissible under this Act is quite difficult.  If the Legislature is looking again at the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, I hope the DPP's office will be consulted to enable a reasonable number of amendments to be made to this Bill so as to change that Act and make it easy to prove banking transactions in court cases.  I have seen cases &mdash;and I am not speaking out of court or out of turn &mdash; where the difficulty of proving financial transactions in accordance with Irish laws of evidence has <Col N="1935" /> allowed guilty people to go free.  If the Minister is amending any provisions of that Act, it is about time that records of financial transactions, not simply bankers' books evidence but every form of financial record, are made easily provable in court cases with a view to securing convictions of people who are committing offences.  I can only assure the Minister that it is very easy to exclude evidence under that Statute which is now 110 years old, even as amended, and makes it impossible to prove in courts of law the substance of quite serious financial crimes.  If we are going to interfere with that Act, I believe now is the time to take on that issue.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that the law in relation to the Central Bank be changed but it is not necessary, looking at the history of the Central Bank, that we should merely add another tottering tier to a wedding cake.  The Central Bank emerged from the Currency Commission.  It went through the 1942 process and the next major milestone in its legislative career was during 1971.  The Central Bank is entering a period of huge expansion of its functions in 1989, but it still remains a body which I believe is immune from the ordinary rigours of accountability and responsibility.  It is up to this House to accord it a degree of independence and respect which is commensurate with the importance of the work it does.  In order to achieve that it is not necessary for this House to wash its hands of responsibility or allow its Ministers to simply say that this is an independent body over which they have no control when they appoint the entire board.  The reports of the Central Bank are never debated in this House &mdash; I do not know when they are debated but they are used on occasion &mdash; and its accounts are never debated or examined in depth by this House, and it is not enough to have them submitted annually and left lying in the Library of this House.</P>
    <P>It all persuades me that if we are serious about exercising the supervisory functions which we nominally give ourselves in so many Acts of requiring people to report to us, this House must galvanise itself, at least sufficiently to respond to those reports, to examine them and to <Col N="1936" /> have a committee or institution of this House of some kind who actually address their collective brains, such as they may be, to the substance of those reports, who would call in the Governor of the Central Bank and say that they have been presented with this report and that the committee have or have not said X or Y and want to know what is and what is not implicit in the report and want it accounted for.  That does not demean those bodies.</P>
    <P>One experience that you get as a lawyer in dealing with civil servants is that when a civil servant goes to court and is put into the witness box and a Bible is put in his hand, it is as if it were a stone rolled over in a field.  There is a scurry for cover.  There is a feeling that here is that civil servant being subjected to the cold light of day.  I do not know why they are so afraid of these bewigged gentlemen, but they are.  Accountability may suddenly attach to an individual.  This is endemic in Irish society and is probably our greatest fault, this lack of accountability and responsibility, lack of an innate capacity on behalf of those whom we employ to man our institutions to say &ldquo;That is the decision that I took and I have to stand over it and accept the blame&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank is independent; it must be independent, it must be able to tell the Government that they are wrong; it must be able to tell the people at large that the Government are pursuing unwise policies; it must be able to control the banks on an independent and non-political basis.  All those things are true, but it must also be capable of looking the public straight in the eye and saying: &ldquo;We as a financial institution on our own account are delivering good value for money.  We are managing our own stewardship properly.  We will on occasions subject ourselves to a few questions being put in our direction&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If the Minister technically &mdash; and I presume that he is correct technically because I never challenge the Chair unduly in this House &mdash; chooses to hide behind the proposition that this is a separate institution for which, although he elects its directors he is not personally responsible, fine, that is his business. <Col N="1937" /> However, the institution itself is making important decisions and does so from day to day and will, as all this corpus of legislation comes into being, make more and more important decisions.  Every time it makes such a decision somebody is accountable for that decision.  What I see in my short experience in this House is that nobody is willing to be responsible although he is in theory accountable for the decisions that he makes.  That worries me.  The Central Bank are being given a watchdog function.  They are being given control over the banking system.  They are being given the power to close banks, to revoke licences, to close building societies, to suspend their activities.  They are being given huge powers to protect the public interest, and they are probably all necessary powers.</P>
    <P>There will undoubtedly be, as there have been in the case of the insurance world and the Department of Industry and Commerce, occasions when there is immense pressure on the Central Bank to disregard breaches of its guidelines, not to act because of the consequences for the integrity of our economy or our financial solvency in any particular area. But the deciding power and the buck, in colloquial terms, will always stop on the board table of the Central Bank.  I am saying that this Bill, combined with all the other Central Bank Acts and amendment Bills and the Currency Act of 1927, does not do what is necessary, that is, to establish the Central Bank as a body which has public accountability and responsibility and which carries them out in any form other than under these documents.  These are great for students, for macro-economists who are happy to look at various ratios and the like.  They do not tell somebody who is responsible, as Members of this House are, and to whom the Central Bank are accountable, what actually has been decided in any given year, what options were open and what options were acted on in one way or another and how the public interests were affected.</P>
    <P>The more we complicate the Central Bank, the more important we make it the easier it is to confuse immunity with independence, to confuse irresponsibility with autonomy.  Although I welcome this <Col N="1938" /> Bill &mdash; and we are not going to call votes on Second Stage of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the facet of the Central Bank's relationship with the State, which is at the moment most unsatisfactory. I believe in the future, when there is one major financial collapse or one failure on the part of the Central Bank to exercise its functions, it will give rise to huge reverberations.  At that stage this House will have no moral authority to say to the Central Bank: &ldquo;You made a mistake.  You are responsible&rdquo;.  We never insisted on our right to know what was happening or to insist that the Central Bank account for its stewardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My timely arrival will, I hope, enable me to make a few remarks on this subject.  There are several points that I should like to make on the Bill. One relates to a matter probably not very prominent in the Minister's mind, that is to that section of the Bill which deals with the retention of papers by the Central Bank.  It purports to annul, as far as I can see, the effect of the Act passed by the last Dáil with regard to national archives so far as the Central Bank is concerned. It seems to say that any previous enactment of the Oireachtas requiring them to retain documents for more than six years is repealed.  It may be that this was proposed and brought in without much thought about the national archival aspect, but some matter of convenience of not having any room in that vast building for retention of papers may have lain behind it.  I should like the Minister to <Col N="1939" /> reconsider the point.  Both Houses concurred in that legislation and as an <i>ad misericordiam</i> plea <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Minister, it is the only piece of legislation that I actually succeeded in bringing in myself as Taoiseach in the last Dáil, so I shall be sad to see part of it disappearing in these circumstances.  I should like the Minister to have a look at that.</P>
      <P>There are other points that I want to make.  I am concerned about the deposit insurance proposal from several points of view.  I do not know whether the full implications of this have been considered. I fear that the effect of enacting this may be quite unintentionally to divert the depositors towards less secure investments. The effect of this is to apply, as far as I can see from the Bill a standard premium for what is called &ldquo;insurance&rdquo;, to be paid by all the different deposit taking institutions of 0.2 per cent of their deposits, I think.  The exact figure escapes me, but it is a small percentage.  This would apply to all institutions regardless of what degree of risk is involved.  Whatever this is, it is not insurance.  It is a mistake to describe it as that.  The fact is, of course, that there are different risks attaching in different cases.</P>
      <P>Let us take on the one hand the large, established institutions such as the associated banks.  It is true that in my last term of office as Taoiseach it transpired in unusual circumstances that a problem existed in respect of one of these institutions, a problem which we dealt with very speedily and rectified.  However, the action that we took &mdash; and I shall come back to the reasons for this later, I do not think that it is an action at which the Minister would demur &mdash; was motivated by considerations that went far beyond the question of the interest of depositors or shareholders.  What was at stake would have been so serious for the economy, putting at risk other banks and our currency, that the Government had no alternative but to take the action they did.  In proportion to our size, our two major banks are very large indeed compared to what might be called a large institution in absolute terms in the United States, that would control a much smaller proportion of total banking there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1940" /> A very large institution is in a position where, in practice, the public authorities cannot allow it to fail.  Not alone in those cases are the depositors protected by virtue of the public interest, but in practice so, largely, are the shareholders. People may argue the merits of that.  It is not entirely satisfactory that there are shareholders in a business in which the State cannot afford to let the shareholders lose out.</P>
    <P>In the United States if a small institution fails, the depositors are protected under their insurance schemes but the shareholders are not and therefore lose out.  In the case of a large institution, intervention takes place by the Federal Reserve Bank, designed to ensure that the institution does not disappear.  It is taken over by somebody else.  The shareholders may not do as well as they might have done, but normally the takeovers are such that the shareholders are not seriously adversely affected, the reason being that the impact, even in the United States economy, of the failure of a large institution would be such that it could not be accepted.</P>
    <P>
      <i>De facto</i> deposits in large institutions here are secure for reasons that go beyond the narrow interests of the institutions concerned, yet it is proposed to impose the same levy on those institutions as on ones which may be less secure.  That money in practice can only be put towards salvaging the depositors in smaller institutions.  Insurance is normally related to risk.  That does not seem very sensible.  The Minister may say that it does not matter very much because the sums are small, but there is a little more to it than that.</P>
    <P>The existence of deposit insurance will tend to have the effect of encouraging people to put their deposits in less secure institutions.  Institutions which are involved in higher risk activity designed to earn higher profits can afford to pay higher deposit interest.  Looking at the different rates offered by various institutions, some depositors decide to take the risk because they want a higher deposit interest.  That is fair enough.  That is how the market system operates.  It is now proposed effectively to insulate the <Col N="1941" /> depositors against almost all the risks, except in certain peculiar circumstances, if I understood the mathematical formulae in the Bill correctly &mdash; and I may not since I have never been much good at mathematics, as distinct from arithmetic. It seems that normally the depositors will be assured of protection in respect of two-thirds or more of their deposits.  They will, therefore, be more inclined to go for the institutions offering the higher rates and those institutions will be more inclined to engage in more high risk activity in order to sustain those rates.  There will be a widening of margins and a distortion of activity in favour of high risk institutions as against the more secure ones.  That does not seem to be a good idea.</P>
    <P>This is happening because the regulatory mechanisms in operation are not, in the Minister's view, such as to offer the necessary protection to the depositor. In other words, the Central Bank, as at present operating with the existing staff, are not in a position to monitor the activities of these institutions sufficiently well to be satisfied that they will not go under, as the Irish Trust Bank and another merchant banking institution went under.  It does not seem satisfactory that the Central Bank, in a small country like this with a limited number of institutions, should feel so unable to monitor them adequately that they have to introduce a system of protecting depositors which will effect a distortion in favour of high risk institutions, encourage them to take more risks and encourage depositors to put their money in a more risky area than in the more secure ones.  That does not make good economic sense.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose my remarks will divert the Minister from his intention to introduce the scheme but in this House we should at least debate the merits of the proposal and not allow it to be put into effect without further consideration.  The Minister will probably be disinclined to accept the idea of having different premiums paid by different institutions as being invidious as between them, perhaps highlighting areas of risk by charging higher premiums for some and identifying them as being more risky.  That is what he should do in economic terms.  I <Col N="1942" /> would ask him to reflect on this point, which may already have been drawn to his attention.  I may be preaching, if not to the converted, at least to somebody who has already been alerted to the points I am making.  He may have taken a rational decision to ignore the considerations I am putting forward and, having decided in favour of deposit insurance, he may have taken the rational decision not to discriminate in terms of the premium, but if these issues have not been fully debated in Government &mdash; I know from my own experience that not every issue is debated fully in Government &mdash; I suggest that the Minister should at least reflect on the points I am making.</P>
    <P>I said earlier in relation to the particular financial institution which experienced difficulties when we were in office that it was baled out and that no Government could have allowed such an institution to go under.  I refer once again to that case because it was not satisfactory. People will recall that the institution took over an insurance company, the record of which had been inadequately investigated and which turned out to be in a state of incipient insolvency to such a degree that the bank, despite its size, could not carry the costs and risks involved.  The Government were approached and it transpired that the bank felt itself to be at risk.  Why?  After all, it had its own shareholders' capital and it is required by the Central Bank to have primary and secondary liquidity.</P>
    <P>In this country, the secondary liquidity requirements relate more to the Government's need for support for gilts by the banks than anything else.  Banks here are in those terms more secure than elsewhere because of our secondary liquidity requirements.  Why, then was there a problem in this case?  The problem arose because of the fact that banks had been permitted to count as part of their equity base FRNs, loans from other banks of a particular and unusual kind.  These are loans which are given on condition that if the bank to which the money is lent or any subsidiary, no matter how small, becomes insolvent the loans in question can be withdrawn overnight.  I had to plead ignorance.  I was unaware that a <Col N="1943" /> significant part of our banking capital took that form until this case occurred.</P>
    <P>I had not studied banking in detail since the mid-sixties when I undertook a study of the banking system in considerable detail, at a time when the bank's profits and reserves were hidden, with a view to identifying what they were.  I was reasonably successful.  I identified the position as being that in 1958 their profits had been 2.75 times the figure disclosed, falling to twice in 1964.  When they were disclosed in 1966, they were 1.75 times, which was right on my trend line.  It was an interesting study.</P>
    <P>I have not had anything much to do with banking since then except as an ordinary individual with an ordinary overdraft. I was unaware of this feature of the banks.  I was very taken aback that the banking system had so evolved under the authority of the Central Bank &mdash; that this additional risk element was introduced without any public awareness of it and without the knowledge of members of the Government.  Perhaps it was with the knowledge of people in the Department of Finance, but it never happened to come to our attention.</P>
    <P>It was a very serious development that the system had evolved so that part of the alleged capital of the bank was an insecure loan which could be withdrawn at a moment's notice in the event of any subsidiary of the bank becoming insolvent, thereby putting that bank at such risk that it had to call on the Government and the Central Bank to intervene to save the banking system from danger of default.</P>
    <P>Since that time &mdash; not necessarily because of that &mdash; the Bank of England have been pursuing the question of the adequacy of banking capital provisions.  I should like the Minister to tell us whether the provision which put at risk a major Irish bank &mdash; and our whole banking and currency system at that time &mdash; has since been reviewed.  Can he assure me that the risks which then existed, including the operational risk, have been modified perhaps in pursuance of what the Bank of England have been doing worldwide, not just in England, but in relation to <Col N="1944" /> other banking systems?  I should like an assurance that this has been dealt with.</P>
    <P>In our time in Government it was not possible to pursue the matter much further but we took the necessary and immediate action to save the system. Then, after an interval when there was no risk to the credibility of the bank or the banking system, we arranged with the Central Bank to arrange with that bank, and to some degree with others, to finance retrospectively at no cost to the taxpayer, the provision that had to be made in that emergency so that no burden fell on the taxpayer.  We were not able to convince people of that fact because at the time this happened we could not make provision to require that bank &mdash; and others to a lesser degree &mdash; to provide the necessary resources without putting in doubt immediately the very thing we tried to secure &mdash; that the bank and the system were safe.</P>
    <P>We were not able to defend ourselves against attack, some of which came from the Opposition benches but more generally in the press and media, that we were bailing out a bank with Government money.  In fact, because of the steps we took in pursuance of reaching a decision at the time, after an appropriate interval we ensured that the taxpayer did not have to pay anything and the bank itself, over time, through the Central Bank and other banks to a lesser degree, would finance the rescue operation.  I should like a clear statement regarding FRNs.  We do not want that to happen ever again.  I should also like an assurance that this matter has been resolved, and that steps have been taken to ensure that this will never happen again.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to raise that matter because it has a bearing on the other point I wish to make about deposit insurance.  On that occasion we found &mdash; and this Government would have done the same &mdash; that we had no alternative but to take the action we did.  It was not open to us by any mechanism that could be devised, at short notice in any event, to take action that would not put at risk the whole system or to allow the burden to fall on the shareholders.  Therefore, the shareholders in these large banks are very privileged indeed and, in view of the <Col N="1945" /> privilege they enjoy, it is a matter for the State to consider how they will deal with the banking system or parts of it.  While that might be a reason for looking on these large institutions a bit differently from smaller ones, it is not a good enough reason to operate a deposit insurance system of a kind which at the margin will encourage people to go for the high interest rates.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in this country &mdash; perhaps everywhere &mdash; that when people see high interest rates offered they are tempted by them.  All my life, I have taken the view that if any interest rate is higher in one place than another there is usually a bad reason for it.  I am more than willing to be told I am wrong and I would be the first to chance it &mdash; if I had any money to put into something at the higher rate if I thought it was secure.  The first time this happened to me was a very long time ago when my wife suggested she put a little money into Shanahan's Stamp auctions.  I told her not to do so until I had checked it out as the interest rate was so high I thought there must have been something wrong.  It collapsed a few weeks later and I have operated that principle since then.</P>
    <P>Having said that, of course the marginal differences in interest rates between deposit taking institutions as published in <i>The Irish Times</i> every Monday are differences between banks which, in the ordinary way, are secure.  Some of them operate in a slightly different way from others and there are marginally different interest rates; I am not suggesting that when they are slightly higher there is any real insecurity.  However, there is slightly less security in most cases where higher rates are paid.  Beyond a certain point that could become insecurity.</P>
    <P>The deposit insurance system will encourage those banks, by virtue of the additional money that people put into them, knowing now that their deposits are safe, to offer higher interest rates because people are now insured for at least two-thirds of the amount by the State.  That is unwise because it has operated badly in the United States and has been a significant contributory factor to the failure of banking institutions in the US according to quite a number of <Col N="1946" /> observers of the banking system there. Before we introduce a flat rate premium, we should reflect on the American experience and on whether we want to encourage people along these lines.</P>
    <P>If we had a very sophisticated body of depositors who knew the risks involved in higher interest rates and were willing to take them, that would be all right but, given the reaction of depositors in the institutions which have failed, it is obvious that they do not think in those terms. They believe that any institution operating here on the authority of the Central Bank must be secure and that if the institution goes under they are entitled to their money back from the State.  As long as people believe that and put their money in on the basis of getting the best return regardless of risk, there will be a tendency to invest in risky areas and deposit insurance in these circumstances merely makes that trend stronger and makes it more likely that some institution at some stage will take too much of a risk and fail.</P>
    <P>The provision of deposit insurance will be very popular and will satisfy the people who want their deposits to be secure, but whether it is in the interest of the country as a whole &mdash; or even in the interest of the depositors in the long run &mdash; is another question.  I was anxious to contribute to this debate and I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</P>

The keynote is the protection of the public from financial loss and the upholding of acceptable standards of supervisory practice.</P>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the points made by all speakers.  A number of arguments were made in the debate to which I wish to respond.  I will take them in the order in which they were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to section 11 Deputy Noonan asked whether it was appropriate to apply penalties to the employees of a financial institution.  The provision in section 11 is standard and appears in many other Acts. <Col N="1947" /> It does not require that individuals be prosecuted but allows this to happen where it is clear that the person in question is the main architect of the breach of the law.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 14, Deputy Noonan drew attention to the Irish test embodied in section 14 (3) (a) for entry to the staff of the bank.  This is simply an re-enactment of an existing requirement and I do not see that it causes practical problems.  From experience, it has not caused any so far.  In relation to section 15, which deals with confidentiality, Deputy Noonan may be reading much more into it than is there.  The present oath of secrecy is more restrictive than the proposed provisions in the Bill.  The section will not prohibit the bank from dealing with inquiries from committees of the House.  Last month officials from the bank appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation in relation to certain EC Directives on banking.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 15 is to safeguard the confidentiality of the affairs, for example, of individual banks supervised by the Central Bank.  This is essential to enable the bank to supervise such bodies.</P>
    <P>I note what Deputy Noonan said in regard to section 17 and I will look at it between now and Committee Stage.  In regard to the International Financial Services Centre, the provisions are only a small element of the Bill and I hope the whole debate will not concentrate on it, although it is important to include it.</P>
    <P>The success of the centre to date speaks for itself.  Fifty-three projects, with the potential to create 1,300 jobs, have been approved.  The Government welcome all suggestions for the development of the potential of the centre.  The contribution by the commentator referred to by Deputy Noonan was commented on recently by the chairman of the International Financial Services Centre Committee and in the short time available to me I will not quote what he said but I think it was a clear statement of the position and I see no reason to add to it.  I hope that we can all work together in securing the continued success of the <Col N="1948" /> International Financial Services Centre. The commentator put that forward as his view as to how we may improve the centre.  The statement issued by the committee in response deals with that but I have no doubt we will return to this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have been asked to clarify how Chapter VI will work and if a bank will be required to get approval not only from the bank, or from me, but also under the mergers and takeovers legislation.  The position is that the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be required in certain cases.  The Bill provides that I must consult with my colleague when giving my approval. Perhaps, as Deputy Noonan suggested, one decision making body is best but I would not see, in practice, major problems arising with the procedure outlined in the Bill.  This is more or less the way it happens at present when a bank wishes to take over another firm.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan wondered if the size of the deposit protection account would be too large.  I agree with the Deputy that the account will be larger than is the case in the UK.  However, there are a number of important differences with the UK scheme.  It is proposed in the Bill that the money deposited with the Central Bank would remain the property of the individual banks and they would be paid interest on their deposits.  The scheme would not cost the banks anything unless it was found necessary to utilise the fund which we all hope will not happen.</P>
    <P>Another important difference is that the UK fund is able to borrow money thereby increasing the money available to compensate depositors.  I would prefer not to have a maximum limit on the size of the account.  I think it is more prudent to have a fund that can meet situations that may arise rather than to have a scheme which fails at the first hurdle.  As for the power to alter the percentage by order I would only be able to do this after a recommendation from the bank.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 40 certain reservations were expressed about the use of the provisions in the Bill to have court proceedings held in camera when the affairs of a financial institution are involved.  I, too, believe in open justice <Col N="1949" /> but there are undeniable cases where the trial of issues in public might not be desirable. It would be up to the court to decide if this is the case.  All we are doing is allowing the court to take that view and to try the issues other than in public.  In a recent case Mr. Justice Costello decided on the evidence before him that that case should be heard in camera as if it were to be heard in open court untold damage might be caused to a commercial business. It is only reasonable that the court should take a look at the factors involved and decide on whether to hear a case in open court.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell raised some interesting points which I have no doubt he will pursue further on Committee Stage. He asked a question about the currency centre in Sandyford &mdash; the bank is responsible for the issuing of our currency &mdash; but only last summer the Deputy was assured, in response to questions raised by him on the cost of efficiency of the production of currency, that the production costs were competitive.  There are reasons for giving limited detail in response to questions on this area and on Committee Stage I hope to refer to this area in more detail when I hope that the present industrial dispute will be at an end.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell also raised queries about the format of the accounts of the Central Bank and complained bitterly about the lack of information contained in them.  The format of these accounts was reviewed and changed in 1984 but I can assure Deputy McDowell and the House that once this Bill has been enacted I will review the format and take into account all suggestions made.  I may be open to correction but I am not aware of the Central Bank refusing to give information to any of the committees of the House who act as watchdogs over the various public bodies.  However, I can assure the House that I will take a look at the format of the accounts once this Bill has been enacted.  Deputy McDowell asked as to why changes were made in 1984.  I will outline the reasons on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell also referred to the UK Financial Services Act and called for the enactment of a similar Act here.  I <Col N="1950" /> think anyone who is aware of the implications of the UK Financial Services Act would not wish such an Act on the financial institutions here.  It is quite clear that that Act has caused many problems for the operators in the London market.  It has increased costs for operators and some feel that it needs a very extensive overhaul.  I would not be in favour of enacting a similar type Act here.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Deputy's query on the gaps in supervision I would refer him to section 25 of the Bill, the provisions of which would allow me to apply supervisory provisions to unregulated sectors, if needed, so as to protect the public from loss or to promote the proper and orderly regulation of the financial markets.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to cases of fraudulent investor activity and the placing of misleading advertisements in Irish newspapers recently.  I would refer the Deputy to the recent action of the Director of Consumer Affairs in tackling illegal and fraudulent share pushing.  A provision is contained in the Bill, where misleading advertisements are published, for the Director of Public Prosecutions to take action.  In one, if not two, recent cases he sought the assistance of the fraud squad and they dealt with the cases pretty adequately.  This is not an easy matter to deal with.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell also raised various queries in relation to section 82 and appeals to the court.  He asked why not move from an appeal to the High Court to an appeal to the Supreme Court.  For the information of the Deputy and the House I should say that the same system applies under the Mergers and Monopolies Act.  However, this is an issue we can come back to on Committee Stage. Deputy McDowell also raised various other queries which I will deal with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald raised some questions in regard to the components of bank capital monitored by the Central Bank. For the Deputy's information and the information of the House let me point out that under new EC rules, the so-called Basle agreement, nearing finalisation, there will be EC agreement which will reflect the agreements reached between the regulatory authorities of the <Col N="1951" /> major economies.  Under these rules a certain amount of primary capital can be subscribed by floating rate notes, FRNs, which the Deputy referred to, where these are perpetual, in other words non withdrawable.  The Central Bank is committed to operating the Basle Rules.</P>

      <P>I will get a chance to go into more depth on Committee Stage.  In regard to the flat rate contribution of 0.2 per cent the Deputy said that no account is taken of differences in risk.  I believe that all schemes in place are run on a flat rate basis mainly because it is very difficult to derive an actuarially based deposit insurance premium.  The proposed introduction of the scheme outlined in the Bill does not imply any lack of confidence in the supervisory ability of the Central Bank and the scheme is being put in place to provide some limited compensation to depositors if, for any reason, a bank failure occurs.  I will go into this matter in more detail on Committee Stage, including the reasons for the introduction of the scheme.  I believe I dealt with this matter at some length in my opening ramarks and if the Deputy studies them in detail he will see what I am trying to achieve.  I am approaching this matter in a balanced way but I will take on board some of the points made.  We can look at this matter in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the difficulties which arose in one financial institution during his time in Government and the problems which were caused as a result.  The Deputy said he could not find a possible mechanism at that stage to transfer some of the responsibility to the shareholders.  My party in Opposition supported fully the action taken by the Government then in the interests of ensuring that our two major banking institutions were kept intact.  I was not privy to the discussions at the time but I would have thought it would have been possible at that stage to ensure no damage was done to our financial institutions.  I would have thought there could have <Col N="1952" /> been a mechanism by which the Government would have been able to take a shareholding in that bank and when better days come, as they did soon afterwards, the shareholders in turn would have the opportunity to buy back those shares from the Government of the day, the Central Bank or whoever.  In that way it would have been possible for the shareholders to shoulder the responsibility which was theirs in the first instance.  The taxpayer should not be asked to shoulder that responsibility.  It was right for the Government to step in.  In the same circumstances any Irish Government would step in.  I would have thought it possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is a matter of grave public importance in view of statements and counter-statements made by various interested parties since the discovery, by accident, of 17 plastic bags containing asbestos waste in Portarlington last weekend. There is a clear need for some type of independent inquiry in view of the conflict of evidence to date, and I hope the genuine fears among members of the public can be allayed as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>We had the spectacle last weekend of the ESB in a very cavalier manner admitting a mistake, having disposed of the waste in a very careless manner.  At the same time, or shortly afterwards, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment appeared on TV speaking of the alleged dumping while under the glare of cameras we saw people remove plastic bags from the area.  It is time for straight talking on the part not alone of the ESB, but of the Government as to what exactly they are going to do about this incident.</P>
      <P>All we know is there was a mistake. The ESB in a very smug manner seemed to feel this was the end of their duty.  I hope the Minister will pursue this matter with all vigour to ensure there will be no repetition in other areas and that the ESB and other bodies who may be engaged in similar activities are made fully aware of the regulations, national and international, laid down for disposal of such waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Portarlington is a small town with some 6,000 people.  There has been public <Col N="1954" /> knowledge in the area in the past few months, in view of the closure of the power plant, that the ESB intended to demolish it.  Prior to the demolition the body decided in their wisdom, rightly, that they would have to remove a thermal installation substance containing asbestos. The manner in which they attempted to do this has given rise to very grave public concern.  Not alone were these bags found in an open field, but the open field is on the outskirts of a town within yards of a housing estate.  Such a deposit must by all reasonable standards constitute an allurement for children in the area.  If children find sealed plastic containers in a field, then children by nature will attempt to discover what is in them. I am sure the Minister is well aware of the grave dangers of inhalation of asbestos.  I would like to know what exactly was in these 17 bags, and the exact nature of the asbestos fibres at present in the power station in Portarlington.  I concede that the substance itself is not dangerous but the concentration of such a substance to which the worker is exposed can give rise to serious problems, depending on the type of asbestos &mdash; white, brown or blue. I hope the Minister in his investigation will endeavour to find out the nature of the asbestos.  The hazards are quite clear. Experts are all in agreement that inhalation of blue asbestos gives rise to an incurable form of cancer.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the ESB treated this matter before the discovery gives rise to serious concern.  I understand they had sought tenders from various bodies for the disposal of this substance and as recently as 4 February a spokesman for the ESB was reported in a local newspaper as saying, and I quote: &ldquo;The job of removing and disposing the asbestos has already been put out to tender by the ESB, whose spokesman ... said that it was a `fairly routine' operation&rdquo;.  Lessons since then underline that the operation is far from routine and the routine manner in which the ESB handled this has shown their activities to be careless in the extreme.</P>
    <P>I hope the full rigors of the law will be brought to bear on those responsible.  The ESB spokesman went on to say, &ldquo;We are talking about the work beginning fairly <Col N="1955" /> quickly&rdquo;.  Unknown to the members of the public, the work had commenced and the fruits of such work were stumbled upon accidentally by parties over the weekend.</P>
    <P>Let me quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 4 February prior to the discovery:</P>
    <P>Materials containing asbestos used on the plant must be removed under the controlled conditions set out by statutory regulations the ESB said and the insulation material at Portarlington will be removed &ldquo;safely and in such a way that will not cause any risks to the community or the environment now and in the future&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The way the ESB followed through on that suggestion underlines how they felt about the serious problem.</P>
    <P>In may 1983 a BBC programme, &ldquo;Tomorrow's World&rdquo;, described the process involved in removing asbestos insulation from power stations.  Following that programme stringent regulations were introduced in the UK.  It was felt that the material could be disposed of safely provided stringent conditions were met.  Two of the conditions were that the material should be buried at least two metres deep and that all the waste material should be soaked in water and sealed in plastic bags.  The ESB, in the course of their statement following the discovery of the mistake, admitted that the waste disposal bags were specially designed heavy duty bags with &ldquo;Danger&rdquo; marked on them.  I hope the ministerial investigation will show that to be so.</P>
    <P>In any debate on the disposal of such waste from any town, particularly a town the size of Portarlington, it is important that the incident is not hyped up to such an extent that it will give rise to false claims by some people.  I am sure the Minister will agree that there are ways of disposing of the substance safely and that if the regulations are complied with such disposal should not give rise to concern. We run the risk of people going overboard on such an issue but it is important to stress that the ESB did not comply with the regulations.  It is precisely because of that that we have to give an assurance to the community that, to the best of our <Col N="1956" /> knowledge, this did not occur before and that all precautions will be taken in the future.</P>
    <P>I should like to put a number of questions to the Minister and I hope he will bear them in mind when ordering the inquiry.  Did negotiations take place with the Department of the Environment prior to the removal of the waste?  Was a licence or permission to dispose of the material sought or granted?  What type of asbestos was involved?  Was it white, blue or brown?  In order to allay public fears it is important that we should know the type of asbestos that was involved.  I should like to ask the Minister to give us details of the find.  How deep was the pit? How many were found?  Will the Minister give us details of the size and strength of those bags?  Had the asbestos been soaked in water?  Was specialist advice sought from the ESB and, if so, from whom was it sought?  Will it be possible to determine who removed the substance? Were outside specialist contractors engaged?</P>
    <P>In the course of their statement the ESB said they were in the process of putting the removal of this waste out to tender and I should like to know if contractors were involved or if ESB workers were concerned.  If ESB workers were involved in the operation I should like to know the circumstances under which they worked.  Were they wearing protective clothing?  Are they trained for such work?  Were they informed of the type of material they were removing? Will the Minister say how much thermal insulation is in the Portarlington plant and what proportion of it has been removed?  Will the Minister comment on a disturbing report published in the issue of <i>The Irish Press</i> of 6 February to the effect that red faced ESB officials would attempt to find out how a highly toxic substance was left exposed for months near a disused generating station?  How long was that substance left in the open? If <i>The Irish Press</i> report is accurate, and we are talking about the substance being left exposed for months, the Minister must be seriously concerned about the matter.  Will it be possible to obtain an assurance from the ESB that this is the first occasion such an incident occurred? <Col N="1957" /> What action does the Minister propose to take to ensure that the full rigours of the law are brought to bear on those responsible for the disposal of this waste? I understand that this evening there is a report of concern about the disposal of waste by another organisation in County Laois.  I should like to thank the Chair for giving me permission to raise this matter and to inform him that I am giving the remainder of my time to Deputy Hyland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Flanagan for sharing his time with me and to thank the Minister for the Environment for taking the debate.  As I see it there are two issues involved in the disposal of asbestos waste from the closed Portarlington ESB generating station. The first relates to the discovery of the waste close to the station.  That was alarming and it calls into question the responsibility of the ESB to dispose of toxic waste.  By their irresponsible action the ESB have shown a complete disregard for the people of Portarlington and the environment generally.  They have shown, in particular, a complete disregard for the health and welfare of the workers involved in the removal of that waste.  It is only right to assume from the irresponsible way that the material was dumped that the workers did not have any protection when removing the waste.  That is a serious matter because it is possible that the workers involved were not aware of the toxic nature of the substance they were moving.  It is possible that they did not know of the damaging effects it could have on their health.  We should be told if those involved in the work wore protective clothing.</P>
      <P>My second point related to the disposal of the remainder of the asbestos waste from that plant.  What plans have the ESB to dispose of such waste at other generating plants which will, within a certain period, be de-commissioned?  It is important that the Minister, and his Department, initiate safe procedures for the disposal of asbestos waste from all ESB plants and other concerns where asbestos is in use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to this incident Laois County Council had been involved in serious <Col N="1958" /> negotiations with the ESB concerning the safe disposal of the asbestos waste from the plant.  Our county manager in Laois, on behalf of the council, sought and was given positive assurance that the highest possible level of precautions and security would be implemented by the ESB or the people commissioned by the ESB to dispose of the waste.  Following the weekend episode we must seriously question the credibility of the ESB with regard to such assurances.  It is frightening that we could have such an occurence in the the town of Portarlington, a fairly large rural town with the usual population mix of old and young people. In the town there are very young people who because of their very inquisitive nature might stumble on a dump such as this and expose themselves to a very serious health hazzard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will begin by outlining the legal controls which exist in relation to the disposal of asbestos waste.  This waste is a toxic and dangerous waste for the purposes of the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous Waste) Regulations 1982.  Each county council and county borough corporation is responsible under the regulations for the planning, organisation and supervision of operations for the disposal of toxic and dangerous wastes in its area as well as for authorisation of the storage, treatment and deposit of such waste.  Accordingly, insistence on the specific measures which need to be taken to rectify the situation which has been found to exist at Portarlington power station is a matter for Laois County Council.  The Department will keep close touch with the county council in relation to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an offence to store or deposit asbestos waste other than in accordance with a permit issued by the local authority. A permit can include conditions governing a wide range of aspects including of course the methods of disposal and the precautions to be taken in storing or <Col N="1959" /> depositing waste.  Failure to comply with permit requirements or indeed any other requirement of the regulations is an offence which carries a penalty of up to £1,000 on summary conviction.  A prosecution for an offence under the regulations is a matter for the local authority.</P>
    <P>Asbestos waste, while it is dangerous, particularly in the form of dust or fibre is not a difficult waste to dispose of.  It does not burn and sophisicated incineration systems are not therefore needed.  Landfill, either on specialised sites or even in conjunction with domestic waste is the internationally recognised method of disposal and this is totally safe if certain requirements are met.  These requirements relate mainly to the safety and protection of personnel engaged in the waste disposal operations and to the security of the site from any risk of leaching to ground or surface waters.  The primary disposal requirements are that asbestos wastes be suitably packaged in strong double-walled plastic sacks or other suitable containers and that they be deposited at least two metres from the surface or flanks of the tiphead.  Guidelines on disposal have been given in various circular letters issued by my Department and local authorities have also been reminded on a number of occasions of the need to provide suitable landfill outlets for the asbestoes wastes arising in their areas.</P>
    <P>Asbestos was of course widely used for many years for its heat resistance and other properties and this usage was particularly extensive in large industrial plant such as power stations, chemical plants etc.  These would almost certainly be the major sources of asbestos waste particularly following removal of old lagging material.</P>
    <P>With regard to the facts of the Portarlington power station waste the ESB have issued a press statement accepting the blame for the unsatisfactory waste disposal situation and there would be little point in my berating them on this account.  There was negligence in some quarters and this must not be repeated. My Department have drawn the attention of the ESB management to the need <Col N="1960" /> to ensure that the necessary statutory obligations are fulfilled and essential precautions taken not only in relation to disposal of any asbestos wastes arising at Portarlington but for any other location or installation where a similar situation may arise.  As to the detailed investigation it is a matter for Laois County Council in the first instance to appraise the contention by the ESB that there was no risk to public health in this instance. I understand that the local authority's engineers were on the site on Monday morning investigating the quantities of waste involved and the state of the disposal site.  I am told EOLAS have been engaged to undertake a comprehensive examination of the site to establish whether surface or ground waters have been contaminated in any way and whether any airborne asbestos fibres are present.</P>
    <P>As to the final disposal of the Portarlington asbestos, I understand that the intention is to have it deposited on the local authority landfill site subject to approval and supervision by the county council and in accordance with the best international practice.  The proposed disposal at this tip has been examined and approved by EOLAS.  The State sponsored body involved on this occasion have a good environmental track record up to this incident, but we must not play down the seriousness of the incident.  It was a case of bad management and corporate responsibility has been expressed by the body.  I am satisfied that the coherent plan and planning being put in place between Laois County Council and the ESB will deal effectively with the remaining problems.  I am not underestimating the difficulty that has arisen nor am I minimising what the Deputies have said, but it is our intention to see that whatever needs to be done to satisfy the requirements of the community and the Department and the county council will be done in so far as the further disposal of any such asbestos waste is concerned.</P>

      <P>The education system also provides training opportunities for young persons wishing to be employed in the industry. CERT have had discussions recently with that Department regarding the provision of additional opportunities in the educational system.</P>

      <P>His insurance contribution record indicates that he would not be entitled to any payments under the sickness benefit payment schemes as he has no contributions paid or credited since 1984.

      <P>Payment was suspended on this claim pending the result of an examination by a medical referee as the person concerned had been found capable of work on two occasions on her previous claim.  The examination has been arranged for 14 February 1989 and her claim to benefit will be decided in the light of the medical referee's report.</P>

      <P>Statistics are not available which would enable the information requested by the Deputy to be given.  To determine the amounts of tax paid and repaid by way of interim refund in respect of the professional categories referred to would require an individual examination of all relevant returns furnished in 1987 and 1988 by the accountable persons as <Col N="1796" /> defined in section 14 (1) of the Finance Act, 1987, together with the relevant tax records relating to such refunds.  Such examinations could be carried out only at disproportionate cost.</P>
      <P>Applications for interim refunds of withholding tax, as provided for under section 19 of the Finance Act, 1987, are processed in the applicant's tax district. Valid interim refund claims of withholding tax are dealt with within one month of receipt and most such claims are dealt with within a shorter period. The provision of a separate office to process such claims is not therefore considered necessary.</P>
