      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The inaugural meeting of the National Heritage Council took place on 5 September 1988.  The council have held a further 14 meetings since then.  Eight of these meetings have been with interest organisations.  The council work through sub-committees and there have been a total of 20 sub-committee meetings so far.</P>
      <P>The council's priority at the moment is to prepare legislative proposals to establish a statutory Heritage Council and the meetings with interest organisations are an integral part of this process.  In addition the council have been considering a large number of applications for grant assistance to heritage projects, and to date have agreed to fund 14 projects.</P>
      <P>The National Heritage Council is funded at the moment from the balance of the £1 million national lottery allocation to heritage.  A statement concerning the council's future funding can be expected shortly.</P>

Has a full-time administrator/organiser been appointed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach, in view of the enactment of the Archives Act, 1986, the steps which have been taken by his Department to ensure the satisfactory establishment and operation of a National Archives facility; in respect of such a facility, the Department which have transferred suitable or eligible documents; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Archives Act, 1986, was brought into operation by me with effect from 1 June 1988.  Departments are, in consequence, obliged to transfer to the National Archives, two years after that date, the great bulk of their official records which are aged 30 years or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have more recently brought into operation, as provided for in section 19 (1) of the Act, detailed regulations to give effect to the provisions of the Act.  Those provisions have been drawn to the attention of all Ministers on a number of occasions.  I have ensured that one or <Col N="986" /> more officials of principal officer rank have been designated in each Department of State to ensure full compliance with the terms of the National Archives Act.  Two senior officials of my Department have been directed to ensure that Departments facilitate the timely transfer of their archival material to the National Archives.</P>
    <P>Additional archival storage space has been made available at 58-64 Lower Dominick Street and that will greatly facilitate the intake of archival material from Departments.</P>
    <P>I have allocated a once off lottery grant of £175,000 to facilitate the work of the National Archives.  The head of the National Archives and the National Archives Advisory Council are at present considering the projects to be subvented from that grant.</P>
    <P>Cabinet minutes and related files for the period up to 1954 have been transferred from my Department to the National Archives where public access is permitted.  In addition, all files held in my Department for the period up to 1960 have been prepared for transfer to the National Archives.  Those files number in excess of 10,000.</P>
    <P>I understand also that a considerable backlog of records has been transferred over the past two years to the National Archives from the Departments of Finance, Agriculture, Justice, Foreign Affairs and Education as well as the Office of Public Works.  National Archives personnel are also in touch with other Departments where the process of preparing archival material for transfer is still at a more preliminary stage.</P>
    <P>I am confident that satisfactory arrangements are in place to enable the National Archives to discharge their statutory functions effectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply.  Would he undertake to ensure that all other Government Departments that have not yet transferred relevant documentation would do so?  In particular would he ensure that the documentation in relation to Ireland's application for membership <Col N="987" /> of the European Community be properly filed and stored in the National Archives because I gather there is a possible problem in relation thereto?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has yet considered the recommendations of the special adviser (details supplied) to the board of trustees of the Chester Beatty Library; if he will arrange for the recommendations to be circulated to Members of Dáil Éireann; if he will outline the main findings; if any recommendations require legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The management report referred to which was commissioned by the trustees of the Chester Beatty Library will shortly be considered by the board of trustees.  I must emphasise that the board of trustees administer a trust established under the will of Sir Alfred Chester Beatty and any action arising from the management report or a decision to publish it is the direct responsibility of the board.  I am not aware of the contents of the report but I will be as helpful as possible to the board in relation to any proposals they may put to me in due course which concern my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan:</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that this House allows the expenditure of upwards of £200,000 per annum, which amounts to 80 per cent of the salaries of the gallery and library, would the Taoiseach not accept that it is important and incumbent on us to have more direct knowledge of and input into the affairs of the library?  Does the Taoiseach not think it is important that those Members of the House, particularly those who have an interest in the library, should have sight of the report in view of its very <Col N="988" /> important and fundamental recommendations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is fairly clear legally that it is a matter for the trustees, as the Deputy knows.  On the question of the report, I do not think there should be any difficulty about getting it for Deputies who are interested, but not until the trustees have considered it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's qualified assurance that perhaps Deputies will see the report.  Obviously I appreciate that the board must consider the report in the first instance, but I want to make the point to the Taoiseach that many of the recommendations from the adviser will of necessity involve legislation.Would the Taoiseach not agree that this a second reason his Department and Members of this House should have sight of the report in order to promote whatever legislative changes are needed, particularly with regard to the appointment from his Department of a full-time official to the board of trustees&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, as a lawyer, will understand that as we are dealing here with a trust and the administration of a trust, we have to be very careful to adhere to the terms of the trust.  The trust is quite specific that the administration of the library should be left to the trustees.  On the other hand it is a matter of very considerable public interest, and I suppose this collection could be regarded as a national asset, but I think the sensible way for us to proceed is on the basis of co-operative informality.</P>

Unfortunately getting it off the ground might involve some political difficulties and we had better not make any false starts until we get the mood right and a fair amount of consensus.</P>

The statement issued by the Minister on 15 March 1989 had not been prepared prior to my departure that morning to the United States to meet President Bush, members of his Administration and of Congress.  I did not, therefore, see the text.  I was aware of the Minister's intention to deal as fully as possible with the matter.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said he did not see the statement before it was issued.  In his statement to the Dáil the Taoiseach said &ldquo;Lest that particular allegation go by default&rdquo;&mdash; meaning the allegation about the £1 million fine &mdash;&rdquo;I should like to explain to the House that the Minister for Agriculture and Food will today be issuing a statement covering the matter&rdquo;.  As the Minister's statement did not, in fact, cover the matter, could I ask the Taoiseach if he gave instructions to the Minister as to precisely what should be in the statement and specifically that it should cover the matter of the £1 million fine?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>That did not arise.  The Minister is responsible for statements affecting his Department.  As I have explained in my reply the statement had not even started to be prepared before I left to go to the United States on official business.  Therefore, I did not see it.  It is the responsibility of the Minister to issue any statements which govern his Department because he has access to all the facts.  I was endeavouring to be helpful to the Dáil by indicating that the Minister would make a statement on the matter that day.  Now it appears I am to be attacked in the Dáil because I tried to be helpful and because I did not see a statement because I went to America.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the statement which was finally issued at about 6 o'clock that evening was inadequate and misleading, to put it at its mildest, did the Taoiseach not feel that it was necessary that an appropriate full statement would be made which <Col N="994" /> would give the facts in relation to the matter in question and set them out fully and does he not feel that at this stage either the Minister, or somebody on behalf of the Government, should make a full statement on the matter which would not have the features of the statement made by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>Given that within 20 minutes or half an hour of the statement being eventually released by the Minister for Agriculture, I had established that there were three material facts which were not in the statement and the Minister confirmed this on the telephone, namely, that the matter had been referred to the Garda authorities because of irregularities, which was not in the statement; secondly, that the figures indicated by Deputy Desmond in the morning were indicative of the figures and that the Minister was unable to clarify the status of the Garda investigation, may I ask the Taoiseach as the head of Government and as the person ultimately responsible for the actions of his Minister if he felt or if he now believes that the statement given that day in his absence was an adequate statement in the circumstances?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated that it was the intention of the Minister to give a fully adequate statement.  The Deputy will understand &mdash; and the Minister will deal with this later in reply to questions &mdash; that in matters of this kind there is a well established practice and procedure of confidentiality with regard to the affairs of individuals and private business firms.  The Minister had to have regard to these matters.

      <P>I do not wish to go into any debate on the matter.  I am simply trying to establish the correct response to the question which I have set down.  In that regard following on what the Taoiseach said in the Dáil that the statement would deal with that particular matter which related to the £1 million fine, I am asking the Taoiseach if he had some discussion with the Minister before he left indicating what particular matters should be contained in the statement, particularly the matter which had been referred to in the Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have any particular discussion with the Minister on the matter except that I understood from him that he was making a statement which would be as adequate as possible.  I can tell the House that when I was speaking in the Dáil that morning I was not aware of the letter which had issued on 19 January.That letter would not normally be brought to my attention because the administration of these schemes is entirely an administrative matter in the Department of Agriculture.  The general situation with all Ministers is that these matters are left to be dealt with by the departmental officials, by the customs authorities and by the Garda if necessary. There is certainly no intervention by Ministers in any of these details nor is there any intervention or even knowledge of these details by the Taoiseach or his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, as I left for the <Col N="996" /> United States almost immediately after announcing to the Dáil that the Minister would make a statement, and was not back for some days, I think the Deputy could infer from that correctly that there was no Cabinet meeting about that matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to point out to the Deputy that it is not the duty of the Government to bring these irregularities to the attention of the Commission or the Court of Auditors or anybody else.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>In addition to the 1992 related activities of individual Ministers, the EUROPEN Bureau will undertake three main initiatives in 1989:</P>
      <P>(i) an extensive market research survey to gauge the extent of the preparedness of Irish industry and services businesses for the Single European Market and, in particular, for the intensification of competition.  The results should be available by May;</P>
      <P>(ii) the publication, with the Irish Business Bureau, Brussels, of a monthly news and information report on progress towards the completion of the internal market.  This will appear in <i>Business and Finance</i> and <i>Irish Business</i>; the first edition was published on 30 March;</P>
      <P>(iii) the commissioning in consultation with the Sectoral Development Committee of a series of analyses of the likely implications of the single market on a broad range of economic sectors of the Irish economy.  The studies will be published for the guidance of the sectors concerned.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach will participate in the campaign as appropriate.</P>
      <P>To date, the reports and comments which I have received confirm the Government's view that the campaign has been successful in arousing the awareness of the business community to the importance of proper preparation for the single market.  The market research survey will help us to measure the situation more accurately and give us guidance on the future activities that should be undertaken by the EUROPEN campaign.When the results are available, I will consider whether a report as suggested by Deputy Quinn, should be published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that comprehensive reply, let me ask three supplementary questions.  First, is the Minister of State aware that at a recent CII economic conference held in a Dublin hotel a number of very senior and prominent businessmen admitted that very few Irish companies had responded to the exhortation of the Taoiseach to establish a 1992 committee with a person responsible for monitoring that development within their own organisations?  Secondly, do the Government propose to follow the Taoiseach's advice and ask each of the Departments to establish the kind of committee that he told everybody else to establish?  Thirdly, does the Taoiseach propose to give to workers in those companies which fail to prepare for 1992 the right to undertake studies to ensure the safeguarding of their jobs, even if the proprietors and employers of the firms are foolhardy enough to ignore it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is already a committee of senior civil servants at assistant secretary and principal officer level who monitor the activities of the 1992 campaign on a monthly basis. Secondly, I am aware of the meeting to which the Deputy refers.  The EUROPEN campaign for the first six months was devoted to awareness of 1992 and what it involves for the various industries and companies.  The various State companies are now endeavouring, working on an individual basis company by company, to try to ensure that each company appoint, as Deputy Quinn says, a 1992 person within the company.  Each of the State companies has already done that.  All the Ministers, at the various seminars and conference held around the country, exhorted employers to ensure, first, that they were prepared, had done the necessary homework required and, secondly, that they kept their employees informed of all the various changes, extensive in some instances, that may have to take place for the Single European Market.</P>

      <P>I have more or less answered the first part of the question.The first six months of the campaign were basically devoted by various Ministers to awareness of the implications of 1992 for Irish industry and businesses throughout the country.  Each Minister has been asked as far as possible to involve the Oireachtas joint committee. However, the committee about which I spoke with regard to Deputy Quinn, who monitor the 1992 campaign, have been considering, now that the campaign has moved into a more intensive sphere, that particular attention be paid to what role the Oireachtas joint committee should play.</P>

      <P>The words that &ldquo;particular attention&rdquo; be given to the role of the committee are a direct repetition of what was said here almost a year ago. Why has there been no movement whatsoever to debate any of the ten major reports of the Oireachtas joint committee?That committee, as was pointed out in this House and as was indicated to the Minister of State when she came to address them, consider that these reports, all of which have to do with the <Col N="1009" /> approach of 1992, are extremely important.Could the Minister of State, on behalf of the Government, give the reason that the reports of that committee have been ignored?</P>

      <P>As a result of a meeting I had with the Oireachtas joint committee, as Deputy Hussey knows I raised this matter with the Government Chief Whip who had discussions with the other party Whips in relation to that matter.  I have ascertained now that the Government Whip has offered to make time available on Tuesdays and Wednesdays to debate reports from all Oireachtas committees, which would include the Deputy's committee.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence resulting from the disclosures of the RTE &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme of 4 April 1989, whether an urgent review of the overall situation in the Defence Force is required; whether any such review should include (a) the low level of morale, (b) pay and allowances, (c) conditions of service and hours of work, (d) equipment and transport, (e) Air Corps, service, equipment, recruitment and training and (f) a representative body; and if he has satisfied himself that pay, allowances and equipment are adequate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>The particular television programme to which the Deputy refers failed completely to present a balanced or accurate picture of the Defence Force.  As the Deputy is already aware, the Government established a committee to review the pay, allowances and conditions of the Defence Force in June of last year.  I would point out that this was the first such review for ten years.  I am satisfied that the committee's recommendations represented a reasonable response to the case for improved pay and conditions in the Defence Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully suggest that the impression given to the serving members of the Defence Force and the general public as a result of the RTE programme was that the Minister was not properly briefed about Army affairs and was not <i>au fait</i> with what was happening in the Defence Force.  He completely failed to reply to some very important questions raised in the programme.  In view of the facts that emerged from the programme, will the Minister consider employing an arbiter to examine the matter &mdash; this applies in the public service when there is a dispute regarding wages and conditions of employment?  Perhaps he will also consider allowing the EmployerLabour Conference to investigate the matter?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The committee appointed by the Government in June 1988 as a result of my recommendation &mdash; and not at the behest of any pressure group &mdash; looked at pay, conditions and allowances of the Defence Force.  I am satisfied that the recommendations of the committee have been implemented in full by the Government <Col N="1017" /> and that the problem has been satisfactorily sorted out.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bell should appreciate that the Chair has an obligation to dispose of all the Priority Questions within the prescribed time of a quarter of an hour and I am appealing for brevity and co-operation from the Deputies who tabled questions.  I am sure Deputies will co-operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to be brief.  The statement which the Minister has consistently made is effectively causing the problem within the Defence Force. There is no acceptance by him or the Government that there is a problem.  Will he accept, on the basis of the evidence presented on &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; that equipment and transport are obsolete in many areas?  Will he also accept that pay is low and that members are not compensated for the hours they work?  Will he accept that there is a very low level of morale within the Defence Force?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The problems within the Defence Force are caused by misinformation and mis-state-ments made by the Deputy and others who are not <i>au fait</i> with the facts.  I do not accept any of the allegations outlined by Deputy Bell which are without foundation.I assure Deputy Bell that I am totally in touch with the situation and it is he and others making the allegations who are out of touch because they are using the Defence Force as a political football.  It ill behoves them to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I propose to take Question Nos. 20, 24, 28, 34, 42 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the substance of the question, I wish to say that I know that the House will wish to join with me in expressing the sympathy of the House to the families and friends of Corporal Fintan Heneghan, Private Mannix Armstrong, Private Michael McNeela and Private Thomas Walsh on their tragic loss, and in acknowledging the supreme sacrifice made by these men in the cause of peace with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.</P>
      <P>Private McNeela died on 24 February 1989 when his checkpoint at Haddathah village came under fire from Israeli-backed militia.  On 21 March 1989 Corporal Heneghan, Private Walsh and Private Armstrong died near the village of Brashit as a result of the explosion of a mine beneath their truck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the most recent tragedy, I asked the Chief-of-Staff to visit Lebanon to assess the situation there and to liaise with the United Nations authorities in their investigations.  As the House will be aware, the Secretary-General of the United Nations has been given responsibility by the Security Council for the day-to-day administration of the Force and the Secretary-General, in turn, has appointed a Force Commander who has <Col N="1020" /> responsibility for the operational deployment of the Force.  The detailed investigation being conducted by the United Nations is not yet complete and so far it has not been possible to establish who was responsible for placing the explosive device or against whom it was directed.</P>
    <P>In the course of his visit the Chief-of-Staff met UN Under Secretary-General Marrack Goulding, UNIFIL Force Commander Lt. Gen. Wahlgren, Irish battalion personnel and local leaders. Security in the Irish area of operations was examined and a number of measures to enhance the safety of Irish personnel were agreed, including the provision of specialist in mine discoveries and bomb disposal, certain engineering works and the closure of a high risk post.</P>
    <P>In general the safety of Irish troops serving with UNIFIL is kept under constant review.  Troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of training designed to help them carry out their peacekeeping mission and to provide for their protection. They are issued with a modern range of weapons and equipment and operational procedures are geared to provide maximum safety for our troops consistent with the carrying out of their mission.  I am satisfied that the training, equipment and procedures provide adequately for the protection of our personnel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Minister, I wish to extend on behalf of my party our sympathy to the families of those gallant heroes who died in Lebanon.  I tabled this question so as to ensure that such a thing will not happen again and that at the least the precautions that can be taken are taken.  I am not satisfied with the Minister's reply.  I have made inquiries and I wonder if the Minister can tell the House if the authorities out there <Col N="1021" /> at this stage have the necessary equipment to monitor and identify mines that may have been laid in that territory?  It is very important, particularly for the members of the Defence Force, that we as a nation genuinely believe that everything that can be done to prevent such terrible disasters has been done.  Can the Minister tell us if such equipment is now in use or is it the case that it has not even been thought about at this stage?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Such equipment is in use.  I wish to repeat that the safety of Irish personnel serving with UNIFIL is kept under constant review. Troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of training.They are issued with a modern range of weapons and equipment.  In addition, physical security in the form of equipment and engineering works at posts and checkpoints is steadily being improved. The Deputy will agree that military service with UNIFIL carries an inherent risk but I can assure him and the House that all necessary precautions are taken.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence the reason the members of the Army School of Music have fared so poorly from the recent pay and conditions awards; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that their new group status is lower, relative to other groupings, than before 31 December 1988; if his attention has further been drawn to the importance of the Army bands at State, military and civilian engagements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I do not accept the implication in the question. Members of the Army School of Music qualify on the same basis as other military personnel for the increases in line pay, military service allowance and other allowances which were announced by the Government in December 1988.</P>
      <P>As regards the technician pay aspect, the inter-departmental committee on Defence Forces pay, allowances and conditions recommended in their report to Government a complete restructuring of the groups of trades and skills together with increases in the rates of technician pay.  The creation of six new technician groups involved extensive rearrangement of the three former groups of trades and skills and the inclusion of new designations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases in technician pay relevant to members of the Army School of Music are: £1.84 to £3.06 per week; £6.96 to £10.20 per week and £13.11 to £30.60 <Col N="1026" /> per week depending on the type of work undertaken.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister or the Government consider paying the entire special claim to the members of the Defence Forces on 1 July and not the 40 per cent which amounts to £6.2 million?  It is only fair and reasonable that the Government should pay it now and defuse the whole situation.</P>

My question was an attempt to draw his attention to the unanimous decision of the European Parliament recommending Governments to establish such associations.  Has he considered that report and does he accept the finding which states that there is no legal reason against such an association being formed in this country?  It appears to the European Parliament investigators that the only reason such an association is not being formed is due to outmoded military practices.  Can the Minister comment in that regard?</P>

It was noted by the Council of Ministers of <Col N="1028" /> the EC at their meeting in May 1984. Nothing further has been heard of the matter.  Certain European countries do permit the existence of representative bodies within their armed forces.  In these countries national service on conscription is generally used as a means of recruitment.There is no direct comparison in such cases with the position in Ireland which maintains a voluntary Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>When I met the oil companies on 3 March I conveyed to them the Government's concern about the serious implications of an increase in the price of petrol and diesel.  The terms of reference will be to hold an inquiry into the conditions which obtain in regard to the supply and distribution of petrol and auto diesel in the State, including the implications for prices of gifts and promotional schemes, the effect on prices of the operation of the INPC and the operation of the Restrictive Practices Motor Spirit and Motor Vehicle Lubricating Oil Order, 1981.  This order deals <i>inter alia</i> with company ownership of retail petrol stations. The commission has already sought submissions.It is intended that the commission will submit its recommendations by the summer and these will be given immediate attention by the Government. The Government are reluctant to intervene in the market but did so on this occasion because the increases could undermine the strenuous efforts being made by all sectors of the economy to hold down inflation.  We recognise that world market prices are increasing.  For this reason I undertook when I met with the oil companies on 31 March that the situation would be continually monitored in consultation with them.  As part of this process I am meeting the companies tomorrow.  I am shocked that in the meantime, and knowing of the meeting, companies should have made threats against the Irish people to cease to import supplies.  This is not an approach that the Government can tolerate.  Against the background of world prices everything that can be done within the Irish oil industry to reduce cost must be done and I will be putting this point forcefully to the companies.  Beyond that I do not want to <Col N="1031" /> go pending my meeting with the companies tomorrow.</P>

Could he clarify to what extent they are fulfilling their obligations?  Second, could the Minister clarify to the House what the cost to the consumer is of these stamps and marketing gimmicks used by the oil companies?Third, could the Minister clarify his statement made yesterday on the radio in relation to a possible alternative retail distribution by the INPC or by the Government?  Has the Minister some plans in mind in that respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the question of oil stocks, there are other Private Notice Questions being asked of the Minister for Energy, and I have no doubt he will reply in relation to that.  We will be discussing the matter of stamps and so on with the companies.  There are estimates that they cost between 5p and 6p per gallon and are used as marketing tools by the companies against one another.  It is more important at this stage, in the interests of the economy, in the interests of keeping down inflation and in the interests of the consumer, that prices be reduced rather than that these marketing tools continue to be used.</P>

      <P>One of the disturbing aspects of the announcements and threats <Col N="1032" /> of the oil companies in the last number of days has been their strength in the distribution area.  I will be looking at this matter very carefully because we cannot have a situation where the national interest will be interfered with as a result of attempts by the oil majors operating within the Irish market to hold the country to ransom because of their distribution control.  Distribution is a possible role for the INPC to be looked at favourably in the future.  I thank the Deputies for their support in relation to measures that can be taken in the future against those who do not co-operate at this critical time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the Private Notice Questions submitted by Deputies Spring, De Rossa and P. O'Malley together.  Deputies will be aware that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has announced that he will be meeting representatives of the oil companies tomorrow and accordingly it <Col N="1034" /> would not be appropriate for me to outline at this stage the steps the Government propose to take to ensure continuity of petrol supplies.  Similarly, it would not serve any purpose at this point in time to speculate on the implications of a prolonged dispute over pricing issues on petrol supplies until the nature of any problem that might arise in the future can be further assessed.  In a statement issued earlier this week I described the decision by certain oil companies to suspend importing petrol stocks as unnecessary and regrettable.  I pointed out, and I want to re-emphasise it here today, that stocks are adequate for the foreseeable future and that supplies of auto diesel, gas oil, home heating oil and fuel oil are not affected by the oil companies' decision. There is therefore no immediate or pending cause for concern on supplies.  Furthermore there is no international shortage of crude oil products and Whitegate refinery will continue to supply the Irish market.</P>

This problem however is not in that area.  I want to emphasise that there are no shortages and that the facilities are available from the point of view of shipping, importing and operations at Whitegate to ensure that no such difficulties will arise.  It would be totally inappropriate for me to outline the features of a plan which I and the Government would put into effect in the event of this situation deteriorating just 24 hours before the Minister for Industry and Commerce meets with the representatives of the oil companies.</P>

Would the Minister agree that part of the reason the oil companies have this power over us is that we only refine 50 per cent of our oil needs through Whitegate and that part of the Government's long-term response at least to this situation would be the siting of a second refinery which would ensure that we could refine 100 per cent of our oil needs?  Will the Minister accept also that there is urgent need for the INPC to establish an independent network of distribution independent of the multi-national oil companies as a further step in preventing us being held to ransom and our economy brought under assault by these companies?</P>

In the event of the oil companies maintaining the attitude they have adopted in the last few days, and if we are forced to take supply from Whitegate because it is not coming from any other source, what contingency plans, if any, has the Minister for the distribution of that product to the retail outlets which is where the major problem would arise in relation to taking supplies from Whitegate?</P>

      <P>I will be very brief.  I can understand the Minister being reticent in relation to giving out information on the day prior to meeting the oil companies, but can I take it from what he is saying that he is assuring the House that we satisfy the EC requirement of a reserve of 90 day stocks of petrol?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that he does not want to speculate on what may have to be done if the situation changes.  Surely he must accept that the situation has already changed by the mere fact that these companies have made a threat against the State.  We must take urgent steps to extricate ourselves from the position where these people control the distribution network and the importation of virtually half our supplies of petrol.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated already that should the situation deteriorate we are in a position to put in place features of a plan which would ensure that the commercial and industrial life of this country, which depends on the consistent flow of this product, is not affected.  I have no wish to add to that at the moment.  I do not think this House should be debating five Private Notice Questions <Col N="1037" /> in relation to this matter just hours before a very crucial meeting takes place.</P>

I have no objection generally to restriction on speeches &mdash; in fact, I think it helps the efficiency of the House to do so &mdash; but the continued restriction of the time allotted for the main spokesperson of The Workers' Party on major <Col N="1185" /> issues in this House is unacceptable.

You had the goodness to agree with that.  Then, Sir, you delivered what I think you must have considered to be the <i>coup de grâce</i> by saying to me that they do not come within the terms of Standing Order 51.

      <P>On the Order of Business I would like to raise three matters with you.  First, I seek to raise on the Adjournment the payment of almost £2 million by Dublin County Council by way of compensation to a builder.  Second, in the context of today's debate, which is to continue into tomorrow, the Taoiseach on the Order of Business prior to the Easter recess indicated that he would facilitate Members of the House by ensuring that we had any relevant information necessary for this debate.  Third, I tabled a Dáil question to the Taoiseach today asking whether the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs had received a copy of the Dublin consultants document for structural funds.  That question has been transferred, for some reason which I do not understand, to the Minister for Finance and will not now come up for answer until 2 May.  I appreciate, Sir, you have no <Col N="1194" /> control over the Taoiseach transferring questions.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  The question I want to ask the Taoiseach on the Order of Business so as to facilitate Members of this House to have as much information as possible in contributing to this debate, is whether he can confirm that it is the case that the Dublin consultants document relating to structural funds had not been completed by the time the national plan went to Europe and, secondly, can he indicate whether it has yet been completed&mdash;</P>

If he has not so satisfied himself is he making provision to introduce a short piece of legislation to deal with this firm which has four plants in this country and who feel they are jeopardised by the Government's failure to introduce legislation to extend the life of the patents which they currently using in this country?</P>

    <Title>National Development Plan 1989-1993: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Government's National Development Plan 1989-1993.</P>
      <P>This National Development Plan is primarily a programme for investment in the country's economic and social structures.It is a detailed multi-annual development budget designed to modernise the economy, expand our productive capacity and promote stronger growth with higher employment and improved social equity.  It is an integrated plan comprising inter-related programmes which will be implemented in every region of the country and every sector of the economy.  The programme is a blueprint for economic and social progress over the next five years.  First, the plan outlines the macro-economic framework within which it will be implemented over a five-year period.</P>
      <P>Secondly, it sets out the amount to be invested annually in the principal sectors of the economy and in each region. Thirdly, it provides outlines of the programmes for each sector and the seven sub-regions.  Fourthly, it indicates the manner in which the plan will be implemented with estimates of the employment to be generated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan has its origins in the decision <Col N="1202" /> of the European Council held in Brussels on 12-13 February 1988 when it was decided that as part of the Delors plan for the relaunch of the Community and the completion of the Single European Market the amount of the Structural Funds for the less developed regions should be doubled and a special effort made for the least prosperous.  This means, in effect, that Ireland as a whole, will be a beneficiary of this increase as one of these regions.</P>
    <P>Technically, this plan, therefore, is a framework to enable us to take up our share of the increased resources of the Structural Funds, as these funds in future will be allocated primarily on the basis of programmes.  The Government, however, decided to avail of the opportunity to formulate a comprehensive investment plan which enables us to utilise the additional resources in a coherent integrated way as part of a major economic development programme.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan should be seen also as an extension of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, consistent with its objectives and taking us further along the road of economic and social development.  EC assisted development programmes will help to increase productive efficiency, improve communications with our principal markets, overcome the competitive disadvantages of peripheral location, broaden innovative capacity, enhance the quality of management and the skills of our workforce.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has laid the foundations of a sounder and more prosperous economy by bringing about marked improvements in key areas such as the public finances, interest rates and inflation, the balance of trade and payments, and competitiveness.  This plan proposes to build on this progress with the assistance of the policy of cohesion adopted by the European Community.</P>
    <P>The availability of the increased resources resulting from the doubling of the EC Structural Funds by 1993 represents a unique opportunity for Ireland to raise the whole country as a region of <Col N="1203" /> the Community on to a new plane of development and to overcome the economic and social deficiencies that are holding us back.  The under-utilisation of our resources, including the talents and abilities of our people, is the biggest challenge we face today, a challenge that goes to the heart of our future.  It is imperative that we succeed in raising permanently and significantly the level of economic activity to sustain more employment and support better living standards.  We have proven our capacity to master modern industrial and service technologies and to sell our products and services in the markets of the world.  To improve our performance as a modern economy and reach the standards we desire, it is urgently necessary to eliminate structural defects and bring the economic infrastructure up to the highest possible standard of efficiency.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal briefly with the situation in the Community to which our national plan will relate.  This Government have been active and effective in ensuring for this country the full benefits of our membership and in protecting our national interests in the Community.  The success of our efforts is due to consistent and determined political effort and negotiation to achieve the objectives we set and pursued.  The decision to double the Structural Funds came after intense negotiation at the European Council in Brussels in February 1988 and the inclusion of this country as one of those to benefit especially from the increase was of critical significance for us and opened the way for the launching of this plan.</P>
    <P>The reform of the Community's Structural Funds in the context of the completion of the internal market has been finalised, and the new system is now fully operational since 1 January 1989.  The doubling of the resources of the Structural Funds for the less-developed regions is accompanied by a commitment to a special effort for the least prosperous of these regions which, at my insistence, includes this country, and a provision that for these regions the rate <Col N="1204" /> of assistance from the funds can be up to 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>We were also successful in obtaining agreement that certain infrastructural projects with private sector funding can be eligible for assistance &mdash; a provision which will be particularly helpful to us given our budgetary constraints and, through partnership arrangements with the private sector, ensure that infrastructural projects can proceed much more rapidly than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    <P>The relaunching of the European Community and the new impetus toward integration has given the Community a new momentum of confidence.  Economic growth last year was the strongest since the end of the seventies, the increase in investment the highest for over two decades.  The inflation rate has been reduced to an average of 3.5 per cent. Employment at the Community level is now increasing, though the level of unemployment unfortunately remains high at 11 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Community intend to build on this progress through the full implementation of the range of policies provided for in the Single European Act, completing the Internal Market and its social dimension, promoting economic and social cohesion, advancing research and technological development and protecting and improving the environment.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of completing the Internal Market is to lift the performance of the Community on to a higher growth path.  The Cecchini Report suggested that the benefits resulting from increased competition, exploitation of the economies of scale and better use of resources could provide additional growth of around 4 per cent over a five to six year time span.  This means that the average growth should be increased from 2.5 per cent a year to at least 3 per cent.  Such a result would represent a further step in the strengthening and development of the Community, improve its world trading position and provide substantial rewards in terms of greater prosperity <Col N="1205" /> and jobs.  Particular attention and vigilance will be necessary to ensure that these benefits are shared equitably among all the member states and throughout the regions of the Community.</P>
    <P>Success in achieving the Community's objectives will require the support of the public and the social partners.  This in turn depends on a commitment to a social dimension directed at ensuring that all Community citizens benefit and that there is a progressive improvement in social standards and working conditions throughout the Community.  This concept is entirely in line with the approach which we adopted as an integral part of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which relies for its success on the participation and co-operation of the social partners.  The increase in the Structural Funds is designed to promote a more equitable sharing of the benefits and the opportunities between the centre and the periphery.</P>
    <P>Deeply conscious of the crucial importance of this plan as a vehicle for utilising the increased Structural Fund resources to improve the performance of the Irish economy over the next five years, the Government made careful and effective arrangements for the preparation of this plan.</P>
    <P>First, we acknowledged the vital role to be played by the Commission both in approving the plan to be submitted and in its subsequent implementation.  It was clear to us that full and close co-operation with the Commission was essential in order to make a success of our preparation for the completion of the Single Market and, in particular, to ensure that the plan meets all the necessary requirements.We arranged, therefore, at an early stage to establish the closest possible degree of co-operation and co-ordination between the Government and the Commission and the administration here and the services of the Commission.</P>
    <P>For this purpose, on the Commission side, a task force of relevant Commissioners and Directors-General was established, headed by President Delors. On our side, this was paralleled by a <Col N="1206" /> Committee of Ministers and Secretaries over which I preside.  The objective is to ensure that the Government's policies and Community policies are fully co-ordinated on an ongoing basis and that as the plan took shape it would be with the full knowledge and understanding of the Commission at every stage.  We developed what was, in fact, a novel partnership between us and this co-ordination and co-operation will continue to ensure the successful implementation of our Irish Plan.</P>
    <P>Since Ireland is one region for the purposes of the Structural Funds, the plan covers the State as a whole and this is in accordance with the Community's regulations.</P>
    <P>In preparing the plan, the Government carried out an unprecedented level of consultation at both national and local, regional level.  At national level, the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> were consulted, as was a wide spectrum of business, financial and vocational interests.</P>
    <P>To make the plan as responsive as possible to the needs and requirements of the different areas of the country a completely new system of consultation with local interests was put in place.  The country was divided into seven sub-regions.In each region we established an advisory group and a working group to prepare an outline plan giving the needs and priorities of the subregions.</P>
    <P>This two-tier system and the work undertaken in this way provided a valuable and vital input into the formulation of the overall National Plan and the related plans for the subregions which, in effect, make up the totality of the National Plan.  I would like to thank all the members of both the advisory groups and the working groups in each of the seven subregions for their very important and valuable contribution.  The plan sets out how the level of national expenditure is broken down into the expenditure, under corresponding headings, in each of the subregions.  This is an important and significant innovation.  Indeed, it is the first time that any National Development <Col N="1207" /> Plan as such has had a subregional basis and content.  The National Plan, therefore, is integrated both vertically and horizontally.  Each sector of the economy is inter-related with the other sectors and the subregions are integrated with the National Plan.</P>
    <P>In addition to these structures which were put in place to facilitate and streamline the planning process, there was a constant flow of detailed information and projections between each of the Ministers involved and their Departments with the corresponding Commissioners' offices in Brussels.  This latter process was primarily concerned with the preparation of the individual operational programmes for each of the different sectors.  All of these operational programmes must also be submitted to the Commission for approval.</P>
    <P>An additional separate plan will be submitted by June next, in accordance with the special time schedule provided in the regulations, in relation to what are called Objectives 3 and 4.  These relate to action to combat long term unemployment and to facilitate the occupational integration of young people.</P>
    <P>The plan has been published in its entirety, and is now being debated for three days in the Dáil.  As I indicated at the launch of the plan, we welcome constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement.  While the fundamental provisions must be broadly adhered to, the Government will be flexible with regard to detailed aspects of particular sectors and the timing and implementation of particular projects.  We remain open to submissions and proposals.  I would appeal, however, for a sense of realism and a regard for the national interest because that is the basis on which the Government undertook this major exercise.</P>
    <P>I regret that some Members of the Opposition Parties have seen fit to knock the plan and make statements about it which are in no way related to what is actually in the plan and what it aims to achieve.  I would like to suggest to them that they are very much out of touch with <Col N="1208" /> the widespread public approval there is for the Government's achievement in formulating this powerful, positive plan for economic and social progress.  Their statements are in stark contrast with the favourable reception by the business and financial community and by the professional commentators.  They are also at complete variance with the favourable reception of the plan by the Commission and the manner in which the work and the approach of the Irish Government were complimented at all levels.</P>
    <P>This is the most important financial submission ever made by Ireland to the Community.  It incorporates major elements of public expenditure and budgetary provisions over the next five years.  It is the responsibility of the Government to make these financial decisions.  The presentation of a coherent and comprehensive plan on time was vital.  The Government have fully discharged that responsibility.</P>
    <P>Ireland submitted this National Development Plan to the Commission on 22 March, comfortably within the legal deadline of 31 March and indeed, well ahead of all other member states, except Portugal.  Our systematic and comprehensive approach of continued assessment and co-ordination at national level, complemented by the involvement from the outset of the subregional groups, has not been matched in any other Objective I member state.  I draw your attention to this aspect to underline again the seriousness with which we undertook the regional input and our determination to produce a plan which would address the particular needs and aspirations of the different regions of the country.</P>
    <P>The document which ensued is the National Development Plan which we have before us today &mdash; the fruit of careful, logical and systematic endeavour over the past 12 months.  For those who persist in criticising that achievement, I would like to point out that Ireland's performance in regional consultation compares more than favourably with that of other member states.</P>
    <P>The formulation of this National Plan was a very complex exercise.  It involves <Col N="1209" /> intricate, interlocking calculations and projections, not just combining seven subregions into a coherent whole but also projecting the whole process over the five years ahead.  This could only be done centrally.  The same applies to its implementation, which can only be undertaken through national mechanisms.Anything else would result in administrative chaos.  Of course a major part of the actual operation of the programmes will be regional and local and there will be the fullest possible level of consultation and discussion on this aspect.</P>
    <P>A vitally important aspect of this National Development Plan is the manner in which the expenditures envisaged in the plan are fitted into and made compatible with the strict budgetary discipline being pursued under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>The economic recovery policies that we have implemented since March 1987 have the approval of the European Commission.Indeed, the recent annual report of the EC stresses the continuing importance of the process of budgetary adjustment, stabilisation of the debt-GDP ratio, a continuing reduction in the Exchequer borrowing requirement through cuts in public expenditure, with a greater emphasis on current than capital. The degree of improvement in the public finances achieved to date has been remarkable.  The debt-GNP ratio has been stabilised ahead of schedule as a result of renewed economic growth and associated revenue buoyancy and the reduction of Government expenditure by 9 per cent of GNP since 1986.  But further adjustment will be necessary, even after this year's targets have been achieved.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the level of borrowing achieved in recent years and the improvement in the rate of growth in the economy have done no more than ease the problems of budget management to a limited degree.  The recognition in the programme that &ldquo;a fiscal policy which faces the financial realities is the key to putting the economy back on the path to long-term sustained growth&rdquo; must still remain <Col N="1210" /> a major guiding principle for policy over the next five years.</P>
    <P>The size of the Exchequer deficit is the primary determinant, within our control, of the environment for investment and sustained economic growth &mdash; through its impact on financial markets and interest rates and on stability and confidence generally.For this reason, and in view of the scale of outstanding debt and the large amount of resources this pre-empts, it is necessary to proceed beyond stabilisation over the medium term.</P>
    <P>At the same time, there is good reason to believe that, with a positive response to the development programmes set out in this plan, the economy can move reasonably quickly on to a higher growth path.  Growth in the Irish economy over the period to the mid-nineties could exceed the average of the EC, given continuing implementation of a responsible domestic policy strategy.  Key elements in this will be the maintenance of a good management labour relations climate, low inflation and interest rates, a stable rate of exchange and a constant emphasis on competitiveness.  Given a consistent adherence to the right policies and attitudes we could prudently anticipate real economic growth of the order of 3.5 per cent annually over the medium term, with the possibility of doing better than the EC average.</P>
    <P>Such growth should lead to a modest reduction in the burden of debt over the coming few years.  However, to fully reestablish sustainable growth in output and employment a more substantial reduction in the real level of debt is clearly necessary.</P>
    <P>The progress made under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the major prospects of further progress under this plan, however, could be endangered if we allow inflation to rise significantly again in relation to our trading partners. This danger of a resurgence of inflation is a cause of concern in a number of developed countries which have suffered recent setbacks in this regard and it has recently started to creep up again here. There are some outside inflationary pressures but the increases in our rate <Col N="1211" /> have been to an extent generated here at home.  It has taken us seven years to get inflation down from 21 per cent to 2 per cent, and we cannot afford to let go of the comparative advantage our low rate provides.  This means two things.  First, there is an absolute necessity for continued income restraint, and I mean incomes in the widest sense.  Special pay claims in the public service or elsewhere can have serious implications.  No case, however exceptional and however well founded, can be treated in isolation.  The public should always keep in mind that every pay increase above the norm ultimately affects them in higher prices.  The consumer and especially the housewife can be very effective in keeping prices down by vigilance, questioning and resisting unwarranted increases.  Prices can be kept down by public awareness and pressure, by greater efficiency in business, by keen competition, by doing away with wasteful gifts and vouchers and finally by Government action when necessary.  To keep prices and the rate of inflation down is one of the most important tasks we face in maintaining economic progress and in ensuring the success of this national plan.</P>
    <P>The plan we have adopted is, despite the demands for additional capital expenditure, consistent with the financial policy goals we have been adhering to and in fact improves on them.  The plan envisages a reduction in the Exchequer borrowing requirement to 3 per cent of GNP in 1993, and in the debt-GNP ratio from its current level of 133 per cent to 120 per cent by that date.  It is possible, if the experience of the last two years were to be repeated, that financial progress could be faster than that.  The Exchequer returns for the first quarter of 1989, in so far as they give any valid signal for the year as a whole, are encouraging.  It is not possible accurately to predict the course of events for many years ahead but our responsibility is to set realistic, achievable targets and implement consistently and courageously the policies necessary to achieve them.  If conditions warrant we will raise our sights higher as <Col N="1212" /> the implementation of this national plan brings the desired results.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer borrowing objective of a reduction in 1993 to 3 per cent in conjunction with the growth rates envisaged sets the national debt-GNP ratio on a downward path.  This reduction in indebtedness should, in turn, lessen by about one-tenth the annual burden of debt service, thereby releasing resources for other desirable purposes including a reduction in taxation.</P>
    <P>One of the purposes of the plan is to secure a substantial increase in private investment.  We do not propose to make economic growth and employment dependent on increased domestic Government expenditure.  There has been substantial progress recently in streamlining the economy, and we have the capacity to absorb the additional funds now available and to use them for productive purposes without difficulty.  It is not legitimate to criticise this plan for what it does not contain.  Neither taxation policy nor social welfare policy, which are covered in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> feature as such in the National Development Plan, because they are not directly relevant to the increased Structural Funds.  The title of the plan is <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993,</i> and it is essentially an expansion in depth and an elaboration of some key development aspects of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>In the past additional EC aid, in the form that it took especially following our joining the European Monetary System in 1979, required us to increase Exchequer borrowing by substantial amounts in order to avail of Community funds.  On this occasion the Government are determined that there will be no conflict between the goal of better overall financial balance and increased capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>The plan envisages total expenditure of £9.1 billion over the five year period 1989-1993.  This includes £3.6 billion of public and similar expenditure, £2.1 billion of private sector expenditure and £3.4 billion from the EC Structural <Col N="1213" /> Funds.  Full details of these expenditures are set out in the plan.</P>
    <P>In addition, the separate plan to be submitted by June next is in relation to what are called Objectives 3 and 4.  These relate to action to combat long-term unemployment and to facilitate the occupational integration of young people. Provision for £0.6 billion of expenditure will be made in that plan, of which £0.2 billion will be public expenditure and £0.4 billion from the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>In total, the two plans will amount to £9.7 billion of expenditure, of which £3.9 billion will be sought from the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>For 1989, the plan now submitted provides for expenditure of £1.5 billion, including £0.4 billion from the Structural Funds.  The 1989 budget has already taken this expenditure into account so that the development measures could go ahead as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>The plan is geared to maximise the amount of Structural Fund aid which will be made available to Ireland and to use it to best advantage in developing the economy.  The amount sought from the Structural Funds, totalling £3.9 billion, goes beyond a strict doubling for Ireland over the period.  It represents what the Irish Government would regard as a fair allocation of the available funds in the light of Ireland's development needs.</P>
    <P>The public finance position limits the Government's room for manoeuvre in providing domestic resources to develop the economy.  What the plan sets out to do is to maintain domestic public and similar expenditure on structural development somewhat above its 1988 level and on top of that to invest the additional Structural Fund resources in additional development.</P>
    <P>This is in line with the &ldquo;additionality&rdquo; provision in the Community regulations. This provision requires that the increased appropriations from the funds should result in at least an equivalent increase in the total volume of official or similar structural expenditure, including the Community assistance, in the member state concerned, taking into account the <Col N="1214" /> macroeconomic circumstances in which the funding takes place.</P>
    <P>In our circumstances, given the level of the national debt and the continuing need to reduce the level of Exchequer borrowing, the scope for increasing the level of Government investment in the economic infrastructure is of necessity limited, but the higher intervention rates now available from the Structural Funds are of very great value in this regard as they will mean that the increased Community assistance will greatly increase the return that can be procured in improved infrastructure from domestic expenditure, public and private.</P>
    <P>The Government intend to pursue a further reduction in Exchequer borrowing over the medium term.  This reduction must be sought primarily on the current side, that is by reducing the budget deficit.  This will require continuing strict financial discipline.  In fact, since 1986 the greater burden of adjustment has been on the current side, which has been reduced by 4.3 per cent of GNP, compared with a reduction of 3.3 per cent in Exchequer capital borrowing.  For the first time since 1982 the Public Capital Programme in 1989 showed an increase of £80 million over the outturn for 1988, an increase that was achieved however without resort to additional Exchequer borrowing.</P>
    <P>The reformed EC Structural Funds provide for an increased maximum rate of Community contribution of 75 per cent of eligible expenditure involved.  The precise contribution rate which will apply to particular operations will be a matter for negotiation with the EC Commission. Factors which are to be taken into account include the seriousness of the specific problems to be tackled and the financial capacity of the member state involved.  Other factors such as the extent to which an investment will generate revenue will also have a bearing.  Since Ireland has been classified as one of the least prosperous regions, it would be appropriate that the highest contribution rate should apply in Ireland as far as possible and this is reflected in the plan.</P>
    <P>In determining the development <Col N="1215" /> priorities, the Government looked first at the main features of the economy which needed most attention, and where there are serious structural deficiencies which need to be remedied.  We have to overcome low income and output levels, where quite insufficient progress has been made since we joined the EC.  We have problems arising from our population structure, which has meant we have had to face both a rapid growth in labour supply and a high dependency ratio.  This has also undoubtedly exacerbated our financial problems.  The persistently weak demand for labour has led to high unemployment and emigration.  We face difficulties in finding necessary development funds, because of continuing budgetary imbalances and high indebtedness. Access costs and serious gaps in our infrastructure hinder investment and development.We are still relatively heavily reliant on agriculture.  There are weaknesses in our industrial structure, and investment levels have been low in recent years.  Many of these problems arise in part from our position on the periphery of Europe.  The completion of the Single Market and the parallel cohesion measures must aim to reduce the scale of these difficulties and begin to close the gap between Ireland and the central regions of the Community.</P>
    <P>It was clear that two types of action were needed &mdash; action to improve the competitiveness and efficiency of the Irish economy, taking account of our geographic position as an island on the periphery of Europe, inadequate infrastructure and low population density; and action to strengthen the productive capacity of the economy. Improving the competitiveness and efficiency of the economy requires investment in transport facilities such as roads, rail and bus, sea ports and airports.  It also requires investment in telecommunications, postal services, the energy network, sanitary services and waste disposal facilities.  All of these were identified as sectors where steps need to be taken to improve our position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" /> As regards strengthening the productive capacity, the areas identified for development are industry, services, tourism, agriculture, fishing, forestry and rural development generally.  These sectoral areas must be complemented by the development of human skills through improved educational and training resources and particular measures to facilitate the occupational integration of young people and to combat long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>Now that the development plan has been submitted the Commission will assess it and proceed to draw up what is called the Community Support Framework.This Community Support Framework will be prepared in consultation with the Irish Government.  It will set out: the priorities included in the National Development Plan for which Community assistance will be provided; the forms of assistance to be provided; the indicative financing plan, with details of the amount of assistance and its sources; and the duration of the assistance.  In effect, it will set out the development measures which the Structural Funds will assist over the period and the level of assistance which will be provided.  This will be a crucial document since it will establish the overall financing position for the five-year period.  The process of consultation and dialogue with the Commission, which has worked so well in expediting the preparation of the plan, will continue to operate during the examination of the national plan, the operational programmes and the support framework.</P>
    <P>The regulations require the Commission to take a decision approving the Community Support Framework not later than six months after receiving the plan.  However, I am confident that the process can be completed earlier than that.  In discussions which we have had with President Delors and the Commissioners involved, we have stressed the need for early decisions so that the development operations can get under way as early as possible.</P>
    <P>The plan sets out the overall strategy which will be followed in each of the <Col N="1217" /> relevant sectors.  The operational programmes will spell out in more detail the precise measures to be undertaken. These will be chosen in a way which will maximise the development effect and deal with the main deficiencies in each sector.  These operational programmes will show the specific developments and projects in each sector.  These programmes will have to be agreed with the Commission and in fact will form the legal basis for the commitment of funds by the Community.  The programmes to be submitted are set out in the plan as follows: industrial development; tourism; roads; transport, including air and sea freight, sea ports, airports, rail and bus; energy; sanitary and other local services; telecommunications and postal services; human resources, education, training and employment; and agricultural and rural development.</P>
    <P>Many of these programmes have now been submitted to the Commission for approval.  The only exceptions are where funding for 1989 has been agreed and the final draft is under discussion with the Commission.  The Commission will be examining these programmes in parallel with their examination of the plan, and we would expect that they will be approved at the same time as or even before the Community Support Framework is established.  The Ministers concerned with each sector will deal fully with them during the course of this debate.  I would like at this stage to give a brief outline of our approach to the principal sectors in the plan.</P>
    <P>For Irish business and industry the completion of the Internal Market has major implications.  The fundamental EC objective is to remove trade and other barriers which distort competition. Ireland has, perhaps, the most open economy of any country in the Community.We have fewer non-tariff barriers to trade than are found in most other Community countries.  At the same time we export almost three-quarters of what we produce.  Unrestricted access to Community markets is essential not only to the development of indigenous industry <Col N="1218" /> but also in attracting overseas industrial investment to Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, of fundamental importance to Irish economic development that the remaining barriers to trade in the Community are removed.  We have been strong advocates of the need to create a single European market, because of the major opportunities that will arise in that market for Irish firms.  Irish firms have shown that they can compete successfully in Europe.  At the time we joined the European Community in 1973 only about one-sixth of our exports went to Community countries other than the UK. Today, while the UK still remains our most important export market, we have more than doubled the proportion of our exports going to other Community countries.  In the process Irish firms have achieved a healthy diversification of markets and export products.  They have shown that when trade barriers are lowered they can penetrate and compete successfully in some of the most competitive markets in the world.</P>
    <P>Last year our exports reached record levels.  One of the most significant features of this performance was the level of export growth achieved by the indigenous sector of Irish industry.  Exports from this sector increased by over 23 per cent last year &mdash; well ahead of the overall growth rate of 15 per cent in total exports.  This is one of the clearest indications to date that smaller Irish firms are beginning to get their export activities right.  Improved marketing and export performance of this nature are essential requirements if we are to benefit from the opportunities which the single market will generate.</P>
    <P>Successive CII surveys have shown that the Irish business sector is optimistic about the opportunities that the completion of the Internal Market will bring, but there can be no complacency. Undoubtedly, the removal of hidden trade barriers and the increased demand which the single market programme will generate will make Ireland a more attractive location for internationally mobile investment seeking access to European markets and will provide <Col N="1219" /> increased export opportunities, but competition will also increase markedly in markets right across the Community. That is why the Government engaged in an intensive awareness and information campaign at the end of 1988 to bring home to business firms not only the significant new opportunities for business now coming on stream but the increased competitive challenge that will also arise.</P>
    <P>In planning for the best possible use of the increased Structural Fund resources that will become available over the next five years the Government have taken care to maintain a proper balance between essential investment in upgrading the infrastructure needed to underpin economic development and in directly productive sectors of the economy.  We also had to keep in mind the fact that the Commission emphasises that infrastructural investment should be related to productive purposes.</P>
    <P>Over the period 1989-1993 the objective of the Government is to create 100,000 gross new jobs in manufacturing industry and international services.  The achievement of this outturn will represent an improvement of almost 20 per cent on performance in recent years.</P>
    <P>Over the period 1989-1993 a reorientation of industrial policy will take account of the changed environment which the completion of the Internal Market will bring about.  The competitiveness of Irish industry must be improved.  Such improvement will be essential for most Irish firms if they are to gain new markets and to withstand the increased competition that will occur in their existing markets.</P>
    <P>A supportive environment for new business investment will be kept in place. It is essential that the rate of inflation be kept to the lowest possible level.  We will continue to work with the social partners to avoid levels of inflation, interest or pay increases that would undermine the major achievements in economic recovery of the past two years which have achieved the improvement in the investment climate which is now beginning to translate into jobs.  Downward pressure <Col N="1220" /> on services costs &mdash; electricity, telecommunications and postal charges, insurance &mdash; is the key to competitiveness and must be maintained.</P>
    <P>Increased resources will be devoted to achieving a further significant shift in State support to upgrade the marketing and technological capacity of Irish industry.Improved marketing performance by Irish firms will be required not only to maintain our existing market shares in an expanding market but to take up opportunities in new markets which the removal of trade barriers will bring about.  Irish firms will increasingly realise that they are no longer exporting to Europe but marketing within Europe. Our objective is to double the market share of Irish firms in other Community Markets by the mid-nineties and to be well on the way to achieving this with the aid of the Structural Funds by 1992.</P>
    <P>Community surveys have shown a significant technological gap between the core and the peripheral regions of the Community.  A determined effort to narrow this gap will be made in Ireland over the next five years.  This will be done by concentrating our efforts on selected areas of advanced technology relevant to the needs of existing and emerging new industries in Ireland and where basic expertise exists in our third level education colleges.  We will promote greater links between industry and higher education bodies and ensure that the technological support services available to industry from our research institutes and industrial promotion agencies are designed to help firms achieve a competitive edge in the market place.</P>
    <P>The increased competition in the free internal market will provide both the opportunity and the need for Irish firms to combine their resources with other firms based either in Ireland or other Community markets in order to increase efficiency in production, marketing, distribution or product development.  The IDA, SFADCo, CTT, EOLAS and Údarás na Gaeltachta will support and promote new initiatives to achieve such joint ventures.</P>
    <P>Some £1.2 billion of direct support will <Col N="1221" /> be channelled directly to Irish firms over the five year period from the increased resources available and together with matching resources from the private sector will underpin a total expenditure of over £3 billion by Irish industry between 1989 and 1993.</P>
    <P>Tourism has been identified as a key sector for expansion over the period of the plan, following up the high priority this Government have given tourism since coming into office.  Tourism is labour intensive, has a low import content and has the ability to provide income and employment in the most remote regions of the country.</P>
    <P>Measures taken over the past two years since the launch of the special programme for tourism in May 1987 have brought a major improvement in the industry.  Annual visitor numbers are up by over 30 per cent on 1986; annual revenue has passed the £1 billion mark; and the sector now sustains some 67,000 full time job equivalents or 6 per cent of the labour force.  Bord Fáilte are targeting for a further 15 per cent increase this year.  The board believe that the sector is now well on course for achieving the stated objective of a doubling in visitor numbers by 1993.</P>
    <P>To sustain growth of this magnitude there is, however, an urgent need to improve the quality and range of Irish tourism facilities, with particular attention to the faster growing segments of the international tourism market.  Ireland should have a natural advantage in the provision of activity and special interest holidays such as fishing, golf, sailing, cruising, walking, cycling, archaeological, historical and cultural visits. However, these advantages are not enough without the provision of first class facilities and amenities for visitors in each of these areas.</P>
    <P>Heavy and sustained investment in product development, backed up by effective marketing and competitive pricing, is essential for the continued successful development of Irish tourism.  The plan envisages investment in all aspects of the tourist infrastructure necessary to establish Ireland as a major tourist venue <Col N="1222" /> and marketing will be co-ordinated by the State agencies and combine State and private sector expenditures.  The need is to eliminate deficiencies and bottlenecks and overcome constraints by organising combined investment from public and private sources and the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>A very encouraging development has been the great upsurge of investment interest in the tourism industry in Ireland this year.  A very large number of high quality projects are coming forward, involving high levels of investment and capital expenditure, filling in particular gaps in the infrastructure of tourism amenities and facilities.  Bord Fáilte are very active in encouraging these developments and are monitoring them to make sure that every possible assistance and facility is extended to the promoters of good, sound, viable tourism infrastructural projects.</P>
    <P>It is true that our island located on the periphery of the European Community places us at a major cost disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> our European neighbours.  We have been at pains constantly to emphasise that aspect to the Commission and to the Community services in general. Transport costs for Irish exporters are approximately twice those incurred by Community countries trading with one another on the European mainland.  The opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1993 will accentuate our peripheral location, leaving Ireland as the only member state without a land link to the rest of the EC. These factors, together with the completion of the Internal Market, make it essential that we provide an efficient inland and access transport infrastructure.We cannot change our geographical position on the European Continent, but we certainly can and must do everything within our power to ensure that internally transport access of exports to our ports and to our airports is the best we can provide.  The most significant reason for high Irish transport costs is the poor state of the national roads and the access roads to our principal ports and airports.</P>
    <P>The plan proposes Exchequer expenditure of almost £1 billion over the five <Col N="1223" /> years on the development of our roads with £755 million on national roads. Local authorities will continue to provide funds from their own resources and the Exchequer will continue to provide certain finance for road maintenance.</P>
    <P>Under the plan, immediate priority will be given to the development of the following strategic sections of national routes; Euroroutes EO1 and E20 and Dublin to Kinnegad.  The detailed strategy has been set out in the Operational Programme for Roads, which has been formally submitted to the EC Commission.</P>
    <P>Before Easter, the Minister for the Environment invited proposals for private investment in the Dublin Ring Road in return for a toll franchise.  We expect a positive response to this proposal.  We have also identified three other projects which have potential for private toll based investment.  These are the Newbridge/Kilcullen by-pass, the Lucan/Kilcock Road and the Cork Downstream Crossing.  We will also welcome realistic investment proposals relating to these projects.  Private investment in toll roads will be used to accentuate the investment programme on national roads and will not be in substitution for Exchequer funding.</P>
    <P>Roads are, however, only one aspect of our transport infrastructure.  Over the next five years the Government are proposing total investment of over £440 million in transport in the following other specific action areas: development of air and sea corridors and services to UK and mainland Europe; investment in the State and regional airports; development of certain commercial seaports; and investment in bus and rail infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The investment plans for each of these areas have been specifically designed by the Government to ensure that Ireland is more fully integrated into the mainland European transport network.</P>
    <P>The approach has two aspects.  First we have to orient our whole transport system in all its aspects to European access.  At the same time, we have to develop our internal transport systems to make sure <Col N="1224" /> that to the greatest possible extent it facilitates especially our export trade and also the import of essential goods.</P>
    <P>Over the last two years Irish airports and carriers have between them generated an unprecedented growth in air traffic, internal, cross-channel and international, which is without parallel in Europe.  I would like to pay tribute to all concerned.  The Government's concentration on cheap access, on opening up routes, and in supporting investment in our airports both national and regional is paying off.  There will be continuing investment of £120 million over the period of the plan.  Plans are also being drawn up for intensive air freight services to Continental Europe.  Again that proposal for air channel as it is sometimes called is related directly to the opening of the Channel Tunnel.  At that point, we will be the only country that will not have a direct land link with mainland Europe for our exports and imports.</P>
    <P>Port facilities must be suitably modernised so as to enable faster turnabout of ships.  Computerised documentation processing must be used to cut down delays.  The development plan targets the main commercial ports.  Total proposed investment in commercial ports over the period of the plan is £72 million and this will mainly be concentrated on Dublin, Rosslare, Waterford and Cork.  Other ports will also be included.</P>
    <P>For an island State the need for a fast efficient and competitive sea transport is self evident.  We therefore intend to develop a fast sea freight shuttle service to Europe using Rosslare harbour as a hub.  We will supplement this by an enhanced lift on/lift off capability using the most modern purpose built harbour container vessels plying from Dublin, Waterford and Cork to mainland Europe.  We will expand the conventional fleet by encourging private investment in shipping and stimulating this by direct grant assistance.</P>
    <P>The Government expect the Commission to acknowledge the acute and unique problems faced by Ireland in this regard and will strongly support us in our determined drive to improve the access <Col N="1225" /> and internal transport networks throughout the economy.</P>
    <P>Energy has a vital role to play in the National Development Plan and in the national and Community objective of greater economic and social cohesion in the run up to 1992 and beyond.  Energy is fundamental to all sectors of the economy.It is vital to ensure that the provision of adequate, reliable and competitive energy supplies does not pose a barrier to economic growth and development at national or local level.</P>
    <P>After acute problems became evident during the second oil crisis in 1979, a major investment programme was undertaken to ensure adequate electricity supplies in the eighties and to extend the national gas network from Cork.  Dependence on imported oil has been reduced from 70 per cent to under 50 per cent and in electricity generation to insignificant levels.  Our electricity prices have become much more competitive in the last two or three years.  Exploration for offshore oil and gas has been stepped up as a result of the new licensing terms and the agreement reached with Marathon has already produced results in the welcome form of a new gas find after years of stagnation. I know that all Deputies in the House will welcome this very significant addition to our indigenous resources of energy in the new find of Kinsale.</P>
    <P>Ireland is the only member state with stand-alone gas and electricity networks. There is no interconnection even with Northern Ireland at the present time. Our small and dispersed population structure and the dispersed pattern of industrial settlements are disadvantages. As a result, Irish energy costs are significantly above average Community levels.  It is essential that we develop indigenous resources to the maximum extent possible.</P>
    <P>Subject to further assessement, it is intended to pursue steps to integrate Ireland's electricity and gas systems with other networks in the Community. Energy investments over the next five years, will therefore, form an integral part of the overall National Plan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1226" /> We must always be alert to new technological development.  Things which may appear impossible physically or uneconomic at present may, in a very short time, because of the fantastic advances that are taking place in technology become feasible from our point of view.</P>
    <P>Within the framework of the plan, an operational programme has been prepared for continued major investment in sanitary services.  For the period 1989-93 investment of £62.5 million a year is projected, and support is being sought from EC Structural Funds towards the greater part of this projected investment.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the sanitary services programme are to provide adequate good quality water supplies for industrial, agricultural, domestic and other users, and to provide systems for safe, adequate waste disposal from industrial, residential, and other development.  These objectives are critical both to the economy and to the environment.  A high level of investment is required to ensure that this programme will support planned economic expansion, for example, in natural resource based industries and in tourism.  Efficient services are essential for the exploitation of agriculture also and the expansion of the food processing sector; clean, pollution free waters are essential to the development of inland and coastal fisheries.</P>
    <P>Our information technology industry in general and telecommunications in particular are a success story.  We are already one of the most computerised countries in the world with one of the best telecommunication systems.</P>
    <P>It is time people started talking about that fact.  Many industrial visitors or people involved in the services industries coming to this country are constantly amazed at the high level of computerisation in the Irish economy and also at the enormously high proportion of computer literate people in our workforce.These are tremendous advantages and these should be more frequently adverted to.  Nevertheless, at present telephone density in Ireland is the second lowest in the Community; the full range <Col N="1227" /> of modern services is still not available nationwide and, despite substantial price reductions last autumn for international calls, the cost of our telecommunications service is still not in line with that of other member states.</P>
    <P>During the period of the National Development Plan, capital expenditure on the Telecom Éireann network will be needed of the order of £675 million.  Of this amount £369 million is considered to be of a structural nature and grants totalling £17.9 million have already been approved under the EC STAR programme, expenditure which will be matched by an equivalent investment by Telecom Éireann, in expanding the network, completing digitilisation of the trunk service and other similar improvements.</P>
    <P>Since Ireland joined the European Community in 1973 one of the consistently favourable features of our membership has been the flow of assistance for programmes of vocational training and job creation.  In 1973 Ireland was approved for just over £4 million in Social Fund assistance.  In subsequent years, the level of assistance grew rapidly as the national system of vocational training developed and expanded.  In 1988 Ireland was approved for assistance of £166 million from the Social Fund, and our cumulative total approved assistance, between 1973 and 1988, now exceeds £1,250 million.</P>
    <P>This assistance has enabled us to develop a modern infrastructure and system for vocational training which would simply not have been possible without the assistance of the European Social Fund.  The money received has enabled FÁS to build and equip its network of training centres, to run many different types of training courses, including new technology courses, and to undertake a whole range of initiatives in the training area.  The ESF has assisted the Department of Education to expand its technical and other courses in the regional technical colleges and colleges of technology.  It has provided generous <Col N="1228" /> assistance for the training of the handicapped and has helped the IDA and other development agencies by providing assistance for training grants.</P>
    <P>Ireland is cited in Brussels as a country which has made efficient use of its European Social Fund receipts and it is frequently said there that the effects of the ESF can be seen more clearly in Ireland than in any other member state.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I give the Deputy credit for his own contribution to that.  I am confident that as part of our share of the increased resources of the Community Structural Funds, European Social Fund support for our training efforts will expand further over the coming years.  I can assure the House that this increased income will also be used to good effect, specifically to equip our workforce with the necessary skills to cope with 1992 and the single market.</P>
      <P>The reformed European Social Fund will come into operation on 1 January 1990.  There is a difference between the European Social Fund and the other fund but that will not affect the receipts to Ireland from the Social Fund during 1989. When the new Social Fund regulations come into operation they will be concerned with the following three broad objectives: (i) promoting the development and structural adjustment of the regions whose development is lagging behind; (ii) combating long-term unemployment; and (iii) facilitating the occupational integration of young people.  We have already submitted to Brussels a draft of an operational programme for Objective 1 dealing with the development of our workforce.</P>
      <P>New areas where we will be looking for increased Community assistance include training for the short-term unemployed aged over 25 years, certain activities within the educational system and recruitment subsidies as part of a broad programme to help small and mediumsized enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work is proceeding on the preparation <Col N="1229" /> of operational plans in respect of combating long-term unemployment and assisting young people to make the very necessary and sometimes difficult transition from school to work, ensuring the availability of a pool of well-qualified technicians and technologists in science, technology and business studies, and a direct interface between third level institutions and industry.</P>
    <P>Agricultural production and food processing employ about 20 per cent of our labour force; gross agricultural output exceeded £3 billion for the first time in 1988, with exports of just over £2 billion. The sector is characterised, however, by some major structural problems and faces a number of challenges in the immediate future.  At farm level there is both a serious income and under-employment problem on many farms.  In addition, there is the growing income differentiation within farming between those engaged in milk and other farming enterprises.  Direct employment in agriculture has been declining, which, allied to the scarcity of job opportunities outside farming, has been a major contributing factor to the migration from rural areas in recent years.  The cutbacks in the CAP support mechanisms for the main commodities have also contributed, and will continue to contribute to these problems.  On the positive side sheep numbers have doubled since 1980, and there has been a significant increase in the beef suckling herd.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined, notwithstanding the difficulties, to maximise job and wealth creation in the agricultural sector and to stabilise the rural population to the extent that this can be achieved.  These objectives are clearly outlined in the plan which sets out a programme of measures designed to achieve them.</P>
    <P>At farm level, there will be measures to increase efficiency, reduce costs, improve quality and stimulate diversification of production while protecting the environment.The problems of low farm incomes and of preserving the farming population in disadvantaged areas will be <Col N="1230" /> addressed through the maximum use of compensatory or headage payments.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the food-processing sector is central to the Government's overall economic development strategy. The plan seeks increased support for the Five-Year Plan for the Food Industry drawn up by the IDA in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The plan recognises the role in rural development of small industry, craft industry, agri-tourism, fishing and forestry and indicates how these will be developed.  The Integrated Rural Development Pilot Programme has already been launched and the experience gained from the pilot programme will be used to formulate a nationwide rural development programme to be implemented with Community support over the later years of the plan.</P>
    <P>Ambitious objectives for the development and expansion of forestry are put forward in the national plan.  It is proposed to double the annual planting targets from the record 15,000 hectares achieved last year to 30,000 hectares a year by 1993.  This is the most important development in forestry policy since the foundation of the State and aims at maximising the benefits of our comparative advantage in tree growing which is three times faster than the Community average.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government adopted an ambitious four-year development plan for the growth of the fishing and aquaculture industries.  Significant additional resources have already been provided from our own resources in the 1989 budget.  These resources will be complemented by receipts from the Community under existing facilities.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan also provides for a major fishery harbours development programme, designed to provide adequate infrastructure at carefully selected harbours.  The purpose of the investment is to improve the effectiveness of the fleet and reduce operating costs through the provision of modern facilities and better access and through <Col N="1231" /> the relief of congestion.  The total investment envisaged is £19 million over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the plan will be the biggest boost to the regions of this country that they have ever received.  The preparation of the National Development Plan has enabled the Government to undertake a comprehensive review of the development needs and priorities of each of the seven sub-regions into which we divided the country.  I would like to illustrate the regional content by looking at the plans for three of the sub-regions.</P>
    <P>Sub-region No. 1 is the greater Dublin area, which contains close to a third of the State's total population.  The principal problems of the Dublin region have been a sharp decline in industrial employment between 1981 and 1987, and the existence of above-average unemployment in the inner city and some of the suburban areas.  The overriding priority is employment creation and the development of skills in the workforce.  The main needs of Dublin are the creation of more industry, especially in the western suburbs, the development of the tourist potential, and the improvement of transport communications and the environment.  In the county there is a significant development potential for horticulture and forestry. Education and training, industry and transport are the three main items for which European assistance is sought. Over £2 billion expenditure under the different programmes is proposed in the Dublin area, and £750 million is being sought in EC support.</P>
    <P>In transport in the early eighties priority was given to the establishment of the DART.  Indeed, I will remember those who for very shortsighted reasons opposed totally the establishment of the DART.  Fortunately, most of them are not around in political life any more. Further improvement of existing public transport infrastructure and the provision of new commuter services is also provided for in the plan.  Another priority is the completion of the Dublin ring road <Col N="1232" /> to motorway standards and linked access to the port.</P>
    <P>The south-west sub-region, covering Cork and south Kerry, faces very serious problems, particularly unemployment, leading, of course, to emigration.  The key elements in resolving these problems are to strengthen the presence of an internationally competitive manufacturing sector, the exploitation of the great tourism potential of the area and an increased effort to stabilise the rural population. These objectives will be underpinned by improvements to the infrastructure of the region, especially transport links to and from Cork.  A specific target is included in the plan for creating at least 1,000 additional jobs in tourism per year in the sub-region up to 1993.  A total expenditure, for example, of over £1 billion is being put forward for the south-west region with nearly half that or close to £500 million being sought in EC support.</P>
    <P>In the west sub-region the problem of poor access has been identified as a major obstacle to development.  Incomes in the west are well below the average for the State, and outside of Galway it is one of the least industrially developed areas, heavily dependent on agriculture. Improved access is the major key to the development of the region.  There is great potential for tourism development, including both agri-tourism and cultural tourism, for afforestation, for fishing and mariculture, as well as industrial initiatives, including food processing and craft industries throughout the region.  Horan International Airport offers considerable potential for the establishment of international services, and a strong high technology sector at present centred on Galway and UCG can be further strengthened.  Over £1 billion worth of projects are being put forward in the west, and about £439 million is being sought in EC support for the west sub-region.</P>
    <P>The problems and potential of the other four sub-regions are addressed individually on the same basis as the three sub-regions I mentioned.</P>
    <P>As the creation of an adequate number of permanent viable jobs is the basic <Col N="1233" /> objective of economic policy, the programmes to be implemented under this plan are designed to have, directly and indirectly, a major impact in providing employment.  This is articulated under three headings.  First, the main thrust of the plan is to strengthen the economy's competitiveness on a broad front, to help Irish producers to surmount the disadvantages of our peripheral location in Europe and an under-developed infrastructure and to enable us to gain maximum advantage from the opportunities presented by the Single Market. Secondly, it will give a considerable impetus to the sectoral development strategies being pursued under the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> both by enabling us to intensify our efforts and, indirectly, by creating a more favourable environment.  Thirdly, the new activity involved in implementing the programms would itself generate many extra jobs, though, in contrast to the enduring benefits which we expect from the programmes when implemented, only during the period of the implementation will that particular increase in employment come.  It should, nevertheless, be significant in the relatively short term.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to fully quantify the overall employment impact of the plan, embracing both the direct job content of the measures themselves and the wider implications for economic performance of strengthening the economic base and the development strategies.  The Government are, nevertheless, satisfied that the rate of job creation will be stepped up progressively as these measures take effect.  It is possible to calculate that the pace of new job creation, estimated at 29,000 last year, can be accelerated to at least 35,000 annually by 1993.  This would represent the creation of more than 150,000 jobs over the five years.  It would accommodate the natural growth of the workforce, and, if job losses can be contained, it would enable a continuing significant reduction in unemployment.</P>
    <P>The adjustments which completion of the Internal Market must involve suggest that it would be unrealistic to expect to avoid losing jobs.  As well as bringing <Col N="1234" /> increased opportunity, we must squarely face the fact that the Single Market will intensify competition.  The programmes set out in this plan, both of a general and sectoral nature, and the broad policy strategy outlined, are framed with this reality firmly in mind.  These, combined with a positive attitude on the part of all the participants, can equip us to meet the challenges and grasp the opportunities. In partnership, we can lift the rate of new job creation, we can stem the flow of job losses, and reinforce the encouraging positive trend of total employment which has recently emerged.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention one very encouraging factor in our whole economic structure, the excellent performance and the new spirit that prevails in a large section of the semi-State sector. Some of these companies have been performing very well; indeed, I would nearly use the world &ldquo;brilliantly&rdquo;.  They have gone out into the international markets and developed for themselves substantial incomes from consultancy and other services.Throughout the semi-State sector we can see today a new spirit, a new sense of purpose and a new motivation.  That augurs very well for the contribution that the semi-State sector will be able to make to the <i>National Development Plan.</i></P>
    <P>In assessing this plan, it is important to bear in mind that it concentrates considerably on the essential development priorities over the next few years.  The increase in the funds, while substantial, does not represent any kind of abundant largesse, nor is it a chance to indulge in unrealistic attitudes and pursue projects not relevant to the funds or their productive purposes.  All the funds must be carefully expended to produce the best possible results.  Basically, they must be oriented to productive purposes and form part of a feasible programme.  What we are doing here is creating a strong base for future progress.  Both the Government and the European Commission in a new and very optimistic partnership are determined to make a success of this plan so that Ireland in the economic and social sense during the period to 1993 will fully demonstrate the validity of the European <Col N="1235" /> commitment to the less developed and peripheral regions and I know that this ambition is shared by the Community. Such success is essential if progress in the Community is to be consolidated and we are to be in position to move on towards economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>The <i>National Development Plan</i> provides the opportunity for a great national effort, a major move forward.  It will change the economic and social face of Ireland.  It is the most comprehensive development budget ever adopted to modernise the economic and social structures of this country and to expand its productive capacity.  It will affect every region of the country and every sector of the economy, and its operational programmes will speed up growth, generate employment and improve living standards and social equity.  There will be real opportunities and support for local bodies, co-operatives, individual businesses and State agencies to promote new and exciting projects in all the regions. The State, the EC Commission and the private sector will all be involved in a partnership for growth.  This is a plan for major economic expansion over the next few years and into the nineties.  I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course this document should have been debated in this House before its submission to the European Commission.  The Taoiseach today attempted to claim credit for being prepared to listen to views and submissions. That is nothing more than a sham, a cosmetic exercise, designed to comply on the surface with the requirement in the regulations that there be consultation with all relevant interests about the construction of the plan.</P>
      <P>In the course of his remarks today the Taoiseach had this to say:</P>
      <P>The plan has been published in its entirety and is now being debated for three days in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>He indicated that he welcomed constructive criticism and suggestion for improvement.  He went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1236" /> While the fundamental provisions must be broadly adhered to, the Government will be flexible with regard to detailed aspects of particular sectors and the timing and implementation of particular projects.</P>
    <P>He said the Government remained open to submissions and proposals.  Had that been said before the document had been submitted to Brussels I might have believed it.  Said today I will not disbelieve its intention but it cannot mean a great deal today because the Taoiseach himself has set out the procedures that happen from here on and they do not include amendments, advices or views from Dáil Éireann being taken into account in what actually happens on the ground when the operational programmes are being implemented.</P>
    <P>Indeed all of us in this House know very well that there has been no real consultation with the interests involved. The Confederation of Irish Industry, the Federated Union of Employers, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Farmers' Association, Chambers of Commerce and other groups have been involved in advisory and consultative structures.  My contacts with the people involved in that whole procedure confirm me in the view that they feel no real sense of participation in building up a national plan.  They have not been involved in any real sense in fixing objectives or priorities.They have not been involved in any real assessment of the economic returns from different areas of investment nor have they been involved in any real consideration of investment strategy. Exactly the same thing can be said of the alleged consultations with county and city managers over the last few months. Chairmen of county councils and of borough corporations have been involved in advisory structures.  I have talked to a number of them.  They have all told me the same thing.  They feel that they have been used and abused for purely cosmetic reasons.  They feel a very deep sense of frustration and resentment that they have not been given any real opportunity to <Col N="1237" /> represent the people they serve.  In this, as in so many other ways, the Government have shown that they have not got the least real concern for local democracy or local government structures.  That was very clearly illustrated by the Taoiseach himself in the course of his remarks today when he said:</P>
    <P>The formulation of this national plan was a very complex exercise.  It involves intricates, interlocking calculations.This could only be done centrally.The same applies to its implementation which can only be undertaken through national mechanisms.Anything else would result in chaos.</P>
    <P>That is absolute and utter nonsense.  The Taoiseach knows perfectly well that there are decentralised systems of government in other member states of the European Community that work quite happily, that leaves substantial margins of executive decisions to local authorities, to decentralised bodies, that have functions in their regions.  The Taoiseach has decided to set his face completely against that.  I believe that is a dreadful pity.  It is my belief that it constitutes a course of action which is stifling a level of initiative and dynamic that we here could exploit.</P>
    <P>There was another example more recently of this absolute disdainful treatment of local authorities of any kind.  The Commissioner for Regional Policy, Mr. Bruce Millan, whom I met, came here towards the end of last week to have discussions with the Taoiseach.  I do not know whether or not he expected it but I am given to understand that he was brought around some parts of the country ostensibly to see some of the operations for himself.  He was brought by helicopter to Cork, from there to Limerick, from there to Galway and was back in Dublin on Friday evening last in time to appear on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;.  I do not know what he would have learned in the course of that trip, other than what it is like to fly in a helicopter and meet a member of the European Parliament in Cork.  At no stage did he meet any of the county managers or any of the representatives <Col N="1238" /> of the local authorities in the areas he visited.  Yet this was the Commissioner for Regional Policy ostensibly being shown what goes on here.  There was a time &mdash; and probably it is still the case &mdash; when people used to say, half in earnest and half in jest, that when the IDA brought foreign industrialists here they would bring them around the country by helicopter deliberately so that they would not be able to see how many potholes the Minister for the Environment had left in our roads.  It would seem to me that if we are bringing the Commissioner for Regional Policy to Ireland in order to support, emphasise and underline our case for assistance, we should have made sure that we brought him by road, by the by-roads, so that the person who will be overseeing the operations of the Regional Development Fund and the important matters dealt with in this plan should have a very clear idea for himself of the difficulties we must surmount and that should be addressed by a plan of this kind.</P>
    <P>In view of all of that it take some nerve on the part of the Taoiseach to make the statement that he did today as follows:</P>
    <P>Success in achieving the Community's objectives will require the support of the public and the social partners.</P>
    <P>That is true but, in order to get that support, they should be properly informed, properly involved in a manner that renders it a real involvement and not just the cosmetic one we see in this debate and indeed in other examples to which I will come in a few minutes.</P>
    <P>The document before us is not a national development plan.  Nor is it, as the Taoiseach claims, a detailed multi-annual development budget.  It is a fairly pedestrian, unimaginative projection of the Public Capital Programme over a five-year period involving £3.8 billion of expenditure by public and local bodies in this country, £3.7 billion of projected or expected expenditure from the European Community Structural Funds and the expectation of £2.1 billion of expenditure by the private sector here.  In fact the expenditure set out in this document <Col N="1239" /> implies a more or less static level of capital expenditure by State and public bodies, at around the amount provided for this year.  In reality it implies a reduction in real terms in the level of the State's contribution to capital formation over the period.  The projected increases come from the European Community Structural Funds and from the private sector.  Therefore, this document cannot in any way be held to represent or involve any real, new contribution by Government policy to the development of our economy.</P>
    <P>For a total investment of over £9.5 billion over five years the Government project a gross increase in the number of jobs available in Ireland of between 29,000 and 35,000 per annum.  I think the Taoiseach mentioned a figure of approximately 150,000 gross, over that five-year period.  That clearly assumes a continuing high level of emigration.  Underlying it clearly there is an expectation of a continuing high level of unemployment.  For a total investment that is equal to one and a half times total annual State expenditure, that is a very meagre result. Indeed it could hardly be otherwise since, as far as I can see, the whole planning exercise so far has been approached in a totally inadequate and unsystematic way.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this document cannot be regarded as a national development plan.  I heard the Taoiseach ask that the plan be not criticised for what is not in it. I suppose we could be indulgent and say &ldquo;fair enough, we will not criticise the plan for what is not in it&rdquo; but I can tell you one thing for sure, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Government deserve to be roundly criticised for what is not in the plan.  If we are not to have a go at the plan itself let us hang the responsibility for it on the Government.  A real development plan would deal not only with investment, which is the hardware of the economy, but would also deal with the structure of our economic system, the structure of our tax system and the structure of our social welfare system.  It would deal with the way the labour market works; it would assess the contribution of education to <Col N="1240" /> development; it would look at how competition works in our economy and how it affects our competitiveness both on export markets and in the Irish market. A real development plan would look also at the software of the economy &mdash; the systems that determine the quality and quantity of the output we get from the hardware.  This plan attempts nothing of the kind.</P>
    <P>Maybe we will indulge the Taoiseach's little request by not criticising the plan too much for that because we know the framework in which it is submitted to the European Community, but there is not any evidence anywhere else that the Government are looking at these other elements which must be put in place.  In fact, we have evidence that they do not want to do that.  The accompanying measures which I have described were first set out by my party last January in a comprehensive document covering all of these areas.  These measures and proposals are designed to ensure that we get the maximum benefit from the investment of both Community Funds and domestic funds in our economy.</P>
    <P>These proposals are contained in our Economic Development Bill which is currently before the House.  As I have said, it deals with the areas which are needed as indispensable supports from the investment of Community and national funds. As I have said, the Bill is before the House and the Government have decided, as they seem to do fairly often when any other party in this House bring forward an idea, that they do not want to have anything to do with it.  The Taoiseach on the other hand claimed in his speech today that he is doing all these things when patently he is not.  I call on the Taoiseach and the Government today to abandon the silly, shortsighted and defensive attitude they have taken on the Bill and to recognise that what we propose is a vital indispensable set of accompanying measures without which any investment undertaken here will not realise its full potential.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the document is not a national development plan nor is it, so far as I can see, even a well structured <Col N="1241" /> investment programme.  There is no evidence of any systematic ranking of development priorities.  Neither is there any evidence of any attempt to assess the return on the investments proposed or to compare the effects on employment and economic activity of different sets of investment options.  Nothing in the document suggests that any of the standards and criteria which I put in place for public capital investment projects have been applied to the capital expenditure proposed in this document.  In the absence of any such indication I can only conclude that there is a serious danger that the Irish taxpayer and the European Community taxpayer will not get full value for money in terms of extra output, higher employment and increased living standards in this country.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see how this plan would achieve the objectives set out on page 25 of the document.  Paragraph 2.1.1 states that the plan seeks to prepare the economy to compete successfully in the internal market when it is completed in 1992. We have the investment, the investment plans and the various pieces put in place in the sub-regions, but there is not anything here about the labour market, fiscal policy, tax policy or any of those other areas which will be required to ensure that we compete successfully.  In the same paragraph it is stated that the plan seeks to stimulate the growth needed to reduce unemployment, to raise productivity and to begin to increase per capita income towards average Community levels. Again this deals only with the hardware and not with the other measures that must be put in place to make sure that that hardware and not with the other measures that must be put in place to make sure that that hardware is productive.</P>
    <P>That paragraph also states that the plan seeks to improve further the state of the public finances.  The Taoiseach has pointed out that by 1993 he expects to have an Exchequer borrowing requirement of 3 per cent of GNP, which indeed is a legitimate and laudable target, but this plan will not do it; in fact, this plan is in many ways a result of that particular <Col N="1242" /> objective because, as I have said, it is based around a level of public capital expenditure from domestic sources which is more or less constant in today's money terms, declining slightly in real terms over the period.  This plan is not a cause, it is a result of that particular approach to public finances.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2.1.1 concludes by saying that the plan must seek to accompany economic growth by a greater social dimension in our society.  The Taoiseach cannot have it both ways.  He cannot ask us not to criticise this plan for what is not in it and at the same time claim credit for what is not in it.  There is nothing in this document about an increased social dimension.  Mind you, it is a curious turn of phrase and I wonder what a &ldquo;greater social dimension&rdquo; is, but I think we all get the drift of what is meant.  I think the Taoiseach should accept that that is a bit of &ldquo;bureaucratese&rdquo; that needs to be explained to the ordinary people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would know more about Community bureaucracy than I would.  He was there and he knows how the Community works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, and that is something I will have great pleasure in telling the Irish people when the appropriate moment comes and they will make their choice on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already pointed out that the plan excludes a major part of what is required to prepare the economy to compete successfully in the unified Internal Market. It will not do anything to improve further the state of the public finances and the actions set out will do nothing to ensure that economic growth is accompanied by this greater social dimension.  The State's contribution to total investment expenditure shows very little change compared to current levels.  No account is taken of the very substantial need for the development of our social infrastructure.  This means that any development resulting from this plan will be concentrated in selected sectors and among selected groups and will do nothing to remove divisions in Irish society or to reduce the <Col N="1243" /> alienation being suffered by the poor, the underprivileged and the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>For a Government who are talking about this &ldquo;greater social dimension&rdquo; it is interesting to note that in the preparation of the plan that Government held no consultations whatever with the many groups whose chief concern is precisely that of ensuring a greater social dimension in our society.  It may be argued that regulations governing the Structural Funds, and especially the Regional Development Fund, preclude the inclusion of a great deal of what we would normally describe as social infrastructure, but that is only a very partial answer.  Any plan of productive investment inevitably has social effects and planners must take account of that.  Plans of investment in productive activity clearly &mdash; and this is well known &mdash; can be tailored so as to produce a certain number of desired social effects.  There is no evidence in this document of any thinking along those lines.  Neither does the document give us any indication about what will happen to the remainder of the public capital programme over the period of the plan, if indeed there is a remainder.</P>
    <P>As we all know the public capital programme contains expenditure in a number of areas which are not covered by this plan.  The Taoiseach has mentioned the greater social dimension. What is happening or what is projected to happen to the rest of the Public Capital Programme?  Is that where we must look during that period for this greater social dimension?</P>
    <P>The document before us leaves a great many questions unanswered.  On tourism, for example, paragraph 3.1.13 states:</P>
    <P>... policy would be primarily directed towards supplanting Government expenditure by private-sector investment in the provision of the necessary amenities.</P>
    <P>What that seems to mean in practice is that direct expenditure by the State over <Col N="1244" /> the period will amount to some £40 million.In addition to that it is expected that expenditure by the private sector will suddenly, and for no apparent reason, double from £29 million in 1989, to £58 million in 1990 and that it will remain at this level until 1993.  The document gives no basis for that expectation.  It rightly identifies the importance of niche marketing in tourism development in this country.  That is essential.  The more of that kind of activity we have the better. The more promotion we see of that kind the better.  I am bound to say, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle &mdash; and I think Members of the House would agree with me &mdash; that even though apparently, this has been recognised for the last year or more in terms of the official response of Government and semi-State agencies to tourism, I have not seen it noticeably in any of the promotions.  When I take my Aer Lingus flight, as I do occasionally, to London or Brussels and I read <i>Cara</i> magazine I do not find a lot of niche marketing there.  I do not find much niche marketing in the glossy publication on <i>Ireland Today</i> that we continue to receive from the Department of Foreign Affairs and in which Bord Fáilte are a major actor.  I do not see it in the tourism-based magazines you see around the other capitals of the Community.  I would like to know when this niche marketing will start so that we can begin to benefit from it. The Taoiseach mentioned a number of the various activities.  I am surprised he did not mention any of our equestrian activities but I am sure that is a momentary oversight on his part.</P>
    <P>The document sets out a number of worthy objectives in relation to sea ports and the development of sea freight services. 0In paragraph 3.1.39 it is stated:</P>
    <P>If appropriate transport infrastructure is provided in the hinterland of the west coast ports in Britain, this would further improve the competitiveness of Irish exports to mainland Europe via the landbridge link.</P>
    <P>That is perfectly true.  Following on from that it will obviously be very important <Col N="1245" /> to the success of any investment programmes here that that investment activity is carried out in the hinterlands of the west coast ports in Britain.  I would like to know what plans there are to follow this up effectively and to persuade or cajole or coax the UK authorities into putting that corresponding investment into their own programme.  It will require close consultation and co-operation and a good deal of goodwill between the two sets of authorities.</P>
    <P>Much the same, of course, could be said about the proposal in the document to develop air channels between Ireland and continental Europe.  Not only would that require investment in airport facilities here, it could well require corresponding investment in the airports concerned.  That again is something which would have to be followed up effectively with the authorities concerned.  It is clearly an area where we would need to have the co-operation of the Commission in ensuring that the plans are integrated at the two ends of the air channel in the appropriate way.</P>
    <P>Cross-Border co-operation is dealt with on pages 59 and 60 of the document. What is set out there seems to be fairly sensible and straightforward, if not entirely comprehensive.  However, I take issue with the Government because they do not set out any structure to bring about the desired improvements in co-operation.Last September, in the context of the review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, I proposed that the inter-Government Conference should be given a specific mandate and responsibility in relation to cross-Border aspects of 1992. The Government seem to have taken my point as to the substance if I read correctly what I find in this document.  They should go the rest of the way and now put the mandate in place.  It is not sufficient to say that the Government would, and I quote:</P>
    <P>... now welcome a renewed commitment from the Community that, in the context of the Development Plans which are being submitted by both <Col N="1246" /> Governments, additional encouragement and support will be available for the further development of co-operation on a cross-border and allisland basis.</P>
    <P>That means the support of a specific mandate in the inter-Governmental Conference.Unless a step of that kind is taken that passage in the document before us will remain nothing more than a pious aspiration.</P>
    <P>There is a section in the document, pages 60 to 63, dealing with human resources, education, training and employment.  Here again, a number of very worthy things are said about the objectives of human resource development in the context of expanding employment.But there is no evidence that there has been any reassessment of the structures or of the results of the many programmes run by FÁS.  There are two causes of concern here.  The first is that it has recently come to my attention that the Government initially pitched their request for aid from the European Social Fund for 1989 at too low a level and it required some benevolent assistance from the Commission to avoid a situation where the Government would have sold us short this year.  The second is a much wider concern.  The document before us proposes the expenditure of £1.9 billion over the next five years on training, recruitment and temporary employment programmes.  A separate programme is to be submitted to the Commission relating to measures to combat unemployment and measures to facilitate the occupational integration of young people.  This is another nice little piece of &ldquo;bureaucratese&rdquo;.  These are objectives 3 and 4.  A total of £557 million is apparently envisaged here.</P>
    <P>Those are very substantial sums of money by any standards.  We will be spending all that on training, recruitment, temporary employment schemes, combating long term unemployment and facilitating the occupational integration of young people while at the same time we have reduced our ability to train our young people in our second level schools <Col N="1247" /> and particularly in our vocational schools and community colleges.  I would submit that there is clearly a need for a substantial rethink of policy in this area.</P>
    <P>How many young people are now unemployed because the skills they needed were not available in second level education by reason of there not being the facilities nor the teachers in the local vocational school or community college? How many young people are now being trained in schemes run under the fairly elaborate structure of FÁS who would never need to go near a FÁS training course if our vocational schools and community colleges were properly equipped? We need a fundamental review of policy in that area and we need it quickly.  We should not allow the existence of FÁS and its size and the diversity of its programmes to become an institutional obstacle to the use of funding for vocational training in the most efficient and socially productive way.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to increased Community assistance for certain activities within the educational system.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would ask one of his Ministers who will be speaking over the next few days to explain that in a little more detail.</P>
    <P>There is an air of what I can only describe as unreality about the section of the document which deals with agriculture.The document appears to assume that there will be major changes in the Common Agricultural Policy and that the emphasis will shift to direct income supports.  As we now know, the Community has agreed &mdash; only last Friday &mdash; to a freeze in the level of export supports.  That is no more than the beginning of a major debate in the general agreement on tariffs and freight, a debate in which the other protagonists want to bring about a world reduction in the level of supports leading to their eventual elimination even while they, notably the United States, are taking steps to increase their production levels.  I hope the Government are not simply assuming that that whole process is inevitable and will continue to be as unbalanced as it <Col N="1248" /> looks at present because that would be a criminally negligent approach.</P>
    <P>In relation to agriculture, in both the document itself and in the Taoiseach's speech this afternoon all the right words and the correct phrases are used:</P>
    <P>At farm level, there will be measures to increase efficiency, reduce costs, improve quality and stimulate diversification of production while protecting the environment.  The problems of low farm incomes and of preserving the farming population in disadvantaged areas will be addressed through the maximum use of Compensatory or Headage Payments.</P>
    <P>The Government may not have all that much trouble in preserving the farming population in disadvantaged areas because they seem to find it very difficult to make up their minds on where the disadvantaged areas are.  The Taoiseach said that there will be measures to increase efficiency, reduce costs, improve quality and stimulate diversification of production.  Everybody agrees with that but what does that actually mean for a milk producer, for example, a family farm producing milk with a quota of say 40,000 gallons and perhaps 45 cows? That is not untypical of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>What will we do for such a farm in order to increase efficiency, reduce costs, improve quality and stimulate diversification?  If we increase efficiency on that farm, what will happen to milk production?  It will go up to 45,000 gallons, to 47,000 gallons and to 48,000 gallons.  If it does, we may well reduce <Col N="1249" /> the cost of production per gallon but we will not do a lot for the income of the family and depending on the co-op area they are in, they may find themselves with the milk still going out to the creamery for a number of months during the year, but no cheque coming in because they are getting stuck with the co-responsibility levy.  Let us assume that they find a way of keeping their production at quota and they still need to expand their production.What else will they do?  In some cases that family will be able to run a small sheep operation on the farm, although many of my colleagues know that there is in many parts of the country almost a cultural taboo against running a dairy unit and a sheep enterprise on the same farm.  What are the opportunities for that farming family to do all the wonderful things being presented here?  We talk about agri-tourism as a potential area but have any assessments been made of the full extent of our development capacity in agri-tourism and has any assessment been made other than the most glib statements which are often made, of what is actually required for a farming family of modest means to get into the agri-tourism business?  Most of them would have to build on a substantial addition to their house or build another house on the land.  Capital investment is required there.  Is this document really saying that there will be measures and what will they be, to stimulate diversification of production while protecting the environment?  We need to see some real application of all of this stuff here. This is perfectly good, perfectly laudable and uses all the right words, but it means absolutely nothing until we can see how it will apply in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a good few large tillage farms around my own home.  This is a very specialised area.  What opportunities are there for product diversification for those people when they find the effects of the latest GATT talks beginning to hit their cheques?  Some of them may go into horses, which requires a special skill. They cannot go into milk because they will not get a quota and they cannot go into sugarbeet as there is a quota there <Col N="1250" /> too.  What other options are open to them?  They cannot set aside land, because the current programme in operation would not come even remotely near dealing with a problem on a farm like that.  They might go into beef if they can raise enough capital to buy the calves let alone yearling cattle.  What do these wonderful words mean for that fairly typical medium sized tillage farm in the midlands?  These farms are already so efficient that it is causing them problems.What do measures to stimulate diversification of production mean? There is no indication of any of these measures in this document so we must look at what is in place in the community.It reminds me of the kind of tobacco that Brendan Behan wrote about getting in Borstal, the Three Nuns, none yesterday, none today and none tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 3.3.9 of Chapter 3 of the <i>National Development Plan</i> says:</P>
    <P>The reorganised agricultural research and advisory service (Teagasc) will have a very important part to play in such a programme.  Steps will be taken to ensure that the necessary expertise will be available within the service so that guidance and advice can be provided for local groups undertaking developmental work in their areas.</P>
    <P>That statement is astonishing, especially in the light of the fact that at the beginning of 1987 ACOT and AFT had a staff of 2,193 between them.  Up to today that has been cut by 597.  About 27 per cent of the staff has gone.  These are the steps being taken to ensure that the necessary expertise is available.  The combined budgets of AFT and ACOT in 1987 amounted to £35.5 million.  The budget of Teagasc for this year is £29 million. That is hardly the picture of an organisation that can fulfil the aspirations of this document, unless there is something else that has not been said.  If what the Government intend to say in that document is that we will have this reorganised agricultural research and advisory service as long as the people who use the service are able or are prepared to pay for it, <Col N="1251" /> that at least would be the honest way of presenting it.  To present it in this way obscures more than it reveals, although that seems to be a feature of statements on agricultural matters from the Government lately.</P>
    <P>Something very strange seems to have happened in the drafting of the parts of the document that concerns fisheries.  On page 39, for example, it is stated that the achievement of employment targets in the fisheries sector entails among other things:</P>
    <P>&mdash;tackling major structural weaknesses in the fishing fleet;</P>
    <P>There is no such tackling of major structural weaknesses in the measures listed on page 67 of the document, as being the measures that are required to achieve the objectives of the fishing industry.  I wonder what tackling the major structural weaknesses in the fishing fleet means.</P>

      <P>There are a few major structural weaknesses there, but they have not got much to do with the fleet; more to do with the Minister.  We already know that our fishing fleet is stuck in a capacity trap.  If one is an Irish fisherman one of the most difficult things to try to do is to buy a more modern fishing boat. One must convince all kinds of people that one has sold one's previous boat, that it has gone out of the Community fleet or that it has been destroyed or scuttled or something else and when one has done all that one is still up against the difficulty that the Commission believe that the Irish Government have agreed that we should reduce the total capacity of our fishing fleet, so that even when one has done all that, one is not sure that one will have a modern fishing vessel of the size of the one just disposed of, or a larger one.  There is nothing in practical terms in this document about the tackling of major structural weaknesses in the fishing fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The treatment of environmental <Col N="1252" /> improvement in the document I find extremely sketchy.  There is a brief reference to it under the headings of tourism and agriculture where it is brought in because it is part of the buzz, part of the cadence of what we should normally say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no real evidence of any recognition of the importance of a clean, safe environment to industrial development, to tourism expansion, or to an improvement in the overall quality of life.  There is a good deal in the document about roads, and it is inevitable that that would be the case.  I am sure the Taoiseach knows, however, that those involved in the consultation process, to the extent that they were involved, would not all be exactly in agreement about the relative proportions of the programme being taken up by the roads plan as opposed to others.  I take what the Taoiseach has said in the text about roads as being fairly sensible.  Mind you, I notice that he mentioned three projects in particular in relation to tolling &mdash; I do not know why.  One of them is the Cork Downsteam crossing.  It occurs to me to wonder how many times that Cork Downsteam crossing has been promised.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think it was.  The Taoiseach might surprise me one of these days.  There is one important point I would like to make.  Those projects have been mentioned in the context of tolling and a reference was made to another project in the Dublin area.  There is absolutely no difficulty that I can see in tolling a bridge project.  We see one example already in operation and another in the course of construction.  I would counsel the Taoiseach to approach very carefully the possibility of tolling the Lucan-Kilcock Road or, in particular, the Newbridge-Kilcullen by-pass because these are two by-passes with a link road between them.  If you look at the modern literature on road development, you fairly quickly come to the conclusion that unless it is an exceptional project there is no point in tolling a road project that would be shorter, for example, than a link from Dublin to Portlaoise.  This is for purely practical reasons that have nothing to do with any arguments about the way the project is funded, or who provides the toll plans.  There are difficulties there unless the projects are very special.  I would advise the Taoiseach and the Government to be careful about the way in which they approach this matter.  I would like to see those two projects completed for all sorts of reasons.  They are important to many more regions of the country than my own county.  However, they should be approached with some care.</P>
      <P>This document contains sub-regional programmes &mdash; seven of them.  It is very clear from a reading of the document that those sub-regional plans were put in very much as an afterthought.  My information is that the Government originally had no intention of including the sub-regional plans and they were put in only on the insistence of the Commission.</P>

      <P>Those sub-regional plans are an interesting contrast in style to the <Col N="1255" /> rest of the document, clearly not having been written by the same hand.  All those plans have not been written either by the same hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give a little more information about that aspect in a moment.  That the sub-regional plans have gone in as an afterthought is an acurate reflection of the degree of importance the Government attach to local consultation and local involvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an assertion of the Taoiseach and we should follow it up. Let the Taoiseach listen to the rest.  The presentation is garbled, to say the least. Two different figures are given of the average density of population per square kilometer in the Community.  Reading these chapters, I get the very strong impression that the texts were very substantially rewritten in order to fit in with the tables.  A national document was produced; the national expenditure tables were produced; some process was gone through to spread those out over the regions and then the text had to be fitted into the tables that were put there.  That is not sub-regional planning.  That is not a sub-regional input into the national planning.</P>
      <P>I have been further informed just today that the consultants who were given the job of producing the draft plan for Dublin have now been instructed to revise the draft in order to bring it into concordance with the plan that has been published.  If we needed any further illustration of a total lack of connection between these sub-regional plans and the national plan, that sub-regional plan in draft form was still being discussed on 22 March when this document was put into an envelope and sent off to Brussels.  Nobody can pretend that there is any real connection between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1256" /> Just today, my colleague, Deputy Alan Shatter, got a most interesting answer to a written question.  The question reads:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Finance the working groups and advisory groups in each of the seven designated regions for EC structural funding which have submitted their regional reports; if such reports have not yet been submitted, the date by which it is anticipated that such reports will be received; and if he will ensure that each such regional report will be published.</P>
    <P>The reply he received was as follows:</P>
    <P>Interim reports which contained all information relevant to the preparation of the National Development Plan were submitted on behalf of the seven sub-regional working groups and advisory groups prior to the completion of the plan.  The completed reports of five of the sub-regions have now been submitted.  The report of a further sub-region will be submitted by the end of this week.  Completion of the consultancy report on the Dublin area is continuing and is expected to be finalised later this month.</P>
    <P>No decision has yet been taken as to whether the sub-regional reports will be published.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the left had knows what the right hand is doing.  What is the reality? What connection is there between any of these sub-regional activities and the national plan.  That is an extremely far cry from the picture of perfect vertical and horizontal integration the Taoiseach spoke about during the course of his remarks this afternoon.</P>
    <P>Chapter 5 of the document dealing with the question of implementation, which one would think would be a very important part of a document like this, consists of two pages and a map.  Most of the second page comprises a list of Departments, State agencies and semi-State agencies.  An essential part of the operation of this integrated national plan we are supposed to be preparing here will be the operational programmes and the <Col N="1257" /> operation of those operational programmes in each region.  The Government have nothing to say about these, beyond the very bald statement that these operational programmes will be implemented by Government Departments and that long list of State and semi-State bodies.  No role is given to the regions or to the local authorities other than the subsidiary roles which they perform under the present administration. No role is given to local communities and the Government should re-think in that regard.</P>
    <P>In the course of a recent conversation with Commissioner Millan I was struck by the firmness of his interest in regional involvement in the development and implementation of the operational programme.That is certainly what was intended in the implementing regulations themselves and if the Government set out on the path which is charted &mdash; if that is what one can call it &mdash; in Chapter 5 of this document they will be making a serious error both in terms of securing Commission support for what they are doing and of getting a real local commitment to the essential development process.</P>
    <P>This document, of course, has to go through several further stages which are set out in the document itself.  While all that is going on the business of the European elections will be going on in this country.  I predicted some time ago &mdash; and experience has borne this out &mdash; that in the meantime, while the Commission is examining this and building up the community support framework, the Government or members of the Government party will be exploiting what is in the plan for electoral purposes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not perish the thought.  In the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Tuesday, 4 April, it is stated that there are EC funds for Dublin West, that major benefits for Dublin West will come from EC Structural Funds for 1992.  These were outlined by &mdash; who else &mdash; our favourite local Fianna Fáil Deputy, Liam Lawlor. These funds include more than £7 million <Col N="1258" /> for a rail extension to Clondalkin and Blanchardstown, a £4.4 million improvement to Fonthill Road with a new bus route and an investment of £11 million in rolling stock to be built at Inchicore. Deputy Lawlor did not say that the £4.4 million improvement to Fonthill Road was one of the first victims of this Government's reduction in the road programme in 1987.  If the Government had made a different choice in 1987 the Fonthill Road and that part of the operation would now be in place.  The Taoiseach should have another little chat with Deputy Lawlor as they seem to get along well when they talk to one another.</P>
      <P>I had the experience a few weeks ago of attending a seminar at the Tallaght Community Council when they talked about the various problems in the area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, indeed.  There was an MEP there whom I will not mention by name although she represents Dublin. She produced letters from the Minister for Education assuring her that the line required to get EC funding for the regional and technical college in Tallaght was written into the Government's submission to the European Commission. The &ldquo;crathur&rdquo; seemed to be in blissfull ignorant of the fact that if we build a regional college in Tallaght &mdash; which we should and soon &mdash; by far the greater part of the funding will have to come from national sources because, as I am sure the Taoiseach knows, there is only a limited degree to which a project of that kind comes within the ambit of European funds.  This MEP, a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, is going along with the idea that once we get the 1992 money, the regional college in Tallaght will be built for us by Brussels.  While all that is going on, what will happen to the document before us?  It would take time to read it all out but the Taoiseach stated that the Community support framework has to be developed, that it would be prepared in consultation with the Irish <Col N="1259" /> Government and will set out the priorities included in the National Development Plan for which community assistance will be provided.  It will set out the forms of assistance to be provided; it will set out the indicative financing plan with details of the amount of assistance and its sources and the duration of the assistance.  In other words, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance or anybody else cannot say with any certainty that any single £1 million will be spent on any specific project until the Community support framework has been drawn up.</P>
      <P>The regulations require the Commission to take a decision approving the Community support framework not later than six months after receiving the plan. However, the Taosieach said he is confident that the process can be completed earlier that than, a view shared by the Commissioner in charge of the Regional Fund.  However, I would be prepared to lay any money that no matter how hard the Commission works at it &mdash; and I am quite sure it will do its very best &mdash; it will not be finalised before 15 June.  I warn the general public that there will be a splurge of all kinds of promises in relation to railways, canals and so on, being built all over the place between now and 15 June&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me give another example.  Last Thursday we had the spectacle of An tAire Stáit, An Teachta Donncha Ó Gallachóir, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Pat Gallagher, solemnly promising the people of Tory Island &mdash; the day before this document was published &mdash; that there would be full support from the Government for the planned programme published that day in Tory Island providing for an airstrip, a new harbour with a process called a &ldquo;rock box&rdquo; to be blasted out of the rock, a handball alley, a social and management centre for the operations of the island, the construction of the first phase of self-catering holiday accommodation and a camping site.  The two Ministers of State solemnly assured the people that they had spoken to the Government, had seen drafts of the plan and were quite happy that the things the Tory Island people wanted would be included in it.</P>
      <P>I now turn to Chapter 6 of the plan which deals with sub-regional plans.  I looked for a reference to airports and I found one on page 115.  One of the essential prerequisites is the provision of an adequate infrastructure.  It says that further development of regional airports is important to facilitate tourism growth and other economic activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I then turned to fishing but there is nothing about fishing harbours.  There are statements on fleet modernisation and the development of a fish processing industry but nothing about harbours.  I then turned to Sub-Region 6 and the Table.  North-West includes the major harbour at Killybegs, an airfield already at Carrickfin and Sligo Airport.  The total provision for the five-year period 1989 to 1993 in relation to access transport, sea and air freight, seaports and airports &mdash; remember, we are constructing air bridges to the Continent, better road and port links and re-equipping ports, and <Col N="1261" /> Sligo is an important port in that region&mdash; is £3 million with support of £1.5 million being sought from the European Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>No. It is for access transport, sea and air freight, seaports and airports.  That is the whole lot.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There is nothing at all for harbours.  I wonder how much Tory Island is going to get out of it.  There are 77 broken promises and we are going to see more of that.  The more of it we see the more this Government and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party are going to bring the process of economic planning into utter disrepute.  The Taoiseach should make sure that we do not see much of that over the period because if he does not he is going to end up with a community support framework that is going to have to include an awful lot more than could conceivably be brought in and he is going to end up in a situation which he mentioned himself today.  In the course of his remarks the Taoiseach made a plea &mdash; I think we could call it that.  He said:&ldquo;I would appeal however for a sense of realism and regard for the national interest because that is the basis on which the Government undertook this major exercise&rdquo;.  I would like to see the Taoiseach make sure that that plea is heeded by the members of his own party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, there is an awful lot more that we could say about this document but it will be dealt with over the next couple of days.  The Taoiseach has asked us to take note of it but quite honestly I do not think the Dáil can do anything else but take note of it.  As I said at the very beginning, this debate should have taken place before this document was sent to Brussels.Then we could have debated it, argued about priorities and come to some sensible conclusions on the objectives we want to see achieved, on the priorities and the kind of investment programmes <Col N="1262" /> we want to see.  We are going to have to wait until we see the Community support framework.  There is no point in asking the Dáil to do anything other than note the fact that this document has been sent off and the Government have missed another opportunity for democratic debate by not having the guts to bring it into the House before it was sent off.</P>

      <P>It is hard to be either supportive or enthusiastic about the actual document which the Government have published.  I will not call it a plan because it is not a plan in any real sense of the term.  Once we get past the nice colourful and elaborate cover and the usual list of praiseworthy but vague purposes which the document contains we can find little in the way of detailed targets to be achieved or any clear spelling out of how any particular progress is to be made in any field.  Instead we are presented with an old fashioned listing of general areas where money is to be spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are statements about millions to be spent on roads, tourism, communications, ports, airports and various items.  All of these have no doubt some merit in their own right but what we are not told is how and why these particular projects and the amounts of possible spending mentioned were selected. There are general references to building <Col N="1263" /> so many miles of road or carrying out different projects but there is no attempt to relate the proposed spending to any specific targets or expected results.</P>
    <P>What has happened to the attempts being made for years to introduce some proper system of assessment for public spending, expecially of a capital spending nature?  The ESRI a couple of years ago came to the conclusion in one of their reports that if the capital spending projects of Irish Governments over the previous 25 years had been self-financing, that alone would have put the budget of two years ago into surplus because of the huge amount of money that would have been saved.  It is indicative of the inferior nature of capital spending over the past few decades, in particular its unproductive, unremunerative nature and its almost universal inability to remunerate its own capital.  Time and again we in common with others have called attention to the need for some form of audit to be carried out on State spending which would do more that simply prove that someone had not run away with the money but rather which would look at the whole question of whether value had been got for particular spending, be it current or capital.  This is particularly appropriate and necessary where capital spending is concerned.  Unfortunately, this document does not mention that at all.  There is an assumption that we are going to have a continuation of a system whereby if one can show that one spent the money on something referred to in a document of this kind then that would be sufficient and the fact that one was pouring money down the drain is immaterial and no one is to be held responsible or blameworthy in any way for that.</P>
    <P>We must ask where are the efforts at showing how spending on some project will provide some identifiable contribution, whether by way of financial return, additional output or improved facilities?  In other words, where is the planning, whatever about the plan?  If we are going to spend money on tourism projects, for example, what are the reasons for the particular projects?  Will <Col N="1264" /> they meet some already existing gaps or shortages in our present facilities?  Will they mean new additional capacity to cater for more tourists and offer attractions previously unavailable?  The list could go on and on but the point should be clear by now.  This is not a plan because it does not cater for any of those necessities.</P>
    <P>A plan should meet a number of requirements.  It should first set out a review of the existing situation so as to establish the base or starting point from which we move forward.  Secondly, it should outline, as fully as possible, the likely pattern of future development on the basis of existing trends and policies. This would provide some sort of bench-work for the level of progress expected in the absence of the additional action to be proposed in the plan.  Thirdly, a plan should then spell out the possible options for further action which are open for decision.  Various possible projects should be assembled, the relative merits and demerits of each examined so as to establish an order of priority for undertaking such projects and the overall scale of spending or commitment of resources required to undertake these projects should also be established.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, the possible additional projects identifed in step three should be set alongside the overall circumstances of the economy and assessed in terms of their impact on output, employment, balance of payments, Government finances, regional distribution and other aspects. In this way the scale of any feasible plan can be identified and the appropriate number and pattern of projects from those examined in step three can be selected in order to offer the best prospects for an additional development effott.</P>
    <P>The plan can then be put forward showing why these number and type of projects were selected, indicating the scale of the additional boost they will give to national development by way of extra employment, improved living standards and many other development objectives. I have taken time to spell out briefly these requirements for a satisfactory plan because I believe it important for the <Col N="1265" /> eventual success of the Irish case within the European Community to show why the Government's effort is unsatisfactory and why it is necessary to have in its place a proper planned document.  I can understand why the Government might think they should be reluctant to publish any detailed plan along the lines I have suggested.  If they do, presumably they feel they are offering hostages to political fortune in the sense that by identifying clearly the scale of the extra results they aim to achieve, they provide future critics with ready-made material if the results for any reason fall short of their planned level.  Political prudence can suggest it is preferable to be as vague and general as possible on the grounds that if nothing is clear then nothing can be clearly wrong. Whatever the short term political reasons for that approach, it is not good enough when we are dealing with the future of the nation.  When nothing is clear, nothing can be achieved other than a vague sort of muddling through.  In the American phrase &mdash; if you do not know where you want to go, any road will take you there.  But apart from any of the general reasons which would apply at all times there are particular reasons, on this occasion, that there should be a plan worthy of the name put forward to the EC authorities.</P>
    <P>While the principle of Community support for the development of the poorer areas has long been accepted &mdash; indeed, it was incorporated in the original Rome Treaty &mdash; the process of establishing appropriate arrangements and financial support for such development has been slow, complex and controversial.  The reasons are not difficult to understand. If some member states are to be given financial support, others must pay for it. Before doing so the paying states need to be satisfied about the need, scale and nature of the support to be given.  On the one hand, they want to make sure that financial aid is not used to subsidise industries, for example, which would then compete with their own firms, thereby, perhaps, weakening their own industries. On the other hand they do not wnat to see money spent on irrelevant projects, <Col N="1266" /> which may seem prestigious for the country undertaking them, but which are not really going to help the overall development of the Community &mdash; the modern equivalent of building the pyramids &mdash; or, put more simply, creating white elephants.  So there is a difficult but necessary task to be performed in establishing the type of development projects which should have Community support.</P>
    <P>Infrastructural projects, such as roads, telecommunications and ports, have been acceptable because they can be seen as helping to overcome some of the initial barriers or cost disadvantages which the weaker regions suffer, without at the same time posing any unfair subsidised threat to established industries elsewhere in the Community.</P>
    <P>A second area where Community partners need to be satisfied is that their financial support will indeed be used to aid a greater effort at development, and not simply mean that the national government will cut back their own efforts and substitute Community funds.  This issue of &ldquo;additionality&rdquo; has surrounded debates on regional policy for the past 20 years, and it is still a valid and legitimate concern.  I will return later to this issue in more detail.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, if agreement is reached on appropriate projects, and these are additional development efforts, there is a Community need to be able subsequently to verify that the funds were spent on the agreed programme, and also to establish the extent to which the expected results were achieved or, in the usual case where actual performance differs somewhat from initial expectations, to be able to identify and agree on the reasons for these differences.  In more recent years, Regional Fund activity has been looked at in terms of asking for overall programmes for development, not just shopping lists of individual projects to be financed, and for presenting information in a form so that what are called &ldquo;regional impact assessments&rdquo; could be carried out to review the outcome of any programme.  However, if we ask: &ldquo;Does this represent an additional <Col N="1267" /> effort and, if so, how much?&rdquo; We are faced with some large question marks. What level of development spending do the Government envisage in the absence of the possible additional EC funding?</P>
    <P>I emphasise additional, because there would, presumably, be a continuation of the prevailing level of funding in the absence of this new initiative.</P>
    <P>To answer these questions there should be a proper plan spelling out the main features as I have outlined them, and that plan should spell out the other need, an indication of the results expected from the plan spending, so that the other requirement &mdash; of carrying out some assessment of the impact on regional development &mdash; could be made in later years.</P>
    <P>On the regional question there is, of course, grave disappointment throughout the country at what the Government have done.  They set up, nominally at least, these working groups and advisory groups in each of the seven sub-regions, as they were identified last year.  Then they proceeded at Central Government level to draw up a plan with no reference to what had been done by those groups who worked so hard in the regions.  I will come back to that, but in regard to regional development, quite apart from the EC or any additional funds or anything else, this Government have it entirely within their power to make a significant difference to the regions in this country if they would proceed with a relatively costless programme of decentralisation.This has been talked about since the late seventies.  In a small way it was implemented in two or three places but no substantial work has been done and there has been no substantial transfer of Government Departments from Dublin.  Most of it can be funded privately in the sense that the capital can be arranged through those who will develop it, and it is terribly disappointing to find that after many years of waiting we still do not have it except in some very small instances.  We are administratively the most centralised Government in Europe as far as I can see.  We contrast with <Col N="1268" /> France which has Departments of State all over the country and we contrast with Britain which similarly has decentralised huge Departments.  It is interesting to note that recently, because of the increases in advances in information technology, the Department of Health and Social Security in Britain have been able to decentralise one of the sections of that Department not just out of London but into Derry.  Even though Derry is perhaps the furthest city from London within the UK, there is not the slightest difficulty in operating there. With the kind of technology available today almost anything that relies on information &mdash; and much administrative work does &mdash; can be carried out anywhere. You do not even have to think in terms of cities any longer except perhaps to make it more attractive for people to move there rather than to a rural area.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the question of how the Government have sought to foist the development plan we are discussing today on the Irish public.  There are some very damaging features arising from all of the hype attendant on the recent publication of the plan.  The danger of this kind of political over-kill is that the public's expectations will be inordinately raised and at the end of the day they will find the promises made are totally unrealisable.  This kind of thing only deepens the public cynicism with politics and politicians.</P>
    <P>At the launch the Government sought to represent their so-called plan as a £9 billion investment programme of a spectacular nature to generate 35,000 jobs a year.  Can you blame the average person, if they take this at face value, for imagining that we would never again see a poor day?  But when we look behind this PR hype, what do we find?  What we have got from the Government is, to all intents and purposes, the annual capital budget rolled over for a five-year period.  When this is taken account of, the net picture is that the increased revenue being sought from Brussels is not £9 billion but rather £1.5 billion pounds, with all that spread over five years, in other words, approximately £300 million extra per year.  That, <Col N="1269" /> while obviously welcome if we get it, is a very small sum of money in today's terms when one takes into account the level of expenditure incurred by the State.</P>
    <P>On the job creation front, as for the 35,000 jobs per year promised, it is important to bear in mind that these are gross job projections.  To put them in perspective, let us remember that before this plan was published the gross job projection of the Government was 29,000 per year.  But we know full well that the level of redundancies in Irish industry and services is running at over 23,000 per annum.  As a result there is very little net jobs growth in the economy.  At best we know that the figure is perhaps a few thousand.  On top of that looms the tragedy of large-scale emigration.</P>
    <P>What the much hyped 35,000 jobs nets out at then is nothing more than a possible increase of 6,000 in the number of gross jobs created annually.  But we do not know how many of these jobs will be counter balanced by job losses elsewhere in the Irish economy, e.g. in agriculture. Indeed, we also know that aside from the present unemployment and emigration crises, even the National Development Plan itself projects an annual growth of 25,000 people into the labour market each year between now and the end of the century.</P>
    <P>So, even to contain unemployment at its present appalling level of 18.5 per cent of the workforce, and to contain net emigration at the 32,000 plus figure, the Irish economy would need to generate a net 25,000 new jobs to accommodate the increased numbers coming into the workforce each year.  That is the real perspective against which to judge the gross increase of 6,000 outlined in this plan.</P>
    <P>Some people suggest that the Government are right not to overplay the possible net job creation arising from this plan, but they cannot have it both ways. They cannot on the one hand acknowledge that there is very little job creation in this programme, and, on the other hand, play up this development programme as somehow constituting a spectacular £9 billion investment plan for the <Col N="1270" /> country.  Job creation is the ultimate criterion by which any economic development plan for this country must be judged at a time of mass unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>Like everybody else in this House, I am obviously very concerned that in the run up to full free competition and the free movement of goods, people, capital and services throughout the Community by the end of 1992, Ireland should be well placed to compete.  There are undoubtedly geographic disadvantages and attendant cost penalties which this country must come to terms with if we are to compete on anything like equitable terms with the member states of mainland Europe.</P>
    <P>That is why I certainly do not wish to belittle the amount of money which we are entitled to by way of transfer payments to compensate for these dramatic changes from the richer countries of the Community.  But what I am concerned about is that the money is set down in its real value terms, not in all this political hype, and that it is deployed in the best way possible to prepare this economy for fair and free competition within the EC and also to provide a better future for our workforce, particularly for the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>In this context, the net £300 million annual improved availability of EC funding can be put in stark relief.  It is the very minimum which this country will have to get in the event of full Community tax harmonisation to compensate this country for necessary tax changes arsing from that process alone.  Therefore, the compensatory mechanisms as outlined in this plan are quite paltry.</P>
    <P>We only have to look, for instance, at what has happened one of our primary industries, namely the dairy sector.  They have been made to pay the price of the necessary retrenchment that has had to be forced on the factory farming techniques of mainland Europe.  But that was done at a time when we had not reached optimum output from a grass based dairy sector here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This was one example of successive Irish Governments in the past getting it <Col N="1271" /> wrong.  This brings me back to my central theme today.  A proper economic and social plan for this country has to be carefully worked out; it has to have carefully assessed development programmes prepared and has to have a clear view of the attendant economic developments that can flow from such projects.</P>
    <P>In the seventies, in the initial blast of competition that resulted from our entry to the Community, we saw the casualties that resulted in domestic industrial sectors like car assembly, footwear, clothing and textiles.  Therefore, we have to be very much alive to the implications for this country of total free movement of goods, people, capital and services which will be at our doorstep in a mere threeand-a-half years time.  Will the same thing happen, for example, in services, as happened to many of our domestic protected industries in the immediate aftermath of 1973?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is liable to happen, are we trying to protect ourselves?Are we trying to create employment in other aspects of those services that will not be vulnerable in the way particular types of older industry were vulnerable after 1973?</P>
      <P>There is another parallel which we must draw with our experience after our entry in 1973.  If additional funds begin to become available &mdash; and they are proportionately very modest now compared with what became available throught the CAP after 1973 &mdash; are we going to waste them in the way those additional funds were undoubtedly wasted post-1973? One of the effects of the consumption of those resources post-1973 was that it was inflationary and we paid a very sore price for a very long time for the inflation we created through the unproductive use of that money.  Are we liable to do the same again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most noticeable ways in which those post-1973 resources were ultimately used was in the expansion of State, semi-State and local authority <Col N="1272" /> activities.  They absorbed the resources and they became swollen, as it were, in relation to what they really needed to do. We saw the painful and very expensive process during the past two years of this Government's having to pay out large sums of money which they borrowed from the future projected profits of the Central Bank in order to buy people out of the public service who perhaps should never have been in it in the first place. The tragedy is that it is not necessarily the best people who have stayed.  Many of the best people have gone and it was an added bonus for them to be able to go in the lucrative circumstances in which they did.  We have to remember those lessons from that time and ensure that we do not repeat the same mistakes.</P>
    <P>How could the Government get it right when we have no proper regional policy and when there was no real attempt to involve local representatives at any level, whether elected political representatives of community representatives, or to involve the people who really know what kind of infrastructural and industrial developments are appropriate to the various regions?  Just as this very debate is somewhat academic and too late now to influence the shape of the plan put forward by the Government and already lodged in Brussels, so too there has been a totally unacceptable level of secretiveness and selectivity involved in the preparation of the necessary regional plans which should underpin any national development programme.</P>
    <P>At this stage, now that the national plan has been published and we are told that six out of the seven sub-regional plans are completed, it is fair to ask why have they not been published?  Presumably the Government are not willing to see them published, but I would invite the seven regions concerned to publish it themselves because it is only right that debate should be engendered on these matters and contrasts made between what is in this document and what the ideas at local level were.  It is a pity that they were not published before this debate.  Perhaps some Deputies have some of them available to them and might <Col N="1273" /> make good use of them in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>I have already adverted to the absence of published detailed proposals for the regions.  No doubt Fianna Fáil will indulge in regional PR hype during the course of the European election and for the next two months will seek to camouflage the ignoring of the plans proposed. This, too, will merely add to the public confusion and cynicism.</P>
    <P>Not only was consultation at regional level in the preparation of the Government's <i>National Development Plan</i> totally inadequate and patchy but now we have seen insult added to injury in regard to the treatment of those regional plans. On Monday last <i>The Irish Times</i> carried a report that the regional plans are not even being presented in Brussels, nor is it intended to maintain any regional policy input or monitoring dimension to the unfolding EC structural aid programme over the next five years.</P>
    <P>The transparency of what the Government are about is quite obvious.  Everything will be run from Government offices and, more particularly, from the Department of the Taoiseach, in the administration and deployment of whatever resources emanate from Brussels. Proper planning and economic development is about and for people, yet they are to be ignored and an iron grip will be held from the centre.</P>
    <P>There is no country in western Europe in which the central iron grip is tighter than it is in Ireland.  Even in eastern Europe the traditional centralised iron grip is visibly declining.  This continued over-centralism, which Tom Barrington in particular has identified as perhaps the reason for so many of our ills fundamentally, the lack of democracy in the regions, the lack of any say outside of Merrion Street, is an absolute disgrace. It is an insult to the regions and the people of the regions in every part of this country.  It betrays a lack of sympathy and understanding on the part of this Government with the real needs of the people.  It is a cynical &ldquo;we know best&rdquo; attitude in full flight.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1274" /> Underlying it all is a political gombeenism which wants to ensure that every penny that will emanate from Brussels over the next couple of years, whether by way of continuing programmes and commitments or any added funds, will first be filtered through Government to emerge in the guise of being the responsibility of the present administration and a gift from them in the same way that the national lottery funds were so grossly abused over the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>We have seen the merest genuflection in the direction of a regional input to the Government's plan.  Now that is being dispensed with.  Ordinary communities around the country now know full well how they are regarded by this Government and how they are to be treated as mere supplicants who may or may not be entitled to favours from their overlord in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn briefly to the detailed strategy of the financing of the Government programme.  The European Commission made it clear that the principal of additionality must apply to the increased Structural Funds.  That is to say that it must generate investment above and beyond ongoing Government programmes.</P>
    <P>In that regard, given our budgetary problems here, I accept and agree with the Government's decision to opt for part private sector financing of various projects.The country simply cannot afford unlimited Exchequer-funded public spending.  Unfortunately, the great bulk of the private investment is in industry where it would happen anyway.</P>
    <P>If one refers in particular to page 82, Chapter IV, table 19, one finds that there is a total projected private sector investment over the five-year period of £2,144 million.  Of that £1,930 million is in respect of industry and tourism.  If one looks at the breakdown of that one finds that the totals show that £1,800 million of it relates to industry and only £130 million relates to tourism.  It would be a bad five years indeed if £1,800 million were not invested in industry in this country in the five years to come.  If that is all that is going to be invested, it is <Col N="1275" /> pretty poor.  I recall two years ago one gentleman alone announcing that he was going to spend £260 million, none of which has yet been spent, but there are others who spend actual money and it does not take a great deal for capital intensive projects to amount to £1,800 million in five years.  It is only a little over £300 million a year.</P>
    <P>It is particularly worrying that in tourism only £130 million is projected for capital spending from the private sector in five years.  That is a tiny sum of money, given the shocking state of our tourist industry.  It has never been worse.  It was buoyed up publicly by all these false figures that are given out and which recently were exposed for what they are, when it was discovered that one in 11 of our so-called tourists from Britain are in fact tourists and the other ten out of the 11 are recent emigrants coming home to visit their mothers.  That only £130 million is being spend on the capital side of tourism by those involved in it over the next five years is a sobering thought indeed, because that will not have much impact.</P>
    <P>If one looks at Table VI on page 75 one finds all the other headings: transport, roads, nil; rail and bus, nil; access transport, nil; sea and air freight, sea ports and airports, nil; sanitary and other local services, nil; energy, nil; telecommunications and postal services, nil; vocational training infrastructure, nil; fishery harbours, nil.  There is no private sector investment under the Social Fund, and the remaining part of it is under EAGG.  That amounts to £340 million in the five years, and that is it.  Most of that, when one looks at the breakdown, relates to on-farm investment which is going to take place anyway.  Of the £344 million, £203 million is on farm investment, that is, farmers just making the normal investment they would make in any event.</P>
    <P>Marketing and processing, significantly, is only £86 million.  With all that we hear about it nowadays, with beef, milk, bacon and other areas, I would have thought that it would have called for a lot more than that.  It seems a very low level.  While I welcome the <Col N="1276" /> principle of it, I would ask the Government to try to ensure that more than that will in fact be invested over the next five years.</P>
    <P>It is timely to raise a warning that it is not at all clear that the European Commission will approve matching funds for projects that are promoted by the private sector, small as these figures are.  Money from the Structural Funds to match private sector funding was first raised as a possibility last December but the guidelines remain very unclear.  It is also likely that in the non-industrial areas where private funding hopefully might occur for things like toll roads and tourism projects, a lower level of European Community funding will follow than in areas where the matching funds come directly from the Exchequer.  If the Exchequer has to keep up its funding of the areas mentioned in this programme I have an awful apprehension that the parts of the public capital programme that are not included in this plan will be hit very badly because they will not be under pressure from the European Commission to keep up expenditure there.</P>
    <P>The two areas that one obviously identifies that are part of the normal public capital programme but are not part of this plan, and on which capital spending can be reduced to almost nil if the Government so choose, are health and education.  We need some reassurance during the course of this debate from one of the many Ministers who will be trotted in here to read out their little departmental bit that those two areas are not going to be severely hit because neither can afford it.  When you think of the quality of so many of the schools at present where people have to operate in appalling buildings and the inferior quality of so many of our hospitals and other medical facilities, that would be disastrous.</P>
    <P>We must not lose sight either of what the proposed doubling of the Structural Funds is about.  It is intended as the Community's compensation, as it were, to this country for the adverse effects of 1992. <Col N="1277" /> We must realise that no European Community funding will resolve the difficulties inherent in that departure.  The Government here appear to be totally indifferent to the extensive and rapid change which will be forced on us in the three and a half years between now and the end of 1992 as part of the European Community tax harmonisation programme due to come into operation.  The most obvious area of difficulty for us is the harmonisation of indirect taxes.  I am aware that no final agreement has been reached yet at Community level as to what the appropriate rates should be. However, we know enough to realise that we will be faced with some very difficult choices, in particular with the necessity to bring down our higher 25 per cent VAT rate.  In this regard the Progressive Democrats believe we should commence the exercise as soon as possible.  It is worth bearing in mind, for instance, that earlier this year the Danes started to reduce their higher VAT rate of 22 per cent to 20 per cent.  Clearly they were responding to the demands of 1992 and it is time we did so also.</P>
    <P>My party believe that this is a delicate issue and one that has to be approached with some caution.  I do not believe that the question of tax harmonisation requires that absolutely similar tax rates would apply in all member states but it is obvious that they should lie within a band of difference that would not be an incentive for major loss of trade from this country to others.  The obvious country that we must have in mind in this regard is the United Kingdom with whom we share a land boundary.  I believe what we should do, as phase one of a programme for all European Community tax harmonisation, is opt for local approximation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the United Kingdom. Again let me say, this does not require equal tax arrangements.  The differences must be narrow enough to remove any temptation to significant cross Border smuggling or a major exodus of shoppers from the Republic to the North.  Prices can still fluctuate but within a tolerable margin that will not induce an exodus of shoppers.  One interesting feature of a <Col N="1278" /> bilateral harmonisation with Britain is that both that country and ourselves have zero rated food.  That would leave the possibility of maintaining that zero rating.  Obviously against a background of our penal levels of taxation allied to our huge problem of poverty arising from our unemployment crisis, this is a course which must be given serious consideration.</P>
    <P>While it will be necessary to move a large number of our items which are currently at 25 per cent VAT rate to a lower rate, I do not think we should seek to reduce entirely the top 25 per cent.  For instance, there is a strong case to be made on health grounds for trying to get the British to raise their level of excise duty on both cigarettes and alcohol.  These are outlines of some of the proposals we have in mind to commence the process of gradual tax harmonisation.  What they underline of course is the total absence of action by the Government and indeed a total lack of ideas in this regard.  With every day that passes, time is running our for this country.</P>
    <P>Another area of tremendous laxity which must be addressed at official level is European languages.  Given that we are a country that exports two-thirds of what we produce, it is axiomatic that we should be proficient in the languages of our actual and potential customers.  It is crazy that despite our 16 years membership of the Community to date we rank bottom in the European league in proficiency in other languages.  At present it is reckoned that 17 per cent of the people in Ireland have some knowledge, often slight, of French and 3 per cent have some knowledge of German.  Both those figures are frightening.  There is almost no knowledge of Spanish or Italian and that leaves us firmly and by far in last place among the 12 member states of the Community.  We need a major crash course in European language teaching. We need to see a summer-time exodus of our second level students to the Continent to acquire proficiency in French, German, Spanish and Italian on a par <Col N="1279" /> with the influx we witness from continental countries each year to learn English.</P>
    <P>We must also encourage greater knowledge on the part of Irish business people with the realities of the European marketplace.  It was absolutely appalling to have recently confirmed by the Minister for Labour the decision of the training agency, FÁS, to shortly discontinue the subsidisation of the European orientation programme.  This invaluable programme was started by the Confederation of Irish Industry five years ago to provide business graduates with the opportunity of working on a factory floor in Europe and to acquire language skills there.  This year the CII had been hoping that at least 100 new participants in this course would be taken on.  Due to the cutbacks in funding, a mere 20 people will commence this invaluable programme.Moreover it is intended, as the Minister for Labour recently stated, that FÁS will not undertake any fresh funding.</P>
    <P>If ever there was an example that makes nonsense in practical terms of all the hype about 1992 this is it.  There has been much talk of development plans to enable us to take our place in the free Europe of the nineties where we could exploit the market opportunities that will arise, and then we fail to provide some tiny funding for a programme such as this.  It is a classic case of the kind of general hypocrisy that exists and the difference there is between the reality and the rhetoric in the kind of speeches we heard, for example, from the Taoiseach today, or at the European launch in the National Concert Hall last July and in respect of which, as far as I can see, absolutely nothing has happened since.</P>
    <P>When I commented on this plan last week I mentioned how disappointing it was that there was nothing radical or innovative about it, that our problems are so fundamental that they are somewhat depressing, even in the terms of that plan and that if you are not prepared to question things and to make radical changes <Col N="1280" /> you will not really achieve any success.  I pointed out that the best that plan could hope for, in its own words &mdash; this is the judgement contained in chapter 2 &mdash; was that if all went well we would increase our GDP by up to one-half of 1 per cent more than the Community average.  If that is the case we will achieve what is the average level at the moment of Community prosperity, we will have reached half way up the scale in terms of personal wealth, income and prosperity in 80 years time.  It is said that for every 1 per cent we increase above the Community average we will be brought one year closer and on that basis we will get to the average level &mdash; I am not talking about being as prosperous as the Germans or the Belgians, but the average which would be about the level of the British &mdash; unhappily in 80 years time.  That is depressing but that is according to the programme.</P>
    <P>I find another matter profoundly depressing in relation to the programme and it was repeated by the Taoiseach today.  I give him credit for his honesty in saying and repeating it.  I think he only says it because it is a vague figure that people do not understand.  The Taoiseach said that we had great success in the last two years in curbing the rate of growth of Government borrowing and the rate of growth of the debt-GNP ratio and that we have had after two years stabilised it at approximately 133 per cent.  In other words, our net national debt is 133 per cent of our GNP.  The Taoiseach said that if all goes well, and everything goes as we would wish it to, we will have reduced that in six years time to 120 per cent of our GNP.  I suppose that in a way is a kind of an achievement but then we must ask ourselves what is the European average.The European average is less than 60 per cent.  What is the public debt-GNP ratio of some of our neighbours?  It is 40 per cent and our nearest neighbour has decreased it by 10 percentage points in the last ten years.  Even if we have great success under the plan we will still have in six years time a debt-GNP ratio that will be nearly three times that of our closest neighbour.  We should remember that our closest neighbour is worried <Col N="1281" /> about their position.  That neighbour is worried about a lot of things and seems to worry all the time about the economy. We are certainly not out of the wood by any means and we have got to be more innovative and radical about this.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with one region before I conclude my contribution and I will avoid the temptation that is widespread here of talking about my own region.  I will not deal with Munster but with the Dublin region.  If one reads Chapter 6 one will see that all sorts of great things have been set out for Dublin but they are all part of a public capital programme.  All the usual headings that one normally sees in a public capital programme are included but, lo and behold, in the middle of the Dublin section one sees that one of the big factors that will contribute to the growth and prosperity of Dublin in the next five years is forestry. We are told that a forestry programme will be pursued vigorously in the sub-region and that this will be reflected in increased afforestation and maintenance of the present forest estate with a view to providing increased employment, raw material for industry and improved recreational facilities.</P>

      <P>There are between 200 and 300 acres of forests in the entire region but I do not know what the relevance of that is.  However, from the way the plan has been prepared it appears that there has to be a section on forestry for every sub-region and, therefore, something was lobbed in for Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan deals with the port of Dublin in an absolutely predictable way.  The port of Dublin is very important from two points of view.  It is important from the positive point of view as a port that can contribute to the economic development of Dublin, its hinderland and, indeed, as far as 100 miles away.  It is also very important from a negative point of view because of the awful problems it creates for people who might wish to live in the inner parts of the city.  We should ask ourselves some fundamental questions <Col N="1282" /> about Dublin port.  What is envisaged is that another £30 million or £40 million will be spent there over the next five years.  The port, which was there in a fashion going back to the Vikings but has been there in a serious commercial way since the 18th century, has been moving about half a mile to the east every 50 years.  That process is continuing.  Somebody at Government level, at planning level or at regional level should ask themselves what is the point of retaining that port in its present position?  They should ask if there is any overall net benefit to Dublin in having it there.  They should ask themselves if it is negative to have it there and then consider the position of ports and cities in the rest of the country and in Britain.</P>
    <P>It is worth bearing in mind that the only significant city that still has a port left in the middle of it and that proposes to try to develop that port is Dublin.  In other places they have given up; it has not worked.  Other cities have given up because of the difficulties of trying to work a port with access to it through a city, and the larger the city the more difficult it is.  They have also given up under the kind of social pressures there are from those who would wish to live in the city but cannot because of the unbearable pressures that are created by the kind of traffic that is associated with modern sea ports, where the roads are clogged up and broken up by 30 tonne to 50 tonne trucks that go through it day and night.</P>
    <P>If one looks at Dublin one will see that it is the only city where there is very little residential development on the river. Other cities of a comparable size and type, like Boston, San Francisco, Amsterdam and much larger cities like London, now find that the river is perhaps in amenity and location terms the most valuable place they have.  They have developed it to the full.  Looking at other ports in this country one will see that in cities like Limerick the main action is downstream.  In Cork all the developments are taking place in the lower harbour and moving away from the quays within the city with the result that more <Col N="1283" /> bridges can be built and there is less congestion there.  In Waterford they are about to start to build five miles downstream even though on the face of it they would seem to have room.  There is not as much congestion there as there is in Dublin but they consider it necessary to move downstream.</P>
    <P>We should ask ourselves this question: what is by far the most successful port in this country?  The answer might surprise many of us, particularly those who come from the south.  By far the most successful port in the country is Larne.  Larne, as a container port, handles three times the container traffic to the United Kingdom that is handled by the central corridor ports of Dublin and Dún Laoghaire combined.Twenty-five per cent of the total traffic through Larne either originates in or is destined for the Republic.  A lot of what is going through Larne from here is not simply going to Scotland; it is going to London and on the Continent.  The road distance from Dublin to Manchester via Holyhead, is 115 miles.  The road distance from Dublin to Manchester via Larne and Cairnryan is 380 miles, but there is more traffic using the 380 mile road route than there is using the 115 miles route because it is cheaper and quicker.  There is a lesson to be learned there.</P>
    <P>Dublin cannot cope with the radically changed situation.  Dublin is choking itself in its efforts to do so.  Dublin is choking itself also as a result of the rather luke warm efforts being made by the Government to decentralise their administration.What is the point of condemning Dublin in perpetuity to its present position in relation to its port? Why should Dublin be, in some years time, perhaps one of the very few cities left in Europe that actually has a port within it?  One of the remarkable things about Larne is that it is a privately-owned port.  It has an enormous throughput of trade.  It is hugely efficient and is widely used by all our exporters and importers even though it entails driving many hundreds of miles further to get to one's destination.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1284" /> I wonder would it not be better, from the point of view of Dublin and Ireland as a whole, to think in terms of not continuing the traditional 18th and 19th century-type harbour we have here, in Dublin, with very shallow waters that will not be able to accommodate the large ships now wanting to use it.  Rather should we not think in terms of a purpose-built port somewhere within, say, 20 miles of Dublin?  Presumably it would have to be north of Dublin &mdash; there is really no scope south of Dublin &mdash; somewhere, for example, between Malahide and Balbriggan, and have a purpose-built port in the same way as Larne?  Larne is now far more important than Belfast. There was a time, I suppose even in my lifetime, when Belfast was literally one of the great ports of the world.  Yet look at it now.</P>
    <P>Ringaskiddy, proportionately, will become more important as a port than Cork as clearly will the new development in Waterford.  All the development from now on in the Shannon estuary, portwise, will not be in Limerick city or docks.  We have to face that fact.</P>
    <P>What I say may be fairly obvious in many respects.  When one argues it out I think it is, but it would be regarded, perhaps, in terms of this type of document, as absolutely revolutionary.  There is not even one suggestion of that kind in this document.  We must remember that we cannot plan for a country that is in severe structural and economic difficulties without trying to identify where there are real problems, without saying: &ldquo;Look, we are not going to solve those real problems unless we have a fundamental and radical rethink of some things&rdquo;.  We must not take for granted something which happens to have been there for 50 or 100 years, or whatever period.  We must begin to learn to live with change.  If Northern Ireland today were dependent on Belfast port the pretty shook economy of Northern Ireland would be in a very much worse state.  Indeed, we would be too, because so much of our imports and exports go through Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Let us think in terms of those ports and <Col N="1285" /> the way we approach them.  Obviously Dublin is important.  There cannot but be a port in the greater Dublin area; it would be foolish and, indeed, impossible not to have one.  But why not have a relatively small but highly efficient port on the lines of Larne which has a very fast turnaround, working 24 hours a day? Remember this, when the Channel tunnel opens in 1993 nearly all the ferries operating between Britain and the Continent at present &mdash; certainly those at the southern end of England &mdash; will become redundant.  Then the obvious place for them to come is the Irish Sea, but they are too big.  There is no way they will get into Dublin or Dún Laoghaire, there is just not the requisite depth of water there.  They may or may not be able to get into Rosslare but the demand, particularly for passenger traffic, obviously is into Dublin.  We will have to develop those kinds of ports.  Look at all the new ports there are in Britain, how successful some of them are and how the old ones within cities have declined.  Look at the old port of London, perhaps the most famous in the world in its day.  What is it now?  It is a high-class residential and office area.  It is something to envy; people are happy there; they want to go down and live there.  Indeed, in many respects it is becoming the most fashionable and valuable sector in London.  It is what people want.  Where are the ports? They are all scattered out on the coast. They are all purpose-built and the great majority are very efficient.  They are the kinds of terms in which we should begin to think here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I might make two observations before commencing my analysis of this debate.  As a Member of this House for over ten years, debating something that is perhaps, in the Taoiseach's words, the most important document ever prepared in terms of its economic impact on this country and in terms of our relationship to the European Community, I find it absolutely appalling that the Fourth Estate, or our representatives of the Press, all of whom are paid to be here, most of whom get higher expenses <Col N="1286" /> in order to dine in this establishment than we do, should be totally and utterly absent from the Press Gallery.  It is necessary to put that fact officially on the record of this House &mdash; because none of them will put it on the record in their papers.  As a professional politician &mdash; and I am proud to give myself that title &mdash; I invite the members of the gallery to observe this absence.  As we get so much stick from these people, who accuse us of playing to the gallery, or of being in dereliction of our duties, it is something that should be noted.  If I may so presume, I say that on behalf of all elected politicians.</P>
      <P>Second, I should like to congratulate the Leader of the Progressive Democrats on that portion of his speech I was honoured to hear.  While I would disagree with some elements of it the radicalism and kind of freshness it contained are things we have come to expect from Deputy Desmond O'Malley.  Therefore, it was not surprising but very rewarding to hear.  Tragically, it is in marked contrast to the tired prose, the tired thinking of this purple document, the very exhausted method of political gestation that produced that document.</P>
      <P>I want to divide my comments into four sectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;condemns the failure of the Government to consult Dáil Éireann on the National Development Plan prior to its submission to the European Commission on March 31st; resolves to amend the Plan by taking into account the contributions in the Dáil debate of April 12th &mdash; April 14th 1989 inclusive.  Dáil Éireann further instructs the Government to establish, on a formal and legal basis, the seven <Col N="1287" /> sub-regional working groups and their advisory bodies, so as to provide for an open democratic forum which would actively engage the energies of local and regional community groups throughout the country&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made in the past, and were made today by the Taoiseach in the course of his comprehensive remarks, that anybody who attacked this plan or attacked the Government for its preparation would be in some way out of touch with what was public opinion &mdash; and I take responsibility for that myself &mdash; but, more importantly, would be sabotaging the national interest and undermining the efforts of the Government to do their best in Brussels so that they could bring home to the nation at large the maximum amount of money available for us.  I reject utterly and totally that kind of political intimidation, and I say it as a European of Irish nationality.  The Labour Party have consistently asked this Government &mdash; and I would include also all of the Opposition parties here &mdash; to consult with us and publish in advance of the 31 March deadline the proposals they were preparing so that whatever would go to Brussels would, in so far as possible, have the maximum amount of political support from this House.  The Government have consistently failed to facilitate us in that regard.  The Government Chief Whip had the temerity to suggest that today's business might be ordered in the form of a motion whereby this House would support or endorse the National Development Plan.  I, speaking on behalf of my own Whip because I was present at the meeting, declined on the basis that if such a request had been asked of the Labour Party two to three months in advance we might have been in a position to acquiesce because this plan is very important for all of us.  It is above the petty politics we sometimes engage upon in this political arena and should be bigger than all of us; yet the Government have consistently refused to provide for a democratic political forum which is at the very outset of <Col N="1288" /> the philosophical thinking which produced the idea of social cohesion in the first instance and the doubling of the Structural Funds in the second instance.</P>
    <P>As far back as Thursday, 19 May 1988, the last time on which we debated this central issue, and which was then known as the Cecchini Report, I urged the Government to open up the process of consultation and I stated:</P>
    <P>I want to turn from the market itself and all the implications of the completion of the internal market to the question of social cohesion and the role the Government have in that regard.  I have been appalled at the low level of activity this Government have displayed in the past 18 months in relation to the preparation of work for integrated programmes in the context of the provision for social cohesion and new Structural Funds.  The thing that appalled me most of all is the obsessive secrecy that has surrounded the Government's action in this area.  That secrecy has been maintained because a battle has been fought out within the Government Departments, the Department of Labour, the Department of the Environment, the Department of Health, and to a lesser extent the Minister's own Department and the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I was referring to the Taoiseach's Department.I continued:</P>
    <P>That battle was a struggle for control of the system of operation, management, and design of applications for these new integrated programmes.  It was fought between those Departments and it has been lost by them with disastrous consequences for the Irish citizen.</P>
    <P>I said that on 19 May 1988.  This document is the final testimony to that bitter defeat and the Minister for Energy here present will be aware of what I am referring to because his Department, among others, have been caught in that bloody battle.</P>
    <P>This Government have, for whatever <Col N="1289" /> reason and either consciously or unconsciously, misled the citizens of this State about the way in which this document has been prepared.  The permanent administration which controls this Government &mdash; and I refer specifically to the Department of Finance &mdash; have overridden, over-written and over-ruled the wishes of various Government Departments in relation to how best we could apply to the European Commission for Structural Fund assistance so as to compensate us for the onslaught of competition which will come on 1 January 1993 when the internal market is completed.That is the first general point I wanted to make to this House, and I do not make it with any sense of gratification.This is not a good day for the Irish body politic.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I want to examine the background against which the Community &mdash; which is not noted, when one takes into account Chancellor Kohl and Prime Minister Thatcher, for its sense of social concern &mdash; in return for the completion of the internal market and the removal of all the remaining non-tariff barriers to trade will be the largest single market in terms of purchasing power in the world &mdash; 323 million people with a disposable income away in excess of anything in either the Soviet Union or the United States of America, which are the two comparable States or markets one can refer to.  The trade off for that particular achievement was social cohesion, a French phrase which does not necessarily translate so comfortably into the English language but which, as we understand it, is essentially a sense of social solidarity between the weak and the poor, between the rich on the one hand and the poor on the other and between the strong central core of Europe and the weak peripheral regions.  It will enable those weak peripheral isolated regions of the European Community, which through no fault of their own but through a function of history and geography were disadvantaged from the day the Community started, and indeed in many respects from before that time, to get up to speed and eliminate some of the disadvantages so that they <Col N="1290" /> can play on equal terms in the enlarged internal market.  That is what the doubling of the Structural Funds was about and every penny which will be spent through the Structural Funds should, could, and will only be evaluated in principle in so far as it brings all of those peripheral economies a little bit closer to the even, central field of the European Community.</P>
    <P>That is what was intended and in addition to that the European Commission, based upon the experience it had in relation to the administration in particular of the European Regional Fund in all of the 12 member states which is found to be highly unsatisfactory, said that not only would it double the amount of money in principle but it wanted to change dramatically and radically the way in which that money was spent so as to ensure that national governments did not simply pocket regional funds coming from Brussels at the point of receipt, which was the Department of Finance in all member states, and substitute that revenue for domestic expenditure that would otherwise have to be spent.  Every Department of Finance engaged in the activity of taking money from Brussels, absorbing it into central funds and then announcing that money that was gone to the Department of the Environment, the Department of the Marine or anybody else who was building some kind of infrastructure facility was getting partial assistance and finance from the Department of Finance and by extension from the European Community.  The Commission recognised that the whole object of additionality was not being achieved and that what was happening was a substitution of national spending by national Departments of Finance by the utilisation of European moneys.  The Commission wanted to avoid that.</P>
    <P>I want to formally charge this Government as basically evading that particular objective and, through this very purple document, of proceeding with the age old practice &mdash; and by that I am referring to our advent to the Community in 1973 &mdash; of using EC funds to substitute for national expenditure and of evading the <Col N="1291" /> critical litmus test of additionality which will be the criterion upon which the framework of national support will be adjudicated when this plan is really assessed in Brussels over the next six months. It is appropriate that the Minister for Finance will respond to this debate on Friday afternoon, and I presume the people here present in the House this evening will be in a position to convey to him the comments from the various speakers.  I do not expect the Minister for Finance, in the half hour available to him, to cover everything said in the debate but I have one request to make, and I want to convey it formally to him through the representative of the Government here present, the Minister for Energy: I should like the Minister for Finance on behalf of the Irish Government to refute the allegation I am making, if it can be refuted.  If I am wrong, and it is possible that I am wrong, and it cannot be refuted, I want him to indicate to the House in what way the Irish Government are going to ensure that additionality does take place and that net additional funding occurs so that we can bring this economy up to some level of comparable speed with that of the rest of the European Community so that the objectives of social cohesion and the doubling of the Structural Funds can, in respect of this State, be achieved.  That is the second point I want to make.</P>
    <P>I will make a third point in relation to the way in which this plan was put together.  A Cheann Comhairle, since you have now resumed your responsibilities in the Chair and since you exercised your discipline in respect to requiring the exit of other Members from this House in the earlier part of the day, I will be careful with my language.  I have to say formally to the House that the way in which this Government duped the public &mdash; I think that is an acceptable parliamentary phrase &mdash; into believing that they could, as citizens, have a role in the formulation of the plans for application for assistance from the European Structural Funds was totally irresponsible <Col N="1292" /> and, frankly, gives Government and democracy a bad name.</P>
    <P>I have a full copy of an advertisement which was published in all the national newspapers.  The one I have from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 16 December 1988 entitled &ldquo;Assistance from EC Structural Funds.&rdquo; reads:</P>
    <P>The Government have established Working Groups and consultative Advisory Groups in each of seven areas covering the entire country to prepare programmes for EC Structural Funds. The programmes will cover expenditure in areas such as infrastructure, industry and services, tourism, rural development agriculture and training and will cover a period of five years &mdash; 1989 to 1993.  The final decision as to what proposals will be put forward to Brussels for funding will rest with the Government, who retain the responsibility for co-ordinating the programmes.</P>
    <P>The Groups preparing the programmes will have no power to give grant or other financial aid to any party; this will be a matter for negotiation with the EC Commission...</P>
    <P>It will be necessary to provide matching finance from Irish sources for any development projects proposed.  While Exchequer funding will play a major role here, in certain circumstances local, private or community funds may qualify for matching finance from Brussels.</P>
    <P>Any person or body wishing to make a submission in connection with the preparation of the programme should do so in writing, as soon as possible, to the Department of Finance, Room 319...</P>
    <P>That gives democracy a bad name.  That kind of subterfuge, that kind of invitation to the public led them to believe that they could, in some way, make a contribution to the programme and participate in its formulation.  That is the official advertisement and the hype that went with it was far worse.  There was no reason for the Government to do that.  They misled countless numbers of people and as I <Col N="1293" /> speak there are at least a thousand submissions, from the body of the seven groups, some of them hare-brained but many of them very seriously thought out, which are lying on the floor or resting on the shelves of the Department of Finance and which will never be properly evaluated or taken into account because the working groups to which that advertisement refers were officially disbanded as and from the end of last month.</P>
    <P>On 19 May 1988 the Government exhorted the nation to be prepared for 1992 and at the European campaign which was launched in the National Concert Hall in July 1988 the Taoiseach was very free in his advice telling people how to get their act together and to respond. What was happening in the Department of Finance during that time?  I have already given the quotation from the speech I made at that point.  What was happening?  They took over a year to come up with seven new sub-regional boundaries.  This is the same Department that abolished the regional development organisations at the same time as the Department of the Environment abolished An Foras Forbartha in September 1987.  It took an entire year to come up with new boundaries.  I am not going to go into the logic of the description and the definition of those boundaries.  Some of the logic is hard to follow but time does not permit me to deal with it.  Irrespective of what boundaries they came up with, and Donal Barrington's frequent contributions on the question of regionalism in this country have already been referred to, there were at least six to seven existing regional sub-divisions of this country extant and officially operated, be they the health boards, the ESB, the IDA, Bord Fáilte or whatever.  The Department of Finance had to reinvent the wheel and they took 12 months to do so.  Those boundaries, in some cases, are clearly politically motivated and clearly contradictory.  They were announced in late August 1988, yet by mid-October in the Department of Finance the Government still had not got their act together so much so that because of staff shortages they had to draft in three Army officers to <Col N="1294" /> act as secretaries to three of the working groups which were only then being put in place.  As late as 16 December 1988 they were inviting community groups around the country to submit proposals to prepare for the submission of a development plan to the EC.  This is the Government of competence.  This is the Government who have the biggest effective working majority that this State has ever seen. This is the Government who among its strengths counts the fact that it has the boss totally in control.  We are told that there are no long anguished debates at Cabinet.  The seminar approach to problems solving has been replaced by the boss-cat approach to problem definition and implementation.  There are many advantages to that particular approach when it works.  It would appear in this instance that it has not worked and I want to know why.  This State and the taxpayers of this State have paid upfront somewhere in the region of between £300,000 and £500,000.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance or a Government spokesperson or whoever is appropriate would comment on that.  In the press release which I am issuing I am putting it at approximately £450,000 since the fourth estate is still absent.</P>
    <P>The consultants for the Dublin sub-regional plan were contracted for a fee of £300,000, subject to official correction. The managers in the rest of the Leinster region, excluding Wexford, contracted to pay £30,000 for a document prepared by consultants and none of those documents, other than some of the text that is used in the summary chapters and in Chapter 6 were part and parcel of the submission that went to Brussels.  Again subject to official correction, the EC Commission originally said, &ldquo;if you show you are involving the regions and you are having a horizontal integrated programming planning approach to this exercise we, the Commission, will pay for these studies if you demonstrate that&rdquo;.  I am informed from Brussels &mdash; and I think the House will accept that I have been reasonably accurately informed on this subject over the past nine or ten months &mdash; that the Commission is refusing to pay <Col N="1295" /> for both the Dublin study and the study for the rest of Leinster and, indeed for other studies and that whoever picks up the tab, it will not be Brussels but rather the Irish taxpayer.  Those documents and those studies are now languishing in the various Government Departments, principally the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>There are many issues in Irish politics with which I and the Labour Party can engage the present Administration in order to advance our cause or to diminish the position of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not regard this issue as one of them. This issue is bigger than all of us.  We have enough matters to argue about, enough matters against which we can score points, enough matters domestically which are rightfully and properly our concern and nobody else's but I would respectively submit to the Government, through the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk &mdash; who has now joined us &mdash; that this issue is bigger than all of us.  The Government have demeaned themselves, and the House and possibly injured the real propsects of this nation in the manner in which they have gone about the preparation of this plan.  The tragedy is that they did not have to do it that way.  We might have been on the Government's side and we might have been of considerable help had they trusted us.</P>
    <P>The Government should have trusted us because they trusted just about everybody else &mdash; the Commission, the social partners and the public through this duplicitous advertisement, in fact everybody except the elected representatives. If we had had this debate on a draft document in January or February of this year we would have reinforced the negotiating position of every Irish Minister asking for funding in Brussels.  I know exactly the strength of argument in Brussels if a Minister can say that the entire domestic political process is behind him on an issue.  Tragically the Minister cannot now presume that full support. That is not in the interests of the Government or of the people.</P>
    <P>Since the Taoiseach is not here now &mdash;<Col N="1296" /> I noted that he was not in the best of health, I wish him well physically &mdash; regretably I challenge him on some very misleading statements made today in his speech.  He said:</P>
    <P>The reform of the Community's Structural Funds in the context of the completion of the Internal Market has been finalised, and the new system is now fully operational since 1 January 1989.  The doubling of the resources of the Structural Funds for the less developed regions, is accompanied by a commitment to a special effort for the least prosperous of these regions which, at my insistence, includes this country, and a provision that for these regions the rate of assistance from the funds can be up to 75 per cent.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, Deputy C. J. Haughey, a very eminent Member of this House, suggested that at his insistence Ireland qualified for this kind of regional assistance.  That is not true.  We were there already.  The Taoiseach did not have to insist, and if he did insist at any European Council meeting, then he did enormous damage to this country and to his credibility by insisting that we should get something we already have. Either that is a political lie put in for domestic consumption or it is a an admission of extraordinary incompetence.  I will allow the Ministers, Ministers of State and backbenchers to decide.  I am confused.  The Taoiseach in his speech also said:</P>
      <P>Success in achieving the Community's objectives will require the support of the public and the social partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That refers to social cohesion and the completion of the Internal Market.  I agree with that sentiment and perhaps the Fianna Fáil minority Government would start with the other elected <Col N="1297" /> Members of this House.  The Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>Success in achieving the Community's objectives will require the support of the public and the social partners.  This in turn depends on a commitment to a social dimension directed at ensuring that all Community citizens benefit and that there is a progressive improvement in social standards and working conditions throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach then goes on to talk about the need for consultation and so on.  He also said:</P>
    <P>The Government made careful and effective arrangements for the preparation of this plan.</P>
    <P>The most junior official in the Department of Finance knows that there was chaos in the Department from midDecember until the end of October and that there was a battle royal between eminent civil servants who thought that the European Regional Development Fund under the new arrangements which commenced at the beginning of this year, was basically the same as before and that all that was required were a few telephone calls to Brussels, then one got the cheque in the post and divided it and then told some unfortunate county council official to put up a sign saying that a project was being assisted by the European Regional Fund.  The middle management and some of the younger people were tearing their hair out trying to tell their officials up the line that things had changed.  The Government are trying to say that they made careful and effective arrangements for the preparation of this plan.  That is either misleading or the Taoiseach does not know.  I invite the House to decide, but I am confused.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also said:</P>
    <P>In preparing the plan the Government carried out an unprecedented level of consultation at both national and local regional level.  At national level the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i><Col N="1298" /> were consulted as were a wide spectrum of business, financial and vocational interests.</P>
    <P>That simply did not happen.  I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, on the radio saying that there was that consultation.  I spoke to at least ten county managers who said they were told what might be in the plan.  If one regards Oliver Cromwell's edict of &ldquo;go to Hell or to Connacht&rdquo;, as some form of consultation, then there was consultation.  If one would regard that ultimatum as a satisfactory form of dialogue, then consultation could be deemed to have taken place.</P>
    <P>There was no consultation, in the Oxford dictionary meaning of that word, in relation to this.  I will go further.  In the Central Review Committee, no documents were put on the table because the officials from the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach would not trust them with documents because they might leak them, take them home and read them or might ask people for views and opinions, and people like Opposition Deputies might actually get their hands on them.  Consultation in the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> consisted of back alley type consultation such as, &ldquo;What would you think of such and such? How would you react to such and such?&rdquo; The Taoiseach says there was an unprecedented level of consultation at national, local and regional level.  It is for the House to decide, but I am confused.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the time so I will be selective in the numerous quotations I have identified.  I now turn to something to which the Taoiseach referred.  This was at the core of what the Commission are about in relation to the preparation of these plans, and has not happened but could happen if the Government decided to mend their ways.  There is a certain amount of jargon attached to any type of activity and the European Commission is no stranger to inventing its own.  The negative aspect of the old regional plans was that they were vertically dominated, they came from central government, <Col N="1299" /> there was no consultation and they were operated programme by programme.  It was only about roads, agriculture or airports.There was no complementarity or integration.  What was needed was not a sector by sector operational approach but an integrated programme.  With reference to the way in which this plan is formulated the Taoiseach states:</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is the first time that any National Development Plan as such has had a sub-regional basis and content.The national plan therefore is integrated both vertically and horizontally.Each sector of the economy is inter-related with the other sectors and the sub-regions are integrated with the national plan.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to go along with that official line if it helps our case in Brussels, because I do not want to be accused of national sabotage.  However, frankly, that is not true.  The reason for it being included is that when the Government officials, led by a senior member of the Department of the Taoiseach, went to Brussels with the draft plan published in February and put it on the table for the Commission, they were told across the table that it was inadequate in terms of the way in which it failed to have any regional content.  When that came back to the Department of the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach over-ruled the Department of Finance and ensured that the increases in presumed levels of expenditure, in what is now known as the Marsh draft of the same plan, would take place in the areas of the public sector without the Department of Finance having to increase their commitment to overall expenditure, it was also recognised that they would have to put in some reference to regional planning in order to keep the thing sweet with Brussels.</P>
    <P>To suggest that this purple document achieves the description set out in the quotation to which I have referred, of being integrated both vertically and horizontally, is simply not true, the way that I read it.  If any of the Government speakers today and over the next few days, <Col N="1300" /> with the entire array of expertise in the Department of Finance and other Departments to facilitate busy Ministers, have evidence that I am reading it wrongly, I would be the first person here to ask to be corrected because I want this plan to be a success.  We are looking at vertical progress in relation not just to the national figures set out in the tables in the document but also in the seven regions which are set out.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach states:</P>
    <P>The plan has been published in its entirety...</P>
    <P>That is not so.  The various full, comprehensive documents that were extracted from the seven working groups have not been published and they were supposed to be part of the plan.  Is the Taoiseach misleading the House, or is he ill-informed?  On this point, again, I am confused.  Perhaps the members of the Government might clarify that point for me.</P>
    <P>I do agree with the following quotation: &ldquo;This is the most important financial submission ever made by Ireland to the Community&rdquo;.  Why, therefore has the Taoiseach so traduced the traditions of this House and by-passed the Members, when he could have got full and comprehensive support?  It was a missed opportunity.</P>
    <P>Here is another little paragraph that has been stitched into the Taoiseach's speech so as to reassure Brussels that there was a regional input:</P>
    <P>I draw your attention to this aspect to underline again the seriousness with which we undertook the regional input and our determination to produce a plan which would address the particular needs and aspirations of the different regions of the country.</P>
    <P>A very smart civil servant wrote this speech.  He knows just how vulnerable the Government are in relation to the acceptability of this plan in Brussels over the next six months.  There has been no consultation with the regional groups.  I was at a press conference yesterday in Buswell's Hotel from which the largest <Col N="1301" /> single group of the population &mdash; those in Dublin &mdash; were excluded.  I invite any Member of the House to talk to any member of the advisory groups in the Dublin area.  In population terms alone, that is one million people, plus.  The advisory group meetings were derisory. Maureen Potter is a serious politician when contrasted with the activities of those at those meetings.  Yet, this little piece of insurance is written into the speech: &ldquo;I draw your attention ... again ...&rdquo;.  Either the Taoiseach does not know, or he is misleading the House.  On this matter, as on others, I am confused.</P>
    <P>The speech goes into a massive analysis of the reason that growth in this country will be restricted by the need to keep the public sector finances in control.  I would agree in many respects with that overall analysis.  I disagree about how the products of our economic activity are distributed internally, but external objective reality as it exists cannot be wished away, no matter how much we would like to do so.</P>
    <P>Without getting into an argument about the validity of the particular economic strategy that has the support of 90 per cent of the parties in this House, I want to look at the summary of what the plan actually proposes as described by the Taoiseach.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The plan envisages total expenditure of £9.1 billion over the five year period 1989-1993.  This includes £3.6 billion of public and similar expenditure, £2.1 billion of private sector expenditure and £3.4 billion from the EC Structural Funds.  Details of these expenditures are set out in the plan.</P>
    <P>That is not so.  I compliment the writer or writers of this document.  Whatever else may be the case, full details of these expenditures are not set out in the plan. There are references to the possibility and presumption that private sector expenditure will take place over the order of that period of time.  There is no way in which this Government or, indeed, any other Government in office, can presume how much the private sector will spend in 1991.  Deputy Lawlor, who has far <Col N="1302" /> more professional knowledge of the private sector than I, although we share a certain degree of common knowledge in this area, would concur that you cannot say specifically that £2.1 billion will be spent over the five year period by the private sector.  You may hope it will be spent.  You may make every effort to encourage that, but you cannot say that it definitely will be spent, because we do not control the private sector.</P>

      <P>I advise the Deputy that the Chair would much prefer that he would accept that the Taoiseach and the Government are responsible for this plan, for what it contains, and that no blame should be attached to officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept and appreciate the intervention by the Chair, but I recognise the great contribution that the permanent civil servants have made to successive Governments.  I recognise the hand of skill that has gone into proofreading what might otherwise be a political document.  While the Government are totally and utterly responsible for what is put forward in the House today or on any other day, I must compliment the skill and expertise of those people whose job it is to assist them.</P>
      <P>I want to move from that specific observation about the expectations for the private sector because we do not know yet what kind of inducements will be put in front of that sector to meet this figure. We had some intimation in relation to the publication of the Finance Bill today with regard to 100 per cent capital write-off for road investment.  I have not had time to analyse that, or to let my people come back to me in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to move from the general points to something specific and because of time constraint I am skipping the references to procedures after the submission of the plan.  In the amendment that I have moved on behalf of my party I am asking formally that the Government take into account the proposals, suggestions, or amendments that might be made in the course of this three-day debate so that the plan, as discussed with the Commission in <Col N="1303" /> Brussels, would be suitably altered to take account of these submissions.  In many respects I would hope that the contributions made would be positive and constructive and would strengthen the bargaining hand of the various Government Ministers who are there on our behalf.</P>
    <P>It would appear &mdash; and Deputy Dukes made this point &mdash; that there is not much room for manoeuvre in terms of alteration or amendment.  Perhaps the Government will clarify this because the Taoiseach stated, in regard to the Community support framework, which will be the document that will emerge following the six months' negotiations between the Government and Commission representatives, that the document will indicate how and when we might get money to finance in whole or in part or up to the 75 per cent the various projects we want to undertake.  I do not know how much room for manoeuvre, alteration or variation exists in that area but I earnestly request that the Minister clarifies that point.  They should also consult the Opposition who want to be constructive in suggesting ways of strengthening the Government's bargaining hand in regard to the areas of the plan about which there is no dispute and for which maximum support is sought from all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach identified the nine sectors within the plan and basically analysed what the plan proposes to do in relation to them.  I do not propose to go into all of them for a variety of reasons, including lack of time.  However, I want to concentrate on roads.  A Member of this House, a very flamboyant man from the west, a colleague of the Minister for Energy, has succeeded in confusing himself, his officials and the Order Paper of the House by having at present five Bills on the Floor of the House in different states of disarray.  He has also succeeded in passing an inoperable Act, the multi-storey Act, which the construction engineering industry refuse to implement.  He has run with all kinds of draft legislation <Col N="1304" /> except the one Bill which the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition promised they would introduce, the legal incorporation of the National Roads Authority, which they promised in their manifesto.  On the Order of Business today, Sir, if you can recall that rather traumatic period, in reply to a question ruled in order because it concerned promised legislation, I was told that the heads of the Bill had not yet been cleared.  The Government have been in office for two years and the five Bills on the Floor of the House were drafted before the Minister took office but he has only had time to pass an Act which cannot be implemented.  The heads of the Bill in relation to the National Roads Authority have not yet been cleared.</P>
    <P>Everybody recognises that a country that exports &mdash; I am quoting the Taoiseach's phrase in his speech &mdash; up to three-quarters of what it produces with 96 per cent conveyed by road through bulk freight or roll-on roll-off container traffic, needs a dramatic improvement in its roads infrastructure, particularly in relation to ports.  I should like to particularly compliment the CII who have analysed this over the past few years. Everybody recognises that there is a 200 per cent surcharge or double the transportation costs attached to Irish goods arriving in the central European market compared with the European average. These figures are not disputed and there is a clear necessity to dramatically improve and radically enlarge the roads infrastructure in respect of access to those ports which would enable us to get our goods to the European market without delay.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that this document would have been explicit in that regard but, tragically, it is not.  I understand &mdash; although I am subject to correction &mdash; that the amount of money spent <i>in toto</i> over the five year period on the roads infrastructure will amount to approximately £755 million which represents 23 per cent of the money the Government estimate needs to be spent on our national primary road system to bring it up to comparable EC levels.  On the basis <Col N="1305" /> of that time projection it will take 20 to 25 years before our roads network is comparable with the rest of Europe.  To revert to what I said at the outset of my contribution, the whole purpose of the increase in the Structural Funds is to remove the disparities between the rich centre and the weak periphery.  Either I have misread the plan or the Government are totally offside.  To be honest, I would prefer it to be demonstrated that I had misread the plan.  It may be worse than I fear because when you discount what will come from Europe we will be spending less on roads in 1992 than we are spending this year.  That is crazy thinking.</P>
    <P>There are&mdash;no puns intended&mdash;road-blocks and barriers to accessibility in a number of areas but there are additional barriers and one of them is in the local authority area.  Dublin city and county, from a roads planning point of view, is a disaster.  Deputy Colley represents a constituency in which she has lived for a long time and she will know the saga of the Southern Cross route.  The holy grail search for the alignment of that route goes back as far as 1971.  A former student of mine did his master's thesis as a planning student on the political participatory process in selecting the Southern Cross route in the early seventies.  It is so long ago that he is now the senior official chief planner for Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation but they still have not decided the route.  Am I correct?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support a National Roads Authority because of that.  Indeed the centre of Dublin looks as if it has been visited by the <i>Luftwaffe</i>.  In fact it was visited by the road engineers of Dublin Corporation and the CPO department. We still do not have proper and reasonable access to Dublin port.  I am simply concentrating on roads because they are of critical importance but this document does not grasp that nettle.  There is no specific commitment to the National Roads Authority and the amount of capital proposed is inadequate.  My understanding is that in respect of the <Col N="1306" /> operational programme to which the Taoiseach referred in his speech &mdash; he talks about a separate programme having been submitted to Brussels on roads &mdash; and in respect of Rosslare which is correctly and properly designated as a major port of departure for Irish goods, there is a motorway from Donnybrook Bridge as far as Kilmacanogue, or there will be when the Shankill bypass is completed, and there will be a dual carriageway which will be more than adequate as far as Enniscorthy.  Although recently improved, there is a fairly inadequate road from Enniscorthy to Wexford.  At present there is no way around Wexford and the access roads to Rosslare are simply not adequate, particularly in the vicinity of the port.  Anybody who has driven a car or other vehicle in that area will know what I am talking about.  There is a commitment to have a dual carriageway as far as Enniscorthy, perhaps by 1993, but this is not good enough. There is more money available from Brussels for road development than the amount of money it is proposed to avail of under this plan.  The reason for this is that the Department of Finance have spancelled the amount of investment that would be coming from the public sector.</P>
      <P>The big saviour in all of this &mdash; the Santa Claus of economic hope and development for the &ldquo;soldiers of destiny&rdquo;&mdash;is the private sector.  The Labour Party welcome investment from any quarter, sector or area of finance in the economy. Let us be quite clear about that and let no one accuse me of being against investment, as I am not.  We have been down this road before.  In 1977, in response to the biggest democratic and political bribe since the foundation of the State, with, perhaps, the exception of the Act of Union the expectation was that the private sector would respond and generate all sorts of activities, but they did not do so.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for the Environment, the Taoiseach under the heading &ldquo;Roads and Transport&rdquo; identified four areas where the Government hope the private sector might get involved.  The Taoiseach said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> Before Easter, the Minister for the Environment invited proposals for private investment in the Dublin Ring Road in return for a toll franchise. We expect a positive response to this proposal.  We have also identified three other projects which have potential for private toll-based investment.  These are the Newbridge-Kilcullen by-pass, the Lucan-Kilcock Road and the Cork Downstream Crossing.</P>
    <P>From as far back as 1979 when the toll road legislation was enacted by this House to facilitate investment by the private sector in the East Link Bridge, the Department of the Environment, the Department of Finance and presumably the Department of the Taoiseach, have been carrying out analyses of the fluctuations in and the viability of private sector investment in toll roads.  The experience in Spain and France is that despite the best of inducements the private sector have had to be bailed out by the State simply because the volume was not there.  We have the lowest density of vehicular traffic in Europe and if we seek finance in return for toll revenue then we are on very barren and stony ground.  If after ten years the Government are not aware of these analyses, readily available to me and confirmed in formal memoranda to the previous administration, to the best of my knowledge, particularly by some of the major finance houses who would facilitate this notwithstanding the inducement of the major tax write-off contained in the Finance Bill, then either the Taoiseach is ill-informed or is misleading the House.  Either way I am confused.</P>
    <P>As the time allotted to me is almost up, the final point I wish to make is as follows &mdash; perhaps the Chair might first inform me as to how much time precisely I have left?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not due to conclude until 9.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I will conclude before then as I have had a substantial <Col N="1308" /> run and I do not believe in filling time simply for the sake of it.</P>
      <P>Let me say sincerely to the Minister for Energy, whose political attributes and skills I respect, that the comments I have made, discounting the odd florid party political term, are sincerely offered and are an indication of the way I feel about the way this matter has been handled by the Government during the past 18 months.  I think the Minister would agree that I am not standing on my feet on this issue for the first time.</P>
      <P>I am a citizen of this State and a Member of this House.  I care passionately about the future of this country within the European Community. Together we can do better than this and the Opposition have as much a role to play in the activity of Government as Ministers of whatever administration who have the honour to hold office.  The Minister should trust us and engage our support.He will need it in the lonely corridors of Brussels.  He will need it when he is hours away from home.  It will help him if he can say that all of the House of Representatives of the people of the Republic of Ireland agree that we have to get this extra money for road development, tourism, forestry or whatever.I am simply saying that he should trust us, talk to us and consult with us. He should not set up machinery which would enable us simply to throw brickbats at him &mdash; we can and will do in many other ways just as he threw them at us. That is the nature of democracy but this matter is bigger than all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has said that this is the most important economic submission ever made by this country to the European Community and its implications will be felt by our grandchildren and their children's children, if we get it right. Likewise, the disadvantages will be endured by them if we get it wrong.  Most of the people on this side of the House want to help the Minister to be effecive in this regard.  I take pride in the fact that the voice of an Irish Minister is listened to, with equality and clarity, in the halls of Brussels, whenever that person, whoever he or she may be, speaks.  I say <Col N="1309" /> that honestly and sincerely.  It is for that reason that the Labour Party have proposed an amendment which I would like the Government to accept.  It is in three parts.</P>
    <P>The first part of the amendment condemns the Government for their failure to consult with Dáil Éireann in advance of the submission being made.  Secondly, it asks the Government to take into account the changes and alterations which will be proposed in the course of the next three days.  Other party spokespersons will refer to other ones but I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the total inadequacy of the figure in relation to roads.  I could also allude to the total inadequacy of the figure in relation to language skills and the need to market within Europe, however, I am conscious of the time constraint but others will make that point.  Effectively, no programme has been drawn up in relation to language skills.</P>
    <P>The third part of our amendment states that:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann further instructs the Government to establish, on a formal and legal basis, the seven sub-regional working groups and their advisory bodies, so as to provide for an open democratic forum which would actively engage the energies of local and regional community groups throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Various administrations have been remiss in not having a proper regional planning structure institutionalised.  I have to accept my share of responsibility in respect of this failure.  Therefore, nobody, to quote the Bible, is without sin.  If there was ever a time to seize the opportunity, imposed upon us from outside, surely that time is now.  I am not even going to argue about the configuration of the boundaries of the seven sub-regions.  There have to be boundaries and one will never be 100 per cent happy with the configuration.  What is so perfect about the configuration or the meandering of a river?  What is so perfect about that particular boundary?  There are <Col N="1310" /> seven sub-regions and I am not going to argue about the way they came about.</P>
    <P>Can we now finally formalise them and institutionalise the public representation within those boundaries and get the Government to provide for them on a statutory and legal or independent basis? This would ensure that they do not exist at the whim of the Department of Finance or the Minister of the day and the ongoing process of dialogue and consultation which is at the very heart of the philosophy of the Commission, of the Community and, indeed of President Delors and which is the very essence, in linguistic terms, of what the French refer to as social cohesion could continue. Would the Minister not recognise that the synergy that possibly could be created by the bringing together of those advisory groups, representing the social partners and the various local interests, might very well unleash the very kind of private sector investment aspired to in the Government's document?</P>
    <P>If you were to give to people on the ground the possibility of looking at how investment could take place at local level and how some of that could be matched with funds up to 75 per cent or even 50 per cent, you might get local interests investing in the infrastructural facilities that are needed.  You are not going to get it if the seven chairpersons &mdash; chairmen as they effectively are &mdash; of the seven working groups are all civil servants, all officials of the Department of Finance and all live in Dublin.  Is this regionalism? You will not harness the potential energy that is there by that kind of approach, and you have nothing to fear from it.</P>
    <P>I formally invite the Government to consider constructively &mdash; the wording may be different and they can come back with a different format &mdash; some institutionalisation of a regional structure that would be ongoing over the next five, six or seven years to provide for the spending on the ground to get back to the kind of combination of vertical and horizontal integration to which the Taoiseach referred and which his civil servant scriptwriter <Col N="1311" /> very carefully included in the official speech.</P>
    <P>The reason that amendment is there is that we have to avoid the kind of headline that was in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Monday, 5 December.  The text was written by Frank McDonald and the headline was produced not by him but by the subeditors.It reads: &ldquo;Ireland's Regional Development Plans a Sham&rdquo;.  That is not going to help any Minister in any negotiations in Europe and the Minister can bet his life that this clipping is on file in every interested office in the Commission in Brussels.  I want to remove the possibility of that kind of headline ever appearing in a national newspaper again, and I am inviting the Government to assist me by institutionalising and providing for the kind of structure referred to in our amendment.</P>
    <P>One last thing I want to say leaves me open to the accusation of being slightly parochial, but since I have included it in the press statement that went out with my speech, I think I should, for the purposes of the record, refer to it.  The refusal of the Department of Finance &mdash; or their admonition as I understand it &mdash; in the terms of reference they gave to the consultants for the Dublin region to require at the very outset that the extension of the DART should not or could not be part and parcel of their recommendations, seems to be an outrageous piece of pre-emptive judgment, if that is the correct phrase.  I will find another forum in which to talk about the necessity for having the DART and a proper public transport system in the Dublin area.  This is not the time or the place for such a discussion.  The Department of Finance hired consultants with taxpayers' money &mdash;consultants who were eminent in their own field &mdash; and then told them what conclusions they could not come to.  That seems to be a perversion of the natural course of activity.  If that is true, I want it to be reversed because I believe the extension of the DART is the correct thing to do but if it is not true, that assertion should be removed.</P>
    <P>I recognise that I have been given <Col N="1312" /> extensive time which is not often available to a Deputy in this House.  I have tried to be as constructive and informative as possible, but I want to leave one last impression with the Minister &mdash; and I mean this sincerely.  This thing is much bigger than all of us.  He has belittled himself and the Irish people by the way he has treated this matter to date but that process does not have to continue.  He can be better, bigger and more courageous and in so doing not only will he enhance the position of this Administration but he will secure the future for a whole generation of Irish people who can get more from the Structural Funds than this tired and purple document is purporting to apply for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Smith) Minister for Energy (Mr. Smith)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>The five year National Development Plan submitted to the European Commission three weeks ago represents the most comprehensive, integrated, medium-term development plan ever drawn up for this country.  All aspects of the economy are covered, including the productive sectors, infrastructure, human resources and the environment.  A wide body of opinion was canvassed at national and local levels in drawing up this plan and the contributions made proved both informative and highly valuable in framing this important document.</P>
      <P>The central objectives of the plan are to prepare the economy to compete successfully in the new enlarged Single Market of 1992 and to stimulate economic growth which in turn will reduce unemployment, raise productivity and contribute to an increase in <i>per capita</i> income towards average Community levels.  It will thus hasten our progress towards closer economic and social cohesion with the rest of the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a general level, the plan highlights Ireland's socio-economic state of development in a clear, realistic and frank manner.  It spells out the drawbacks which we all know exist.  It identifies unambiguously the concerted efforts already embarked upon by this Government to address those drawbacks.  The <Col N="1313" /> plan's realism and frankness are, perhaps, among its most striking features. As we face into the competitive European environment post-1992 there is no point in trying to sweep our problems &ldquo;under the carpet&rdquo;.  There is no point in putting a &ldquo;gloss&rdquo; on our difficulties or in attempting to view our economy through rose tinted glasses.  We must face up to the problems and challenges which lie ahead.  We have a duty to ensure that the ground is properly prepared, that foundations are solidly laid so that underlying economic conditions facilitate our commercial, industrial and agricultural sectors to flourish and develop with confidence.</P>
    <P>Indeed, as the plan rightly points out, we have already made considerable progress in getting the fundamentals in this economy to turn in our favour through the policies pursued by this Government. These policies are based on the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which has been underway now for two years and which will continue to be adhered to.  The success will continue.  Implementation of this programme to date has seen many benefits for the economy &mdash; the debt/GNP ratio has been stabilised, interest rates have fallen dramatically, business confidence has been restored, investment has increased, cost and price trends have moderated and economic activity and employment have recovered. All this was, and is, of course essential for the economic and social development of the country in any event, but in the context of 1992 and the Single Market it takes on an added and significant dimension.In this sense the Government began preparing the economy for 1992 long before now and the comprehensive National Development Plan now with the Commission is just one further step &mdash; albeit a vitally important one &mdash; in that process.</P>
    <P>The plan recognises that the European Community has a major role to play in supplementing our own efforts towards increased economic development, through the opportunities offered by the Single Market and the links between it <Col N="1314" /> and the increased resources of the Structural Funds.  The allocations of Structural Fund resources have been carefully dovetailed with the macro and sectoral economic policies being pursued by this Government.  These funds represent a major additional benefit for the Government's programme.  The mix of domestic policies and funds deployment is designed with a view to maintaining the momentum in growth and job creation already achieved.  Such a mix optimises the value from our national expenditure. These goals are clearly reflected in the investment levels set out in the plan.</P>
    <P>Total State expenditure under the plan, including expenditure by public and local bodies, over the five years will be more than £3.6 billion.  This averages at about £723 million per year. Associated private sector investment in connection with certain planned programmes will amount to £2.14 billion. The contribution sought from the Structural Funds to supplement this major expenditure programme over five years is in excess of £3.3 billion, rising from £423 million in 1989 to £801 million in 1993.  This will bring total investment under the plan to an unprecedented £9.11 billion.  These investments will be targeted at specific strategic areas of the economy.  Details of the expenditure will be set out in the operational programme.</P>
    <P>The areas to be covered by operational programmes &mdash; there are nine in all &mdash; have already been agreed with the Commission and the developmental measures to be pursued through these programmes are at one with the basic objectives of the enlarged Structural Funds, namely, the development and structural adjustment of Ireland as a region, the conversion of areas in industrial decline, the promotion of rural development and the speeding up of adjustments in agricultural structures. The operational programmes being submitted to the Commission will describe how the planned investments will be implemented.</P>
    <P>Objectives three and four of the Structural Funds which deal with measures to combat long-term unemployment and to facilitate the occupational integration of <Col N="1315" /> young people will be the subject of a separate plan to be submitted to the European Commission in accordance with its own separate time-table.  The plan and the operational programme are designed to address our economic and infrastructural deficiencies under the headings I have just mentioned.  As I have already said, our difficulties are dealt with frankly and honestly in the plan.  Many of these are quite stark when we compare ourselves with Europe. Some are due to structural weaknesses within the economy which have been with us for many years, while others stem from our geographical location on the periphery of Europe.</P>
    <P>The main disparities of the Irish economy compared with the rest of Europe are set out in the plan.  We have low income and output levels.  In 1987, GNP <i>per capita</i> was only 58 per cent of the Community average and only 40 per cent of that of the five richest regions of the Community.</P>
    <P>Our population structure is such that the proportion of persons in the dependent age groups is 66 per cent, compared to the Community average of about 50 per cent.  The economic disadvantages of this high dependency ratio are further compounded by our relatively high level of unemployment which is about seven percentage points higher than the comparable Community average.  The weak rate of labour demand is further reflected in the pace of outward migration which has been accelerating in recent years.</P>
    <P>At the end of 1989 our national debt was equivalent to 133 per cent of GNP, well in excess of the EC average of 60 per cent.  Despite progress to date in stabilising this ratio, our debt situation will continue to limit our ability to pursue budgetary and economic policies capable of achieving progress towards economic and social cohesion.  On the other hand, correcting the imbalances in the public finances is in itself a prerequisite for achieving cohesive objectives.  Nevertheless, as the expenditure figures in the plan clearly demonstrate, there will be a sustained high level of State and public <Col N="1316" /> investment in key areas and sectors in tandem with our aims for the public finances.</P>
    <P>Our industry suffers a number of cost disadvantages due to our island location on the periphery of Europe.  Our export costs, for example, are about double those of member states trading on the European mainland.  Imports are similarly affected.  Our geographical isolation from mainland Europe also accentuates the deficiencies and disadvantages of our major infrastructural networks, some of which are relatively underdeveloped compared to other member states. Ireland has a high dependence on agriculture and food related industry.  We are therefore particularly vulnerable to changes in the CAP.</P>
    <P>The plan also refers to other structural weaknesses of the Irish economy which will be addressed such as industrial structures, low investment levels, the particularly low level of development of border areas and the protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>Through the implementation of an integrated set of operational programmes, the plan should see economic growth rise in this country by over 3 per cent per annum and we conservatively estimate new employment to be created at a rate of 35,000 jobs per annum on average over the period of the plan.  The plan also aims to reduce the debt/GNP ratio to about 120 per cent and the Exchequer borrowing requirement to around 3 per cent of GNP by 1993 compared with 5.3 per cent this year.</P>
    <P>The increased resources available from the Structural Funds and the measures set out in this plan should not be seen as isolated developments; they are taking place against a background of fundamental change in the environment in which the Irish economy operates and the completion of the Single Market will open up many opportunities and challenges for Irish industry.  This plan, supported on the one hand by appropriate domestic disciplines and on the other by increased Community resources, has the ultimate aim of enabling less prosperous <Col N="1317" /> regions such as Ireland to compete effectively in this market, and will assist our industry and other sectors of the economy to grasp those opportunities and meet the challenges that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>The national plan also shows the planned expenditure for each of the seven sub-national regions into which the country was divided for the purpose of consultation with local and regional interests.  One such region, in which I have a particular interest, is the mid-west comprising counties Clare, Limerick, South Offaly, North Tipperary and North Kerry.  As with all sub-regions, the consultation process in the mid-west involved the main bodies concerned with development of the region, the local authorities, State agencies and Government Departments operating through a working group and an advisory group.</P>
    <P>Total expenditure in this region under the plan will exceed £1 billion and over £370 million of this is being sought in aid from the European Community.  Investments in the region will have, as their prime objective, the enlargement of the mid-west's productive and employment capacity, protection of the environment, the revitalisation of areas where population has been declining and, generally, to improve the quality of life of all the people of the mid-west.</P>
    <P>Within this overall objective, a number of sub-objectives have been established concerning five principal areas of activity &mdash; industry and traded services, tourism, rural development, supporting infrastructure and human resources.</P>
    <P>The mid-west already has a wide and diverse range of economic resources and no single sector holds the &ldquo;magic key&rdquo; to future economic growth in the region. Resources, therefore, need to be targeted at a number of strategic sectors which have potential for further growth and which, in turn, will stimulate activity and employment in other areas.  This calls for a multi-pronged strategy which will capitalise on the inherent strengths of the region and overcome its weaknesses.</P>
    <P>The planned development of the midwestern region will therefore be achieved <Col N="1318" /> through the adoption of key strategies in the following areas:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Industrial and Traded Sectors: This will involve an integrated approach involving industry, education and research designed to promote investment, build stronger companies, build and maintain a supportive climate for industry to prosper and to exploit the value added of the mid-west's natural resources.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Tourism: There is a need for a concerted drive to improve this region's competitive position in both the domestic and international tourism markets.To this end, the strategy for tourism is to create unified packages of special interest and activity holidays and to promote these holidays in a coherent manner.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Natural Resources: This covers a number of related and important areas involving agriculture, peat development, forestry, fisheries and the promotion of rural enterprise.  For example, the strategy for agriculture will involve product quality, reducing production costs and diversifying farm production.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Supporting Infrastructure and the Environment: Basic infrastructure and the quality of the environment must be preserved and improved.  These are central elements which enhance the development prospects of other sectors such as industry and tourism.  The main areas for improvement include roads, transport and communications links. Selective environmental upgrading measures will also be undertaken.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Human Resources: The mid-west's greatest asset is its people and we must strive to ensure that they have the necessary education and training to play their full role in the rapidly changing work environment being brought about by technological changes.</P>
    <P>I believe that this co-ordinated and integrated approach to the development needs of the mid-west will greatly enhance its ability to grasp and make the most of all available opportunities for further economic growth, not only in the <Col N="1319" /> Irish context, but also in the wider European arena.  Above all, I see the strategies which I have just summarised as leading to greater employment and prosperity for all the people of the mid-west.</P>
    <P>I would like to move on now to the aspects of the plan for which I have responsibility.  The plan proposes a major forestry programme costing £233 million over five years which will be implemented by the State forestry company, Coillte Teoranta, and private sector interests.  Of this, £89 million is being sought in EC aid from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund.  It is proposed under the forestry programme to double current annual planting levels to 30,000 hectares by 1993 construct about 750km of forest roads to facilitate economic exploitation, increase marketing and harvesting programmes to two million cubic metres by 1993 and implement amenity programmes for recreational and tourism purposes.  My colleague, Deputy Liam Aylward, the Minister of State for Forestry, will be speaking on the forestry aspects of the plan during the course of this debate and he will cover this sector in more detail.</P>
    <P>Under the energy programme, total planned investment over the five year period is close to £0.5 billion, rising from £80 million this year to £120 million in 1993.  This represents over 5 per cent of the total plan investment and 13 per cent of the total State and public sector contribution under the plan.  As far as the European Regional Development Fund is concerned, the energy investments represent 21 per cent of total State and public sector expenditure under this Fund heading.  These high proportions indicate the importance we attach to energy developments in the light of the cohesion objective of 1992.</P>
    <P>Energy is fundamental to all sectors of the Irish economy and our objectives as set out in the plan are: to develop the energy supply systems to meet the demands of the economy; to maximise energy security and reduce dependence on oil in energy supplies; to improve the price competitiveness of energy supplies, <Col N="1320" /> and to integrate Ireland's electricity and gas systems with European networks. The bulk of the planned energy investments will be targeted at infrastructural improvements and developments designed to help meet these objectives.</P>
    <P>Much has been done over the past few years to improve our energy infrastructures.Let me summarise briefly where we stand at the moment.</P>
    <P>Our electricity system now has considerable in-built flexibility enabling a choice of fuels to be made at any particular time to take advantage of changing market circumstances.  This is attributable mainly to the increased use of natural gas and the commissioning of the 900 MW coal-fired power station at Moneypoint.  Dependence on oil for electricity generating purposes has been reduced substantially in recent years and, in fact, in 1988 only 8 per cent of electricity was generated from oil.  In 1979 it was over 70 per cent.  At an electricity demand growth rate of about 3 per cent per annum, there will be no need for further investment in new generating plant until the turn of the century.</P>
    <P>While our generating capacity is adequate in the medium term, the same cannot be said of much of our large and dispersed transmission and distribution systems.  To illustrate this, it should be noted that system demand and unit sales have increased by over 100 per cent since 1970.  However, only 35 per cent of the distribution system and 40 per cent of the transmission network have been constructed since that time.  Considerable investments will be needed in these systems to modernise them and to provide a reliable supply for existing and new customers.</P>
    <P>Natural gas is Ireland's newest fuel and is now supplying a number of major urban centres, including Dublin.  Large investments have been made in developing a transmission system from scratch to bring this native, clean source of energy to consumers in the industrial, commercial and domestic sectors.  A 400 km network of high pressure lines now links the Kinsale field with Cork, Limerick, <Col N="1321" /> Waterford, Clonmel, Dublin and Dundalk and with a number of smaller locations.  There have also been substantial expenditures on the town distribution systems over the last few years, many parts of which date back to the last century.  If the potential growth of the gas market is not to be limited, much further modernisation and reinforcement of these systems is required so that the benefits of this indigenous resource can be enjoyed by greater numbers in the economy.</P>
    <P>The development of peat resources on the scale which is found in this country is unique within the European Community. The total area of bog in Bord na Móna's ownership is now just over 88,000 hectares.The board are engaged primarily in the production of milled peat for power generation, the manufacture of briquettes and the production of moss peat for the horticultural market.</P>
    <P>To date, Ireland has found no commercial oil reserves of its own.  We do however, for strategic and security reasons, have a refining capability at Whitegate.  This refinery supplies 35 per cent of the Irish market for certain refined products and, to do this, it operates at about 50 per cent capacity.</P>
    <P>We also have a large oil storage facility at Whiddy Island in Bantry with a capacity of over seven million barrels of oil.  The State took over this facility from Gulf Oil in 1986.  Subject to the provision of new mooring facilities at the terminal, this asset has potential for use in international oil storage, trading and transshipment.</P>
    <P>Investments are needed to upgrade the Whitegate refinery to a modern competitive status and to reactivate the Whiddy oil terminal.  However, the question of financing these investments remains to be settled so they are not adverted to in the plan.  The source of funding for the necessary investments will be determined by the form and scheduling of the modernisation package put in place and is likely to involve private sector investment.  As you know, I am investigating a number of possibilities in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1322" /> We are all aware of the recent difficulties arising from the response of the oil companies to the imposition of a price freeze on certain petroleum products.  I have already highlighted the Government's concern at the evolution of industrial costs in the economy.  Trends in energy prices are a very important determinant in this regard.  The reduction of energy costs is a key concern within the energy programme outlined in this plan. The Government intend that costs within the semi-State energy sector will be kept to the lowest possible level.  The containment of price increases within the private sector oil segment is of no less importance.</P>
    <P>There are of course, many other facets of the Irish energy scene which I have not mentioned, for example, the retail sale of oil products, the importation and distribution of coal and LPG, both of which are in the private sector domain.  There is also the subject of our vigorous approach to the offshore exploration effort which had a recent encouraging result and the Government's promotion of improved energy efficiency and conservation.This latter is, of course, an underlying aim of almost all energy investments.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to dwell today on these other energy matters important though they are.  Given the context of this debate, it would be more fruitful to concentrate on the particular energy aspects of the plan itself and to expand on the reasons for their inclusion and the benefits that can be expected.  Another reason for pursuing this line stems from the background under which the plan was prepared, namely, the overall objectives which the Structural Funds themselves are designed to achieve.</P>
    <P>While Ireland has made considerable progress in the energy sector over the past few years, the scope for further development may be hindered due to a number of absolute disadvantages compared to other member states.</P>
    <P>The energy investments referred to in the plan are designed to help alleviate these disadvantages and to enable our consumers, in all sectors, to have access <Col N="1323" /> to adequate and secure energy supplies under satisfactory economic conditions, which is one of the prerequisites for economic growth and cohesion.  There are a number of specific problems in the energy sectors which I have already referred to and which need to be addressed over the coming years.</P>
    <P>Due to our geographical isolation from mainland Europe, our electricity system must be self-sufficient.  There must be enough capacity to meet peak demands as well as the average demand for electricity.There must also be an adequate level of reserve capacity to cater for plant breakdowns and the ESB must plan the loading of their plant to incorporate &ldquo;spinning&rdquo; reserve to provide for selfrescue in the event of the largest generating unit suffering breakdown.  The ESB's choice of generating fuels cannot be based solely on economics and while they have the capacity for using a wide range of fuels, they must in their day-today operations, build into their plans an appropriate level of fuel mix for reasons of security of supply.  They are also unable to participate in the growing European trade in electricity.  These disadvantages result in higher capital and operating costs than would be necessary for a similar European utility.</P>
    <P>Added to these, Ireland has only a small capacity for cheap hydro-electric power.  Our low population density and large rural network result in high transmission and distribution costs that affect the tariffs charged to Irish industry and other productive customers.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned already, much of the transmission and distribution systems were built prior to 1970 when the demand to be met was very different to what it is today.  We can expect even further growth in electricity demand was a consequence of implementing the overall national plan.  This will involve the ESB in a programme of modernisation and expansion to cater for economic growth, industrialisation and increasing consumer demand.  While a certain amount of work will be required on the transmission network, the priority for attention will be <Col N="1324" /> the distribution system which serves over 1.2 million customers.  This system must be strengthened and expanded to provide for increased supply to existing customers and to supply new customers.</P>
    <P>The main structural disadvantages in the natural gas area relative to our EC partners stem from the lateness of development of this industry in Ireland and the scale of the industry based, as it is, on just a single source of supply.</P>
    <P>As in the case of electricity, it is the gas distribution systems rather than the transmission network which will be the priority areas for further modernisation and expansion programmes.  Many of these systems were in a poor state resulting in inefficiencies and gas losses.  Programmes of repair and replacement are underway in all gas supply areas, including Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Clonmel.</P>
    <P>From the commercial point of view, the long-term viability of the Irish gas industry depends, among other things, on increasing the volume of sales to the premium sectors which include the domestic market and the smaller industrial and commercial/service sectors at minimum cost.  The modernisation of existing distribution networks will, of course, assist in this effort but it will also be necessary to achieve even higher premium sales by supplying more customers within the catchment areas of existing networks and by extending those networks where justified on economic grounds.  The energy programme over the next five years will cater for these developments.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the disadvantages suffered by energy consumers due to Ireland's isolation from the electricity and gas grids of other member states.  There is a growing trade in electricity across national borders through interconnecting systems on mainland Europe and with the UK.  Ireland is the only EC country not connected with another member state.  As the UK is already linked to France, a link between ourselves and the UK would effectively link Ireland to the rest of Europe.  Without such a link, the question of free trade <Col N="1325" /> in electricity within Europe, which is currently under discussion at EC level, would only be of academic interest to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the case of natural gas, a vast European gas transmission network now encompasses almost all of continental Europe but, as yet, there is no pipeline link between the UK and the European grid and Ireland's isolation from both the UK and Europe is even more pronounced.  The plan provides for investments in these two important areas. A study conducted by my Department last year showed that there were compelling arguments in favour of ending our isolation in respect of these two energy sources.</P>
    <P>I must point out, however, that these are two major investment projects in their own right and it is for this reason that they have been shown separately in the plan's projections.  The lead time involved for projects of this nature goes beyond the five years covered by the plan which only shows investment up to 1993. By their nature also, projects of this magnitude can be influenced in terms of their cost, phasing, timing etc. by events both at home and abroad.  For example, it is not clear to what extent, if any, the proposed privatisation of the UK electricity network might influence the various factors involved in developing an electricity link with that country.  The proving up of additional commercial gas reserves off our own shores may influence the timing of both types of interconnectors.</P>
    <P>The energy situation, as always, is a dynamic one and I will be keeping all aspects of this matter under constant review.</P>
    <P>Peat development in Ireland is critically important not only because of the significant contribution which this indigenous resource makes to our overall energy requirements but also because of the contribution which this labour intensive industry makes to the local, rural economies in which it is based.  Successive Irish Governments have been mindful of both these aspects of the industry since <Col N="1326" /> the establishment of Bord na Móna in 1946.</P>
    <P>The main product produced by the board is milled peat which accounts for over 90 per cent of total volume supply. Given the dramatic changes in the world energy markets in recent years it has become essential for Bord na Móna to produce this product at lower cost and a number of measures are being pursued with this aim in mind.  As the House knows, the board are currently involved in a rationalisation of its workforce to improve productivity and reduce costs.</P>
    <P>There is also a need, however, to investigate means of reducing the weather dependency of milled peat harvesting operations.  Current harvesting methods require reasonably good, dry weather. Irish weather patterns have proved largely irregular and unpredictable and an unprecedented succession of bad harvesting seasons over the past few years compounded the financial problems already experienced by the industry.</P>
    <P>In an effort to reduce the impact of bad weather, a programme of testing and development of new concepts in milling, ridging and harvesting with new prototype machines and methods is now underway and the indications to date are that significant improvements in production efficiencies can be achieved.  If, following further testing and evaluation, the new system proves to be technically and commercially successful, a decision to change over to the new production technology will be made.  This would allow for an increased production area, increased yield and a greater saleability of stocks as well as better quality milled peat for power stations and briquette factories.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude by emphasising the important role of energy in this national plan.  The planned energy investments will contribute to overall economic growth by ensuring that adequate and secure supplies of energy are available to all sectors of the economy in the most cost effective manner.  This requires that disparities and weaknesses within the energy supply system be eliminated to the maximum extent possible and that development expenditure is targeted on <Col N="1327" /> the provision of fundamental infrastructures and facilities which will in turn contribute to and assist the promotion of economic growth throughout all regions of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear that I cannot be as complimentary as the last speaker about this document.  It is a very flexible document and somewhat like the Bible in that it can be quoted by disparate groups with disparate objectives to meet all situations at all times.  It can be referred to at any time over the next four years and from it can be gleaned some element which will allay criticism that might arise in the case of objectives that have not been achieved.  Reference to the good book will infer that provision has been made for that matter.  If the objective has been achieved it is stated in the book and if the objective has not been achieved there is provision for that also in the great book.  It meets all requirements, embodies everything and is all-embracing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty with all such publications is that they are inclined to be platitudinal, to say the least, with little inspiration and a great deal more aspiration and the latter is what this book most contains.  It is vague and is similar to some of its predecessors in the sense that <i>The Way Forward</i> contained many of the clichés in this document.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> contained many similar statements which have now been rephased, redrafted and put into a new form which is a consumer product, obviously for consumption in the course of the Euro elections.It will be a very useful handbook when the Government party are canvassing and massaging the electorate at the various doorsteps throughout the country.  The canvassers no doubt will be able to refer to the words in the good book and say: &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, <Col N="1328" /> on this basis we will proceed for the next four years and we will achieve the Utopia we have often referred to but so far have never even glimpsed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The objectives are vague and, as I said, earlier, by their vagueness there is a great weakness.  It is far better to be absolutely precise in the various areas rather than coming along with old, well-worn clichés like those in Chapter 6 in relation to sub-region 7, the midlands-east, the area in which I live.  I hope you will pardon me, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for being a little parochial but all of us who are politicians have to be that way from time to time, otherwise we might fall the same way as the good book.  For instance, on page 119, under the heading, &ldquo;Industry and internationally traded services&rdquo; paragraph 5b. states:</P>
    <P>The strategy will build on the industrial stengths and traditions in the sub-region.Paticular emphasis will be placed on the food industry, and on the electronic, mechanical engineering, textiles, health products, apparel and furniture industries.</P>
    <P>Amazingly some of those industries have suffered dramatically over the last number of years and they must be about to receive an unprecedented revival if we are going to achieve the objectives as set out in the plan.</P>
    <P>The plan also refers to the food industry.In that area I am more than a little concerned that of the much vaunted plan for the expansion and the creation of jobs in the food industry to the extent of between 5,000 and 6,000 jobs over a five year period, about 200 jobs have been provided so far and two years of that five year plan have already gone.  There are three years left in which the Government have time to provide the remaining 5,000 or so jobs.  I would honestly and earnestly say that I hope a little more success greets the further onslaught in that area.</P>
    <P>Another problem I have with this document is the inter-dependency of many of the objectives.  It appears that if one objective is achieved it is possible that something else will be achieved in <Col N="1329" /> another sector, but if one objective is not achieved it is possible that the entire programme will be thrown out of kilter. We will then have to deal with a different set of inter-dependencies which may lead to the fragmentation of the plan.  If we were dealing with a plan which did not depend on funding from outside the State, as this does, such a system would not be too bad, but if there is fragmentation or a failure to meet objectives, the entire plan will be weakened with the result that two years or so down the road we may be asked questions from other quarters which will not be complimentary to us.  It would have been better if we had had an open debate on the programme before it was submitted to Europe.  Public representatives at national and local level should have had an opportunity of giving their views on the plan.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that we will receive funding from Europe in the coming years based on the plan.  It has been suggested that steering committees, regional programme managers and others were involved in its preparation and I accept that they had an input.  No one is doubting that those people did not work hard and were determined to succeed, but they were frustrated by the lack of a coherent approach and feedback from the Government.They did not have an opportunity to research their subject and present a worthwhile submission to the meetings. If they had been given that opportunity the document before us would be of greater value to the House and the country.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that it took so long to produce the plan for the different regions.  It is worth recalling that up to about 18 months ago regional development authorities existed throughout the country.  They had collected a wealth of information from local authorities and that information is on computer.  As a result it should have been easy to prepare a plan for the different regions.  However, the Minister for the Environment at the stroke of a pen abolished those authorities. It appeared to us, mere mortals, that he had no further use for such bodies and that there was no proposal to prepare <Col N="1330" /> regional plans.  However, officials of the various Departments one year after those bodies were abolished have had to divide the country into different regions and to go to a lot of trouble and expense doing work that had been done in the past by regional development authorities.  Those bodies worked reasonably well bearing in mind the meagre resources made available to them.  The Minister was wrong to abolish those authorities merely for the purpose of saving money.  Since then there has been a change in attitude.</P>

As a former member of a regional development organisation I must say that their suggestions were never heeded.  The Minister should not have abolished them.</P>
      <P>There may be sufficient in the document to whet the appetite of the electorate, at least during the course of the elections to the European Parliament, but whether there is sufficient to assuage our fears remains to be seen.  I hope the plan does not turn out to be a mirage and that people will be asking questions about it within a short time.</P>

    <P>I should like to deal with the proposals in regard to education contained in the plan.  Deputy O'Malley, and others, have referred to that topic.  I should like to point out to the House that parents in my county have to pay the local secondary school for tution in German, a class that started some years ago and was proving successful.  We all recognise the importance of European languages but there is little encouragement to schools to organise classes in them.  The different Government Departments seem to operate from watertight compartments to such an extent that one does not know what the other is doing.  It is wrong that parents should have to pay for tution in German but it appears that will remain the case. <Col N="1331" /> The odd thing about this is that in Germany, France, Spain, Italy and elsewhere there is a great emphasis on the teaching of foreign languages.  Children are sent here and to England to improve their English.</P>
    <P>These is a determination in those countries that the children will be able to communicate with other countries in the Community.  Surely we are capable of producing a plan to deal with the teaching of continental languages.  We should decide once and for all that we are going to do something about European languages.We should give our young people who intend working in other EC countries the basic ingredient they need, an ability to communicate with other Europeans in their own language.  The plan has failed to grasp that nettle.</P>
    <P>The plan refers to transport costs. Many factors contribute to our high transport costs, such as our poor roads system, high excise duty on fuel and the basic units and delays at ports.  Many of those costs can be reduced.  I should like to compliment the Confederation of Irish Industry for calling on the Government to ensure that we have an adequate road network to help industry, with particular reference to access to ports.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from that, there is another roads structure which seems to have been forgotten, one which I mentioned on countless occasions in this House.  It is not possible to locate all industry or services on a national primary route.  It is not possible to locate all of the population within easy access to a national primary route.  Particularly in the eastern sub-region, No. 7, there are still large pockets of population which do not have ready access to a national primary route of any consequence.  As a result they are besotted by the continued appearance of a terrible problem that has surrounded them in the form of an absolutely inadequate local roads system.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that we have heard all of that before.  We have, but we have done nothing about it.  If we look at the contents of this document in relation to our local roads system, we find that <Col N="1332" /> the moneys proposed to be spent in that area are totally inadequate at this point. The moneys proposed for non-national roads in sub-region No. 7, Midlands East, are totally inadequate.  The total sum provided for there &mdash; which, if you like, is an aspirational sum &mdash; is about one-fifth of what is required over a five-year period or one-fourth over a four-year period. Here I am speaking on the basis of the information made available to the various local authorities.  When this document was being drawn up it was a great pity that some of us were not given the opportunity of a debate in this House, or some similar type debate, to point that out beforehand.  There is not much sense in talking about it now.  The plan has already been submitted to the powers-that-be in Brussels and, at this stage, we can do nothing to change it.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that somewhat more emphasis was not placed on that type of roads network.  I realise the reasons for that.  If we are to increase output, boost industry and increase employment, emphasis must be placed on the national primary routes.  But the balance must be struck also of ensuring that people who happen to be unfortunate enough to live in rural areas, who must depend on an inadequate, local roads network service, are catered for.  It must be remembered that they have rights also.  I am sorry to dwell on that issue and I apologise to the Minister for berating him again in regard to this issue.</P>

If the Minister thinks that money is sufficient I would invite him to come on a trip with me any day he likes on any of the roads I have <Col N="1333" /> mentioned in County Kildare.  I am sure his colleagues in Counties Meath, Wicklow and the various other counties in the eastern sub-region, will bring him on similar trips when he can arrive at his conclusion of the amount of money required to put those roads in a proper state of repair.  If the Minister does not believe me he can ask the various county engineers of the local authorities involved, or the relevant county managers, what they have to say about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the alleged steady growth in industry in relation to tourism, to which Deputy Desmond O'Malley also referred.  He rightly pointed out something I said in this House some three months ago, that the people we now call tourists, two years ago were part of our indigenous population, working and attempting to live in this country.  They now find themselves part of the tourist statistics to which we refer, part of a new growth sector, because approximately 120,000 of them left the country in the past two years. They are checked in as tourists at our seaports and airports.  They come in for St. Patrick's Day, the Easter holidays, the summer holidays, Christmas and on other occasions.  It is no wonder that Dublin Airport has shown the second highest growth rate of any European airport.That is simply because the greater proportion of our population now live outside the State than ever did in the history of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1334" /> In terms of achievement, I sincerely hope that the four years proposed under the terms of this plan will achieve somewhat more than has been achieved in the past two years.  Otherwise we will need more seaports and airports to cater for those so-called tourists.</P>
    <P>With regard to national tourism at a more local level, or with regard to indigenous tourists and the provision of facilities and amenities to cater for the large growing urban population that exists, again in sub-region 7 I should have much preferred to have seen greater detail in the plan.  I have been critical of many parts of it.  However, I have noted that it does contain a commitment to tourism which is reasonable.  Whether that commitment will be put to best use remains to be seen.  Suffice it to say that, in the eastern region there are inland waterways &mdash; I speak now as a public representative of a non-maritime county &mdash; canals and rivers, all of which can be readily utilised and adapted for amenity purposes, something which has been done to a very minor extent only so far. There is a great deal of scope there.  I hope that those involved will ensure that such facilities are developed to their maximum potential as quickly as possible and not just await 1993 to achieve that objective.  Not alone must we cater for our people at home but we must cater for those who come from, say, France, Germany, the Scandinavian countries, people who have been coming here steadily in recent years and who will return only if such services are provided.  They will have no wish to return unless such services are provided.  It should be our objective to avail of the opportunities that present themselves to us to provide those services for them, thus improving our international image as a tourist country.</P>
    <P>I might refer again to our national primary routes.  The Minister indicated that one of the proposed national primary routes, the N4, was suitable as a toll road.  I have doubts whether it would be successful as a toll road.  However, I am glad to note that we are moving in the <Col N="1335" /> direction of the implementation of that plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be built, with or without the toll, and there is good interest being shown in it.  The Deputy will be pleased to hear that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is something that has been needed for many years in order to alleviate a major traffic bottleneck.  Its absence caused terrible problems on the other minor roads in the vicinity for the simple reason that traffic had to be diverted in order to gain access to the capital, and so on.  I would assume that that provision was inserted purely to placate me.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Likewise, the Minister, who travels along that route also.  Likewise, the Kilcullen or Newbridge by-pass roads are necessary and I am glad to note have been included in the plan.  Had they not been included I would have had something to say.  It is reasonable to assume that, within the terms of the plan, we will go a considerable way towards their completion.  As a result, transport costs to the towns they by-pass will be considerably more attractive from an investment point of view.</P>
      <P>I should also like to refer to another matter which does not concern my constituency or the sub-region.  The Western Ring Road in the Dublin area will be of tremendous benefit to industrialists both on the County Meath side and County Wicklow side of the county and it will enable those who wish to get to ports, etc., to traverse around the city fairly quickly.  I do not want to detain the House very long because I know there are other speakers and my time is running out fairly quickly.</P>

      <P>With regard to 1992 and 1993 and all that entails, we must be in a position to capitalise on the forward movement of the economies in Europe. We must remember that European economies, when compared with the USA and Japan and more especially with the EFTA countries, are considerably behind in terms of income <i>per capita</i> and that we in turn are even further behind our European colleagues in terms of income <i>per capita</i>.  If we are to achieve parity with our colleagues in Europe, which is a first step, we must provide the basic structure here and now which will enable our people to become employed and our industrialists to invest, give employment and provide various services.  If we do not do this we will be left further behind.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made in the document to the development of the food industry and the potential for job creation in that industry.  These are rapidly changing times in the food industry.  Rationalisation is taking place in the dairy industry, the meat industry and the bread baking industry.  There are one or two points I should like to make in this regard. I sincerely hope that we do not arrive at a juncture whereby rationalisation will be utilised to eliminate competition with the result that the consumer at the end of the day will find himself or herself in a worse off position when the competition is eliminated.That is not what Europe or 1992 is all about and I sincerely hope we do not fall into that trap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies in relation to the dairy industry.  It is worth remembering at this juncture &mdash; I am not making political points about any particular organisation or individual involved &mdash; that there have been a number of take-overs or mergers in the dairy industry in the past couple of years.  This is not a bad thing.  It is progressive and can be useful but a number of companies who have also gone public and the industry itself will become increasingly vulnerable if more development of that type takes <Col N="1337" /> place.  I sincerely hope that those companies do not become vulnerable to take-overs from interests outside the State and over which the producers and consumers in this country will have no control at all. I do not have sufficient time in this debate to go into that area but I just wanted to draw the attention of the House to it in the hope that at some stage somebody will address it.  One way to address this issue, and not everybody will agree with me &mdash; I know the Minister for Agriculture and Food does not agree with me &mdash; is to draw up procedures and guidelines to ensure that cannibalism does not break out within that industry as this would not be beneficial or desirable from the point of view of consumers, producers and exporters in this country.  It is essential that some format be drawn up whereby regulations are introduced to ensure that over the next couple of years the industry will evolve in such a way as to protect our producers and consumers and especially our exporters in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to discuss the National Development Plan with Deputies.  I propose to deal mainly with those matters which fall within my area of responsibility as well as dealing in a special way with the west sub-region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I should stress that the measures set out in the National Development Plan cannot be viewed in isolation from recent developments which have taken place here at home. When this Government came into office the economic picture was very grim.  We faced a national debt in excess of £24 billion, a debt which had more than doubled in just four years.  The entire public sector debt represented an astonishing 165 per cent of GNP, one of the highest ratios within the OECD.  High interest rates were sapping the economy and added to that, national output in 1986 was lower than it had been in 1980 when other economies had shown steady and prolonged growth.  There was no export growth in 1986, there was a 4.5 per cent <Col N="1338" /> drop in construction activity and investment fell by 2.5 per cent while interest rates were on the way up again.</P>
    <P>Within two years this Government have shown tangible results.  Inflation was reduced to less than half the UK rate and below the forecast rate for all OECD countries in 1988 &mdash; at 2.1 per cent on average for 1988 it represented the lowest inflation rate since 1960.  The recent evidence of a slight pick-up in inflation must be kept in perspective.  Our overall annual inflation rate &mdash; at 3.3 per cent as at mid-February 1989 &mdash; compares well with our main trading partners and with the EC average of 4.8 per cent as at January 1989.  In particular our rate is still less than half the UK rate.  Exports achieved another all time high in 1988 reaching £12 billion.</P>
    <P>Our recent economic growth has confounded the economists who had been predicting that the budgetary measures would have a negative effect on the economy.Our ambitious targets on the Exchequer borrowing requirement have been met to an extent which probably surpasses all other economies in this respect.  Further evidence of continued economic recovery is provided by last week's Exchequer returns.</P>
    <P>The response of the Opposition in the House thus far in the debate on the National Development Plan says more about the nature of the Opposition within the Dáil than it says about the plan.  Let me put it this way.  If you see a man on a football pitch kicking a ball well, you are seeing strategy, tactics which have been worked out and skill.  You are seeing something which is active, something which drives the game forward and something which has a purpose attached to it. If you see a man kicking in response to a doctor's hammer on his knee what you are seeing is a reflex action.  There is no thought or control involved and it has no significance other than the fact that there is life there.  The politics of reflex action is what we have been getting from the Opposition for some time now but it has been epitomised more so than ever by what we have heard so far in this debate.</P>
    <P>We all appreciate that an Opposition <Col N="1339" /> have a duty and that they see it as their duty to oppose.  It is not the Opposition's duty to merely react, it is not their duty to detract and it is certainly not their duty to seek for failure when national success is possible, and the Government are achieving that success.  When we came to power it seemed enough just to arrest the Coalition disaster we found there and to help our economy survive but now it is time to go further.  It is time to seek for success and to put the strategies in place which will allow us to attain greater and further success.</P>
    <P>That is what this national plan does.  It is clear, it is concise, it is credible and it is coherent.  It is coherent both nationally and regionally and the timing of this plan must be right.  In the plan we are talking about real money for real programmes, a foundation for future prosperity, a foundation that can be set for job creation and a foundation for better living standards.The plan is clearly all those things. The national plan has been well received at EC level and has been endorsed at home by industry, by political and economic commentators and by all those who write knowledgeably about national, economic and social matters.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Medication for Psychiatric Out-patients.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for selecting this item out of a large range of issues which were raised for the Adjournment today.  The issue is of importance.  I am raising it on the Adjournment because of the unsatisfactory replies I received at Question Time on 15 March when I raised the matter with the Minister for Health.  I want to make it clear what the issue is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Psychiatric out-patients who previously received free of charge the drugs and medicines they required to live in their communities are now being charged for these medicines.  The health board <Col N="1340" /> officials involved state categorically and repeatedly that this is a direct result of the cutbacks in the moneys provided by the Government for the service.</P>
    <P>Treatment for psychiatric patients has always been free of charge, both for inpatients and out-patients.  Indeed, it could be said that the charges to which I am now referring are a first for the present Minister amongst all previous Ministers.  The basis for providing such service for psychiatric patients is contained in the General Health Acts, in the 1945 and subsequent Mental Health Acts and specifically for out-patients in section 56 (1) (a) of the Health Act, 1970, which states:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this section &ldquo;outpatient services&rdquo; means institutional services other than in-patient services provided at, or by persons attached to, a hospital or home and institutional services provided at a laboratory, clinic, health centre or similar premises, but does not include&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the giving of any drug, medicine or other preparation, except where it is administered to the patient direct by a person providing the service or is for psychiatric treatment,....</P>
    <P>Thereby, it is established that psychiatric patients are recognised as the weakest in our community and are, therefore, afforded special legal protection and free medical care.  Despite this recognition psychiatry has always been the Cinderella of the medical specialities.  The vast majority of people suffering from psychiatric illnesses are from poor backgrounds.To establish this point the <i>Psychiatric Services, Planning for the Future Report 1984</i>, demonstrates that out of the three higher grades of income groups per 100,000 persons there are 1,717 psychiatric patients and in the three lower groups there are 8,491 psychiatric patients per 100,000; that demonstrates one of the major problems attached to psychiatry and the way it has been treated.  The vast majority of people suffering from such maladies are from poor backgrounds.  As a result there is no <Col N="1341" /> money in psychiatry.  It is not fashionable or profitable.</P>
    <P>I want especially to congratulate tonight the medical staff, the nursing staff, the administrative staff and the health boards who carry out the services for psychiatric patients without it being fashionable or profitable.  I am very mindful of the fact that their conditions of work are equally as bad as the living conditions for the patients.  Traditionally we have dealt with psychiatric out-patients by simply locking them away behind high walls where they were forgotten, unseen and unloved by their own, and were not even visited.</P>
    <P>My experience as a health board member demonstrated very clearly the Dickensian type conditions in which we keep our psychiatric patients.  These institutions were neglected, under-funded, under-staffed and over-crowded.  Buildings were literally falling asunder and there was the occasional outcry, for example, when the ceiling fell down on patients in St. Brendan's Hospital.  The worst example I have seen in my time was in St. Ita's, Portrane.  I remember there was a large barn which served as a kitchen and lorries could drive in as there was no door.  As a result birds flew into that kitchen and as there was no ceiling they perched on the rafters and their droppings fell on the plates of food being prepared for patients.  The conditions in the wards of that hospital could be described as barbaric.</P>
    <P>After one visiting committee meeting which I attended as a member of the health board I remember writing to the Minister's predecessor, the Taoiseach &mdash; because I would not be back there again for 12 months and would have no real opportunity of raising the matter &mdash; notifying him of the conditions I found there. I must give him credit because I understand he arrived at that hospital and examined the matter for himself and there has been a vast improvement since. I will give him credit for initiating that procedure.  About the same time it was regarded &mdash; and I would put a question mark after it &mdash; as great progress that the high walls were knocked down, padded <Col N="1342" /> cells were by and large dispensed with and straitjackets were no longer used. Because of the understaffing and the overcrowding this led to a régime, which I witnessed, of high doses of behaviour controlling and shaping drugs.</P>
    <P>I do not believe these drugs had any medicinal purpose but they did have the effect of transforming the patients into literally walking zombies.  They did not know whether it was day or night, whether they were coming or going, where they were, who they were or in whose company they were.  They became institutionalised arising from that and from previous treatments to such a degree that they had no knowledge of ordinary things.  The knew nothing about money, shops, purchases or the preparation of food.</P>
    <P>At that time I also witnessed an experiment in St. Brendan's, Grangegorman. This was an EC funded pilot scheme where selected patients had their intake of drugs reduced on a progressive basis in a different type of environment in the grounds of St. Brendan's.  The results of that experiment were near miraculous. People were transformed &mdash; and we should never forget that they are human beings &mdash; from a drug-induced constant stupor to knowing human beings who simply needed care.  There is a very large question mark over the use of such behaviour-shaping drugs.  There is a question as to whether they are simply therapeutic or whether they are used for managerial or custodial purposes.  In the present circumstances of under staffing and over crowding such drugs are being used for managerial purposes rather than for the treatment of patients.</P>
    <P>However, an extension of that experiment led to a new enlightened era in the treatment of psychiatric patients, which came to be known as the community based service.  Highlighted in the <i>Planning for the Future Psychiatric Services Report</i>, 1984 to which I referred earlier was the proposition that patients were to be treated in their own homes and in sheltered housing outside of the institutions and that half-way houses between <Col N="1343" /> the institutions and the community were to be provided, with house fathers.</P>
    <P>In my constituency I have seen the success of that programme but an essential part of it was that drugs were to be provided as required to enable the patients to live in the communities.  They were to be provided without charge.  That programme has led to quite a large increase in the number of outpatients. Section 56 (1) (a) of the 1970 Health Act gives legal protection and a right to such drugs to patients, but now we discover that there is a discrimination between one area and another in the treatment of patients.  South Kildare is covered by another health board, despite the fact that we are in the Eastern Health Board and our patients are attended to by St. Dympna's in Carlow.  Outpatients there have to pay for their drugs.  Those in north Kildare are dealt with in the Eastern Health Board area and outpatients do not have to pay for their drugs.  Why do one set of patients, because of geographical location not have to pay for their drugs and others because of the whim of the health board's CEO or because he has not sufficient money to provide the service, have to pay?  That is not a fair distinction.</P>
    <P>On 15 March 1989 in reply to my question the Minister said in the House that the question as to whether drugs are provided free of charge was a matter of clinical judgment.  I do not understand what the Minister, who is a doctor, meant by that.  Surely it is not good therapy, or any therapy, to insist that a patient pays for treatment.  The treatment, whether with drugs, medicines or other therapy is a matter of clinical judgment but whether a patient pays for the drugs is a budgetary matter, a matter of administration.  It now seems to be an entirely arbitrary budgetary matter in local areas.  The Minister is disregarding the rights of patients under legislation.  By what legal authority has the right of the patient under the legislation been withdrawn in certain areas?  I submit that there is no legal authority for withdrawing those rights.  This has occurred, although there <Col N="1344" /> is not a very large number of patients involved.  This was a heartless and needless action which will undermine the whole basis of the community care services for psychiatric patients.  A highly desirable development in psychiatric care is being undermined.  Patients will be forced back into the institutions.  The costs for the State in financial terms will be high but the cost for the patient will be very high indeed in terms of his quality of life.  This decision will create real dangers for the health of patients who drop out from treatment and that is a likely consequence of putting a charge on the treatment.  It will certainly reduce the acceptability of the programme of rehabilitation to the general community.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us on 15 March 1989 that he is having talks with the chief executive officers of the health boards to try to get equalisation of treatment throughout the country.  Have the talks concluded?  If they have not the Minister should bring them to a speedy conclusion and should start giving directions to the CEOs.  If the Minister provides the resources the service will be resumed. Having listened to the Minister for the Environment saying how well the economy is doing, surely the weakest sections who are unorganised and who have no voice in the community, can be cared for at least at the previous level that was available.</P>
    <P>The health boards are acting illegally and without authority in withdrawing the service from the community.  Outpatients who previously received free of charge drugs and medicines they required, in order to live in their communities, are now being charged.  I would ask the Minister to take whatever action is required to ensure that that practice is ended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon):</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept Deputy Stagg's allegation that the question of psychiatric patients paying for their drugs is a new departure by the health boards.  The practice has been extended but it is not new.  Perhaps the Deputy would like to speak to his colleague, Deputy Barry Desmond, the former Minister for Health, about this <Col N="1345" /> practice.  I agree with Deputy Stagg about the improvements in the provision of psychiatric services.  As the Deputy knows there has been a number of major improvements in his own health board area.  Patients have been leaving St. Brendan's Hospital to go to hostels, to Blanchardstown, and to Clonskeagh. This is very desirable.  There have also been major improvements at St. Ita's Hospital.  The hospital was favourably commented on by the inspector of mental hospitals in his recent report.</P>
      <P>On the question of the income eligibility and whether psychiatric patients are poorer than other patients, as Deputy Stagg is aware, the general medical services are available to those who are eligible. If a large number of patients suffering from psychiatric illness are in that category they will receive medical cards and be entitled to free medication, through their family doctors.</P>
      <P>On the question of the use of behaviour-shaping drugs that Deputy Stagg alleges are being used incorrectly because of short staffing, the Deputy should provide evidence of this and if he does I will investigate it.  I do not accept that allegation.  We have the highest ethical standards and all our patients receive treatment in their best interests as patients, and not to facilitate the staff. Deputy Stagg also stated in relation to the answer that I gave to his question of 15 March that I had said that the question of payment was a matter of clinical judgment.  If the Deputy reads the answer he will find that that is not what I said.  I quote as follows from column 848 of the Official Report of 15 March 1989:</P>
      <P>As I see it, the question is whether the psychiatric hospitals continue to dispense drugs directly from their supply to the patients or whether the patients receive drugs in the normal way through their general practitioner and pharmacy.  That is related to the clinical judgment as to whether the psychiatrist should assume responsibility or not.</P>
      <P>Obviously there is a very important and crucial issue at stake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, whether the drugs are dispensed.  I did not make any reference to charges.  It was as to whether drugs are dispensed at the out-patient's psychiatric clinic or are prescribed by the general practitioner.  This is an extremely fundamental issue.  It is a question of who accepts responsibility for the continuing management of the patient.  If the general practitioner is going to assume responsibility for the patient on an on-going basis for 24 hours a day, there is a very good case as to why the general practitioner should prescribe the necessary treatment.</P>
      <P>The practice followed over the years was changed some years ago.  The charge to patients attending the out-patients department for psychiatric treatment being provided with their drugs at the hospitals or clinics in the various towns is not new.</P>

      <P>Injections, yes, but tablets no.  Tablets are provided by clinics which the patients attend.  On the question of whether that is in the best interest of the patient, for individual patients it may well be but for other patients it may be correct that their treatment should be prescribed by the family doctor.  It is a question of who is assuming on-going responsibility for the management of the patient.  What is of prime concern, I am sure, to both Deputy Stagg and myself is to ensure, whatever method of prescribing drugs or dispensing them is adopted, is that it is in the best interests <Col N="1347" /> of each individual patient.  That is what we want to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of payment, in the answer to which Deputy Stagg refers I said that we were arranging to discuss the matter with the chief executive officers of the eight health boards.  The next meeting of those eight CEOs will take place on 26 April and the issue is on the <Col N="1348" /> agenda for that meeting.  There has not been a meeting of the eight CEOs since 15 March.  Following the meeting, I shall review the position and communicate directly with the Deputy about the outcome and what decision might be arrived at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins):</NameTxt>
      <P>This report sets out a wide range of general principles and approaches that should be adhered to in the management of the penal system and, in view of this, it is not feasible in the course of a reply to a parliamentary question to comment on the attitude adopted in relation to each specific recommendation and conclusion contained in the report.</P>
      <P>The position is, however, that since its completion, various findings of the report have been taken into account in dealing with a number of prison issues.  Many of the recommendations made were in line with developments already under way as part of the ongoing prison administration process.  For example, in relation to the development of alternatives to imprisonment, an issue which was of major concern to the committee, very satisfactory progress has been made in relation to community service orders, which had been provided for and brought into operation shortly before the report was published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important recommendation was that a new duty roster for the Prison Service should be introduced.  In relation <Col N="1053" /> to this too there has been very considerable progress &mdash; within the past few weeks, a new roster has been agreed following long and detailed negotiations between my Department and the Prison Officers' Association.  The roster is already in operation in some institutions and will be fully operational in the others within the coming weeks.  Certain recommendations and conclusions contained in the report require further consideration, particularly having regard to changes in circumstances that have occurred since the committee completed their deliberations.Also, in some instances, the recommendations made related to matters for which the Minister for Justice is not primarily responsible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins):</NameTxt>
      <P>If initial inquiries warrant such a course, a prison officer is charged in writing with a breach of prison discipline and asked to respond to the charge.  On receipt of the written response to the charge it may be necessary to seek further information or statements from the officer or other persons.The officer is given copies of all statements and documents relevant to the charge.  At this stage, depending on the nature of the evidence, it may be decided not to take any further action or the officer may be warned.  Otherwise the case is submitted to the Minister who decides what disciplinary penalty should be imposed.  The penalty may be a repnmand, a fine, a reduction in pay, demotion or, ultimately, dismissal which, in the case of established officers, is a <Col N="1054" /> matter for the Government.  At the conclusion of the proceedings all statements and documents are retained in personnel files.</P>
      <P>As regards representation, it is open to a charged officer to obtain advice before replying to a charge and it is open to interested parties, such as the officer's staff association, to write on behalf of the officer.  The officer must, however, personally reply in writing to any charges.</P>
      <P>A new code of discipline for prison officers is under discussion with the Prison Officers' Association at present.</P>

I am afraid that I cannot reveal the details or source of this intelligence but I can tell the House that, acting on it, appropriate preventive measures were adopted at our airports.  I would prefer not to go into the details, mainly because policy has always been to give no details of specific security initiatives.

      <P>The difficulties of small scale producers under the quota system introduced in 1984 have been a major concern for me.  For that reason I secured agreement from the Council of Ministers in 1987 to introduce a restructuring scheme giving special priority for the purchase of quota, without land, to small scale producers.  There are no funds available to me to subsidise purchases of quota under the restructuring scheme.</P>
      <P>I have laid down that priority for the purchase of quotas under the scheme is to be accorded to small scale milk producers.The scheme is in fact restricted to producers with quotas under 50,000 gallons and of these the first priority category is confined to producers with quotas of less than 30,000 gallons.</P>
      <P>In regard to the clawback scheme, as I already announced the quantities available in that reserve are being allocated to certain small scale milk producers with quotas under 10,000 gallons and some qualified young farmers.  As from 1 April 1989, I have provided that the clawback will apply only where the lessee's total quota exceeds 50,000 gallons instead of the 25,000 gallon ceiling which applied in 1988-89.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 99 to 106, inclusive, 108 and 111 to 113, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Because of the considerable amount of detail covered by the questions my reply will be in the form of a detailed statement on the cattle and beef industry and CAP expenditure controls.</P>
      <P>The following is the statement:</P>
      <P>Importance of Cattle and Beef Industry</P>
      <P>The unique importance of the cattle and beef industry to the Irish economy is evident from the following basic facts:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the cattle and beef sector accounts for nearly 40 per cent of the value of agricultural output and exports of cattle and beef are valued at about £900 million p.a. or 8 per cent of total annual exports;</P>
      <P>&mdash;about 1.3 million head of cattle are slaughtered annually at meat export plants yielding about 420,000 tonnes of beef and some 10,000 people are employed directly in the meat processing industry;</P>
      <P>&mdash;practically every Irish farmer, whether full-time or part-time, is involved in some way in cattle production;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the cattle and beef sector is six times more important to us than the same sector is to any other EC member state and is in fact more important to our economy than agriculture as a whole is to the total economy of the European Community.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Importance of Common Agricultural Policy</P>
      <P>The vital importance of the Common Agricultural Policy to the Irish beef sector is clear in that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;it provides access for our cattle and beef exports to a Community market <Col N="1074" /> of more than 320 million people; this provides a return of the order of £500 million compared with £300 million which would otherwise be available on world markets;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the intervention intake in Ireland, that is beef bought up by the Community, was 126,000 tonnes in 1986, 99,000 in 1987 and 58,000 tonnes in 1988;</P>
    <P>&mdash;under the aids to private storage scheme, that is where private traders are paid to keep product off the market, over 130,000 tonnes or one third of exports were placed in storage last year;</P>
    <P>&mdash;refunds/subsidies paid on exports to third countries for 1988 were worth over £200 million and overall over £500 million was paid from EC funds in this country under the EC regime for cattle and beef in that year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Beef Industry's Potential for Further Expansion</P>
    <P>The Government lay particular emphasis on the role of the beef industry in expanding and developing the economy.In this context the industry is well poised for further expansion.  The December livestock enumeration revealed a substantial increase in beef cows and in-calf heifers, indicative of the general confidence in the industry.  With a decline in cow numbers throughout the Community, the industry here is in a strong position to increase its share of Community markets and export earnings and to generate increased sustainable employment.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Need for Responsible and Informed Commentary on Industry</P>
    <P>Given the importance of the beef industry and the CAP to this country the Government believe that it is necessary to clarify how the EC price support system for beef operates and how any infringements and irregularities that arise under Community regulations in the cattle and beef sector are dealt with in this country.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1075" /> State Agencies involved in CAP Control System</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food is the agency primarily responsible for application of CAP regulations here. The Customs Authorities also have an important role as regards import and export control.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Role of Department of Agriculture and Food</P>
    <P Just="Center">400 Departmental Staff Involved</P>
    <P>The total of over £500 million of Community funds paid by the Department of Agriculture and Food involves many thousands of individual transactions. About 400 Department staff are engaged in the control and monitoring of the operations giving rise to these payments, and in administering the systems generally at headquarters, at 43 meat export plants and associated cold stores, at 43 public cold stores and at export points.  Veterinary inspectors and staff in a number of Agricultural Officer grades are employed by my Department supervising all operations at meat export plants.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Wide Range of Community Regulations Applied</P>
    <P>Community regulations applicable to the cattle and beef sector are many and complex.  They include provisions on export refunds (subsidies to third countries), intervention buying (that is beef bought up on behalf of the Community), intervention sales, aids to private storage (that is where private traders are paid to keep the product off the market for specified periods) and the charging and paying of monetary compensatory amounts (that is amounts applied in trade to offset currency fluctuations).</P>
    <P Just="Center">Securities Required for Advance Payments</P>
    <P>Advance payment of export refunds subsidies before the export is carried out is the norm in Ireland.  Aids to private storage may also be paid before the end of the contracted period.  In order to protect Community funds, however, a trader <Col N="1076" /> who avails of the advance payment must lodge a security that is a written guarantee from a recognised financial institution or insurance company, which gives an undertaking that, in the event of noncompliance with the conditions of the scheme, the advance payment plus a 15 to 20 per cent penalty will be repaid. Securities lodged by traders with my Department to guarantee performance of contracts and compliance with obligations under EC regulations are released only when the transaction covered is completed, the prescribed documentation justifying release has been submitted to my Department and the Department is satisfied that all requirements have been met.  The procedure can entail inquiries by the Department either about the documentation itself or about any other aspect of the operation concerned.  Under some EC measures periods considerably in excess of two years are permitted between the lodgment of securities and the receipt of the necessary release documentation. Lodgment and release of securities take place on an ongoing basis and the level of securities on hand in my Department can vary from day to day.  The total value of securities held at present is about £850 million of which some £300 million relates to beef export refund operations.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Standards Laid Down by EC</P>
    <P>In its application of the system, the Department follows explicit standards laid down in EC regulations as well as rules of practice agreed with the European Commission and with other member states.  This applies in particular to infringements and irregularities and suspected cases of both, an area in which the Department maintains close liaison with the European Commission.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Treatment of Irregularities</P>
    <P>Whenever an irregularity is suspected an investigation is immediately set in train in accordance with explicit standard procedures.  If imports or exports are involved, this investigation is carried out in close co-operation with the Customs authorities.  Where it is established that <Col N="1077" /> an irregularity has occurred which has resulted in FEOGA funds being incorrectly paid, the Department has the option of recovering the amount from the securities held against the operator or, where necessary, initiating civil proceedings to recover it.  Investigations extend to all aspects of cases including any attempts to obstruct official inspections.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Suspected Fraud</P>
    <P>In instances where there is reason to believe that there is misrepresentation with fraudulent intent the practice is to refer the matter to the Garda Síochána for investigation.  Where such an investigation produces evidence of an offence, the Garda refer the file to the DPP who decides whether a prosecution is warranted.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Reporting of Irregularities to EC Commission</P>
    <P>At the end of every quarter the Department makes a return to the EC Commission of all irregularities that have come to notice.  The report shows, 1, new cases which have come to light since the last report and, 2, an update of existing cases.  All relevant facts are made known to the Commission, for example nature of the irregularity, financial consequences for the EC, the manner in which the irregularity was discovered and any action taken, including criminal prosecution.The Commission is kept fully informed of ongoing developments in each case and when an irregularity investigation is closed it is normal for the Commission to be provided with reasons. These standard procedures are followed by the Department of Agriculture and Food in all cases.  Details of the number of cases reported to the EC Commission in the years 1986, 1987 and 1988 are given in the table attached.  The cases reported involve a number of different companies.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Independent Checks on the Department's Administration of CAP Regime</P>
    <P>The Department's administration of the CAP regime is subject to numerous <Col N="1078" /> independent checks.  These are carried out by the European Court of Auditors and by the European Commission's audit services in addition to the audits carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Department's own internal audit unit.  The staff of the unit consists of one professional accountant, four higher executive officers and seven executive officers.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Role of the Customs Authorities Certification</P>
    <P>Exporters' entitlement to the payment of refunds/subsidies is determined by the type and quantity of goods being exported.  It is the function of Customs to certify that the particulars declared by exporters in the relevant Customs documentation are correct.  The certified documentation is then forwarded to the Department of Agriculture and Food as the paying agency.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Regular Spot Checks</P>
    <P>Where declarations are made, Customs, as part of their normal function, carry out regular spot checks on the goods being brought under Customs control, while under Customs control and at the point of exit from the country.  These controls are carried out routinely throughout the country at meat plants and at cold stores.  Customs have a full-time presence at ports approved for the export of live cattle.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Investigations</P>
    <P>When an irregularity comes to light or is suspected in relation to particulars declared to Customs, an investigation is carried out by local Customs staff augmented, where necessary, by staff from the Customs Investigation Branch and assisted, where appropriate, by staff from the Department of Agriculture and Food.  Such an investigation may involve close surveillance of the activities of the firm, the thawing, weighing and physical examination of individual cartons and consignments of beef, checks on weights of cattle and audit of a firm's commercial records.  When an investigation discloses <Col N="1079" /> evidence of an irregularity or non-compliance with EC regulations, the matter is reported to the Department of Agriculture and Food as the paying agency.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Annual Audits of Traders' Records</P>
    <P>In addition to these regular checks and investigations, Customs also carry out an annual audit on the commercial and financial records on a selected number of CAP traders.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Difference between Technical/Procedural Irregularities and Fraud</P>
    <P>It is important to make distinctions between the various infringements and/or irregularities which are liable to occur in the course of applying the CAP beef regime.  Many of the &ldquo;irregularities&rdquo; that occur are of a technical or procedural nature.  These would include, for example, those arising from clerical error or from failure for one reason or another on the part of the company concerned to meet contractual commitments &mdash; either as regards quantities, qualities or time limits.  Money is paid only where the relevant operation has been carried out in accordance with Community regulations and appropriate documentation is available from Customs to confirm that fact. Where infringements are technical in nature no irregularity or indeed fraud may have been intended but the provisions of the regulations will usually require certain action to be taken automatically by the Department including the partial or total non-payment of claims.  In the case of advance payments it would involve the recovery or partial recovery of advance payments made under security plus the appropriate monetary penalty.  Where fraud is suspected the matter is referred to the Garda in addition to imposition of monetary penalties.Amounts forfeited by traders arising from infringement of Community rules in the beef sector were £1.2 million in 1988, £1.1 million in 1987 and £0.5 million in 1986.  A total of in excess of 500 transactions was involved.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1080" /> Position of the Government</P>
    <P Just="Center">Need for Confidentiality</P>
    <P>Financial transactions under the terms of the CAP between the State agencies and particular individuals or companies are conducted on the basis of strict confidentiality.</P>
    <P>Confidentiality is crucial in:</P>
    <P>&mdash;avoiding unfair advantage or disadvantage among traders here and in other member states.</P>
    <P>&mdash;ensuring uninhibited investigations by my Department, Customs and the Garda, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;ensuring that any ensuing legal proceedings are not prejudiced.</P>
    <P>This long established and necessary principle of confidentiality has been accepted by all past Governments and is applied equally to all firms and individuals.In this regard I am concerned about the adverse consequences of the recent unauthorised publication of a letter from my Department to an individual company.  It would be improper of me to compound this breach of confidentiality by replying in detail to the specific questions tabled about the operations of individual companies and their transactions with my Department. Having regard to this obligation of confidentiality I am not in a position to disclose details of individual cases. However, in each year since 1980 cases have been examined by the Department in consultation with the Commission and the appropriate sanctions applied.  These numbered 21 over the period and involved 17 companies.  In the course of running the beef regime inquiries are instituted and concluded on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>The very scale of CAP transactions makes it imperative that official monitoring of those transactions and the pursuit of any irregularities that occur must be carried out impartially under well-established procedures and subject to strict financial control.  That is how the control system for CAP expenditure <Col N="1081" /> within this country functions now and has always functioned in the past.  The Minister for Agriculture and food has overall responsibility for ensuring that the European Communities CAP payments system is operated in accordance with the rules laid down by the Community.The Minister does not take any part in the day-to-day operation of the system which is left as an administrative matter for the Department as already <Col N="1082" /> outlined.  This position has obtained since the coming into effect of the European Communities (Common Agricultural Policy) (Market Intervention) Regulation 1973.  There has not, and will not be any political interference with the operation of the system.  The Government are determined to meet their obligations under EC and national laws by maintaining full, effective and impartial application of the present monitoring and control systems.</P>

As the person concerned had previously been in receipt of occupational injury benefit the appeals officer wished to review the documentation relating to that claim before making a decision on the appeal before him.  These papers were <Col N="1085" /> duly furnished to the appeals officer and he has now decided that the person concerned was capable of work and is not entitled to be paid disability benefit from 26 September 1988.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 116 to 118, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the changes recently announced, all fees payable to dentists under the social insurance dental benefit scheme have been increased by 2.5 per cent with effect from 1 October 1988. Additional increases on specific items, where existing fees had got out of line with increases in dentists' costs, were applied from 1 March 1989.  Other improvements were also brought into effect from that date, including provision for dental examinations every 12 months instead of 18 months and provision for additional items of treatment in line with ongoing developments in dentistry.  The <Col N="1086" /> overall value of the package of improvements to dentists in a full year is £1.8 million.</P>
    <P>Up to 6 March 1989, a total of £1,700,826 was paid, in respect of claims from dependent spouses of insured persons, to the 184 panel dentists who, at that time, had signed agreements to provide treatment to this category.  Five additional dentists have signed such agreements since then.</P>
    <P>The average amount per person per annum paid to dentists for treatment carried out on insured persons is estimated at £48.75.  This represents a total of £16 million per annum for dental benefit in 1989.</P>

    <P>In the case of disability benefit appeals where the claimant had been found to be capable of work by a medical referee of the Department it is the practice to arrange for a second examination by a different medical referee so that the findings of both referees can be submitted to the appeals officer.  Where a claimant is found to be incapable of work following the second examination benefit is immediately restored.  However, if the opinion of the second medical referee agrees with the first then the claimant is afforded an opportunity to state the grounds on which he or she wishes to base the appeal.</P>

      <P>Following reinvestigation the person concerned was assessed with weekly means of £21.10 from income derived from the caretaking of a number of houses and the value of a small amount of capital.  His means were assessed in accordance with section 146 (1) (b) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, as amended by section 13 of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, which provides that all income which an applicant or his spouse may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year in cash, whether as contributions to the expenses of the household or otherwise, is assessable as means.</P>
      <P>The person concerned appealed against the amount of means assessed against him on 25 October 1988 and an appeals officer, on 6 March 1989, reduced his means to £21.  He is, accordingly, in receipt of unemployment assistance of £21 weekly being the appropriate maximum rate of £42, less means of £21.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>Irish residents may only take currency notes out of the country for the purposes of personal travel.  The amount of currency notes so permitted was last increased on 1 January 1988 and is as follows: foreign currency notes &mdash; allowance increased from the equivalent of IR£500 to the equivalent of IR£1,200; Irish currency notes &mdash; allowance increased from IR£100 to IR£150.</P>
      <P>The current allowances exceed those which the OECD Code of Liberalisation of Current Invisible Operations requires its member states to provide &mdash; SDR 1,250 (IR£1,050 approximately) and SDR 150 (IR£125 approximately) respectively.</P>
      <P>Funds in excess of these limits may, of course, be transferred out of the country, by means other than currency notes, for genuine travel purposes, or other approved transactions.  I have no immediate plans for a review of the regulations governing the export of currency notes. These will, of course, fall to be reviewed in the context of liberalising capital movements with other EC member states, which we are committed to achieving by the end of 1992.</P>

    <P>A total of 352 companies have been approved for investment under the scheme to date.  Statistic are not available which would enable an estimate to be made of the number still in operation but it is thought to be the bulk of the number approved.</P>
    <P>The figures given in the table for the cost to the Exchequer reflect the amounts invested under the scheme as formally <Col N="1103" /> notified to the Revenue Commissioners up to 5 April in each year.  On this basis the amount of investments on which the figures given for the year ended 5 April 1989 are based is close on £26 million but there are clear indications that the total of investments actually made in that year were substantially higher.</P>
    <P>Claims for tax relief on these investments will be dealt with in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have <Col N="1104" /> advised me that the taxpayer was married on 19 August 1988.  Married couples are taxed as single persons throughout the year of assessment in which the marriage takes place.  Where the tax paid by the couple under this arrangement exceeds the total tax for which they would have been liable if they had been married throughout the year of assessment concerned, a measure of relief by way of repayment is granted after the end of the year of assessment in which the marriage takes place.  The taxpayer has already been requested by his inspector of taxes to submit the relevant forms P60 for 1988-89 to enable their liability for that year to be reviewed and the appropriate relief granted.</P>
      <P>Amended certificates of tax-free allowances for the current year 1989-90, incorporating the married persons allowance, will be issued shortly.</P>

In effect, the tax-free allowances are set off in priority against the social welfare pension and the balance of these allowances constitutes the net tax-free allowance available for set off against his retirement pension.</P>

    <P>Both of the dates referred to were Sundays.Sunday attendance is normally <Col N="1110" /> given by Customs at these posts on an overtime basis for a period of six hours. On the dates in question, requests were received for Customs attendance at these posts during particular hours to facilitate the clearance of car rally vehicles and equipment.  The hours of attendance were accordingly decided on having regard both to the terms of these requests and to the most cost-effective use of resources consistent with the protection of the Revenue.</P>

      <P>Dromore Wood is a national nature reserve established by order under the Wildlife Act, 1976 on 28 November 1985. The reserve is comprised of woodlands and wetlands and was established to conserve the native species therein.  Management plans for all nature reserves are prepared by the Wildlife Service and the main objective of such plans in woodland reserves is to remove non-native species and allow the native species to develop.</P>
      <P>Beech and spruce trees are not native to Ireland and must be removed from this reserve to allow the native ash, hazel, wild cherry, oak, elm etc, as well as all other native wild vegetation to grow freely.  The removal of these trees inevitably resulted in an unsightly appearance during the course of the work but when completed will greatly improve the overall appearance of the reserve.</P>

      <P>(a) The amount of liabilities underwritten in respect of beef exports from Ireland to Iraq for each of the years 1986 to 1988 inclusive was: 1986, £4.9 million; 1987, £41.2 million; 1988, £78.5 million.</P>
      <P>No liabilities in respect of sheepmeat were underwritten in the period.</P>
      <P>(b) Claims paid in respect of the exports referred to were as follows: 1986, no claims paid; 1987, £3.4 million; 1988, no claims paid.</P>
      <P>A full recovery of the foreign currency amounts due was subsequently made. However, due to exchange rate fluctuations between date of payment of claim and date of recovery, there was a small net loss to the Exchequer of £36,000.</P>
      <P>(c) The amount of premia paid in 1986, 1987 and 1988 in respect of these exports was as follows: 1986, nil; 1987, nil; 1988, £1.5 million.</P>
      <P>Premium in respect of liabilities in 1986 was paid in 1985 when the policy was written.  Approval for export credit insurance was given in October 1987 in respect of contracts for shipment in late 1987 and 1988.  Technical details of the actual policies were not finalised until February and March 1988 at which stage the premia were paid.</P>
      <P>(d) The cumulative outstanding export credit insurance liability in respect of these exports at the end of each year and at 31 March 1989 was as follows: 31 December 1986, £4.9 million; 31 December 1987, £41.2 million; 31 December 1988, £117.8 million; 31 March 1989, £102.5 million.</P>

      <P>Since the setting up of my Department in March 1987 a number of significant developments in relation to marine communications and to Valentia Radio Station in particular have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> I relaunched the marine VHF communications development programme which had been halted for budgetary reasons after four stations were built and with an increased budgetary allocation in 1988 brought five more VHF stations on the air.</P>
    <P>Valentia Coast Radio Station is now the control centre for five maritime VHF stations located at Rosslare, Cork, Bantry, Valentia and Shannon (near the estuary).  A sixth station located at Mine Head and controlled also from Valentia will be commissioned shortly.  Further surveys are being carried out, particularly along the west coast, to identify if any gaps in coverage exist.  Any significant shadow areas, once identified, will be filled.  Medium frequency transmitters which had reached the end of their useful life at the two manned coast radio stations at Valentia and Malin head were replaced in 1988, two of them being installed at Valentia.  Tenders for two more for Valentia have been invited and provision for their purchase is included in this year's estimate.  Two new wireless telegraphy (morse) transmitters have also been installed there.  The emergency power plant has been replaced by a new and more powerful installation.</P>
    <P>In 1988, in co-operation with the Department of Defence, the Naval Service and Telecom Éireann, the computerisation of fishery reports and commercial traffic at the Valentia Coast Station commenced.  This work will be completed in June 1989.</P>
    <P>Later this year, I hope to add on to the computer system a package to handle search and rescue information.  I envisage a computer network eventually linking all the major rescue agencies.  To this end a leased data line linking the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre at Shannon with Valentia Coast Radio Station is being installed.  Preparatory training for computerisation at the MRCC at Shannon is under way.  Computer equipment should be installed there before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I am aware that receiver equipment at Valentia, while still fully operational, is <Col N="1121" /> ageing.  I intend to commence a replacement programme this year.</P>
    <P>Equipment currently being purchased for Valentia will meet the requirements of the new global maritime distress and safety system (GMDSS).  This system, which will be fully implemented by the year 1999, proposes to integrate modern communications media (satellite radio etc.) to enable ships in distress to contact shore rescue authorities as well as shipping in the immediate vicinity.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to maximise the potential contribution the coast radio station service can make to both safety at sea and general maritime communications.To this end I am providing the skilled and dedicated staff at both Valentia and Malin Head coast radio stations with state-of-the-art equipment.</P>

      <P>It has been suggested that the angling licensing legislation has in some way affected the position in relation to the availability of fishing on these waters. This is emphatically not the case.  A licence is required to fish but does not convey any right to the licensee other than those enjoyed by law.

    <P>On 1 January 1988 the loan and loan charge subsidy system for funding local authority housing was terminated and a grant payment for the programme is now made on an annual basis.  The Exchequer, however, must continue to meet the cost of borrowings to fund the local authority housing programme, and if the subsidy had continued as previously it would have amounted to about £205 million in 1988. The shortfall on maintenance and management is provisionally estimated at about £20 million in 1988.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 196 and 201 together.  Under the Road Traffic Acts, where a person is convicted of an offence and is disqualified from holding a driving licence, the court must by order direct that particulars of the conviction and the disqualification order be endorsed on the driving licence held <Col N="1129" /> by that person.  The Acts also provide that an endorsement must remain on a driving licence and on any subsequent licence for a period of not less than three years from the date of the endorsement, provided there is no break between the expiry date of one licence and the commencement date of the next one, otherwise the endorsement remains on the licence for a series of discontinuous periods amounting, in the aggregate, to not less than five years.  I understand that the person referred to by the Deputy was convicted of a traffic offence and disqualified from holding a driving licence for 12 months with effect from 6 December 1986, that he appealed the conviction but subsequently withdrew the appeal, that the conviction was then confirmed and that he was disqualified from holding a driving licence for 12 months with effect from 6 November 1987.  He now holds a driving licence which was endorsed on 21 November 1988.  He will not be entitled to a licence free from endorsement before 21 November 1991.  This will be conditional on his not allowing a gap to occur between the expiry date of one licence and the renewal date of the next licence.  In this regard, he may renew his licence up to one month prior to the expiry date of the existing licence.</P>

I would again emphasise that the management, maintenance and improvement of their dwellings &mdash; the construction cost of which was funded in full by the Exchequer &mdash; is the responsibility of the local authority.  There are no funds available to me to enable authorities to make good any failure by them to adequately maintain and manage their housing estates over the years.  The limited special funding available under the remedial works scheme is geared towards remedying defective &ldquo;low cost&rdquo; housing, refurbishing pre-1940 estates, including the provision of necessary sanitary facilities, and the rehabilitation of designated problem estates to which the local authority have accorded the highest priority. The scheme is not a substitute for a properly planned and executed maintenance and management programme and should not be seen as relieving a housing authority of the responsibility of looking after and improving their housing stock. Future allocations to Dublin Corporation under the scheme will be dependent on their overall response to the maintenance and management problems of their estates, the capital available, and the level of demand by other authorities for such financial assistance.</P>

It is considered that this flexible approach is the most suitable one at this time and will enable account to be taken of the need to protect our water resources while exploiting another very valuable national resource.</P>
    <P>As regards peat siltation and pollution in the Ballycroy area, the Deputy will already be aware from information I conveyed to him some time ago, that my Department sought a report from Bord na Móna on their activities in the area and referred the general matter of pollution and the need for controls, including possible measures in respect of private turf developments, to Mayo County Council, for investigation.  I have received a response from Bord na Móna and I have furnished this to Mayo County County for reference in relation to its on-going investigation of the position in the area.</P>
    <P>I have also kept my colleague, the Minister for the Marine, informed of the situation in view of the statutory powers available to him to require measures to be taken in respect of Bord na Móna works where he considers it necessary to do so to protect fisheries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 236, 237, 238, 241 and 243 together.</P>
      <P>I am committed to implementing the recommendations made in <i>The Psychiatric Services &mdash; Planning for the Future,</i> in relation to services for the autistic, having regard to developments in the understanding of autism which have taken place since the report was completed in 1984.</P>
      <P>While I accept that there are aspects of services for autistic children and adults which need to be improved, considerable progress is being made in addressing the most urgent problems.  The present arrangements for the assessment and diagnosis of autism and the planning of care programmes tailored to the needs of each individual child are being reviewed. Consideration is being given to concentrating assessment and diagnosis of autism at a small number of centres, in order to develop greater expertise.  I expect that decisions on this will be taken very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Eastern Health Board area, a number of important developments in services for adolescents and adults are taking place.  Additional residential facilities have already been provided to service the needs of people on both the north and south sides of Dublin.  Planning of a further 12 residential places and day care facilities for about 25 people on the north side of the city is at an advanced stage.  I expect that the plan will be agreed <Col N="1148" /> this month and that implementation will commence before the end of this year. New and additional residential places for very disturbed patients will also become available this year.  The provision of these facilities should meet the requirements for the adult autistics in the Eastern Health Board area for the next five years.</P>
    <P>The facilities at Dunfirth House, County Kildare, have been extended to provide a further 12 residential places and these will be brought into service on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>The position under other health boards is being reviewed regularly by my Department in consultation with officers of the boards.  Particular attention is being given to those areas in which assessment services have not been fully developed.</P>
    <P>Deputies can be assured that services for autistic people will continue to be maintained and developed in a planned and purposeful manner.  Experience of the implementation of the reorganisation of psychiatric services, as recommended in <i>The Psychiatric Services &mdash; Planning for the Future,</i> indicates that resources can be identified within the overall budget now devoted to those services to enable greater attention to be given to the needs of groups with special needs, such as autistic children and adults.  I am optimistic that, despite the limitations on the overall resources available, we can steadily improve all aspects of the services for autistic people.</P>

      <P>Regulations were made by the Minister for Health in 1984 in respect of the licensing, advertisement and sale of medical preparations.  Under these regulations the National Drugs Advisory Board recommended to the Department of Health that on grounds of public health, safety and efficacy, copper bearing intrauterine contraceptive devices should be made subject to the same product authorisation licensing and control requirements as apply to drugs and medicines under the Medical Preparations (Licensing, Advertisement and Sale) Regulations, 1984.

    <P>No further applications have yet been made to the NDAB in respect of copper bearing IUCDs.  The initiative in this matter rests with manufacturers and suppliers.</P>
    <P>It was decided in 1987 to require that the pharmaceutical contraceptive preparations being imported under the family planning legislation, such as spermicidal creams and foams, should also be subject to review and approval by the NDAB.</P>

        <b>):</b> The Defence Forces (pensions) schemes provide for the payment of a special increment of £2.41 a week to a soldier for each year of pensionable service in excess of 21 years, up to a maximum of 31 years.  As a general rule, this special increment continues to be payable until the pensioner becomes entitled to a social welfare retirement pension (at age 65 years) or to a contributory old age pension (at age 66), at which stage the special increment is withdrawn.  However, as a special concession, the special increment continues to be payable up to 70 years of age in the case of a pensioner discharged prior to 1 August 1978, provided he is not in receipt of a social welfare retirement pension.</P>
      <P>Service pensions for non-commissioned Army personnel are non-contributory and are payable out of public funds.  The State as the employer of the soldier also makes a substantial contribution to the social insurance fund from which the social welfare pensions are paid.  Hence, the State is entitled to take into account such a pension in determining the rates of non-contributory service pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this respect, soldiers are treated more favourably than other State employees whose rates of occupational <Col N="1163" /> pension are calculated having regard to their social welfare entitlements so that their total income from public funds does not exceed 50 per cent of their pay.</P>
    <P>No change in the present practice is proposed.</P>
    <P>The person referred to by the Deputy was discharged prior to 1 August 1978 and reached the age of 70 years on 23 January 1989.  In accordance with the provisions of the schemes already mentioned, the special increment ceased to be payable to him from that date.</P>

The best estimates available at present are that the pupil-teacher ratio will remain at approximately 27.7:1 in 1988-89 and 1989-90 and that it will improve to approximately 26.7:1 in 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of discussions held in 1988 under the aegis of the central review committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the Government undertook to review the pupil-teacher ratio for post-primary schools with the parties to the programme in 1990 and in the light of prevailing circumstances to aim to improve the pupil-teacher ratio to 19:1. The Government further agreed to <Col N="1175" /> review the position after 1990 in the light of any further fall in enrolments.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to say at this stage what the position in regard to pupil-teacher ratios at post-primary level will be over the next five years pending consideration of the matter in consultation with the interested parties.</P>

      <P>Burmin Exploration and Development plc., Modeshill, Mullinahone, Co. Tipperary, hold a prospecting licence over Area No. 3240, adjoining Blacksod Bay, containing the townland of Keel West. The licence was granted to the company on 11th November, 1986.</P>

    <P>Prospecting licences over Area Nos. 3240 and 3255 authorise the holders to explore for the generality of minerals, while the licence over Area No. 3173 is confined to minerals other than silica sand, china clay and kaolin.</P>
    <P>Prospecting licence holders are required to carry out their work in conformity with good prospecting practice and without unnecessary interference with the amenities of the localities in which licence areas are situated.  They are required to ensure that if any trenches are opened during exploration work they are backfilled as soon as the programme of work no longer requires them to be kept open and to restore the surface as far as practicable to its original condition.</P>
    <P>Prospecting licence holders are requested to inform landowners or surface occupiers, as far as may be practicable, of their intention to enter on properties to carry out work there.  Furthermore, they are liable to pay compensation for any damage caused by them.  Licence holders are also required to apply for planning permission for any work which would require such permission.</P>
    <P>A prospecting licence does not authorise the holder to develop any economic deposits of minerals he may find.  For that purpose a separate State mining facility would be required.</P>
