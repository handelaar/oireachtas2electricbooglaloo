    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the present position regarding the opening hours of the National Library, Dublin 2; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Library opens to the public from 10 a.m. to 5.15 p.m. Monday to Thursday and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Friday at present.  It is hoped to resume evening openings shortly when additional staff have been redeployed to the library and industrial relations negotiations with existing staff are concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if the original opening hours of the National Library were from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. on weekdays and from 10 a.m. until 1 p.m. on Saturdays?  Can he say if it is the intention to revert to the original opening hours and how quickly that can happen?  Is the Taoiseach aware that people who work in day time jobs and indeed, people who would have come up from the country at weekends to carry out research cannot avail now of the <Col N="778" /> important research resources in the National Library because of the restricted opening hours?  This is a particularly pressing problem.  Can the Taoiseach say precisely what the new opening hours will be, if they will come into effect before 15 June or will it be within the foreseeable future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has made his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope the new arrangements will come in within a matter of weeks.  However, I am not in a position at the moment to say exactly what they will be but there will certainly be evening openings.  I agree with the Deputy that evening openings are very important.  I am not so sure about Saturday because a lot of institutions do not open on Saturday any more but we will try to facilitate the public to the greatest possible extent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach says it is hoped to resume the previous opening hours of the library but would he not accept that the matter is entirely in his hands and that the fundamental problem is the lack of adequate staffing in the library?  Until such time as staffing is restored to what it was previously one cannot hope, presume, nor expect that the library can open for&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is extending the scope of this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects of it: one is additional staff.  We intend to redeploy additional staff to the library very soon.  The other aspect is an industrial relations one which has to be cleared up but I do not think there will be any undue difficulty about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach refers to industrial relations difficulties would he not accept that those, so far as they exist, are entirely related to the absence of adequate staffing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not <Col N="779" /> going to draw me into industrial relations issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already intimated to the Deputy that he was extending the scope of the question.  He is now seeking to extend it even further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, in regard to the opening hours, there is a clear indication from what the Taoiseach is saying that Saturday does not seem to be within the contemplated restored hours.  I would urge him to look at that again in view of the great number of people from the provinces and elsewhere who did travel to Dublin to avail of the library's facilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if there is a national policy for the preservation of thatched houses; and, if so, the incentives, if any, which are given to owners to maintain such structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Heritage Council has been established to formulate policies to identify, protect, preserve, enhance and increase awareness of Ireland's heritage in a number of areas including architecture.  Architectural conservation includes the conservation of vernacular architecture.  The issue is being considered by the council and has been among the topics discussed at meetings between the council and the major interest groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="780" />
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Taoiseach's reply that there is no policy for the preservation of thatched cottages in general.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a matter for the National Heritage Council to consider in the context of architecture conservation and architecture generally. Thatched cottages certainly come within the context of vernacular architecture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>When people have a thatched cottage which is falling into disrepair and they apply for a reconstruction grant or some aid, be it from the Department of the Environment or from the Department of Tourism and Transport, they are informed that there are no grants available. The result is that people are finding it cheaper to convert thatched houses into slated or tiled houses.  That is a very undesirable trend so I would like the Taoiseach to implement a policy which would bring about decisions that would help people maintain those cottages as they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of the Deputy's approach but I imagine it would be better to see if we could do something through the National Heritage Council because they might have a more sentimental approach to these matters than the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some very cold people in that Department.  I would appreciate it if you would ask the Ministers in the Departments of the Environment and Tourism and Transport to draw up some scheme whereby they can be preserved.</P>

An n-aontódh sé freisin gur chóir go mbeadh ról cinnte ag Roinn na Gaeltachta chun an Ghaeilge a chosaint sa chóras bunoideachais agus iarbhunoideachais?</P>

Bíonn teagmháil againn leis an Roinn Oideachais, ach níl aon bhaint dhíreach ag Roinn na Gaeltachta le cad a dhéanann an Roinn Oideachais féin, taobh amuigh de iad a ghríosú, b'fhéidir, le níos mó a dhéanamh.</P>

An raibh teagmháil ag Bord na Gaeilge leis an Roinn Oideachais maidir le ceist na dtéacsleabhar?  An aontódh an tAire go bhfuil bac ar an bhord i láthair na huaire, nach bhfuil aon chathaoirleach ag gníomhú ansin le beagnach bliain agus go bhfuil leath an bhoird folamh?  An bhféadfadh sé a insint dúinn cathain atá sé ar intinn na folúntais seo a líonadh sa dóigh is gur féidir leo dul ar aghaidh leis an obair seo?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East)</i> asked the Minister for Finance which of the alternative procedures available to the Government in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3.2 (a) of the draft agreement on pay in the public service they intend to follow; if he has had any discussions with the ICTU in accordance with paragraph 3.2 (b) of the agreement; and if the Government intend implementing, in full, the pay recommendations of the Gleeson report in 1989.</P>

      <P>Clause 3.2 of the public service pay agreement provides for the processing and implementation of claims for special increases as follows:</P>
      <P> (a)  40 per cent of such increases shall be applied with effect from 1 July 1989. If, however, the Government consider that these payments would have such serious financial and budgetary consequences as to put at risk the central objectives underlying the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> they shall consult with the ICTU not later than 1 May 1989 with a view to arriving at a mutually acceptable solution which should include provision for reference to a third party, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  payment of the balance of the increases shall be the subject of discussion not earlier than 1 May 1989 with a view to arriving at a mutually <Col N="784" /> acceptable solution which should include provision for reference to a third party, if necessary.</P>
    <P>In my Budget Statement I indicated the Government's concern at the build-up of special increases in the public service and announced my intention to invite the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to discussions on the whole issue.  I met with congress on 8 March last and discussed the position frankly with them.  Since then my officials have met with congress representatives on five occasions and talks are continuing.  Because of the sensitivity of the issues being discussed both parties have agreed that there should be no public comment on the progress of the talks.</P>
    <P>As regards the implementation of the pay recommendations contained in the report of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be helpful for me to comment on a particular case or aspects of it at this stage.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> First, could the Minister inform us if the £30 million provided in the budget covers the full payment of 40 per cent of such special increases in addition to provision for payment of 40 per cent of the Gleeson award?  Second, why does the Minister refuse to comment on the Gleeson award when the Report of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector says that only the most serious considerations of the national interest, not at present foreseen, could justify the further postponement of the implementation of the balance of the increases in this respect beyond 1989?</P>

      <P>My objective in these talks is to negotiate a settlement which would ensure that the £30 million budget provision for the cost of special increases this year will not be exceeded.  It is also an objective to spread the cost of the increases over a number of years so as to avoid an excessive increase in the pay bill in any particular year, to minimise the impact of special increases in 1990 and to place a moratorium on a further series of special increases.  It would be totally inappropriate for me, as the Deputy will appreciate, to comment on the Gleeson report case referred to by him.  Such a comment would only be seen to prejudice the outcome of the discussions, so I am not prepared to comment on any aspect of the discussions.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East)</i> asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to the fact that, even though it has long been the practice that <Col N="786" /> smaller business in the primary market could be operated without difficulty at the official buy or sell prices as posted in the Stock Exchange by the Government broker, this no longer the case; the reason the practice has changed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention was drawn to the practice in existence up to mid-1987 &mdash; and which I assume the Deputy has in mind &mdash; whereby Government Stocks listed on the Stock Exchange for purchase only by the Government broker, namely, &ldquo;bid&rdquo; only stocks, could be nevertheless sold by the broker where the amounts sought of such stocks were small.  These selective sales of &ldquo;bid&rdquo; only stocks, many of which had very high coupons, were discontinued at that time because the practice was considered to be inappropriate.</P>
      <P>The position of small investments in Government stocks was re-examined recently however, in the wider context of an official report on the Government bond market generally.

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that from time to time differences will occur between the prices at which the market is willing to buy stocks and the prices at which the authorities are for tactical reasons prepared to sell. <Col N="787" /> This is the position at present.  In the long run, however, prices in the primary and secondary markets tend to converge in response to changing market conditions. The position of the small investor, and all other investors in Government bonds, must be viewed in the context of, among other things, official bond pricing policy, which is addressed in the bond market report.  I cannot therefore prejudge the outcome as far as the small investor is concerned.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East)</i> asked the Minister for Finance if it is still his view that the increase in consumer prices this year will not be appreciably different from the end 1988 rate of 2¾ per cent, as he stated in his financial statement on 25 January 1989; if not, the underlying economic factors which have caused this change of view; if he will make a statment on the dangers of inflation as he sees them; and the action the Government intend taking to keep prices down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 8 and 9, together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the most recent official data relating to mid-February last show a year-on-year increase in consumer prices of 3.3 per cent, whereas the corresponding figure at mid-November 1988 was 2.7 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At budget time there was the reasonable expectation that the annual average inflation rate in 1989 would, again, be less than 3 per cent.  This forecast was based on the available assessments of price prospects internationally, and on the usual assumptions of unchanged exchange rates, interest rates and international oil prices.  Since the budget, the publication of the mid-February figures and international developments, notably, stronger than expected inflation in our trading partners, the sharp rise in oil <Col N="789" /> prices and the recent increase in German interest rates, point to the annual inflation rate being higher this year &mdash; probably in the region of 3.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>If prices rise faster because of international events, outside the control of this economy, this is something we have to live with but, of course, we must not compound these effects by our own actions.  A higher international inflation trend need not undo the achievement of retaining the inflation rate below the average of our trading partners.  This is what matters for our trade performance, our growth prospects and, ultimately, for a continuation of the recovery in employment. The key to success in this regard, I would stress, is moderation in domestic costs and charges; in that context I would remind the House that, in sharp contrast to the previous years, taxation policy under this Government, to the extent that prudent budgetary policy allowed, has underpinned low inflation.</P>
    <P>The concern I have voiced about the latest figures relates to the position that of the rise in prices in the February 1989 quarter &mdash; 1 per cent, leaving aside non-recurring budget effects &mdash; a significant proportion seems to have been due to factors within this economy.  Some of these were once-off, but the underlying figure was at the high end of last year's quarterly changes.  If this trend were to continue, or if more buoyant economic conditions and external price stimuli were to be exploited to increase profits or pay, the improvement in our competitive position would be jeopardised and we would all end up worse off.</P>
    <P>This Government's attitude to inflation is clear and unequivocal.  Having got inflation down to very low levels, we are determined to keep it there.  This is why we have stressed the need for vigilance throughout the community in relation to prices.</P>
    <P>The Government have not had consultations with the Central Bank on the general question of inflation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the November to February figure, the last quarterly inflation figure, <Col N="790" /> showed an increase in the cost of living of 1.3 per cent which taken by itself, suggests that if it were to be repeated quarter after quarter it would lead to a rate of inflation in excess of 5 per cent by end year?  Would he agree with me that, in the intervening quarter &mdash; because of the factors he has mentioned and others &mdash; there is no reason to believe that the next quarter's inflation rate will be any lower?  Therefore, would he agree that the projected figure of 3.5 per cent he has mentioned is conservative to the point of being economical with truth?  Furthermore would he agree that an objective outsider would predict an inflation rate of between 4 per cent and 5 per cent on present performance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer to be economical so far as the inflation figure is concerned rather than in relation to the truth.  As I have said, it is projected to be in the region of 3.5 per cent.  The most pessimistic forecast at present is of a rate of inflation of 4 per cent at the end of the year.  The Deputy's computation of simply multiplying 1.3 per cent by 4 is not one with which I would agree.  I should say that some factors influencing the quarter from November to February were non-recurring.  The most influential factor in that quarter was the increase in the price of drink which contributed approximately .04 of 1 per cent.  There were also increases in the price of milk and food of approximately 3.3 per cent. There were other aspects, such as services, but the most worrying feature was that it was all domestic-induced inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy would be the first to admit, forecasting in this area is an inexact science.  For example, it is very difficult to predict what oil prices will do for the remainder of the year.  My view is that oil prices will tail down again in the second half of this year.  For example, the most recent figures with regard to manufacturing prices are less than those contained in the previous report on manufacturing price increases.  The most pessimistic forecast of the inflation rate of which I am aware is 4 per cent.  We are saying it will be of the order of 3.5 per <Col N="791" /> cent.  Indeed, we will take any necessary action in an endeavour to keep inflation as low as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In view of the fact that a 25p increase in the price of a gallon of petrol will increase the consumer price index by approximately 1 per cent and a 1 per cent increase on interest charges &mdash; in the pipeline &mdash; would increase the consumer price index by 0.2 of 1 per cent, is not a projected inflation figure of 3.5 per cent at the end of the year very conservative indeed? Would not a rate of 4.5 per cent be more realistic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not accept that a figure of 4.5 per cent would be more realistic.  In fact, I should say that some of the figures the Deputy has just thrown out do not stand up.  First, if there were to be an increase of 25p on the price of a gallon of petrol, and it were to be followed through to the end of the year, that would add 0.4 per cent, not 1 per cent to the rate of inflation.  I have seen the hype in the newspapers about a 25p to 30p a gallon increase which is typical of what always takes place in advance of any price increase.  I do not accept that the increase should be of that order and it would have to be carried through for the full year to add 0.4 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is it the case that on Tuesday, 16 May, the CPI will be calculated for the present quarter?

I should tell him that the price increases review takes place on the fifth day of every month and 5 May is a long way off from 16 May.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are satisfied in general with tax compliance in the beef-processing industry.  While they are aware of the possibility of some abuses in the operation of PAYE/PRSI and VAT in the industry, the Revenue Commissioners are involved in ongoing monitoring in order to identify and counteract such abuses.  The Commissioners have informed me that existing monitoring arrangements are adequate and that they do not consider that the introduction of a tax clearance certificate system for contractors is warranted at present.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me also that they are aware of the practice in the beef processing industry of hiring contractors from Northern Ireland to carry out operations at plants here but they have no information to suggest that the practice is widespread or that it has any significant revenue implications.</P>
      <P>Whether a contractor would be treated as an employee or a self-employed person for tax purposes would depend on the terms of his contract.  Under a contract to provide specific services, the contractor would be treated as a self-employed person liable to tax on his net profits.  If such a contractor is a resident of Northern Ireland, he would be liable to tax here only if his business is carried on through a permanent establishment in the State. If, on the other hand, the contractor were regarded as an employee for tax purposes, payments to him would be liable to tax here under the PAYE system even if he were resident in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards VAT, the position is that if the contractors are treated as employees there is no VAT liability as employees <Col N="796" /> are outside the scope of the VAT system. If the contractors are not treated as employees, they would be required to register for VAT in relation to the services they provide, subject to the normal VAT rules.  The rate of VAT chargeable would be determined by the nature of the service and the conditions of the contracts.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree it is obvious that substantial use is being made in the beef processing industry of gangs of workers carrying out essentially manual tasks at plants in the Republic and that in addition to that fact being obvious even to the dogs in the street it is also the case that where moneys are paid to contractors for those kind of works they do not at the moment attract any PAYE or income tax liability because those people are not being treated as employees for the purpose of the Tax Acts?  Would the Minister not agree also that no liability for VAT arises in the case of such people because they do not have a permanent place of business in the Republic?  In view of all those things, does the Minister not agree that manual labour is being employed wholesale in the beef industry here without any liability to tax, PAYE, PRSI or VAT of any kind and this constitutes an abuse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If that were happening in the way the Deputy has described it would constitute a major use.  This is a tax compliance question with which we are dealing, and the Revenue Commissioners are generally satisfied with compliance in the beef processing industry, including compliance by independent contractors.  The Revenue Commissioners are not aware of any widespread abuse by Northern Ireland contractors but indicate that they may operate more in Border counties than in other areas.  The tax status of such contractors has already been set out by me.  They accept that there may be particular companies with localised problems about the incorrect operation of PAYE, PRSI or VAT but there is no evidence of any significant irregularities <Col N="797" /> common to one group of companies or to the meat industry as a whole.  If the Deputy has information to suggest that there is such widespread abuse as he has alleged here, I will be only too glad to pass it on the Revenue Commissioners who will take immediate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the word &ldquo;abuse&rdquo; as used by the Minister is different from the word &ldquo;abuse&rdquo; as used by me, because if there is no liability at law for PRSI, VAT or PAYE in the case of the retention of these people's services south of the Border, then the Revenue Commissioners, as the law stands at present, cannot say that there is an abuse of the tax system.  However, there is a loss of revenue in the employment of people outside of the State who, if they lived inside the State, would be liable for some or all of these taxes.  This is a widespread practice and it is a matter which should not come to the Minister's notice from the Revenue Commissioners on the basis that there is an effort to defraud the Revenue.  It is a circumvention of the whole tax system that is occurring in the beef processing industry.  It must be obvious to anyone, including a Revenue official, that this is going on wholesale in the beef industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue have said they have no evidence of widespread abuse as suggested by the Deputy.  The Northern Ireland contractors down here are treated as employees.  They have to pay PAYE and the company that employs them is responsible for that payment. The company is responsible under tax law and the Deputy is familiar with that.  It is very difficult to make a judgment in the absence of specific information as to a contract being so devised as to circumvent the system.  I can only repeat what the Revenue say and if the Deputy has any more information that the practice is widespread I would only be too happy to take it up with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a recent review by the trade unions <Col N="798" /> in the industry showed that the practice was growing substantially, whereby companies were being taken over in the industry and the employees were then being classified as sub-contractors and the employer as such, is denying any further responsibility in relation to PAYE, PRSI or any such payments and that the employees are now being paid on a block basis?  Surely the same regulations as apply to forestry and to the construction industry should apply to that industry as well?  Will the Minister ask the Revenue Commissioners to contact the ITGWU and seek the information which they have made available in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 48, 55 and 57 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Customs and Excise staff are <Col N="804" /> responsible for the control and certification of beef which qualifies for export refund under the EC Common Agricultural Policy otherwise known as the CAP.  Beef may be placed under customs control either at the point of exportation or at traders' premises.  The date on which beef is placed under control determines the rate of export refund payable. The certification by Customs and Excise staff of the type and quantity of beef placed under control forms the basis on which payment of export refunds is made by the Department of Agriculture and Food as the paying agency on behalf of the European Commission.</P>
    <P>The Customs and Excise staff check the accuracy of declarations made by traders who place goods under control and for this purpose are entitled to carry out physical checks on the beef, to take samples and to check documents.  They are also entitled to enter traders' premises to examine beef already placed under control as well as to examine traders' commercial records.  Such records are also subject to regular audit by Customs and Excise staff.</P>
    <P>The Customs and Excise staff have no function in relation to the EC scheme of aids to private storage and they carry out no controls in respect of that scheme.</P>
    <P>There has been no change in the functions of the Customs and Excise staff in relation to the control and certification of beef for export refund purposes.  The methods of control are kept under continuous review, however, and are subject to change from time to time to improve their effectiveness or to remedy any actual or potential defects which come to light.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a breakdown of staff numbers engaged in the control of beef for export refund purposes is not available. Virtually all of the Customs and Excise staff engaged in the control of goods at point of export would have some involvement from time to time in the control of export consignments of CAP goods including beef.  Approximately 120 staff are engaged, as part of their duties, in the control of CAP goods at traders' <Col N="805" /> premises.  On average, these staff would spend only about 25 per cent of their time on such duties.  Some 50 per cent of the staff in question are stationed in the Dublin collection and the balance are located in various customs stations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Control of CAP goods placed under customs control is carried out during visits by Customs and Excise staff to traders' premises.  No officers are stationed full-time at such premises.  Normally, no charge is raised against the trader for such visits.  However, where, exceptionally, officers are required to attend at traders' premises to supervise unpacking or re-packing operations on beef already placed under control, the cost of such attendance is borne by the trader.  The Customs and Excise staff are responsible to and report to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Commissioners that no requests have been received from any outside agencies for specific inquiries to be carried out by Customs and Excise staff into alleged irregularities in relation to beef placed under control for export.  I want to clarify the position in this regard. There has been a request from the Department of Agriculture and Food to the Department of Finance in one situation recently.  Apart from that, the outside agencies refered to here are the Court of Auditors, the EC, or others.</P>
    <P>I am also informed by the Commissioners that they have no record of any complaint in regard to obstruction of any of their officers by persons working in beef storage plants.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that officers of Customs and excise have adequate statutory powers for the performance of their duties and protection from obstruction. Obstruction of any officer is an offence under the customs Acts which is punishable by a penalty of up to £1,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying to this House that Customs and Excise officers were not involved and have not <Col N="806" /> been involved in any investigation into the APS system?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Is he saying they have at no time been involved in any sense in any investigation into alleged irregularities in the APS system?  In that connection in relation to the one instance in which he stated the Department of Agriculture and Food asked Customs and Excise to become involved, when was that request made by the Department of Agriculture and Food, in respect of what matters was the request made, to whom was it made and how long did it take before a decision was made either by the Minister for Finance or the Revenue Commissioners to comply with that request?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to confirm again what I said.  The Customs and Excise staff have no function in relation to the EC scheme of aids to private storage and they carry out no controls in respect of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>No investigation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>They carry out no controls there.  However, if you have meat, say, in private storage and it is coming out of private storage to go for export, the Customs and Excise officers have a function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Now I see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is getting at but I want to be clear on the position.  Secondly, in relation to the investigation the Deputy spoke about, the Revenue Commissioners have received no request from the European Commission, the European Court of Auditors or any other agency to carry out specific investigations in relation to beef exports.  The Department of Agriculture and Food requested last month the co-operation of the Revenue Commissioners in the taking of samples of beef from a number of cold stores and from a vessel at Foynes and the transfer of the beef to <Col N="807" /> a central location for examination.  This examination, which was by way of spot check primarily in the context of aid for private storage purposes, is not completed. When the beef comes out they will become involved if the beef is going for export.  Is that clear?  I have not got the details of when the request the Deputy refers to was made but when I get them I will pass them on to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears from the Minister's reply that the request was made last month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>And presumably a decision has been made in relation to that request.  What was the nature of the decision made?  In relation to the involvement of Customs and Excise staff in investigations into the beef industry, is the Minister aware that the European Commission requested the Department of Agriculture and Food here to carry out such an investigation and that the Department of Agriculture and Food said they had not the facilities to do so but that the Customs and Excise branch might?  Did that not happen a considerable time ago?  I think it was last year.  Has the Minister any knowledge of such a request coming from Europe and the Department of Agriculture and Food saying Customs and Excise were the appropriate body to carry out an investigation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy appreciates as well as I do that a request coming from the EC to the Department of Agriculture and Food is a matter for that Department.  I would not have any details of it here.  The Deputy should address that question to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to the other part of the question I want to repeat that the Department of Agriculture and Food requested last month the co-operation of the Revenue Commissioners in the taking of samples <Col N="808" /> of beef from cold stores and from a vessel at Foynes.  I do not know what the Deputy is getting at in relation to what decision was taken.  The examination is not yet complete.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister telling this House that the only requested involvement on the part of Customs and Excise officers in relation to any investigation of any irregularities in the beef export trade, including the APS system, occurred last month and consisted of one single transaction at Foynes harbour? That is what I seem to understand but if there is some wider truth the Minister is not telling me and which I seem to be missing, perhaps he will tell me about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me clarify.  There was one request from the Department of Agriculture and Food last month, as I am informed in this brief from the Revenue Commissioners, but there is a difference between where Customs and Excise staff come in and at what stage they come in. I do not want the Deputy to get the wrong end of the stick in relation to that.  They have no control in relation to private storage.  I have no knowledge of any other request that would come from that Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister reconcile his statement to us today with the fact that the Customs and Excise staff, on a unilateral and public basis, had to approach the Commission services and the officers visiting Ireland to convey their grave concern about exports coming out of the APS scheme?  Surely both they and the Revenue Commissioners are more than aware of what occurred on those occasions.  How does the Minister reconcile the bland brief with the reality of what is going on?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 20, 37, 42, 52, 58, 122 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>The <i>National Development Plan</i> is now being examined by the Commission of the European Communities in consultation with the Government.  On completion of this examination, the Commission will draw up the Community support framework, which will outline the priorities in the plan for which Community assistance will be provided, an indicative financing plan and the forms and duration.</P>
      <P>Following consultation with the appropriate committees, on which all member states are represented, the Commission will adopt the Community support framework, which will then be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> The plan will be implemented through a set of operational programmes as follows: industrial development, tourism, roads, transport, energy, sanitary services, telecommunications and postal services, human resources, and agriculture and rural development.  Most of these programmes have been submitted to the Commission and the remainder will be submitted as quickly as possible.  These programmes are being examined by the Commission in conjunction with the plan and are also the subject of consultations between the Commission and the Government.</P>
    <P>In the preparation of the plan and the operational programmes, the work of the sub-regional groups was fully considered on the basis of interim reports which contained all information relevant to the preparation of the plan.  The reports of the sub-regional groups will serve as a guide to the Departments and agencies implementing the operational programmes, but no decision has yet been taken on the question of publishing them.</P>
    <P>All but one of the groups have now completed their work and submitted their final reports; the report for the Dublin area will be submitted by the group for that area after the consultants have finalised their work.  I would not wish to comment on the accuracy of the article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 14 April, which purported to be based on a draft of the consultants' report, apart from saying that the article was incorrect in implying that it was a plan which was being considered by the EC Commission for funding purposes.  The only plan being considered by the Commission is the Government's <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993.</i>  Competitive tenders were sought for the Dublin consultancy and it is not the normal practice to give the cost of a competitive tender received. Under Government contract procedures, all information in regard to tenders is treated as strictly confidential between the tendering firm and the contracting authority.</P>
    <P>The structures to oversee the implementation of the programme, and the possibility of assigning further tasks <Col N="813" /> to the sub-regional groups in this connection, will be considered in due course in the light of the discussions with the Commission.  The question of making resources available to the groups accordingly does not arise at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is fairly extensive but Question No. 17 in the name of Deputy Sherlock is specifically in regard to the south-west region.  Did the Minister say that the sub-regional reports of the working groups will serve as a guide to the Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>So the Commission will not see them and they will not be serving as a guide to the Commission. The Minister said that the question of publishing these reports was still under consideration.  Is it likely that the reports on the sub-regions, particularly that on the south-west sub-region to which the question refers, will in due course be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the sub-regional reports being sent to the Commission does not arise.  Priorities identified by the sub-regional working groups and advisory groups are reflected in the plan and will be a good guide to those implementing the operational programmes. Only the operational programmes go to the Commission with the plan &mdash; nothing else.  The question of publication of the operational programmes will not arise until the operational programmes have been approved by the Commission or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider it important, if not essential, that the sub-regional reports of the working groups should be published for the benefit of the communities and the people in the sub-regions who are anxious to see the Structural Funds disbursed in their area?  Without the publication of the reports they will not serve as a guide to <Col N="814" /> people as to how the Structural Funds are being used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

We are a single region with one national plan and they do their busines with us, nobody else.  Any information required by the Commission in relation to the plan or the operational programmes will be sought from the Government, not from anybody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has already posed that question.  This kind of repetition is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for the Government to decide what to publish and when. There is a lack of understanding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify one aspect.  With regard to the Dublin consultants' report, can the Minister tell the House the date that report was completed and when it went to Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not gone to Government as yet; it is not completed. It was expected to be completed in April <Col N="816" /> and I am assured it will be completed in May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>So the Minister is confirming that a plan for the Dublin region in chapter 6 of the national plan, devised by the Department of Finance, went to Brussels prior to the completion of the final report commissioned from consultants at the expense of £300,000 to the taxpayer.  Is that what the Minister is saying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not have to go the long way about asking that question.  It is well known that the Dublin report has not been completed but that the plan which has gone to Brusels and the operational programmes reflect the priorities in the draft of the plan sent to the Government before its completion. The Deputy should not try to create a mirage of curiosity about this.  Everybody knows the plan is not complete and everybody knows the national plan is in Brussels, end of story.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the plan for the Dublin region which the Minister seems to regard as very humorous, perhaps he could indicate why the consultants have formed the view that a sports centre on the Custom House dock site is not a viable proposition when the Government have included it in the plan submitted to Brussels?  Which is the Dublin plan?  Is it the consultants' plan, <Col N="817" /> the plan by the Department of Finance or the plan by the Minister for sport?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to reopen the link from Lough Allen to the Shannon for boating purposes has been discussed with local <Col N="819" /> community interests.  Before a decision can be reached on it, further technical examination of the problems involved is required.  It is intended that a preliminary investigation will be undertaken very shortly by the Office of Public Works in consultation with the Electricity Supply Board who have statutory control over water levels in the lake.  Further progress will depend on the outcome of that investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the community around Lough Allen have produced a major development plan based on tourism and agri-tourism to revitalise this area and that central to all this is the reopening of the Lough Allen canal?  Is he further aware that the ESB, who are the owners of the water, have agreed to the plan which has been submitted? In view of that, would the Minister indicate firmly whether the reopening of the canal has been included in the plan which has now been submitted to Brussels or in any of the regional plans for the area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to the statement I issued to this House on 25 April 1989.  As I made clear in that statement, the main reasons for the Government decision to wind up the activities of Fóir Teoranta were as follows: (i) the low level of demand for Fóir Teoranta's services over the recent past; (ii) the very much changed industrial environment now as a result of the firm action taken by this Government, as compared with when Fóir Teoranta were established; (iii) the soon to be enacted provision in the latest Companies Bill allowing for the appointment by the courts of an examiner in order to prevent potentially viable companies from going into immediate liquidation; and (iv) the Government are devoting major resources to the establishment and expansion of industrial firms and to making them more cost competitive as our whole economy prepares for the internal market in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> The alternative mechanism for dealing with rescue situations where long term sustainable employment is involved will thus be the new procedure in the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, modelled on the US &ldquo;Chapter 11&rdquo; procedure.  This procedure will apply to all companies, not just those in the industrial and allied sphere as in the case of Fóir Teoranta. There are, of course, other Government agencies involved in the provision of finance for industrial concerns, namely IDA, SFADCo, Údarás na Gaeltachta, NADCorp and ICC.  The business expansion scheme is also of considerable assistance for the provision of equity finance for viable firms.</P>
    <P>The available directors of the company were informed of the position on 22 February. Two of the directors who were not available on that day were informed on the following day.</P>
    <P>As regards companies owing money to Fóir Teoranta, the position is that Fóir Teoranta took a decision in 1982 not to publish details of client firms as this might damage the credit standing of such firms. That is still Fóir Teoranta policy and it would not therefore be appropriate for me to give details in respect of these companies.</P>
    <P>As regards the arrangements which will be made to collect moneys outstanding, as I said in my statement of 25 April, alternative arrangements for the administration within the public sector of Fóir Teoranta's existing portfolio of loans and equity holdings will be made by the end of the winding-up period so as to ensure that the Exchequer investment in the firms in question is protected.</P>
    <P>As regards the arrangements to deal with negotiations in hand with applicant companies in respect of which application to Fóir Teoranta for assistance prior to 23 February was made but where a final decision has not yet been taken, such cases will be dealt with by the company on their merits and subject to the normal criteria which are laid out in statute.</P>
    <P>As regards the powers of Fóir Teoranta, these have not been suspended; they will continue to be exercised by the company during the winding down period <Col N="823" /> in relation to those cases where applications for assistance were received prior to 23 February 1989.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that as we approach the feared 1992 it is likely that there will be a very high level of demand once again for the services of Fóir Teoranta which were set up under similar circumstances when we joined the EC?  Would the Minister also agree that Fóir Teoranta were under the impression that the examiner to be appointed under the Companies Bill would be Fóir Teoranta themselves because of their experience in assisting in management as well as financially companies in need of rescue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal in relation to the Chapter II system that was included subsequently in the Companies (No. 2) Bill came originally from Fóir Teoranta.  Fóir Teoranta may have envisaged themselves as taking up that role but I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, did not see it that way and I cannot say how my predecessor or my successor will see it.  However, there is a range of agencies in existence to assist companies in need of finance, for example, the business expansion scheme, ICC, NADCorp who take equity stakes or provide preferential loans, SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  The whole industrial environment is different.  As I have said many times, we will be facing a new competitive environment in 1992 when the propping up of non-viable, long-term companies will not be a reality.  We have already alerted everybody in business to that.  Nevertheless, there is a full range of services in existence which can look after viable, long-term companies and jobs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I would envisage that <Col N="824" /> the courts would have the say in who the examiner will be.  The procedure is that creditors will go to court asking for the court's protection so that no immediate liquidations can take place and it is a matter for the courts to appoint the examiner, having heard all the evidence before them.</P>

We discussed a wide range of bilateral issues, as well as international political affairs and European Community matters, particularly the preparations for the completion of the internal market by 1992.  I took the opportunity of stressing Ireland's wish for a close working relationship with Japan and our concern for the development of <Col N="915" /> an open world trading system.  We referred to the Japanese five year plan and to the possibilities for increased tourism under their new &ldquo;Ten Million&rdquo; Plan.</P>
    <P>The Prime Minister congratulated Ireland on our vision in setting up the Irish Financial Services Centre in which major Japanese concerns like Sumitomo, Mitsubishi Trust Bank, Daiwa Securities and Orix have already decided to participate. We agreed to establish a joint Forum for political, cultural and educational matters and another joint Forum for economic affairs.  The purpose of these fora is to oversee and advance the growing relationship between our two countries; to serve as a clearing house for ideas and projects and to identify difficulties and problems.  These fora represent a significant development and will be used to ensure that no opportunities for co-operation are neglected and that obstacles to trade, investment and co-operation are eliminated to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>Following the announcement on the following day of his intention to resign, Prime Minister Takeshita was kind enough to send me a personal message, assuring me that the understandings we had reached and the arrangements made would stand.  I invited the Prime Minister to visit Ireland.  He gladly accepted, saying that he looked forward to paying a visit when the opportunity arose.</P>
    <P>I had a very satisfactory meeting with Trade and Industry Minister, Mr. Mitzuzuka, on the same day.  Our discussions covered areas of co-operation in relation to trade and industry.  The Minister was very forthcoming in his approach to the relationship between our two countries and clearly anxious to advance it to our mutual benefit.  I stressed that Ireland, having one of the most open economies in the developed world, with exports equivalent to about two-thirds of GDP, was committed to international free trade.  We believed that an imbalance between Japan and the rest of the European Community should be remedied by more trade and investment rather than by restrictions or limitations.  I mentioned <Col N="916" /> that our exports to Japan had, in fact, grown by 30 per cent last year.  We agreed that the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Trade and Industry should enter into direct communication at technical level on EC or bilateral problems in co-ordination with our embassy in Tokyo.  Mr. Mitzuzuka proposed that he arrange for an investment mission to come to Ireland as soon as possible to examine all possibilities for Japanese investment here.  I warmly welcomed this proposal and the mission is being arranged.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that if there was any segment of local industry or any company which we would like to interest in this mission we should let his Department know so that it can be included for consideration in the mission.  I should add that we also discussed the possibility of developing for the mutual benefit of our two countries, the services of the 160 or so FÁS students at present working with Japanese companies in Japan.  Mr. Mitzuzuka indicated that he hopes to visit Ireland at an early date to pursue our discussions further and to see at first hand the progress being made in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I received a courtesy call from a delegation from the Japan-Ireland Parliamentary Friendship Group, with whom I had an interesting discussion on parliamentary, trade and cultural links between Japan and Ireland, including the proposal for a new Japanese school here and the progress of the FÁS scheme in Japan for training Irish graduates.</P>
    <P>My luncheon meeting with the Keidanren or Federation of Japanese Industries was constructive and fruitful.  I emphasised that a key element of our industrial strategy is the attraction to Ireland of outside manufacturing and financial services investment.  Representatives of Japanese firms with plants or interests in Ireland spoke favourably at the meeting of their experience and the success of their enterprise here.  They encouraged other firms to consider investment in Ireland and took careful note of the MITI proposal for an investment mission, which I mentioned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="917" /> At the meeting of the Keizai Doyukai, or Association of Corporate Executives, on Tuesday 25 April, executives again spoke of their experience with investment in Ireland.  An important point made by participants in the meeting was that, with the development of the internal market in the EC, they could now think of Ireland as part of a very large market and an important place to invest.  They were very much encouraged by what I had said about the Government's attitude to investment and our support for a European Community committed to international free trade.</P>
    <P>In addition to these meetings with representative bodies, I had a number of separate meetings with the chairmen, directors or chief executives of six very large companies who have invested or are considering investment in Ireland.  These meetings were very friendly, informative and constructive.  The companies indicated their continuing support for investment in Ireland.  I am happy to report that I was greatly impressed by the quality of the IDA presence in Japan, their knowledge of the scene there and their extremely competent performance.  They told me that the pipeline for Japanese investment in Ireland is at the highest level since 1972 and that they have set a target to double the number of Japanese companies in Ireland.  I am sure that with the help and understanding of the companies, whose representatives I had the honour of meeting, this target will at least be met.</P>
    <P>At every level, the Irish delegation was greeted with extraordinary courtesy and consideration and with a very positive attitude.  I would like in particular to thank Prime Minister Takeshita for affording Ireland the opportunity of being the first country invited to Japan as part of a new arrangement for official working visits.  Our gratitude is also due to Minister Mitzuzuka and to the chairmen and members of the Keidanren and the Keizai Doyukai who spared no effort to make our meetings pleasant and productive. The chairmen and executives of companies which have invested in Ireland <Col N="918" /> spoke warmly of their experience and I expect that they will be joined soon by other colleagues wishing to benefit from the developments in the European Community as we move towards 1992.</P>
    <P>I would regard the visit to one of the modern world's most remarkable countries as a success.  I was honoured and gratified by the warmth of our reception everywhere and by the positive response we received at all our meetings and discussions.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Dáil that there is a lively interest in Ireland in Japanese Government, business, financial and industrial circles.  There is a positive attitude towards this country and a definite wish to seek out possibilities for trade and investment.  Japan offers exciting prospects which we must fully and comprehensively follow up.</P>
    <P>On the outward journey to Japan, at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow, the Soviet Government kindly arranged for a meeting to take place.  The Soviet side was led by Mr. Kamentsev, Deputy Prime Minister and chairman of the Foreign Economic Commission of the USSR, and by Mr. Rachimbaev, Deputy Minister, Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations.  Other members of the Soviet delegation were Mr. Zilanov, Deputy Minister, Minister of Fisheries, Mr. Uspenski, Head of the Second European Department, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Krasnov, Deputy Head of the Second European Department, Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  On the return journey a follow-up meeting was held at the airport. Mr. B.L. Tolstykh, Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Science and Technology Commission of the Soviet Union, led the Soviet delegation on this occasion.</P>
    <P>At both meetings, the dialogue begun at Shannon on 2 April with President Gorbachev, was resumed and developed with particular reference to questions of bilateral trade, including possible countertrade arrangements between Ireland and the USSR.  We also discussed multilateral issues, especially developments related to the European Community and relations between the EC and the USSR; <Col N="919" /> and developments within the Soviet Union in respect of the democratisation process and <i>perestroika.</i></P>
    <P>I explained our interest in a possible oil barter arrangement whereby, for our mutual benefit, we would exchange oil and perhaps other resources from the Soviet side for Irish consumer goods and foodstuffs.  When the Soviets indicated a corresponding interest we agreed to establish a joint expert committee to discuss technical questions related to grades of oil, their refining, the amounts that would be involved and other issues.  That committee will meet in Moscow soon.  I put forward a suggestion for consideration by the Soviets that they take a share in our oil storage and refining capacity on a partnership basis.  The Soviet side expressed interest in this idea which they said they would consider favourably and let us have their reaction at an early date.</P>
    <P>The Soviet side expressed a very definite interest in the possibilities for co-operation in the health service area.  I explained the operations of PARC and mentioned that as preliminary meetings had been held, the way was clear for looking now at wider possibilities and said we would arrange for a delegation from PARC to pursue these with the appropriate authorities in Moscow.</P>
    <P>In broadly similar terms, I explained the work and responsibilities of our State organisation, Eolas, in relation to science and technology and requested that a delegation be received to have preliminary discussions about the possibilities of co-operation. The leading Soviet Minister, whose area of responsibility is science and technology, responded very positively, mentioned areas of interest to him and welcomed the idea of a delegation coming soon to see Soviet scientific and research installations and to discuss further areas of co-operation.</P>
    <P>In relation to fishing and ship repairs, I explained our wish to explore what possibilities for co-operation to our mutual benefit might exist, particularly in regard to Verolme Shipyard in Cork. In a considered response, the Deputy <Col N="920" /> Minister for Fisheries, Mr. V. K. Zilanov, made it clear that he understood that we were necessarily bound by the provisions of the EC Common Fisheries Policy and recalled the negotiations now beginning between the EC and USSR on fishing.  He suggested expanded bilateral co-operation with Ireland in three areas &mdash; viz. a joint facility in Ireland for ship repair and for change-over of crews, co-operation in fishery research and co-operation in processing and marketing.  A USSR delegation will come to Ireland in early July to discuss these matters.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that over a period of years our semi-State bodies had acquired experience in operating in the private sector and that their expertise in this context could be of value to Soviet State bodies in their new role.  The Soviet Chairman responded that they had a substantive interest in personnel and management training; they would make every effort to overcome possible difficulties and would examine how best they could avail of the Irish expertise in this area.</P>
    <P>As regards timetables and procedures for carrying these discussions forward in an organised and comprehensive way, we agreed to set up a general negotiating committee at high official level.  That committee will meet as soon as preliminary investigations and contacts are completed.  They should complete their work in June or July; in substance, they will prepare the agenda and a realistic programme of action for the meeting of Ministers of our two countries which will take place next autumn.</P>
    <P>The other points covered in the talks are of more general interest: the two Soviet Deputy Prime Ministers stressed the importance of the increased Soviet-Irish programme of contacts at all levels, but especially the political level.  Beginning with my meeting with President Gorbachev in Shannon earlier this month, and building on these two meetings in Moscow, further contacts now envisaged include a visit by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs after the summer, a visit of Members of the Oireachtas to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, various contacts at official and <Col N="921" /> expert level, and the more general Irish ministerial delegation visit to which I have already referred.  As Deputies will be aware, after the first meeting in Moscow, accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister Kamentsev, I also visited the duty-free shop at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, operated jointed by Aer Rianta and Aeroflot.  My visit was in recognition of the remarkable success of Aeroflot, the first Irish-Soviet joint venture, since its establishment in February 1988, and of the significance of the Aer Rianta-Aeroflot business relationship in the general context of Irish-Soviet relations.</P>
    <P>I am optimistic that these discussions will impact on existing Irish-Soviet trade and economic relations significantly.  By raising our existing range of contacts to a higher level and specifically by providing a fresh, vigorous political impetus to a process already under way, the results for Irish trade and for Irish-Soviet economic relations can be immensely and immediately beneficial.  I was particularly struck by the businesslike approach of the Soviet side towards action to develop practical economic co-operation in various fields and I look forward to favourable developments in the way I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by some comments of a more general character.  The visit to Japan, following the visit to Australia, and the development of relations with the Soviet Union is part of a conscious policy by the Government to strengthen Ireland's links as a member of the European Community with some of the major countries of the world, with which we have hitherto had little or no contact at the highest political level.  The purpose of this policy is to allow us at an early stage to secure a full understanding of the many important and fundamental changes that are taking place internationally at present and to be in a position to accommodate these changes and when possible to benefit from them.</P>
    <P>The completion of the internal market has focused world attention quite dramatically on the European Community. It has the potential to become the world's <Col N="922" /> largest and wealthiest market in the next decade.  Ireland, as a part of the Community, is of much greater interest to third countries, than we would otherwise be.  We offer significant potential for trade and especially as a base for investment in Europe.</P>
    <P>The growing economic importance of Japan, as a third force alongside the United States and Europe in the developed world is one of the most significant features of the international scene.  Japan's economic performance over the last three decades has been phenomenal, and Japan is now steadily increasing her investment abroad and opening up her economy.  It is vital that the growing relationship between Japan and Ireland should be recognised and encouraged by meetings with political and business leaders at the highest level.</P>
    <P>As a necessary extension of <i>perestroika</i> the Soviet Union is actively looking abroad for economic partnerships and flexible financing arrangements so that some of the immense possibilities for development as well as improvements in living standards can be more quickly realised.  In this context some of our State bodies and other enterprises are attractive potential partners and there are many significant bilateral opportunities to be explored.  In this way the rather slow and formal pace of co-operation between Ireland and the Soviet Union that prevailed hitherto can be greatly accelerated.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my recent visits and meetings, therefore, has been to give a new and stronger political impetus to these important developments and relationships, on the basis of the new credibility that Ireland enjoys, as a country with sound economic fundamentals and excellent prospects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Visits of the kind which the Taoiseach has described are, in my view, to be welcomed.  There are always benefits to be derived from improving, and indeed deepening, our links with major trading nations, with nations which have significant political and cultural interests.  The idea behind the visit which <Col N="923" /> the Taoiseach made to Japan began to take shape in the context of a visit to Ireland by a Japanese trade delegation in 1986.  I am glad that initiative of the previous Government, like so many others, was followed up by the Taoiseach and the Government.</P>
      <P>Japan, of course, can fairly be described as one of the great wonders of the modern world economy.  In many respects, it is a country that has outperformed the rest of the world.  It is a world leader in technology and innovation. Above all, it has shown a most remarkable capacity to apply new technology and new ideas and to turn them to competitive advantage.  Japan also is a major political force on the world stage and, as an island nation, has become a major commercial force in shipping and ship-building throughout the world.</P>
      <P>In view of all that, we must be pleased at the development of trading and cultural links between our country and Japan.  Those links, of course, take many forms and the most obvious one, perhaps, is investment by Japanese firms in the Irish economy.  It is fair to say that our experience of that kind of link has been very positive indeed.  We will clearly like to see it develop further and to see an ever-increasing range of Japanese brand Irish-made products on sale in markets throughout the world.</P>
      <P>Of course, much credit for developing those links belongs to the board and staff of the IDA, who have invested a great deal of effort in marketing the advantages of an Irish location to Japanese industry. Their success is to be commended: it is important to all of us.  I would like to say that I fully agree with the comment by the Taoiseach about the IDA operation in Tokyo.  In February, on my way to an engagement in London, I met the chief executive of the IDA who was on his way to Tokyo to do some of the advance work for the contacts which the Taoiseach had during the course of his trip.  The job of the IDA is not commented on enough in the House.  It is carried out with a great deal of expertise and dedication by the people involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> Córas Tráchtála also deserve a great deal of credit for the work they have done in assisting our exporters to penetrate Japanese markets.  We are only at a very early stage and it is a difficult market, notwithstanding the efforts made in recent years to encourage its opening up to goods and services from other countries. We have a number of Irish exporters to Japan, and their persistence deserves all the rewards that they can get.  Cultural links between Ireland and Japan are expanding also.  It would be fair to pay particular tribute to the work of the Ireland-Japan Association in that regard. This is an area which we should explore further to the mutual benefit of the peoples of our two countries and also &mdash; we should never lose sight of this &mdash; the development of cultural links can form part of the basis of expanding the level of tourism exchange between the two countries.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's visit to Japan was part &mdash; a highly visible part, of course, but only a part &mdash; of that widening of contacts between the two countries.  I was interested in the Taoiseach's reference to the institution of a number of new fora for, as I understand it, political, cultural and educational matters and a forum for economic affairs.  That is an idea I would like to see developed a little more so that we would know what would be involved in it.  It is the kind of structure which is well suited to what we might call the Japanese way of doing business and the Japanese style of administration.  I am bound to remark that while I welcome the Taoiseach's progress in developing an economic, cultural and social forum of that kind, I would recommend to him that he turn the same style of thinking internally and look again at proposals my party made not so long ago for a forum that would deal broadly with those kinds of issues to the immediate and direct benefit of the Irish people.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that if he feels that that kind of approach would be of benefit in Irish-Japanese relations it might be an equally good idea, if not a better one, close to home.</P>
    <P>While I commend the visit, I believe it <Col N="925" /> would be wrong to exaggerate the net effects it has had on the flow of Japanese investment to this country and on the flow of trade between the two countries. Political visits of this kind are a necessary but largely ceremonial part of the process of building up these links.  In that connection &mdash; I am sure the Taoiseach will have done some thinking on this matter &mdash; the real question which we must ask is, what has been achieved by the visit that would not have been achieved otherwise? That, of course, is not the type of question the media were asking during the course of the visit but it is one which, in a more reflective mode, should now be taken up.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask about the political content of the visit.  Japan is a major player in world trade.  Did the Taoiseach have any discussions in Japan on the major world trade issues that are now being discussed in the GATT?  During the course of his remarks the Taoiseach referred to the position of Japan in world trade and he spoke of his Japanese interlocutor being very much encouraged by what the Taoiseach had said about the Government's attitude to investment and our support for a European Community committed to international free trade. That is fine as far as it goes but was the Taoiseach referring, either by-the-way or specifically, to questions that arise in relation to international trade in agricultural products?</P>
    <P>Japan is one of the countries that has in the past posed a number of difficulties for the European Community in terms of access.  There have been a number of difficulties for us in terms of access for some of our export products to the Japanese market.  Were those issues discussed during the course of the visit?  Was there any discussion on the much wider, and indeed more preoccupying, issue of the whole approach that is being generated in the GATT to questions of world trade in agricultural products and support for agricultural producers?  Again, that is an area in which Japan has from time to time been a difficult partner in discussion.</P>
    <P>It might have been interesting for the Taoiseach to discuss with members of the <Col N="926" /> Japanese Government their approach to proposals to do away entirely with domestic agricultural income supports. Japan, as we know, has an economy that has developed in a number of very novel ways but, like most other countries, it is a country which took measures, and still takes them, to protect, support and maintain its own agricultural sector.  There might be a point in our coming closer to Japanese interest with a view to the way talks are going to go in the GATT.  I am not suggesting for a moment that we should break out of the proper negotiating circle at the European Community but there are more ways than one to skin a cat.  There are times in negotiations like that when it is very useful to know what the Community's partners outside might be thinking.  It might be comforting to know that some of them would take a particular line on issues where, perhaps, we are not getting within the Community all we would wish in terms of the content of a negotiating brief.</P>
    <P>Japan is an island nation that is bound by treaty obligations to keep armed forces for self-defence only.  I wonder if the Taoiseach took the opportunity of having any discussions with the Japanese Government on how they see their role in contributing to world peace or in furthering the cause of global disarmament? Japan is in a unique position among all the nations in the world in terms of its military forces and its relationships with military blocs elsewhere.  Indeed, it might be fruitful to find out what the Japanese viewpoint is on those issues of world peace and disarmament.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Taoiseach's visits to Moscow, we must wonder if there is any significance in the fact that he was not met during either of his stop-overs by President Gorbachev.  It seems to me that there must be at least as many milestones on a journey from Dublin to Tokyo as there are on one from Moscow to Havana.  I wonder if, following the discussion we had here after the Taoiseach's meeting with President Gorbachev, the Taoiseach took the opportunity on either of those stop-overs in Moscow, or is it <Col N="927" /> envisaged for any of the future discussions that are going to take place, of exploring what the Soviet authorities can do to cut off the source of supply of illegal arms and explosives from the eastern bloc.  I imagine it would not have been appropriate to discuss that at Sheremetyevo when the Taoiseach thought he was talking to a young Irish lady, when in fact, she was a young Soviet lady.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I might have gone a little further, Taoiseach.  It would be useful for us to know &mdash; and it would certainly be comforting for this House to know &mdash; that that particular issue, that is, the supply of arms and explosives, is on the agenda at some point during this series of further contacts the Taoiseach has been arranging with the Soviet authorities.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach told us he put forward to the Soviet authorities a suggestion that they take a share in our oil storage and refining capacity on a partnership basis. I am trying to keep count of just how many partners that is.  I am not sure what the present situation is about discussions with a possible Nigerian partner nor am I sure if there is any foundation for suggestions that there were discussions with a possible South American partner. It appears now there may be discussions with a possible Soviet partner.  At the end of all that, I am not too sure whether the Irish National Petroleum Company will know who heads up what or which bit of it is working for whom this week or next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it might be interesting to establish whether there would be any interest on the part of the Soviet authorities, it seems a more co-ordinated approach is needed to make sure that one group of Ministers does not go off and sign a partnership agreement in Moscow and another group of Ministers sign a partnership agreement for the same set of assets in Nigeria and find out at the end of it all when they come back home that the Government here have decided to <Col N="928" /> become a partner or beef up their partnership by putting in £25 million, which they are talking about putting into Whitegate over the next few months. There is a need for a more co-ordinated approach to this matter and while it might be interesting to sound out opinion around the world there is no substitute for knowing what you are doing here at home.</P>
    <P>It seems that another possibility which was examined was an arrangement under which the Soviet fishing fleet would use the facilities at Verolme Dockyard in Cork.  I think we would all welcome an initiative that led to resumption of activity down there but, again, it should be pointed out very clearly in advance, and we have bitter experience of this, that the Soviet fishing fleet have their own set of practices where maintenance and painting of vessels are involved.  They have, for reasons best known to themselves, a requirement that a certain amount of the work be carried out by the sailors on board the vessels.  That should be made clear very firmly in advance so that any future initiative &mdash; and I would like to see one &mdash; does not trip over that problem as one did indeed in the past with very deleterious results for employment in Cobh and the Cork area generally.</P>
    <P>I must say the general impression is that the Taoiseach's visit to Japan and his two stop-overs in Moscow were useful, and I do not think we should in any way take away from that.  However, it is a fact that the shine seemed to have gone off it rather a bit at the end with the Japanese Prime Minister announcing his resignation and the particularly tragic sequel there was to that.  Of course, the shine had gone completely off the Taoiseach's visit by the time he got back here.  There is a practice in some multinational corporations that they do not allow senior executives to make decisions on any important issues within 48 hours of arriving back from a very long trip.  That is a practice that could perhaps be followed by the Taoiseach.  He came back obviously jet-lagged, clearly a bit tired and who knows perhaps a little emotional and found that things were not to his liking <Col N="929" /> here.  In spite of all the drama and the comment that went on about it, I would have to point out to the House that we have been there before.  The Taoiseach did a similar little dance on a previous occasion after he arrived back from a visit to the United States.  If I were on the front bench over there with the group of Deputies who are there at present, I would pay a good deal of attention to the Taoiseach's future travelling plans and make sure that he never has a journey of more than two or three hours on a plane before he sets foot on <i>terra firma</i> here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That will not be one where we will get jet-lagged.  The Taoiseach will not have any need to be seeking partnerships during the course of that trip, and he will meet a few milestones on the way.</P>
      <P>Having said all of that, and in spite of the fact that the whole thing went rather sour at the end when the Taoiseach got back here, I will conclude by saying, as I have said before, that these visits, and in particular the visit to Japan, seem to have been useful.  They are a proper part of our international relations.  I must say quite sincerely I was impressed by one passage in the Taoiseach's general remarks.  I am very happy to see that he and the party he leads are now beginning in a real sense to turn their eyes outwards and to become, like my party and indeed one or two other parties in this House, a good deal more conscious of our relationship with the rest of the world than has been the case up to now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to be able to say a few words in regard to this visit to Japan and the meetings which were held in Moscow on the way to and from there.  I welcome, of course, the principle of these visits, and perhaps they have been undertaken insufficiently.  Sometimes I ask myself, and particularly so after this last visit to Japan, whether they are undertaken directly for the furtherance of our <Col N="930" /> relations with the country concerned or whether they are undertaken at least in major part for home consumption.  One gets the feeling at times that playing to the gallery at home is a very major element and, of course, RTE did not exactly stint the worship, as I saw it, during the three or four days concerned.</P>
      <P>It is valuable that the Taoiseach has gone to Japan even though there are no immediate results from his visit.  I have some experience of going there myself.  I found at all times that the decision-making period in Japan is extraordinarily long.  Where Americans or Europeans might make up their mind about a particular issue in a matter of weeks, or perhaps at most in a matter of months, one is talking about a period of several years in relation to the Japanese. However, that is their style, their culture and there is nothing we can do about it. Some of the best results of the Taoiseach's trip may not be anything announced by him now but rather perhaps something that will happen in four or five years time.  That is perfectly valid.</P>
      <P>We should examine Japanese investment and trade with this country somewhat more objectively than we do.  It is an unfortunate fact of life that Japanese industrial investment here is at a very low level.  Approximately ten years ago we used to boast that we had 40 per cent of all Japanese industrial investment in Europe.  I do not know what is the current percentage but it would certainly be very small because not a great deal of Japanese industrial investment has taken place here during the eighties.  We have long since been passed out by many other countries in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a particular disappointment that the recent decision of the Toyota motor company of Japan to make an enormous investment, amounting to several billion pounds, in Europe went to Derbyshire in England rather than to this country.  I venture to think that in some earlier times we would have been in there fighting for that investment, hopefully, with some success.  As it happens, on this occasion, we do not appear to have been in the <Col N="931" /> running at all although a number of European countries were in the running.  That is a great pity because it would have been an invaluable investment for us.  That investment directly provides 6,000 jobs in the slightly unlikely site of Derbyshire. Perhaps we could have offered facilities as good as those available there.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in Japanese non-industrial investment here which is to be welcomed but it is not as important in employment terms nor is it as important in actual investment terms as is industrial investment.</P>
    <P>I join the Taoiseach in paying tribute to the extraordinarily skilful staff which the IDA and Ireland are fortunate enough to have in the IDA office in Tokyo.  In that respect no other European country is as well served.  Certainly it is not the fault of anybody there that the flow of investment has declined to the extent it has.  Perhaps we should ask ourselves why this has happened.  One possibility brought to my attention at any rate &mdash; I cannot vouch for its validity &mdash; is the circumstances in which a major investment was made in this country in telecommunications in the early eighties when what appeared to be likely to be a major Japanese investment was not proceeded with, and the investment was made subsequently by a French company without any great success that one can see in terms of employment or output here, which is disappointing.  Such an occurrence can upset the Japanese perception of a country.  Therefore, it might be worth examining why we are in our present position.</P>
    <P>We talk about increases in Irish-Japanese trade which, of course, is happening all the time but from an extraordinarily low base.  Irish exports to Japan &mdash; even though it is one of the richest markets in the world &mdash; are really a drop in the ocean compared with what they should and, in my view, could be.  It is very difficult to sell into that market. With the greatest respect to them, at no time have the Japanese themselves made it easy to sell into that market.  They are under a lot of pressure from the United <Col N="932" /> States and the European Community to render that exercise somewhat easier. They are very slow indeed in how they move in that regard.  If there is any one country in Europe from which exports should be welcomed in Japan I would have thought it was Ireland because Ireland, less than any other country in the EC, puts up barriers to Japanese trade.  For example, more than one-third of cars sold here each year are imported fully built-up, from Japan.  That is a much higher proportion of Japanese vehicles than is the case in any other European country.  For example, France restricts the import of Japanese vehicles to, I think, 3 per cent.  The French are not even prepared willingly to allow Japanese brand vehicles, now manufactured in Britain, access to the French market unless the Commission force them to accept them.  For that reason it needs a bit more than the polite talk that takes place at these types of meetings and negotiations to try to ensure that we get a fairer share of the Japanese market for our exports.  It is a very valuable market and one to which the Japanese have an obligation to give us greater access than they do.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that about half the Taoiseach's text on his visit is devoted to the two meetings in Moscow.  That may well be justified.  Perhaps they are likely to be more immediately productive.  If they are, I welcome the fact but here are one or two surprising elements in the discussions that took place that ought to be commented on.  The first is the suggestion of some joint activity in relation to fishing, in particular the possibility of the use of Verolme Dockyard in Cork for purposes related to fishing and ship repair.  On the face of it that appears to be a very good idea.  Verolme has been closed for some years now.  If it can be got going again that would be greatly welcomed.  However, it is incumbent on anyone thinking in these terms to remember that not all Soviet fishing vessels are used for fishing, that perhaps quite a proportion are used for other purposes.  That does not invalidate some arrangement <Col N="933" /> being made in regard to the use of Verolme. At the same time it might be borne in mind that an understanding be reached that vessels used there would be confined, in so far as at all possible, to fishing and nothing else.</P>
    <P>I note also from the Taoiseach's remarks that he made the suggestion to the Soviet authorities that they would take a share in our oil storage and refining capacity on a partnership basis.  I find that a little surprising because already at least two other countries have been asked to make proposals in this regard and nothing has been worked out on that over the past year or two.  The Taoiseach refers to the fact that he suggested an oil barter deal.  Elsewhere he referred to the necessity to talk about possible countertrade arrangements between Ireland and the USSR.  If we are having a barter for oil we are not having countertrade; the two things do not appear to me to be compatible.</P>
    <P>I do not know that a barter arrangement for whatever goods we would supply, foodstuffs or other commodities, for oil is a particularly good idea.  If it is proposed to have the Soviet Union supply us with oil it seems implicit in what the Taoiseach says that he envisages their supplying us with crude oil.  I doubt very much if the Soviet authorities would want to supply crude oil; they would want to supply product because they are relatively near us.  It would be much more valuable from their point of view to supply refined product and that aspect has not been clarified.  My recollection is that most Soviet oil is quite different from North Sea and Saudia Arabian oil, which is refined at Whitegate at present. Soviet oil, therefore, for the most part could not be used in Whitegate, without major changes being made in that refinery, which might then prevent it being used for other types of oil.  If the Soviets are able to supply the type of oil that could be used in Whitegate, that would be a different matter.  However, the question arises as to whether they are prepared to supply crude oil or would much prefer to supply product, as they <Col N="934" /> have been supplying to this market for the past 15 to 20 years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes adverted to the most noteworthy part of the Taoiseach's visit to Japan and Moscow as being the homecoming because it appears that on his arrival, a great deal of political instability seems to have been caused by what he said.  Of course, this contrasts greatly with what the Minister for Health had said on that very same Wednesday morning on the Dáil motion.  The Minister for Health had said that the Government did not see that motion as a matter of great consequence and that there was no question of it causing a general election or anything of that kind.  The Taoiseach, on arrival, seemed to be rather annoyed and the unstable atmosphere that has existed for the past five or six days was engendered by him by what he had to say.  It may well be that this concern about the possibility of the election does not arise out of a defeat on a motion last week in respect of which the total amount of money that would have been involved over a three year period was only £1.2 million.  It may well be that the Taoiseach's concern arises out of other matters, which seem to be in the process of disclosure at present and which are a great deal more fundamental than the question of the expenditure of such a relatively small amount of money.</P>

      <P>On that basis, Sir, I will conclude by simply saying that I am glad that these visits take place.  Rather than criticising the Taoiseach for making <Col N="935" /> them, I encourage him where possible to make more.  I think it is beneficial to the country.  The fact that it is considerably beneficial to the Taoiseach is by the way.  If the country benefits, that is what is important.  Countries like Japan, the Soviet Union and others lay great store on a visit from a country's leading political figure or the holder of senior political office.  For that reason I hope the Taoiseach will not be averse to making more visits of this kind to open up contacts and possible markets for this country in a world which is changing very rapidly.  I agree with him that we need to adjust to change as rapidly as we can and to seek to benefit from it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of principle I am in favour of visits of this nature.  The Taoiseach visited Japan, and had a stop over in Moscow, and the main part of the visit in particular was very necessary.  By and large only good can come out of these trips.  Given the economic weaknesses which still exist in this country and which will exist for a considerable time, I believe it is very necessary for us to take every opportunity to increase our volume of trade and to attract foreign investment wherever possible.  If we aspire to creating the jobs we so badly need, it is obvious that we will have to attract foreign investment and find foreign markets for our goods.</P>
      <P>Japan is an obvious target.  It is a country which has a lot to offer Ireland. We have boasted in the past of having had reasonable success in attracting Japanese industry but this has been only a drop in the ocean when compared with the potential investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it is within the tenor of this report to comment on the lack of coordination between the various State services. I would have liked if the Taoiseach had looked at the situation as it exists in Japan and in the Far East in general.  I believe we should have far greater coordination and a far greater commercial role for the Department of Foreign Affairs in promoting Irish trade, particularly in places like the Far East.  To my <Col N="936" /> knowledge some countries, for example, Finland, have appointed a specific minister for foreign trade.  It might be difficult to take their example because of the constituency demands on Ministers but I urge the Government to look at this possibility. I know that the Finnish Minister for Foreign Trade spends more than six months of the year abroad selling Finland and attempting to find markets for Finnish products.  From the trade figures, it appears that he does this quite well. There is no doubt that there is huge importance placed on visits by high political figures to countries.  Japan, in particular, takes great pride in such visits.  I had the honour and pleasure of representing the Government on a visit to Japan in 1986 and I can concur with what has been said about the IDA &mdash; their approach and professionalism is second to none.</P>
    <P>As we are all told, the Japanese take two to three years to make major decisions in commercial dealings and it is very important that while they are making their decisions we keep in regular contact with them and offer every encouragement to them.  I believe that such events as the Japanese trade mission to Ireland in 1986 and my visit to Japan in that year when I met with many companies, companies the Taoiseach met with also, are very necessary in establishing a link with the Japanese.</P>
    <P>I would have liked if the Taoiseach had focused somewhat on access to the Japanese market.  In 1986 there were many serious issues relating to high barriers which the Japanese placed on Irish exports, but perhaps at another time the Taoiseach can inform us if he had discussions with the ministry of trade, in particular, on our access to their markets. The efforts by CTT in regard to the Japanese market are to be commended. However, perhaps they would need more staff because of the size of their task.  At a time of cutbacks in public expenditure, it is very difficult to increase the allocation to State agencies like CTT and the IDA but in my opinion money invested in these semi-State bodies to be spent in places like Japan, Korea or elsewhere in <Col N="937" /> the Far East gives a multi-fold return and should certainly be encouraged.  Should the Government seek to increase funding for these agencies, I would lend my total support.</P>
    <P>There were what I would describe as weaknesses in the trip.  There was a mass of benign coverage of the Taoiseach's visit.  That is his pleasure as Taoiseach. However, there was some incredibility about the coverage of the political difficulties during the course of the visit.  In that respect the timing was unfortunate, though through no fault of the Taoiseach. I can only say that the resignation of the Japanese Prime Minister, which was obviously a major political upheaval, must have pre-occupied the man in question during the Taoiseach's visit.</P>
    <P>The visit to the Soviet Union, which is obviously a part of the building of links with the Soviet Union certainly highlighted that there are certain opportunities. As a small nation I believe we should pursue these.  I commend the Taoiseach on the proposed visits which are to take place in the autumn.  These are of interest to this country and I hope they are of benefit.  I hope the House will have an early opportunity of discussing exactly what the Government have in mind in relation to their economic strategy and to strategies generally for the links with the Soviet Union.  I believe there are enormous possibilities.  What we are now witnessing is perhaps the most interesting in the history of the Soviet Union.  There has obviously been a new awakening in that State and I believe they are looking more to the West to developing links and, for my part, I believe we should reciprocate and cooperate with them.</P>
    <P>I hope we will have some clarification of the Government's intentions on the development of an energy strategy because so far as Whitegate and the Whiddy storage facilities are concerned, regrettably it seems that there is a decision a day from the Government, depending on which Minister is speaking. If a Minister is visiting the south he seems to feel it incumbent on him to offer a new policy or a new strategy in relation to our <Col N="938" /> resources.  They are not altogether co-ordinated. I do not want to labour the point, but it would appear that discussions are in train with three different countries in relation to our oil storage facilities in Whiddy and also we are talking about a major investment in Whitegate.  Perhaps the Minister responsible would come into the House at an early stage and afford us the opportunity of having a discussion on what basis these negotiations are taking place and what are the prospects in relation to the current world oil situation for developing these facilities which, needless to say, are in great need of development.  In relation to Whiddy and the oil strategy generally, there is a need for clarification of the position.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset I commend the Taoiseach on undertaking this visit.  I am not sure that he would be overly enthusiastic about going away again given the tenor of his arrival back in the country. If the Taoiseach goes away again perhaps we could ask that he arrive back on a Monday or a Friday in everybody's interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity the Taoiseach has given the House to respond to his statement and his visit to Japan and the Soviet Union. As the Taoiseach has pointed out, Japan is a major trading nation and it is important that we should have friendly political links and productive trading links with that country.  To that extent, the Taoiseach's visit was an important one and very welcome.  It must be said that it was hardly the history making dramatic breakthrough that the Government press machine sought to suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most optimistic reports in relation to the visit to Japan suggested that while in Japan the Taoiseach got promises of investment of between £20 million and £30 million, which was likely to have a job creation potential of around 1,500.  It is significant and it should be noted that these promises are not included in the Taoiseach's statement today.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could take the opportunity to put on record whether these promised <Col N="939" /> investments will come and, if so, when. It remains to be seen if this promise of investment translates into reality and if the jobs actually materialise.  If all the jobs that had been promised, not just by this Government but by previous Governments over the past 15 years, had materialised we would have a very small unemployment problem.  Even the 1,500 jobs promised arising from the Japanese visit &mdash; welcome as they will be, if they materialise &mdash; would be a drop in the ocean as far as the current unemployment situation is concerned, in that these 1,500 jobs would constitute the equivalent of, say, two weeks' emigration figures.</P>
    <P>Two of the promised Japanese projects are proposed to be located in the Financial Services Centre in the Customs House Dock site.  I and The Workers' Party have always been rather sceptical about the job creation potential and the projected job creation at that centre.  It would seem that this Government have placed considerable hope in relation to job creation there.  No doubt jobs have been provided during the construction of the centre.  As long as it continues they will be there and as far as the construction industry is concerned they are welcome. But financial services are simply not going to provide the jobs on the scale needed to deal with our employment levels.  Indeed, an article in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of 25 April 1989 reporting on the Taoiseach's visit to Japan, pointed out that while many of the world's major financial giants have shown an interest in Ireland the number of jobs created to date &mdash; in relation to the Financial Services Centre &mdash; has been tiny.  Companies like Chase Manhattan are already operating with fewer than five employees.  According to the IDA, even after taking all the 60 projects which have sought approval, the initial yield in jobs will be only about 1,400.  That is a long way from the projected 7,000 which had been talked about when this project was proposed.  What this House has to accept is that relying on the Japanese or on financial services will not make a significant impact on our unemployment figures.  If we want to <Col N="940" /> reduce unemployment we will have to do it primarily ourselves and the main job creation vehicle will have to be in the industrial area.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's stop-overs in the Soviet Union were of equal importance to the Japanese trip and judging by the Taoiseach's statement would appear to have been more productive.  The Taoiseach was able to avail of his stop-overs at Moscow to follow up on the talks held during the visit of President Gorbachev to Ireland.  I hope the Taoiseach was suitably impressed by the duty-free shop at Moscow Airport, which is now being run by Aer Rianta.  It shows, I believe, that a well run innovative semi-State company can be a successful commercial ambassador and a valuable earner for this country.  It shows the important potential of the State sector and that far from selling off State companies, as the present Government are doing and are planning to do, it is in the interests of this country to expand, develop and modernise our State sector as part of a comprehensive job creation strategy.</P>
    <P>An agreement with the Soviet authorities regarding the possibility of their fishing fleet using Verolme Dockyard for repairs and maintenance to their trawlers would be a welcome breakthrough for the Cobh area which has suffered so badly from job losses during the past decade.  The facilities at Verlome and the skills of the workforce in the area have been totally under-utilised.  The joint Soviet-Irish proposal in relation to Verolme could be an important step towards putting the yard back on a firm footing as a significant employer in that area.</P>
    <P>In relation to the oil situation and the barter deal which the Taoiseach has been talking about, and because of the continuous strangle-hold which the multinational oil companies have on the economy of this country, it is important that the discussions with the Soviet authorities on a barter deal be brought to a conclusion as soon as possible.  The events of the past few weeks have shown just how important it is for this country <Col N="941" /> to secure a source of crude oil, independent of the multinational oil companies. The price of crude oil in the international market is likely to increase steadily over the next few months, fuelling inflation in the Irish economy and putting more pressure on interest rates. Against this background a barter arrangement which would protect the country against inflationary pressure has particular attractions.</P>
    <P>In relation to the suggestion made by the Taoiseach that the Soviets consider taking a share in our oil storage and refining capacity on a partnership basis, I take the same view in relation to such a deal as I have taken in relation to the Nigerian proposal, that in any such deal we should ensure that this State retains control over our refining capacity and over the Whiddy terminal and the oil storage there.  It is not good enough to allow such strategic things like oil and the supply and refining of oil to be taken out of the hands of the State.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to dissolve the Irish Land Commission and to provide for attendant matters.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission is an ancient institution that has played a notable part in our history.  Its passing therefore is an occasion of significance and to mark it a brief historical sketch seems appropriate.</P>
      <P>By the middle of the 19th century the land of Ireland, through confiscation and plantation, had passed into the hands of landlords.  Their tenants were tenants at will, who held their farms, not on contract, but at the pleasure of the landlord. They could be envicted on a whim, without compensation for disturbance or for any improvements which they had carried out.  This situation led to the vigorous campaign for agrarian reform about which we have all read at school.  The campaign bore fruit in 1881 with the Gladstone Act &mdash; which could be described as the tenants' charter.  Under it they got what were known as the 3 Fs &mdash; that is fixity of tenure, fair rent and free sale.  The act also created a new tribunal &mdash; the Irish Land Commission &mdash; which was to deal with applications for fair rents.  After some years, however, it became clear that the ills inherent in the system could only be cured by the abolition of landlordism altogether and its replacement by a system of tenant proprietors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly in the series of Land Acts which were passed between 1881 and 1921 the emphasis was on the tenants buying out the landlords' interest with the help of money advanced by the State. The Land Commission was given the responsibility for this operation.  It was <Col N="943" /> also given power to purchase and acquire land for distribution among small farmers with a view to relieving congestion.  By 1921 over 316,000 holding covering an area of 11 million acres had been brought out and 750,000 acres had been distributed among 35,000 allottees either by way of enlargement or by the creation of new holdings.  Despite this progress the land problem was far from being completely solved.  There were still 100,000 holdings, comparising three million acres, to be brought out.  In addition, a dynamic programme of land settlement was required to relieve the worst congestion. These were the tasks facing the new Government.  In 1923 the first Land Act under a native government was passed. This had two objectives, namely, to intensify land purchase and to relieve congestion: it also compelled landlords to furnish to the Land Commission particulars of their tenants' holdings.  These holdings were then vested in the commission and later revested in the tenants to make them the full owners.  Payment to the landlords was made in land bonds. This task was completed in the thirties.</P>
    <P>The abolition of landlordism, while of immense psychological value, did not, however, do much to improve the material conditions of the smallholders. On the whole, these were grim.  To meet the situation the Land Commission embarked on a vast programme of structural reform which aimed, through the acquisition and distribution of land, to enlarge and re-arrange small holdings and, generally, to relieve congestion. One of the constraints in achieving the latter aim was the fact that in areas where the problem of congestion was most acute there was often little land available for acquisition.  In such circumstances, the only way of getting land, therefore, was through migration.  This meant that a landholder gave up his home holding and was given a new holding elsewhere.  The land given up was then used to enlarge and re-arrange the remaining holdings. The biggest group to migrate under the aegis of the Land Commission was from Connemara when 27 families were settled <Col N="944" /> at Rathcarn in County Meath.  That was in 1935.  In subsequent years other families were brought from Kerry, Donegal, Mayo and Galway and settled in adjoining townlands.  An interesting feature of this settlement is that the cultural heritage, including the Irish language, which families brought with them has survived.</P>
    <P>From 1923 1.25 million hectares were distributed among beneficiaries and over 2,000 families migrated and were given new holdings.  In addition, the Land Commission carried out extensive improvement works.  It built dwellinghouses and out-offices; carried out drainage; reclamation and fencing; and provided roads and water supplies.</P>
    <P>In 1976 the Government set up an inter-departmental committee to examine the whole land question and decided at the same time to amalgamate the Land Commission with the Department of Agriculture.  The committee found that on the whole the existing policy of acquisition and re-distribution had outlived its usefulness.  In the first place the pool of large estates available for acquisition had declined considerably.  Accordingly, the Land Commission found itself acquiring smaller unused properties the acquisition of which, in general, proved long and tedious as owners availed of their statutory rights to oppose proceedings to the limit.  In view of the small areas involved the contribution of this activity to the land settlement programme was minimal and it was questionable whether the effort and costs involved in the necessarily long drawn out acquisition procedures could be justified in terms of results.  Another most important factor was the rise in land prices.  These were far in excess of what the Land Commission could recover on resale and the subsidies involved were putting an increasing strain on the taxpayer.  There was also the growing unacceptability of land bonds as a means of payment.  Accordingly, the committee recommended in 1978 that the policy of acquisition be terminated and that the land on hands be disposed of. Between that time and 1983, when acquisition was terminated completely, the <Col N="945" /> amount of land acquired progressively decreased each year.</P>
    <P>As the work of the Land Commission was wound down staff numbers in the Commission were reduced, both through natural wastage and redeployment to other tasks.  The availability of Land Commission staff has proved to be most useful, particularly for the expeditious discharge of other important and urgent work which arises from time to time.  An example of this is the redeployment of Land Commission staff to the task of assessing the eligibility of land with a view to implementing the Government's proposal to extend the disadvantaged areas.  In determining the staff numbers to be redeployed outside the commission it is necessary to be mindful of the importance and indeed the urgency of disposing of the commission's land bank as quickly as possible.  Where work in this respect is proving difficult or has fallen behind schedule, staff are redeployed, within the Land Commission, from other areas.  I am determined that there will be no unavoidable delay in disposing of the land bank, so as both to reduce the costs involved and to place land quickly in the hands of those who need it.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to give statutory effect to the position which has obtained since 1983.  In short, the Bill provides for the dissolution of the Land Commission; the revocation of the power of the State to take over land, except by exchange, for land settlement purposes; the transfer to the President of the High Court of the jurisdictions vested in the Office of the judicial commissioner and in the appeal tribunal; the transfer to the Minister for Agriculture and Food of certain functions of the commission and the four lay commissioners, mainly to allow for the disposal of land on hand and for the continuation of controls in the purchase of land by non-qualified persons; the transfer to the Minister of all land and other property vested in the commission, with the exception of fishing rights and fisheries which will be transferred to the Central Fisheries Board; and the payment of compensation to the lay commissioners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="946" /> I should like to make clear that the enactment of this Bill will not affect the continuation of certain work and functions of the commission.  These are: the disposal of land on hands; the revesting in the names of the new owners of land already allotted and of land yet to be allotted; the exercise of statutory control over the subdivision of farms and the purchase of land by non-qualified persons, mainly companies and non-EC nationals; the promotion of group purchase and leasing of land as well as provision of assistance for schemes of rearrangement and commonage division; and miscellaneous statutory and other obligations such as the collection of annuities, custody of title documents, the management of lands awaiting disposal, responsibilities of the offices of Examiner of Title and of Public Trustee.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to express my gratitude to and admiration for the work carried out by the staff of the Land Commission.  Their dedication to Irish agriculture and in particular, to improving the lot of the smallholder is well known and appreciated in every parish in the country.  The demise of the Land Commission is due essentially to the completion of their task.  That task was both a noble and historic one and was carried out effectively, often in the face of most difficult human circumstances and always in accordance with necessarily cumbersome legal procedures.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission has often been criticised in the past for the speed with which it brought individual redistributions to a conclusion.  Such criticism ignored the major problem confronting the commission in settling upon a just redistribution.  I emphasise the word &ldquo;just&rdquo;.  The need to achieve justice in the face of many competing, and often incompatible, demands was of paramount importance.  For this reason, the procedures followed were necessarily complex and led to long delays.  That so many redistributions were harmoniously achieved is a tribute to the dedication of the staff to which I already referred and indeed to their tremendous patience and <Col N="947" /> wisdom.  Irish agriculture, and indeed the entire Irish nation, owe the Land Commission staff an immense debt of gratitude.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this Bill.  Before I get down to the substance and the quick review of the history of the Land Commission which the Minister has given us, there is one point I should like straightened out. This is an enormous omission from the Minister's contribution, which contribution I acknowledge.  We all had the document <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> paraded before us at the last general election and subsequently. Under the agricultural section heading of &ldquo;Making Agriculture Profitable in a Changing World&rdquo;&mdash; I shall not embarrass the Minister by reading nine-tenths of this on foot of what has gone on recently &mdash; one of the key elements of the Fianna Fáil approach is &mdash; and I quote directly from that document:&mdash;&ldquo;a land authority to encourage the build-up of as many family farms as possible to reasonable size&rdquo;.  If ever there was an opportunity to announce an intention in relation to the formation of a land authority, it is surely here this evening as we all discuss the dissolution of the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened the Fianna Fáil promise?  They canvassed on the door and were elected to office on the basis that they would provide a land authority. I take it now from the Minister's address that a land authority is no longer Fianna Fáil policy, that it was merely another empty election promise to the many farmers around the country who wanted to hear that from them.  Apparently it is not to be.  A little more honesty and forthrightness in these matters is really what farmers want.  They do not want false promises, raised expectations.  They just want us politicians to be honest and straight with them, even if what we are saying at times is not what they would ideally like to hear.  They would like to know where they stand.  Let us put to bed the idea of a land authority from Fianna <Col N="948" /> Fáil.  That is yet another election promise kaput here this evening.</P>
    <P>We are discussing this evening, in the abolition of the Land Commission, a very significant step in Irish agrarian history. It is interesting that the Minister and I should choose the same word &ldquo;significant&rdquo;. To many who perhaps would not be very interested in agricultural issues it seems perhaps another reasonably insignificant piece of legislation we have to get through.  However, behind what we are doing today is years of history. We are closing a chapter on agrarian history.  So much has happened and has had to happend to get the Land Commission abolished and so much has happened since its inception in the hundred-odd years, that it deserves a little of our time and attention today.</P>
    <P>Let us look first at the reason for having a Land Commission at all.  As the Minister reminded us &mdash; and I shall continue from there &mdash; by the mid-17th century, following a series of plantations and confiscations, up to 80 per cent of land in some of our counties had been taken and allocated to creditors of the English Parliament.  There was virtually a complete transfer of power and wealth to British landlords and by the time the penal Laws were relaxed at the end of the 18th century 95 per cent of Irish land was owned by settlers, many absentee landlords, with small farmers as tenants. The well catalogued story of tragedy, of unscrupulous agents, middlemen, rack rents, evictions and ejections has been told so many times and is very well documented. By 1870 there were 527,000 yearly tenancies which could be terminated on six months' notice.  During these years British land legislation for Ireland was directed at strengthening the social and legal position of Irish landlords, with a thousand landlords owning over half the land.  With the growth in our population, there was intensive sub-division of holdings and small farms multiplied until 90 per cent of all holdings were under 12 hectares &mdash; 25 or 26 acres.</P>
    <P>From 1878 to 1881 we had some very turbulent years, with an increase in the number of evictions, and agrarian crime and political turmoil generally.  Then we <Col N="949" /> had Charles Parnell, himself a landlord, recognising the gross injustices to tenants. Together with Michael Davitt, he founded the Irish Land League &mdash; a milestone in agrarian history.  The Irish Land League's first success was the passing in 1881 of the Land Act which provided, as the Minister pointed out, fixity of tenure, fair rent and free sale.  This was the Act that set up the Land Commission as a tribunal.  To give the Act its full title, it is the Landlord (Ireland) Act of 1881 which is, in fact, what I understand we are repealing today.</P>
    <P>This Act was to be followed by other land Acts resulting in a good deal of land reform up to the end of British rule in 1921.  Subsequently, voluntary sale or a voluntary purchase system did not lead to the end of landlordism, so in 1923 the Irish Government's first Land Act was passed, which provided for compulsory purchase in three sets of circumstances. One was for the granting of ownership to tenants of land.  Secondly, it provided for compulsory purchase to relieve congestion. Indeed, the phrase &ldquo;congested district boards&rdquo; that I remember going back over the years has an antediluvian ring or concept about it today, but it was not that terribly long ago when one looks back on it.  The very phrase brings to mind all that was difficult and turbulent and all the hardship of the years gone by.  Those three words say it all. The third provision of the 1923 Land Act was to allow compulsory purchase to create economic holdings.</P>
    <P>Over the years there followed a change of government in 1932, the economic war with Britain, the Second World War, then in 1948 a trade agreement with Britain and two reviews of agricultural policy during the Programme for Economic Expansion, in 1958 and in 1963.  We had the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement in 1965 which parallelled the closure of the Community's markets, to Irish cattle and beef.  There was a third Programme for Economic and Social Development from 1969 to 1972 which dealt again with agricultural policy.  We then arrived at the stage where there <Col N="950" /> was a series of White Papers and protracted negotiations that led to our entry into the Community, along with the United Kingdom.  We then had the benefits of the Common Agricultural Policy and initially there were quite considerable benefits with the price guarantees and all that went with them.  There followed our entry into the EMS when, from the agricultural perspective, the gloss suddenly went off our membership of the European Community and things did not turn out to be as we thought they would.</P>
    <P>We are now into the scenario of the reform of the CAP with stabilisers and production quotas of one kind or another.  We are witnessing the decoupling of agricultural production from agricultural aids.  As long as the money from Europe is not directed directly to increasing production, helping production or increasing efficiency of production, as more and more aids are directed at setaside type measures, extensification measures, income aids or paying farmers not to produce, we may keep this generation on the small, uneconomic holdings in the remote parts of rural Ireland. But I doubt if there is a future of any kind on those holdings for the next generation if all their parents have benefited from in the context of the EC is handouts to pay them to produce nothing.  That will not ensure a thriving rural agriculture. That will not ensure the survival of the family farm.</P>
    <P>You cannot call that farming.  That is just paying people to be quiet and do nothing, paying them in the hope that they will stay in the country rather than join the dole queues in our cities, migrate or emigrate.  These are the choices that will be before them.  When you decouple production from agricultural aids, which is effectively the result of the reform of CAP and what President Bush wants to do in the US, and when you give handouts and tell farmers to do nothing, that is the writing on the wall for the future of the small family farm in rural Ireland.  To this, above all, we must all turn our attention to make sure there is a future.</P>
    <P>I was glad to note in the Minister's <Col N="951" /> speech that in maybe three short sentences he referred to what land policy would be left in his Department.  I ask him to think very carefully about this.  He must ensure there is a land policy section in his Department and that the expertise now existing in the form of field officers and Land Commission staff in the various sub-offices throughout the country will not be moved.  He should keep those expert in conveyancing, in the Land Acts and in handling problems in rural Ireland to operate a clearly defined land policy in a clearly defined land section of the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>As I interpret what the Minister said, the present land policy would appear to operate on four levels, commonage division, medium to long term leasing and encouragement in that area, a distributive rearrangement which we have had all along, and group purchase schemes which I hope the Minister has included.  There are the bones there of a land policy.  Add to that the Euro-perspective and what the Structural Funds are allowing us, the set aside schemes extensification, and perhaps income aids of some sort which come within a land policy concept, given what it is trying to achieve.</P>
    <P>As far as Fine Gael are concerned, a land policy is to ensure as far as practicable that the ownership or management of our agricultural land is and remains in the hands of those best fitted to use it and to improve the physical structure of agricultural holdings generally. That is the Fine Gael policy in relation to how to make the best use of our agricultural land and agricultural structures at the moment.  I hope the Minister will clarify and crystallise what land policy means to him.</P>
    <P>I welcome the brief reference in his contribution to it, but in the wake of the Land Commission we need to develop in detail what land policy will be left as far as the Fianna Fáil Minister is concerned. What section of the Department will look after it?  We need assurances that the expertise that is there now, the manpower within the Land Commission, will <Col N="952" /> not be decimated and that we will make the best use of them in the future.</P>
    <P>The one point in the Minister's speech which any of us by accepting the Bill here today agrees with in the absence of replacing it will something else, is that we are removing any controls on the purchase of land or any option or schemes on the control of the purchase of land which had been effectively vested in the Land Commission.  In other words, they could claim priority of land in an area where they needed if for division among farmers.  That is gone.  That is one of the major changes we are facing.  If we accept that they will no longer be part of a scheme for the control and purchase of land, we must be quite sure we know what we are doing, that we are ready for it as a country and what its implications are.</P>
    <P>When you get into private property, compulsory purchase and so on, it will be very hard to replace that control with an equivalent, given our Constitution. Perhaps we should debate whether we should go down that road and if such controls will be necessary in future.  We will have a two tier structure in agriculture very shortly.  On the one hand, we will have the large dairy farmer with a substantial quota who will have cash in hand, thanks to the good returns he is getting for his milk &mdash; fortunately he or she is getting a good return now, having worked very hard for very long with inadequate returns &mdash; and any farmer with a sizeable quota will be able to outbid virtually any other farmer, not only small farmers but farmers in other agricultural enterprises, for land that may come on the market.  On the one hand, the large dairy farmer will be in a position to buy up land as it comes on the market and become even bigger.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he is not changing the function of the commission in relation to exercising statutory control over the subdivision of farms.  That is agreed.  I would like clarification on a point.  The Minister referred to the purchase of land by non-qualified persons, mainly companies and non-EC nationals.  As we face into 1993 and the single market, the removal of trade barriers of any type, <Col N="953" /> technical and/or other, with encouragement of the free movement of goods, services, capital and personnel throughout the Community, and as a fully fledged member of the Community, not in any second stream, how will we be able to implement control over the purchase of our land by non-nationals?  The Minister talks about non-EC nationals here.  I take it he is saying that within the Community there is total access to purchase of land in any country by any Community member. What controls is he envisaging in relation to non-EC nationals?  How will he prevent them purchasing our land?  How will he prevent companies &mdash; Irish companies I presume; he does not say non-EC companies &mdash; purchasing land?  What does he mean by a qualified person when it comes to the purchase of land?  Is it qualified in the sense of holding the three year green certificate in agriculture?  We need this clarified.</P>
    <P>Of all the areas of concern in the wake of the Land Commission it is the future of Irish land and in whose hands it may end up and whether, ever again, the small farmer with the family farm in a remote part of rural Ireland will be in a position to increase his farm to an economic holding, that is most important.  Are we saying today that any holding that is still uneconomic despite the years of existence of the Land Commission will never again get the opportunity of becoming economic? Or are we saying, effectively, that unless the farmer concerned has a reasonable dairy quota and has cash in hand to purchase land over the years, he will be denied access to the ownership of more land?  I am not quite sure how those controls will continue to be exercised, how we define a non-qualified person, on what basis you will say a company cannot buy land or how we will prevent non-EC nationals buying our land.  I will be very interested to hear what the Minister has in mind and how he will be proceeding in relation to that area.</P>
    <P>In this arena, too, we have the difficulty of the milk quota being attached to land and the suggestion that post-1992 the milk quota might be separated from <Col N="954" /> the land.  Will the milk quota be transferable across borders then?  If the milk quota stays with the land, will there not be an enormous temptation, not just for the larger Irish dairy farmer but the dairy farmer in the Community generally, to purchase small and unviable milk quotas at the moment?  Are we looking to a future of the land getting back into the ownership of a few, the few mainly being large dairy farmers?  This whole area is rather grey.  I would be delighted if the Minister would expand and develop his own thoughts and the thoughts of his advisers in the Department of Agriculture as to the road we are heading down and the controls the Community envisage being put in place in relation to handling these problems.</P>
    <P>The original press release &mdash; I think it was in 1986 &mdash; which dealt with the dissolution of the Land Commission stated that it was the aim to have all lands held by the Land Commission disposed of by the end of 1986.  The previous Minister for Agriculture went out of office in February 1987.  He might have been a couple of months behind schedule if he had not disposed of all of the lands by then, but this Minister appears to be two and a quarter years behind schedule.  Perhaps the Minister would tell the House how much land is still on hand to be disposed of by the Land Commission.  We must remember it was all supposed to be gone by the end of 1986.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with the problems of land reverting to the original ownership where there have been protracted negotiations which have not been brought to a conclusion.  This is dealt with in section 7.  How many such deals are involved and how long have the negotiations been going on?  What acreage of land is involved where the deal has not been completed and the land will be reverting to the owners from whom the Minister was trying to acquire it?</P>
    <P>Another matter which concerns me greatly is the fact that this Government, in the National Development Plan, have made such ado about integrated rural development.  As an aspiration all of us have to support the concept of integrated <Col N="955" /> rural development, trying to stabilise remote rural communities and ensure that there is a future for the small family farm that would not strictly be called economic in today's agricultural scene. The problem with all of this and with the aspirations in the national plan is that the only body in the State fit to advise this or any other Minister in relation to rural development and rural policy was the rural economy research centre in Teagasc.  We do not have any agricultural economic institute, despite the fact that agriculture plays such a part in employment, exports and wealth production. We will be demanding much from agriculture in the future in terms of the support of the country.  All we had was the rural economy research centre in Teagasc or &mdash; as it was &mdash; AFT.  What has this Minister done in the past 18 months?  He has talked about integrated rural development.  We have heard a lot about pilot schemes here, there and yonder and we have questioned the way the co-ordinators of the pilot schemes were appointed.</P>

      <P>The only body in this country fit and qualified to advise the Minister or his successor in relation to integrated rural development and rural economy generally has been decimated by a reduction of its resources by 75 per cent in the past 18 months.  Some of us are cleverer than others in this House but I am not looking anywhere in particular. I do not think the Minister, I or anybody else in this House could do without the advice of the single body which can direct integrated rural development and which has the brief and the experience to advise the Minister of the day in relation to it. Apparently this Minister has the benefit of such wisdom that, with the stroke of a pen, the one centre which can advise him can be reduced by 75 per cent.  The few who are left in the section are dealing with the national farm survey for the EC, which is part of the farm accounts data network compulsory on each member country.  I venture to suggest that if it were not compulsory it would have gone also.  We cannot let it go because we have to do it due to our Community commitments. We need to pay more than lip service to integrated rural development. We welcome the agri-tourism package the Minister mentioned.  We have tremendous potential in this area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Paul Connaughton, as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture in the previous Government, did extensive work in relation to land policy generally.  In the wake of the Land Commission whose dissolution we are discussing we have to be very clear about the land policy we have in place and the assistance and aids which will be available to the non-economic farmers.  It was Deputy Connaughton's view, which I fully support, that one of the most immediate ways of achieving the aim that either the ownership or the managment of our agricultural land be in the hands of those fit to use it was through medium and long term leasing.  Leasing is very attractive because it appeals to those who, for reasons of age, ill health or otherwise cannot work their land effectively but still want to retain their ownership and see the land put into good production.  On the other hand, leasing appeals to those who need extra land but who are not in a position to effect the purchase of it outright and cannot raise the capital costs.  About one million acres are leased on the 11-month system.  About one third of this is leased to people for periods of more than five years.  It is this one third who are in a semi-permanent leasing position towards whom we must direct the long term and medium term leasing policy.  To do this in 1984 it was necessary to introduce a Land Bill.  I refer to part of the debate in the Seanad on 23 October 1984 which puts together what has happened over the years in relation to the developments from the time the Land Commission was set up to what we are facing today.  The following is stated at <Col N="958" /> columns 356 and 357 of volume 353 of the Official Report of the Seanad:</P>
    <P>The programme of reform of landlord tenant relations in Ireland saw the tenant advance from the position of occupation at the whim of the landlord to himself becoming the owner of the land.  The process began around 1860 with a series of Statutes which granted progressively more rights to the tenant until the balance of advantage lay with him over the landlord.  Following the successful struggle of the Irish farmer to gain ownership of his own land, there was a natural determination to ensure that the old system of landlordism should not be revived.  Accordingly, the Land Commission were given the power to control leasing and the legislation favouring the tenant remained on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>This has been the difficulty over the years in encouraging leasing, particularly medium and long term leasing.</P>
    <P>This emphasis on ownership led to a situation where possession of land, <i>per se</i>, tended to be regarded as an end in itself and more important questions of user and management tended to be overlooked.  The instinctive the basic motivation of land holders was the determination to retain control of their holdings.  Because the legislation was so much oriented towards the tenant, the adoption of leases, even of a short or medium term nature, came to be seen by land holders as a threat to their secure ownership of the land.</P>
    <P>This was the Minister of State on the introduction of the Second Stage of the Land Bill.  It puts in a couple of sentences the fears that were there and which, to a large extent, still exist among owners of land who are not in a position to use it themselves as productively as they might; they retain these fears of long term leasing in case it would weaken their claim to the land in any way.  That is understandable given the turmoil of agrarian history in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This situation led, in turn, to the <Col N="959" /> adoption of the 11-months letting system as a source of revenue for those who were unable or did not wish to work their lands themselves.  As this is merely a licence to use land for a certain limited purpose for a certain limited period it does not constitute a letting in the full legal sense and is not, therefore, governed by the existing landlord-tenant legislation.</P>
    <P>This was the moot point.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, we wish to persuade those at present letting under the 11-months system, and any other farmers for whom the arrangements might be beneficial, to turn to leasing instead, then an obvious requirement is to repeal any legislation which might appear to act against their interests.</P>
    <P>This is exactly what the Land Bill, 1984, did.  The Minister stated at the time that it was right that a prospective lessor should have the assurance that when the lease expired he would be able to resume possession without any fuss or legal complications. Any apprehension about claims under law to tenancy interests, compensation and so on, would represent a serious, if not decisive, deterrent to a lessor.  Because of this the Minister considered it proper that those statutory provisions in the old legislation which seemed to favour the tenant unduly during the course, or on expiry, of a lease should be identified and revoked.  Taking that explanation in the context of our agrarian history and what our forbears had been through to get back into the possession and ownership of the land, it is easy to understand the difficulties to date in persuading people to opt for medium or long term leasing.  We must do everything possible, and I encourage the Minister to launch a vigorous PR campaign to get the millions of acres that are now lying fallow into the hands of the young, energetic and efficient farmers who may not have the capital to purchase land themselves but who are in a position to make use of a lot more land than they have at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> In that year too, in the Social Welfare Act of 1984, the previous Minister changed the system of assessing income under the social welfare code which had discriminated against leasing.  This was very important because it was a further encouragement towards leasing.  It effectively means that a farmer who leases his land will be assessed on the same basis as a farmer who lets his land under the 11-months system.  In recent times Fine Gael moved, in Private Members' time, the Economic Development Bill.  Again, in relation to the assessment of leases from land in relation to income tax we suggested that the £2,000 limit be increased to £5,000 before the wrath of the Revenue Commissioners or any tax penalty would be incurred.  Regrettably that Bill was not successful.  I would suggest to the Minister that, for the sake of the most efficient use of our land, a further enticement be offered to those who are not in a position to make good use of their own land to encourage them towards medium and long term leasing.</P>
    <P>The group purchase scheme has been a great success.  It has been made use of in some areas more than others.  Perhaps the Minister could bring us up to date on whether any group purchases have been effected by the Land Commission officers in recent times and what structure he envisages putting in place to ensure that the system of group purchase will be there to be availed of in the future.</P>
    <P>Any system that will help a group of uneconomic smallholders to purchase land on the open market, with the finance and legal advice that is necessary, directed by a Land Commission or Department of Agriculture officer has to be encourged.  I would ask the Minister to advertise the fact that this system is available.  The division of a 200 or 300 acre farm among six or seven smallholders can be done very economically if the situation is managed properly for the group of farmers, but none of those six or seven farmers would be in a position individually to bid at auction for some or all of that land.  Even if it was sold in separate lots each lot would cost far more per acre than if it were sold as one lot <Col N="961" /> and subsequently divided between five or six farmers.  Group purchase must be encouraged; the financial and legal advice must be available to farmers to do this.  I would urge the Department to undertake far more activity in relation to this.</P>
    <P>Commonage division hardly needs much comment because it has been such a success.  There is still a lot of commonage not divided.  There are still disputes among neighbours and farmers as to who owns what in different areas. Again it is an area that makes best use of the land involved.  In regard to the disease eradication programmes it makes sound sense because there is no question of cattle being allowed to graze on a commonage now.  It would be very difficult for farmers to consider letting their cattle out with those of the neighbour when they are not quite sure of the disease status involved.  To make the most efficient use of our land, the ownership must be clearly defined and the different areas fenced off and there should be the greatest observance of the provisions of the disease eradication scheme.</P>
    <P>I am supporting the Bill before the House today for various reasons.  I am not saying I do not have reservations.  I am not saying I am satisfied with the attention the Minister gave to what he considers to be land policy at the moment.  I still do not understand what structure will remain in the Department of Agriculture to handle the issues.  I am not sure what use the Minister will make of the expertise of the staff now in the Land Commission or whether he is going to disseminate that expertise and experience and scatter them to the winds.  I urge the Minister to keep a core of expertise in his Department in order to have an effective and obvious land policy.</P>
    <P>This move today is very significant and brings to a close an important chapter in our agrarian history.  I hope we are ready for what we are doing here today, for a policy involving no controls on the purchase of land.  I have asked the Minister to clarify what controls he says he will still be retaining in relation to companies, qualified persons and non-EC nationals. Perhaps the Minister would expand on <Col N="962" /> this since this is the most important aspect of what we are talking about.  The Minister stated in his speech that the existing policy of acquisition and redistribution has outlived its usefulness.  When we look back and review the history &mdash; we all refreshed our memories when we were looking up a few notes for the debate here this afternoon &mdash; I hope Charles Stewart Parnell and Michael Davitt would have agreed with the decision we made here today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinPGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity of speaking briefly about the Bill on the dissolution of the Land Commission. There can be little argument with the desirability of making the most efficient use of the country's main resource, its agricultural land.  Since the foundation of the State, various Governments have attempted to achieve this but have faced many problems.  In Ireland, the structure, the size and the mobility of farm holdings act against this desirable aim.  One of the main tools of Government policy throughout the years has been the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission were originally set up as a rent fixing body in the last century.  In 1923 the functions of the commission were changed to the acquisition and allotment of land.  The aims were to improve the structure of farm holdings so as to increase the efficiency of the agricultural sector.  Under the 1937 Constitution the desirability of maintaining the family farm structure was accepted. Unfortunately, the Land Commission became more and more irrelevant as time went by.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today as we propose to abolish the Land Commission we can clearly see their failure in achieving their aims.  The Land Commission have failed miserably in achieving a desirable and viable farm structure.  They have failed to bring the size of farms up to a viable level.  It must be stated that the commission faced many problems which hindered them in pursuit of their policy.  First among these is the fact that as technology and efficiency in agriculture improved, the size of a farm to remain viable increased greatly.  In <Col N="963" /> the twenties one would require between 20 and 25 acres of land to have a viable holding; in the late seventies one would want a minimum of 50 acres to have a viable holding and in the eighties, if one was in beef or cereal production, one would require in the region of 100 to 200 acres to have a viable holding.  Perhaps in the future in relation to cereal production one may require between 300 and 400 acres to have a viable holding and this is regrettable.  The writing is on the wall for cereal producers and they will have to examine other methods to survive.</P>
    <P>Another area of criticism is the allotment policy of the commission.  In the seventies they acquired 30,000 acres per annum but the average allotment was only seven acres which is hardly significant in making a small holding viable. The cost of implementing land policy also spiralled in the seventies.  As the price of land increased so, too, did the cost of allotment.  The average cost of allotting one acre of land in the seventies was £200.  With 30,000 acres being allotted each year, the total cost was £6 million. There was a flaw in the original Bill in that it did not require the commission to cover their costs.  It cost £6 million per year for a policy that was not working. This was compounded by the fact that originally the commission acquired large estates.  In later years, most of the acquisition was of small farms whose owners resisted acquisition because they were paid in land bonds and not in cash.  This made the life of the Land Commission more difficult.</P>
    <P>In 1978 the Interdepartmental Committee on Land Policy proposed a change in policy from improved land structure to improved land use.  They proposed to do this through increasing land mobility and regulating the land market.  The committee proposed the abolition of the commission but this was later dropped.  Many of the proposals of the committee with regard to the land policy were very positive. The merits of the committee's proposal for a selective purchase tax are as valid today as they were then.  This tax <Col N="964" /> provided an incentive to small farmers to purchase land and it also provided a disincentive to land speculators and large farmers.  I recall ten years ago when a genuine effort was made to try to curtail the larger farmer and speculator from getting bigger and to give a fair chance to the smaller farmer and make his holdings more viable.  Difficulties also arose with regard to this proposal.  In the seventies, there were not huge discrepancies between incomes from sector to sector. Now in the late eighties there has been such a variation in incomes that there would be certain difficulties with that tax and I acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>It can be seen clearly that the Land Commission have failed and, therefore, their abolition should be welcomed.  I am amazed that this Bill is not accompanied by any proposal, especially in the light of the Government's promises at the last election, to tackle this whole area of land policy.  The fact that the Land Commission failed does not mean that the land policy will fail.  There has to be increased land mobility especially for small developing farmers if they are to stay on the land.  An alternative is long term leasing.  This is a realistic option for certain sectors, for example, the sheep and possibly the dairying sector but apart from those, I would have certain reservations. The Government should encourage leasing in these particular sectors.</P>
    <P>It is now four or five years since the former Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald declared that the commission would be abolished.  Since then over £60 million has been spent by the Land Commission, according to the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>, of which over £20 million was spent solely on administration.  The Bill to abolish the Land Commission is long overdue but the commission's abolition does not fulfil the responsibility of the Government with regard to land policy. In conclusion, it is a pity the Minister did not use this occassion to propose the major changes required in the land policy to ensure that our land is used in the best and most efficient way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a positive view of the Land Commission, their history and the role they have played in Irish agriculture and I would like to throw the droch-chás back in the face of those who have been spreading it around quite generously today in the direction of the Land Commission. The proposal before us is to dissolve the Land Commission who were set up under the Land Act, 1881, to revoke their power to acquire land and to sell off the land they hold at present.</P>
      <P>Since the winding down of the activities of the Irish Land Commission, a new type of estate has developed which has created a charter for what has been generally known in rural Ireland as the &ldquo;land-grabbers&rdquo;. They are comparable in many ways to the old absentee landlords. They have large holdings, they are inefficient and they have low production. Arising from that winding down of the activities of the Land Commission, there has been a heavy involvement of non-farmers in Irish agriculture, who use land for speculative and tax shelter purposes. The abolition of the Land Commission, which we are dealing with today, heralds the good fortune for this particular class of land-holder.  It is the final abdication of land use policy by the Government.  In future, the grabber with the cheque book will reign supreme in the countryside.</P>
      <P>Land has a special constitutional status and is different from other properties in that regard.  Article 45 of the Constitution states that the State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing that there may be established on the land in economic security as many families as in the circumstances shall be practicable. Land is the only property or means of production specifically referred to in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission have allotted over 2.2 million acres of untenanted land since 1923, have acquired over 12,000 estates for the purpose of land distribution and made nearly 100,000 seperate allotments. Land Commission activity over the last 30 years has increased the farm size of some 50,000 mainly small farm <Col N="966" /> operators by an average of at least 18 acres; inhibited expansion by larger operators, thus preventing concentration of land in the hands of a few large farmers, and decreased the level of farm fragmentation which causes waste and inefficiency through inhibiting absorption of large-scale technology.  Since 1950 some 13,000 holdings have been re-arranged.  In my own constituency of Kildare some 300 under-used estates were taken over and 2,400 families established there.  They now make a good living from agriculture arising from that positive action.  There is plenty of scope for further such action not alone in my constituency but also in others.</P>
    <P>Studies have shown that the Land Commission allotees used their newly acquired land better than those full-time farmers who inherited or purchased land on the open market.  Land Commission activity has contributed in the past, both socially and economically, to the development of a more viable rural community and has played a key role in distributing land for public amenities and infrastructural developments which would not have occurred in their absence.</P>
    <P>The consequences of a lack of land policy and an agency to carry it out will be that the best land will be concentrated in the hands of fewer farmers.  At present it is estimated that 25 per cent of all agricultural land is owned by 5 per cent of farmers, despite the activity of the Land Commission.  This demonstrates the continued need for the Land Commission or some similar agency.  Small and medium farmers will not be able to afford to purchase land to increase their production and will thus be economically marginalised in the future.  We had a good example of this in the recent past, in the last week in fact, when land was sold in the southern part of the country at £6,000 an acre in the process excluding young farmers and other smallholders in the area.</P>
    <P>It will be very difficult for young farmers to gain entry into the market due to the high price of land, their inability to lease at favourable long-term rates or the lack of collateral to purchase land.  Land <Col N="967" /> prices will increase in real terms due to competition from non farming interests in land.  This land will be used for tax and speculative purposes and not for production and providing employment on the land.  That is the most inefficient use of land.</P>
    <P>There will be no instrument available to confront their structural problems, farm sizes, distribution, fragmentation, age of farmers and so on.  If we want a progressive farm structure then there must be some agency capable of monitoring and implementing a land policy. There is no other comparable instrument to carry out land policy.  The abolition of the Land Commission without replacement signals the Government's abandonment of a land policy.  Quotas are a most important factor when considering the structure of land.  The Government should be examining ways of pressing for quota reforms at European Community level so that they can come under the aegis of a land use agency.</P>
    <P>I would describe Fianna Fail's record on the matter of land use policy and on the Land Commission in recent years as opportunistic and playing with land use policy.  The 1977 interdepartmental review, when published, was opposed by Fianna Fáil because its proposals were for market regulation.  They pledged at that time their loyalty to a more interventionist Land Commission.  In 1980, the Fianna Faacute;il Government published a White Paper on land policy.  That was not simply a Fianna Fáil Party document, rather it was a document published by a Fianna Fail Government.  It was radical, positive and contained very definite proposals for streamlining and enhancing the role of the Land Commission.  It contained proposals for surcharges on land purchases by non farmers which were very specific and detailed; assistance with the purchase of land for smallholders, 20 per cent of the price to be provided for landholders with a £30 valuation or under; control of land purchase with non farmers not being allowed to buy more than five acres of land without the consent of the Land Commission; a priority list <Col N="968" /> or a register of people eligible for land allotment by the Land Commission.  It stated, and I quote from paragraph 31:</P>
    <P>Even with the introduction of the foregoing measures, there will still be a need for compulsory acquisition for as long as a substantial acreage of land remains underutilised in the hands of owners who are not interested in its development.  It has been estimated that over 30 per cent of the land of the country is taken up by farmers which have shown no significant growth in recent years.  To abandon the compulsory machinery of the Land Commission would be to accept, if not encourage, bad husbandry.  Accordingly, in line with a policy which aims at the promotion of more efficient land use for agricultural development, the main thrust of acquisition in the years ahead will be directed at those lands which are substantially under-utilised or neglected and not contributing their share to agricultural output.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 32 states:</P>
    <P>In western areas there are, additionally, structural and demographic reasons for the continuance of a programme of land acquisition and division in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>It also dealt with the retention of the use of land bonds rather than direct financing and the purchase of land by non nationals was to be severely restricted.  It also dealt with late inheritance, farmers' retirement, commonages, the Land Commission itself, on which it states at paragraph 42:</P>
    <P>The Government have considered whether the Land Commission as an institution should be abolished and they have decided that, on balance, the establishment of a second body to implement land policy would not be justified at this juncture.  The intention is, therefore, that the Land Commission will be responsible for putting the new policy measures into effect as well as operating the existing programme on whatever scale may be <Col N="969" /> determined by the Government from time to time.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 46 of that White Paper reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government intend to introduce legislation at an early date to give effect to the new measures outlined in this White Paper.  In arriving at their conclusions, they have been conscious of the economic and social importance of land tenure and of the complex and sensitive nature of the subject.  They are satisfied that the policy proposals now being put forward will have significant economic and social effects and will make an important contribution towards creating the conditions in which Irish agriculture can develop further in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>That is a quotation from the Fianna Fáil Government White Paper of 1980 and those are the proposals contained therein.  What has happened since then to bring about such a massive change? As I said, it was not a party political document, rather it outlined what the Government intended to do.  I must say that they have come a long way since then.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I propose a major land reform programme through a new land agency to ensure that as many people as possible work on the land, to ensure that land is put to fullest productive use and to reverse the dangerous trend of land concentration in the hands of fewer and larger farmers.  The pattern of land ownership is a major reason Ireland has one of the most under-capitalised, least developed and least productive agricultural sectors in Western Europe.  Overall, our farm population in terms of age, education and training, is ill-equipped to develop a modern production sector.  Only 20 per cent of farms are categorised as modern, whereas nearly one-third are marginal or traditional farms where poverty is concentrated despite modernisation schemes which in effect only assist already developed farmers, thus widening the skill gaps in farm production; 21 per cent of farmers have off-farm employment <Col N="970" /> and half the holdings fail to provide full time employment for a farming family. Over 35 per cent of land is held by farmers aged 55 and over, making up just under one-half of all farmers, and only 16 per cent of farmers are 35 years or under.</P>
    <P>Farmers over 55 years operate over two million acres of land and it is estimated that up to 50 per cent of farm holdings in the western region are fragmented. The high cost of agricultural land purchased by professional and business persons who farm as a part time activity inhibits new, younger farmers getting into farming.</P>
    <P>A number of myths are propagated about the size of farms.  Many believe that bigger is better but this is not the case.  Farmers in the 40 to 100 acre range are more productive in terms of output and labour per unit than larger farmers. Let us make a comparison with the most productive agricultural economy in Europe, Holland, where the average farm is about 30 acres compared to an average of 50 acres in Ireland.  Althought Holland has about one-third the amount of agricultural land as Ireland, it employs thousands more in the farming sector. In Holland the food processing sector employs 100,000 more workers than in Ireland and about 75 per cent of all agricultural produce is processed.  Holland employs more people on less land and her farmers have a higher income in both the farm production and processing sectors because farming is geared towards food processing.  This means more value added production which, in turn, means more jobs in industry and higher farm incomes.</P>
    <P>Labour's land policy will be an integral part of ensuring that land is put into the hands of more farmers with security of tenure and producing for higher value-added products.  We propose the establishment of a land agency to replace the Land Commission and I ask the Minister to take that on board in line with his own party's policy.  The functions of such an agency would be to increase the availability of land to present farm holdings and reduce farm fragmentation, to divert land coming on the market to the hands <Col N="971" /> of productive family farmers and to acquire or encourage the release of neglected or under-utilised land to farmers who would develop it.  Such land agency would regulate the sale of land by establishing a register of land applicants.</P>
    <P>Farmers who meet commercial criteria would be placed on the register and given priority to buy land whenever it became available for sale.  Such criteria would include the amount of land already in possession of farmers to prevent concentration of land among large farm holders, production performance on existing holdings, provision of an outlying farm plan by the applicant and no age limit where there is a prospective successor. Inability to pay for land should not be a bar to being placed on the land register. Fiscal incentives should be used to place preferred applicants in a more advantageous position to purchase or lease available land on a long term basis.</P>
    <P>Such a land agency would establish a land bank through their own purchase of land to ensure that productive farmers would avail of more land, either through purchase or long term leasing from the agency.  The land agency would acquire land by first option purchase of land that comes up for sale and there would be a maximum limit on land held by native and foreign absentee farm holders.  There would be compulsory acquisition of neglected holdings and incentives to release land on the market.  They would provide capital for farm improvements, etc., in exchange for sale of land to the agency.</P>
    <P>The land agency should also operate an expanded farm retirement programme. The number of farms held by bachelors with no direct successors is high and an attractive retirement programme would mean the provision of retirement pensions at attractive rates indexed against inflation.  In return the farmer would lease the property &mdash; apart from the main residence and surrounding land &mdash; to the agency or other persons on the register with ownership reverting to the agency on death.</P>
    <P>The land agency would be a key factor <Col N="972" /> in assisting optimum land use and planning agreements with farmers whereby support in land purchase, enlargement and capitalisation would be part of a development plan to ensure that the land was put to its best possible use.  This use would be geared to the supply of raw material for the food processing industry as well as drives for import substitution and export led commodity growth.  Land holdings and land use are the basic building blocks of a modern agricultural sector.  As long as the structure of farm holdings impedes the objectives of providing a greater income for a greater number of farmers, as long as production is unco-ordinated to the needs of the industry, we will fail to employ our agricultural resources to their fullest potential.  Ireland will become marginalised in the European food industry or monopolistic multi-national interests will exploit our resources on their own terms.</P>
    <P>I have demonstrated that a land policy and an agency to implement it are essential. The proposal to abolish the Land Commission without an alternative is a proposal to hand over our land policy and structure to the speculator and the grabber.  It is an abdication of responsibility by the Minister and the Government and will have the effect of excluding qualified young people from coming into agriculture.  It is a major reversal of the 1977, 1980 and 1987 Fianna Fáil policy on land use and the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The vital interests of small and family farms, the future development of agriculture and the economic development of the country as a whole are at stake. My party will be opposing the measure in this House if no alternative is forthcoming. The Minister's speech contained no alternative or hint of alternative.  He held out no hope or policy.  It was a cold death sentence on the Land Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and I wish to express my gratitude and admiration for the work carried out by the Land Commission. Many Deputies from the west would not agree with everything the Land <Col N="973" /> Commission did but it was reassuring to know that they were there looking after the smallholder and ensuring that he would not be at a disadvantage against bigger farmers when land came on the market.  It has been clear for some years, particularly since 1983, that the work of the Land Commission terminated around that time.  Since then there has been a lot of confusion and loss of morale in the Land Commission because of the uncertainty about their future.</P>
      <P>It may be a very blunt instrument to introduce legislation to abolish the Land Commission but the Minister's speech sets out very clearly what he intends to do.  He made a very important point that there are &mdash; and always were &mdash; certain limitations on the Land Commission. One of the major problems was congestion in certain areas &mdash; this certainly applied to the west &mdash; where there was very little land to acquire and to distribute to smallholders.  One of the offshoots was that there was migration from the west to counties like Meath, and this was one of the ways of resolving the very serious problem of congestion in the west.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission have been involved in acquiring and distributing land, they have built dwellinghouses, out-offices, have carried out drainage and reclamation work and erected fences. The Land Commission provided water supplies and even constructed roads.  In some parts of the country they played a social role by providing sports fields and even provided the odd cow plot for non-farmers. In fact, the Land Commission carried out work to meet the needs of local communities.  Acquisition of land was terminated in 1983 and since then morale among the staff of the Land Commission has been low.  A number of major problems arose in the west since that decision.  The first problem relates to the payment of annuities by farmers who acquired land from the Land Commission and the second concerns the division and distribution of land which the Land Commission have had for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An interdepartmental committee reported in 1978 on the Land Commission and that was followed by the <Col N="974" /> White Paper in 1980.  It is interesting to note that the interdepartmental committee came to the conclusion that the policy of acquiring and distributing land had outlived its usefulness.  The procedure for acquiring land, particularly in regard to smallholdings which often involved legal battles, proved long and tedious.  In many cases the acquisition of the land did not achieve what the commission set out to do.  I accept that many of the proposals contained in the White Paper issued in 1980 received some support at the time.  However, it was clearly stated in the White Paper that there were limitations to the traditional policies of the Land Commission.  It also pointed out that there were certain legal and financial constraints which would apply to any Government.</P>
    <P>The White Paper also referred to the difficulties associated with the resale of land at a price which would recover the full cost of the acquisition to the State. The Minister should consider that problem. He should also consider the problems experienced by farmers who have had to pay too much for land.  In many cases the land was bought at a time when it was fetching between £3,000 and £4,000 per acre which was a very high price.  I understand that the smaller annuities have been abolished and the Minister should consider giving assistance to farmers who are experiencing difficulties in repaying money borrowed to meet big annuities.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to proceed with the division of land as quickly as possible.  I do not think there is too much land on hands but many schemes have been completed by local offices and submitted for sanction to the head office in Dublin. It is disgraceful that many estates and holdings continue to be let by the Land Commission on the six months or 11-months system.  The Minister should consider introducing a scheme similar to that brought in by the Minister for the Environment for the sale of local authority houses to tenants.  Local authority tenants were given a very good deal under that scheme.  The Minister should consider accepting a reasonable payment <Col N="975" /> from smallholders for land leased from the Land Commission.  It is worth noting that most of the land let for many years is in bad condition and I accept that the payment must be by cash because that is the way the Land Commission are doing business.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with a number of the points raised by Deputy Stagg in regard to the White Paper issued in 1980. That publication suggested that there should be a priority list of smallholders. In my view that would be a cumbersome way to deal with the allocation of land because it would need frequent updating and that would take a lot of time.  Deputy Stagg mentioned the control of land purchase and in my view that would lead to constitutional problems.  I should like to point out to Deputy Stagg that there would be financial problems involved in producing a scheme to assist people to purchase land.  However, I agree with him that the Minister should consider the question of a surcharge on land purchase.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle referred to the Land Bill introduced by Deputy Connaughton in 1984.  While it was welcomed at the time I do not think its provisions have proved successful.  I would prefer the group purchase schemes which the Land Commission promoted in the west.  The commission gave excellent advice to groups who wanted to purchase land on the market.  I hope the Department will continue to help those who have the initiative to improve their holdings.</P>
    <P>Commonages are causing many problems, as is the division of bogs.  I should like to congratulate the new board, ERAD, on their work to eradicate disease. In their interests it is vital that commonages are divided as quickly as possible.  We are all aware of how costly the bovine TB eradication scheme has been and how important it is for the country that our herds are declared TB-free. We should make use of the assistance available from the EC for the division of commonages.  Grants are also available from the EC, through the farm modernisation and the farm installation schemes, to help young farmers inherit <Col N="976" /> farms from their parents.  I am glad many young farmers are availing of that assistance.</P>
    <P>Many speakers referred to the fact that milk quotas are tied up with land.  The Minister, and our MEPs, have been fighting hard at EC level on behalf of farmers who have small milk quotas. Those farmers are at a severe disadvantage because the bigger farmers have the cash to buy land.  A strong case can be made for the farmers with small milk quotas.  There are schemes for young farmers, for those who have disease in their herds and even a lottery for farmers whose output is less than 10,000 gallons of milk but we must do more for farmers, particularly those in south Galway, who are at a severe disadvantage in regard to milk quotas.  Many of them thought their quotas would be increased by the local co-ops.  With milk quotas tied to land, it is vital that these small farmers be assisted also.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have dealt with the section of the Land Commission concerned with vesting and revesting.  I would ask the Minister to look at the problems farmers have in trying to sort out titles to property when the Land Registry are involved as well as the vesting and revesting section of the Land Commission.  There are very few staff to deal with all the applications on hand.  As the Minister probably knows, there is a sizeable backlog of applications at present.  At a time when the Land Registry are getting extra staff it should be possible for additional staff to be appointed to the Department of Agriculture and Food, who are taking over the functions of the Land Commission, so that farmers will not have to wait lengthy periods to have these problems resolved. I have spoken to the Minister on several occasions about the plight of farmers who have large overdrafts because their problems in regard to titles have not been sorted out by the Land Commission and the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask the Minister to ensure that the controls which he says are still there will be used when the Department of Agriculture and Food take over ment of Agriculture and Food take over <Col N="977" /> the functions of the Land Commission. As decisions in Europe are biting, especially the decisions in regard to milk, I would ask him in particular to ensure that assistance is given to farmers who have smaller quotas.  I hope these small farmers will get the advice they need, that they will be able to continue to get the training and education in agriculture which they require, and that they will never be at a disadvantage compared to farmers who have cheque books and the cash to buy up the land which is on the market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute to all the good men who have worked in the Land Commission over the years.  I have had a certain amount of experience with them over the past 20 to 25 years.  They were an exceptional group who did an awful lot of good work. I should publicly like to pay tribute to them for the work they did on behalf of the small farmers.  I would not say that everybody employed by the Land Commission would come into that category, but I should like to pay tribute to those who did good work.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his speech said that the Land Commission had often been criticised in the past for the speed with which they brought individual redistributions to a conclusion.  If ever I found fault with the Land Commission it was that when they acquired land there was a delay in dividing it.  If one looks back at the record of the House, particularly the debates on the Estimates for Lands, and the questions put down by Deputies at Question Time, one will see that Deputies spoke largely about the exceptionally slow rate at which the Land Commission divided land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of omissions in the Minister's speech but one of the issues I think should have been mentioned is the amount of land the Land Commission have at present and the form in which they hold it.  It would be fair to say that the morale of the staff in the field officers division and other divisions of the Land Commission was decimated over the last few years because they did not have faith <Col N="978" /> in successive Governments and the way they acted.</P>
    <P>This is an historic day in the sense that the Land Commission are being abolished but nothing is being put in their place.  It is very necessary that some body be established in their place.  I do not want an individual to take over their responsibilities, and I do not want the Minister to have anything to do with it at all because I do not think he would be competent to take over the functions of the Land Commission.  There was more than enough political interference in the past, and we certainly do not want any added political interference in the future.</P>
    <P>I thought Michael Davitt would have been entitled to a mention by the Minister in his speech.  Many men played a big part in agrarian reform in this country and now that the Land Commission are being wound up, tribute should be paid to them for the good work they did on behalf of many small farmers who had very few people to represent them.  I should like to know what the future of the small land holders will be, or if they have any future now that the Land Commission are being abolished.  In the past the Land Commission played an exceptionally active role in the acquisition of estates.  Some estates may only have consisted of ten acres, and rather than let an individual who did not need it or a person who was not involved in agriculture buy it, the Land Commission acquired it under section 40 of the Land Act, and if a small farmer came up with as good a price as the top bidder he was entitled to buy it.  I see definite problems being created for many smallholders who want to purchase small parcels of land when they come on the market.  I know that there is a right of free sale and if a person is selling land he will sell it to the highest bidder.  However, if we want to maintain a vital society in rural areas, there must be some type of land authority to protect the rights of the small farmers, that is, if you think they have rights.  If a body is not appointed and given muscle, the rights those individuals should have will be almost automatically surrendered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="979" /> It would appear that the main opposition party support this Bill and because they do, the Bill will almost certainly go through.  The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Kirk, who is present this evening is a practical individual but the problems experienced by the people in County Louth are very few in comparision with the problems being experienced by people in my constituency.  It is necessary that some type of land authority be established.  I heard Deputy Doyle quote for the benefit of the Minister an election manifesto of the Government party prior to the last general election that referred to the establishment of a land authority with many functions.  It sounded well and appeared to refer to many functions of such an authority with which I could readily identify.  The question must be posed: are they forgetting all of these proposals now?  It is essential that some type of body be established, be that a land authority or whatever.  It must be remembered that we cannot revert to the Land Commission.  Indeed, it might well be said that the action of successive Governments demoralised those who worked hardest for that State body.</P>
    <P>Any such exercise on the part of a land authority must be seen to be fair to smallholders who will be unable to compete for land on the open market; they are unable to do so at present. Deputy Stagg mentioned an excessive price of £6,000 paid for an acre of land somewhere in the south.  We all know that such a price is exceptional; probably there was a milk quota attached to it or something of that nature.  That does not constitute an average price for agricultural land, but if one is engaged in anything other than milk production, say horticulture or whatever, then land is not worth anything like the price mentioned by Deputy Stagg.  Indeed a figure of £1,000 per acre probably would be more appropriate, and holdings are tending to become larger.</P>
    <P>Many farmers' sons have emigrated as they see no future in farming.  Indeed there will be fewer prospects for the future <Col N="980" /> for such people unless some type of land authority is established affording them some hope of acquiring land they would otherwise be unable to purchase on the open market.  That would be my plea to the Minister of State present.  While appreciating that I may well be wasting my time I must still make such requests. There were, and probably still are, many people employed by the Land Commission who played and continue to play a noble role, doing much good for many people.  I should like to pay a tribute to them.</P>

      <P>I refer to the historical set of facts with which we are confronted in considering the provisions of this Bill and the major fact is that for many years the Land Commission, <i>de facto</i>, had been run down.  Over the past four to five years there were occasions when many of their employees had no work to do in relation to many of the functions assigned them.</P>
      <P>It was a decision of the previous Government to cease land acquisition and abolish the Land Commission. Apparently it was also a decision of the previous Government to cease allocating land on the traditional basis on which the Land Commission had hitherto allocated such land, that is in accordance with local need.  There have been many expressions of concern in my constituency and others that the remaining lands in the hands of the Land Commission would be sold off to the highest bidder.  I am glad to note that that has not been the case.  Equally I am glad to note that the Land Commission staff are proceeding with all due haste to devise schemes whereby local people, most in need, will be allocated the remaining tracts of land out of estates at present held by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the increase in land prices in the seventies the Land Commission had reached a point at which they would have to examine their role or have it examined for them.  Ultimately their role was defined by reason of the fact that they experienced grave difficulty in persuading farmers to take land at the high annuities occasioned, in turn, by the high acquisition costs incurred by the Land <Col N="981" /> Commission in the seventies.  Indeed in many constituencies in which there were large divisions of land in the seventies people have lived with those unduly high annuities on land throughout the eighties, particularly in the years 1985 and 1986 when agricultural incomes declined on account of bad prices, high costs and inclement weather.  This has meant that there are farmers in my constituency and elsewhere faced with extreme difficulty in paying such annuities.  It will be readily appreciated that the system operated throughout the seventies quickly became redundant in the eighties.  Even if efforts were made to resuscitate the Land Commission they would experience grave difficulty in reverting to the type of operation that had obtained in the earlier years of the State when they seemed to have a radical, important influence in shaping rural life and its developments.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I carried out research in relation to the effect of Land Commission acquisition of untenanted land and its redistribution to smallholders in County Westmeath, that is either those living there or those who had come to the county, predominantly from the west, to acquire holdings in exchange for those they had held in the west.  Since the foundation of the State my research showed that Land Commission activities in County Westmeath created an estimated 3,000 reasonably viable farm holdings initially.  Of course, as the years progressed, the size of such holdings rendered them non-viable and any further allocations of land did not serve to render them any more viable.  However, in terms of the ability of that land to support people, my studies showed that approximately 5,000 people over the last 60 years would have been more or less sustained by the re-distribution activities of the Land Commission.  They were placed in a position in which they could remain on the land in reasonable comfort, sometimes supplementing their incomes through off-farm activities, but always participating in rural society and its development.  I pay particular tribute to the staff of the Land Commission who worked in my county throughout those <Col N="982" /> years and who continue to work diligently in devising good schemes.</P>
    <P>In recent years the provisions of the various schemes have been improved in that the amount of land being distributed to farmers and the types of holdings being established were much more viable, their attendant infrastructure having been planned in a better, modern manner.  One of the sad aspects of early Land Commission activity was the small size of the housing on such lands, much of which quickly became derelict and unoccupied, not even comparable with housing standards of 30 or 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>Many people came from the west to County Westmeath.  These people were settled on Land Commission holdings in County Westmeath in return for relinquishing their holdings in the west.  Over the years they played their full part in community life in the midlands.  I know that I speak for other counties in the midlands, apart from County Westmeath. These people provided a vital input into agriculture, sport, education and the overall cultural development of the area.  Looking back, we can now say that the policy of shifting whole communities eastwards to the midlands was a very radical step to take.  It is great to be able to say that these settlements were a success and that the people, without saying goodbye to the west, found in the midlands a hospitable climate to put down roots and the means by which they could contribute to the welfare of society as a whole.  Of course, there were many local smallholders in County Westmeath who from time to time got additions to consolidate their holdings.  It is fair to say that the Land Commission activities in County Westmeath avoided the worst consequences of emigration in the fifties, and practically put a stop to it in the sixties and into the seventies.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission also played a very important role in County Westmeath in providing an extensive area for cowparks or cow allotments for persons who would not have land, those in labouring jobs or engaged in off-farm work but who for reasons of small income, an interest in farming or an attachment to <Col N="983" /> the land wished to have a cow or a few stock.  They then had the opportunity through the trusteeship of the local authority to have these few stock grazing on the cowparks.  The influence of these cowparks has been remarkable, because many young people started their farming activities or started off building up their herds through taking short term lettings on a headage basis.  Over the years there have been various efforts to dispose of these cowparks in County Westmeath. Some people think they are anachronistic. However, I am glad to put on record that I have always opposed that attitude.  At a time when one talks a great deal about using the services of FAS, Teagasc, the IDA and other bodies to foster enterprise and the enterpreneurial spirit, it is nice to think that we have in place in my own county 600 or 700 acres where young people, smallholders, or unemployed people, can get a foot into stockmanship and enterprise at no cost to the taxpayer because the scheme is self-financing.  The rent pays for whatever expense is involved, and more besides.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have referred to the importance of the Land Commission in providing facilities for recreation and access to public amenities.  Perhaps Westmeath more than any other county best exemplifies the activity of the Land Commission in providing access to the various lakes in the county.  In my lifetime I recollect there was very little or no access to Lough Derravaragh, Lough Ennell and Lough Owel before the Land Commission made very generous allotments to the local authority for the provision of roads and amenity access to the lakes.  At a time when these facilities are being developed in the context of agri-tourism and rural integrated development, it is very heartening to realise that back in the fifties, sixties and seventies there were far-seeing people in the community, local authority and Land Commission who saw the need for the provision of these facilities.  This was brought to mind very forcibly when I sat on a special committee for Lough Ree.  I found that in the three counties traversed <Col N="984" /> by Lough Ree, Counties Westmeath, Longford and Roscommon, there was not enough public access to that great amenity. In this case, the Land Commission and the local authority had been remiss in not providing sufficient access thereby reducing the capacity of the tourist and the general public to enjoy that amenity.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers did not mention that the Land Commission made a vital impact in the area of bogs and turbary provision and management.  The harvesting of bogland and turf is a very complicated business.  The law relating to turbary rights has been complicated to a bewildering degree.  The Land Commission very often came in on top of a very confusing situation and provided a system whereby the turbary rights to the bog could be shared on a rational basis between the hundreds of tenants.  This activity became redundant in the fifties, sixties and seventies when handcutting and winning of turf fell into disuse and hence the role of the Land Commission ceased in that area.</P>
    <P>However, with the onset of new technology for turf harvesting the problem of regulating tenants' bog remains fairly significant.  I know this Bill will not interfere with the legal powers the Land Commission had in regulating areas of bog, resolving disputes between tenants and appointing trustees if necessary.  I would like to think that the Land Commission's powers would be retained in possible reparcelling of bogland when the existing bogs become cut away and the tenants become frustrated by the lack of available bog.  I concede this is a marginal area of interest and only involves the counties which have tenanted bogs.  However, this area creates legal disputes and deserves some study by the Department of Agriculture and Food now that they have inherited the mantle of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The argument of speakers who long for a continuation of the 100 year old Land Commission in its present structure, which has remained static since the thirties, is unfounded.  We have to look to European thinking on rural <Col N="985" /> integrated development.  The Department of Agriculture and Food would do well, as I know they are, to study the provisions of the European White Paper on Rural Development, entitled &ldquo;The Future of Rural Society&rdquo; in which the reparcelling of land was highlighted as an activity which might be supported by EC funds.  Incentives to facilitate land consolidation and opening the way to young farmers would also be supported by the EC under the Structural Funds and the special funds available for rural integrated development.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann directs the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to present immediately amendments to Standing Orders governing Estimates debates to provide that:</P>
      <P>(a)  amendments can be proposed to subheads in individual Estimates to reduce the amount provided;</P>
      <P>(b)  amendments can be proposed to the subheads in individual Estimates to increase the amount provided if the amendments contain within them a proposal to reduce another subhead or subheads in the Estimate, or in the same group of Estimates, by the same amount thereby ensuring that the overall provisions of the Estimate for the year in question and subsequent years are not increased overall;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  amendments to increase provisions for particular subheads, as set <Col N="986" /> out at subparagraph (b) above shall not have effect if, within two weeks of their being passed by the Dáil the Minister for Finance certifies, for reasons stated, to a Committee of Public Expenditure that the proposal designed to achieve savings to compensate for the proposed increase will not in fact achieve the savings claimed;</P>
    <P>(d)  where the Minister for Finance makes a certification within the term of subparagraph (c) above he shall, if requested, give oral evidence in public before a Committee of Public Expenditure to explain the reasons for his certification.</P>
    <P>This proposal is the next step in Fine Gael's reform of Irish politics &mdash; the new politics&mdash;and it is at the very heart of the policy which I set out to the Tallaght Chamber of Commerce in September 1987.  The 166 Members of this House are elected to legislate for and to serve the interests of the Irish people.  I want to improve the ability of this House to do just that.  Our top priority must be to expand employment, to make more jobs. If we can succeed in increasing the number of viable self-sustaining jobs, we will be striking at the very root of the ills that plague our society, poverty, alienation and division.  I said at Tallaght on that occasion in September 1987, and I quote:</P>
    <P>What I am saying is, quite simply, that when we strip away all the rhetoric and get down to what really matters in the day-to-day lives of ordinary people, the resolution of our public finance problem is the essential key to everything that we want to do in the economic and social fields, to everything that we want to do to provide for our people the conditions in which they can live their lives in the way that we believe is right.</P>
    <P>This evening I invite the Government to accept this motion as another weapon to be used in our fight against unemployment, against poverty, against emigration and against deprivation. In doing that, I invite the Government to accept <Col N="987" /> the reality of the fact that it is a minority in this House.  I invite the Government to accept the legitimacy of debate in this House.  I invite the Government to accept also that the history of the last two years shows beyond any shadow of a doubt that the Fine Gael Party know what it is to give proper priority to the needs of the people and to put the country first.  I invite the Government to wake up to the fact that my 50 Deputies accept the need to make difficult but enlightened choices with the long term interests of the Irish people at heart.</P>
    <P>Over that period, my party have played a central role in ensuring that overall budget policy is kept on the right lines. We have succeeded in that.  For those two years, we have pushed the Government along the right path.  It is a Government that was not elected on this sort of platform and many of its Deputies have not got the stomach for it.  Fine Gael on the other hand, have proven, both in Government and in Opposition, that they have the courage and the will to take the hard decisions that are necessary to put the nation's finances in order.  The record of this House shows that Fine Gael have never once in the last two years proposed a departure from the overall budgetary targets which must be met.  We have moved this House decisively away from the unreal politics of the past which were for so long so damaging to this country and our people.</P>
    <P>Our proposal tonight is very simple. It is that without changing the overall amount of money being spent by a given Government Department, the Dáil should have the ability to move resources from one area of that Department's spending to another.  We have put in a provision which allows the Minister for Finance to subject any such proposals by the Dáil to close and careful scrutiny and to determine whether or not it will have the effect that is sought.  Some will see that as an infringement of the Government's executive authority.  I believe, Sir, that that is an excessively rigid and bureaucratic view.  I am bound to say, a Cheann Comhairle, that in spite <Col N="988" /> of their reputation to the contrary, the evidence of the last two years shows very clearly that this Government allow themselves far too easily to be seduced by these excessively rigid and bureaucratic views.  Such a move of the kind we are proposing would, in my view, be no more than a recognition by the Government that elected legislators have a valid role in making adjustments at the margin in the pattern of public expenditure.  Just as important, our proposal would put a clear onus on opposition parties to come forward with coherent proposals and to have regard to priorities in the areas of expenditure. As things stand at present, Deputies, whether on this or the other side of the House, who are not members of the Cabinet must either accept or reject the overall levels of expenditure and revenue and the budgetary targets proposed by the Government.  That is fair enough.  We need to decide on the size of the playing pitch, but having done that, we are then faced with the question of whether we accept or reject each Estimate in total. That borders on the absurd.</P>
    <P>In the Social Welfare Estimate for 1989, for example, there are 19 mainheadings. The largest one accounts for about 30 per cent of the total, the next two account for 19 per cent and 18 per cent respectively of the total and the remaining 17 account for one-third of the Estimate. If we think about those figures for a moment it is easy to see that a relatively small change in the largest item in the total could bring about a fairly substantial change if moved around into any one of the other 17 and especially into one of the smaller ones.</P>
    <P>I have a fair amount of experience of the business of putting together Government expenditure plans and it is clear to me that there is never one single simple obvious pattern of expenditure that has to be decided upon; yet that is what we ask the House to do in the procedure we now use for the Estimates.  Every one of us in this House has had the experience of seeing Bills being improved as they go through Committee and Report Stage, even Finance Bills are improved in that way.  My question quite simply is, should <Col N="989" /> we not have the confidence to take the same view of Estimates?  Every Minister should know that the 15 members of the Government and the Civil Service do not have a monopoly of wisdom.  Our proposal tonight is to give each Member of this House a means of participating in framing expenditure plans without disrupting the Government's overall financial targets.</P>
    <P>This House can work.  During the last two years my colleagues and I in Fine Gael have succeeded in making debate in this House a real debate.  That is confirmed, for example, by the passage of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act.  It was confirmed again by the passage of an Adoption Act which this Government did not have the wit to accept when it was first put forward as a Fine Gael Private Members' Bill.  What happened?  They finally saw the light and came forward with their own Bill almost identical to the one they originally rejected as a Private Members' Bill.  It has been proved again and again as Bill after Bill went through this House with Fine Gael Committee Stage amendments, and was perhaps proved more spectacularly by the passage through this House of legislation on extradition which would not have been contempleted, even in their wildest imaginings, by Fianna Fáil Deputies as recently as 1986.  There have been other occassions, some of them less remarked on in the media, when the Dáil has influenced the Government even though the Government affected to ignore the wishes of the House.  I need only mention the National Social Services Board, the Office of the Ombudsman, the pupil/teacher ratios in our primary schools and this House prevented the Government from stepping back from cross Border security co-operation at the beginning of last year.</P>
    <P>Let us pause for a moment to look at what some of these things indicated.  On some of those occassions the Government said that although the Dáil had taken a different view from them they did not have to do anything about it.  In each of those cases &mdash; the National Social Services Board, the Office of the Ombudsman <Col N="990" /> and the pupil/teacher ratios &mdash; they found themselves at the end of the day, by the weight of political opinion, compelled to do something about it.  A Government which was reluctant or blind or just too arrogant to see what was happening in the House was finally brought, by the pressure of political opinion, to do much of what this House actually recommended it to do.  We have not succeeded in those areas without hard and imaginative political work in the House.  We have not succeeded as far as we would have wished, but we have certainly avoided the kinds of excesses which would be committed by an unimaginative Government blinded by the light of recent revelations and unable to see past the end of their noses.  We have shown that this House can work if there is enough imagination and openness of mind on the part of the Government.  God knows, the people need this House to work properly.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal more to be done. There is an urgent need for a major tax reform even if total tax revenue is to remain at its present level for some time to come.  There is a crying need for reform in social welfare so that it, together with the tax system, no longer constitutes an obstacle to employment rather than a necessary and effective cushion for those who have not yet found employment or those who are between jobs in an expanding economy.  Major structural changes are needed in our economy if we are to explore fully the opportunities that will be opened to us by the full unification of the European Community market and if we are to deal successfully with the new challenges that that will present to our farmers, to food industries, to manufacturing industries and to the services sector.</P>
    <P>I invite the Government to accept this motion.  In accepting it the Government would for once participate constructively in a step which would improve the operation of this House and bring politics that much nearer to being a real service to the people.  My expectations of this Government are low.  They are more likely to indulge in the kind of arrogant play acting that has been their hallmark for the last <Col N="991" /> two years.  They avoid debate in this House and outside it.  They would rather be free to carry on with the kind of abuse we have seen in relation to the national lottery funds.  They would prefer not to examine issues.  They are much more inclined to the dull uncaring conduct that mis-spends money on administering a health service that serves fewer and fewer people with less and less effect.  They prefer not to analyse legislation.  They would rather go for the kind of stroke involved in the attempt, fortunately futile, to rejig the constituencies.  They will not examine people's real needs. They much prefer the kind of cosmetic deception we have seen on the Army pay issue.  They do not want to take real action.  They prefer to go for the kind of optics involved in the petrol price fiasco that is now about to blow up in the face of the Minister for Energy.</P>

      <P>The Government could rise above all that and take the step we have set out here and confirm that they have some concept of the legitimacy of political debate.  The Government could indicate after that that they really want to see politics serving people and they could indicate finally that the message is beginning to get through, that the Government are beginning to realise at last that optics are just for the optics, that they do not make any real difference. In fact, the Government might begin to realise at last that the kinds of policies they opposed tooth and nail for four years, that they have now been pushed into pursuing for two years, are right, are required and are not enough in themselves. They need the rest added.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They need a Minister for Finance, like the Minister before us, who has had &mdash; and God knows how much longer he will have &mdash; something almost unique in the history of the country, a Dáil where the majority of the Deputies understand support and are prepared to go along with the real fundamental changes required in <Col N="992" /> order to serve our people, to get the burden of debt off their backs, a Dáil that is prepared to go much farther than that, that has shown ability on this side of the House, among my 50 Deputies, to make up its mind, to set priorities and to be sensitive to the needs of the country.  I am very much afraid that this Government will lose that opportunity.</P>
    <P>I would be quite prepared and more than happy to be surprised if the Government did the creative thing and decided that this was one step that they should take, that would be in the interests of all our people, but my expectations of this Government are rather low.  I do not expect them to see the need for this kind of step.  The rest of the House will, I hope.  This House is here to serve the people.  We will not be deflected from that, and we will continue to bring forward these proposals.  I predict that one of these days, as they have done on other occasions, this Government will finally wake up and find out what real politics are about.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The procedure for passing Estimates here is unusual in Europe, if not unique, apart from the United Kingdom.  The Government decide the appropriate amount to be spent overall and the appropriate amount to be spent in each Department, and the Dáil is presented with a simple choice of take it or leave it.  If the Dáil reject the Estimate the Government are constitutionally bound, because it is a Finance motion to seek the dissolution of the Dáil and have an election.  That does not allow the kind of flexibility that modern parliaments need and which parliamentarians all over Europe have found to be desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The worst two Governments that ever ruled here were those led by Deputy Lynch which came to office in 1977, by the present Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey when he took office in 1979.  They had one thing in common.  They both had <Col N="993" /> vast majorities, over 90 seats in a smaller parliament.  Since 1981 no one party has had a majority in this House.  The Coalition Government was a majority Government, but it consisted of two parties. Deputy Haughey has tried four times to get a majority and has failed four times. In these circumstances, stability in parliament should rely more on the good sense of parliamentarians rather than on the goodwill of the main Opposition party.  The good sense of parliamentarians needs a vehicle to provide the financial stability which this country needs and which the three parties which share a certain perspective of our difficulties at the moment and over the last few years would require.</P>
    <P>Against that background, this most relevant motion, especially taken in the context of the various conversations in this House and in the public media over the last few days, is a motion which would allow stability in a minority Government. It would remove the constant threat of being defeated on financial motions, with the absolutely inevitable constitutional consequence of a general election.  It would allow parliamentarians a real role in deciding how public money should be spent in circumstances where it is scarce and will continue to be scarce.</P>
    <P>The motion does not advocate a procedure under which this Dáil could increase the totality of public expenditure; it would allow this Dáil to reduce the total amount of public expenditure and that is a good provision.  It would also allow this Dáil to switch money within certain subheads of a departmental Vote.</P>
    <P>Real debate in this House, because of the very strict procedure governing Estimates and financial affairs in the normal day-to-day running of the House, has moved from the main business of the House into Private Members' Time from 7 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. and the real issues that concern the people have been debated over the past ten years, effectively, in what is a side show.  We must ask why the affairs of last week were debated in Private Members' Time, why the crucial Education debate took place in that time, why the question of the <Col N="994" /> Ombudsman's Office took place in Private Members' Time and so on.  The reason is that you move to Private Members' Time because the consequences of a Government defeat in Private Members' Time are not the same as those of a defeat on the floor of the House during normal business time on a financial motion.</P>
    <P>We are seeking to plan for future parliaments which I believe will be Government by a minority.  We are trying to establish a procedural stability where not only have the Government the right to conduct their business as they should and plan the finances of the country, which still remains the crucial issue, but where the Parliament can share in that task and like-minded parliamentarians, no matter what side of the House they find themselves on, are given the flexibility which arises from their maturity to deal with the financial affairs of the nation in a satisfactory fashion.</P>
    <P>At the end of the 20th century modern well-educated parliamentarians cannot be treated like school children, where a Minister asks them to put up their hands and they put them up and say tá or níl and home they go.  We need a say.  Implicit in what we are talking about is a change, not a major one, but a change in the centre of power.  This involves a reduction, to some extent, of the power of the Executive and an increase in the power of the Parliament.  What we are proposing is common practice right across Europe.  There are European countries where budgets are actually negotiated.  We have the division of powers in the United States of America where the President presents a budget to Congress and it is effectively negotiated. We are not going down that dramatic road, but we are saying that people in this House should have the right to decide where the real needs of our people lie and should be in a position to move money accordingly.</P>
    <P>Our motion also says that the Minister for Finance needs safeguards.  There is no point in our coming into a future Dáil, or the Minister's party in Opposition coming into a future Dáil, and moving <Col N="995" /> money about if the figures do not add up.  We say that a certification process is necessary to protect the revenue and the Minister and to make sure that what is being proposed is correctly put together. We all know also that it is possible to take decisions here that involve no increase in expenditure in a current year but can involve huge increases in subsequent years.  We have also allowed for this.  The Minister, by a process of certification, can ensure that the revenue is protected and that Parliament, in expressing its will, does no more than express its will and changes money from one subhead to another.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate in our circumstances that the Government, having all the information from the various institutions of State, the various Departments and the Central Bank, should still be in a position to decide the overall level of expenditure.  I cannot for the life of me see why, if this Dáil decides that another £5.5 million should be spent on remedial education, it cannot decide to move that amount from another Education subhead and put it into remedial education.  I cannot see why, in the course of a Health Estimate, this House could not decide, if it was the wish and will of the majority here, the subject of those about whom we talked in Private Members' Time, last week, the haemophiliacs afflicted by the AIDS virus, would be an appropriate issue on an Estimates debate, where the possibility of an appropriate amount of money being switched from one subhead to another without any increase in overall Government expenditure could be decided in this House.  Then we might have a mature Parliament, a Parliament that would be responsive to the needs of our people.  Then we might have a Parliament where parliamentarians would have a role other than the prospect of being in an Administration.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons that Parliament is becoming irrelevant is that the actions of parliamentarians are increasingly more futile.  If the Executive proposes and disposes and all a Parliament has is the right of veto, that is not healthy for democracy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> All of what I have said would not be so pressing if we thought we were in for a period of majority Government.  I am proposing a way out, a stabilising of Government in a minority situation.  I would go further and say that if we were to couple this proposal with fixed term parliaments then we might get the continuity of policies which would give us the appropriate kind of growth rates and levels of employment and the wherewithal to plan a future for all the people of this country.  While we have a situation where politics has the inflexibility which it has now and where elections become an attempt on crucial occasions by one group to out-bid the other, then not only will we continue to have the present problems but we will actually exacerbate them.</P>
    <P>I have heard conversations in this House today to the effect that if the Taoiseach calls an election there will be a majority.  If you are a commentator, or are not involved in politics, when the word &ldquo;election&rdquo; is mentioned you see this national struggle where the forces are pitted against each other.  All of us in this House know that an election is different from that.  Even though that is some of the reality, it is also 41 different battles in the constituencies.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There are a number of issues which will bring about the situation &mdash; if the Minister likes to test the waters &mdash; which I am saying will occur and we will be left again in a position where either we at this side of the House and those who share our views or the Minister's party at his side of the House will be attempting to run this country as a minority Administration.  The spirit of that amendment would be very useful when we are planning for that future which might be insecure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though we have agreed that many of the options, the visions, the dreams, the plans we have for the future are preempted by the burden of the debt and by the fact that such a large amount of our <Col N="997" /> resources has to be dedicated to the servicing of that debt, almost a quarter of a million of our people are still unemployed and 100,000 people emigrated in the last three years.  The labour force is expanding by 25,000 a year.  Anything the Minister and his colleagues have put before us, including the most recent plan, is not sufficient even to absorb the increase in the labour force, much less put any dent in the 240,000 people on the live register. The former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, said if unemployment went over 100,000 the Government in office did not deserve to be re-elected.  What will we say about a Government who are presiding over a quarter of a million unemployed when every boat and plane are taking the finest of our young people out of the country?</P>
    <P>Even those statistics hide another tragedy.  Any of us who represent urban constituencies know that when you examine unemployment on the ground in the private housing areas the percentage might be small, but in the large corporation areas you have 75 per cent male unemployment.  A number of people around here who are thinking of knocking on doors in the near future will find men in their twenties and thirties, unshaven, coming down to open the door at 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock in the day with a hopeless look in their eyes, trapped in poverty and hopelessness.  I am not painting a picture to depress the Minister or ourselves, I am simply saying if the whistle blows and battle is engaged, when it comes down to the constituencies there is enough power hanging around to make life very uneasy for any Government who think they are on a run.  They are not on a run.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We have proposed a series of initiatives which the Minister has not taken up and which will help with the unemployment problem. <Col N="998" /> We are not saying it can be solved overnight but it can be improved.  We have talked about cost factors in the economy and about tax reform.  We have put various proposals to the Minister.  In the course of the debate on the national plan we said it should be programme-based rather than project-based.  We said it should be integrated if it is to be anything and a series of good projects, no matter how attractive, will not give us the kind of impetus to growth we need if our people are to go back to work.  That has all been ignored.</P>
      <P>Emigration will be an issue on the doorsteps when we go around which will make it very difficult for any party or combination of parties here to be a majority Government.  At times we look at the emigrants through rose-coloured glasses when we think of all those bright young people coming out with college degrees and leaving certificates.  It should be admitted that a large number of our highly qualified young people can be very strong on information and very low in skills, and in modern industrial economies they are not necessarily doing very well.  This is illustrated particularly by the plight of emigrants in London.  Many of our colleagues on both sides of the House have seen it.  It is a shocking scandal that several hundred young Irish people should be living in cardboard boxes in various parts of London while the Government seem to advocate emigration as a national policy.  Anyone looking for a large majority will find that meeting them on many doorsteps. Whereas the traditional emigration of the forties and fifties seemed to affect the poor and the small farmers more than anybody else, emigration is now a middle class issue as well as we will hear it on the doorsteps from parents who might be most impressed by the economic programme, moderate as it is, which has been achieved by our support for the Government following our policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over a million people are in poverty now and I do not think they are going to be enthusiastic about any of us.  We have almost accepted on all sides of the House that the poor must wait.  I do not think the <Col N="999" /> poor must wait.  The connection between poverty and unemployment should be stated.  At least we could attack the poverty traps.  Poverty traps will be an issue if this is to be tested.  I could go on.</P>
    <P>I can talk about the health service, appallingly administered and badly run from the Minister down.  There is probably plenty of money there to run an efficient health service.  The sums of money are huge and on top of that we have more funding from the VHI apart from affairs in the Estimates at all, yet not a Deputy in this House does not know of a series of incidents of tragedy arising in the health service for one reason or another.  Think of the fear, especially among the old, that having been admitted to hospital for serious surgery, they will be turfed out within 48 hours and have to go home with no care.  That is going to be a major issue.  Any Taoiseach who is feeling bullish at the moment should meet some of the people who visit my clinics.</P>

We have larger classes and 1,200 highly qualified young <Col N="1000" /> primary teachers are going from substitute job to substitute job and hoping eventually they might get a job in London.  I think the expectation this year is that there will be 25 fulltime jobs in Irish primary schools.

Where an élite cannot come up with a serious argument they talk down to the laity from the extent of their knowledge and say something is unconstitutional.  Of course it is not unconstitutional and it is quite easy to develop a procedure where both the rights and responsibilities of a Minister for Finance and his Government can be protected and where this Parliament can get more power in the interests of all the people.

Neither they nor I will decide whether there is to be a majority Government in this House.  The people will decide.  If we take one line from the Tallaght strategy and strip away the rhetoric it is clear that the spirit of what they are saying is one thing but the practicalities are totally different.  Two men who held senior positions in Government are trying to con the people into believing that the answer to all our problems lies in this motion, but they know that the practicalities are totally different.

Not only did they have a majority in this House but a majority in Government. What did they do about it? Nothing.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The supporters of this motion have attempted to present this as a technical change designed to improve public expenditure control.  In reality there would be a fundamental change in the procedures under which the Government's responsibilities for public finances are discharged in this House.  There is nothing new in this motion.  It is a rehash of proposals put forward in 1987, a repeat of the Tallaght strategy.  I have read it all before.  The Dáil rejected similar proposals tabled by Deputy Noonan in October 1987 and the Government recommend that it should do so again on this occasion.</P>
      <P>Let me remind the House of what was said by the Minister for Finance on the subject during the October 1987 debate. He pointed out that the proposals would entail &ldquo;a major change in the respective responsibilities of the Government and of this House in settling the Estimates&rdquo;. He continued:</P>
      <P>It is the function of the Government, under our constitutional system, to make proposals on these matters. Under Deputy Noonan's proposal, individual Deputies would have the right to put forward amendments to reduce the amounts provided in the subheads of individual Estimates, and to increase them, by the same amounts, in other subheads of the same Estimates.  The Book of Estimates laid by the Government before the House would, in other words, become little more than a draft set of proposals, subject to unpredictable and possibly major change.</P>
      <P>These remarks remain as valid now as they were then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1005" /> This motion, if passed, would undermine the Government's constitutional responsibilities for the public finances.  It is important that this should be clearly understood from the outset.  I am surprised that Deputy Dukes who has had so much experience in Government should engage in sterile debate.  He knows exactly what the position is in relation to Estimates under the Constitution and the procedures of this House, yet he brings forward this motion.</P>
    <P>The essential feature of our constitutional system in this regard is that the right of initiative in relation to public finance is vested in the Government alone.  Article 17.2 of the Constitution stipulates:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann shall not pass any vote or resolution, and no law shall be enacted, for the appropriation of revenue or other public moneys unless the purpose of the appropriation shall have been recommended to Dáil Éireann by a message from the Government signed by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>It is clearly stated and unequivocal.  Why do the main Opposition party come in with this motion when they know it flies in the face of the Constitution?  If they wanted to redress that position they would have to talk about a referendum to change the Constitution.  If they engaged in such a debate I would have some respect for them but I cannot have any respect for this.</P>
    <P>This constitutional position is reflected in Dáil Standing Orders.  Standing Order 123 states that Bills involving the appropriation of revenue or other public moneys may only be initiated by a member of the Government.  Standing Order 124 lays down that every grant of money proposed for the public service &mdash; in other words the Estimates &mdash; is to be considered by the Dáil on a motion which may only be made by a member of Government.  Standing Orders also stipulate that the motion on the Estimates shall be decided without amendment; yet here is a motion asking that all of them be open to amendment.  The constitutional position and the procedural <Col N="1006" /> arrangements for the conduct of Dáil business are therefore in agreement.  It is the Government's prerogative to propose expenditure through the Estimates and the Dáil's responsibility to either adopt or reject these proposals.</P>
    <P>Advocates of the motion suggest that its adoption will lead to more effective control of public expenditure and point to procedures in place in budgetary systems in other countries which allow for negotiation between the Executive and the Legislature on expenditure proposals. I have studied these systems and have drawn the conclusion that where effective budgetary control has been achieved it is despite and not because of these systems.  The proposition that horse trading between Government and Parliament in order to secure the passage of expenditure proposals could improve public expenditure control is not credible.</P>

    <P>The real issue in public expenditure management is not the sophistication of the system of parliamentary controls but rather the determination of the Government of the day to take the necessary decisions to curtail spending.  One need not look beyond the history of the past few years to realise the truth of this.  This motion is coming from a party that had a majority in Government and a majority in the House, that let public expenditure run wild, that doubled the national debt. <Col N="1007" /> If I did not have to contend with and service that, I would have introduced a budget last January of £1 billion surplus.

      <P>It is the responsibility of the Government to determine their plans and priorities for public spending and to seek the approval of the Dáil for those plans.  If these plans do not command the support of the Dáil, then clearly it ceases to be possible for the Government to manage their affairs with all the consequences that flow from that.  It is patently unworkable to suggest that the Government could be obliged by a vote of the Dáil to implement and to be ultimately accountable for spending programmes which do not form part of their own priorities.  To do so would be to blur accountability leading to less effective Government.  Above all, it would signal a weakening in the ability of Governments to manage the public finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Deputy Noonan's motion the Book of Estimates would cease to be the authoritative statement of Government spending plans which it is at present.  It would reduce instead to the status of a discussion document.  Individual Deputies would be free to put forward changes and amendments to the Government's published Estimates.  Subhead allocations could be increased in one area <Col N="1008" /> and reduced in another not only within individual Votes but also between Votes in an overall Vote group.  This is simply a recipe for confusion, disruption and delay and it would totally undermine the present effective procedural framework.</P>

      <P>The Deputy must be joking.  Did he?  Fine Gael talked about them for four and a half years but they did not bring in any of them.  The pressures which interest groups in our society already bring to bear on parliamentary representatives is severe.  Members of this House can, I am sure, well imagine how much more severe that pressure would be if Government spending plans were to be presented in the form of a discussion draft.  Not alone would the advocates of increased spending become more vocal, so also would the supporters of expenditure programmes included in the Government's Estimates but identified for reduction by vote of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I doubt if Deputy Noonan would disagree with me when I say that there was far too much pressure exercised by small groups in society who were able to twist the arms and bend the ears of Members of this House.  We are getting out of our problems but we have a long way to go. I do not think anybody in this House would advocate going back to leaving the door open to pressure groups to decide what the Government of the day or this House should do.  The consequences do not bear thinking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been a difficult enough task for this Government to bring the public <Col N="1009" /> finances under control and it is nonsensical to suggest that a Dáil &ldquo;free-for-all&rdquo; on the annual Estimates would in any way assist in this task.  It is far too easy to increase expenditure.  Every Deputy in this House will have little difficulty with producing a shopping list of programmes, bodies, and schemes which he believes should have higher funding. However, while it is easy to be an advocate of higher expenditure, it is much more difficult to identify, implement and stand over reductions in spending &mdash; as our predecessors know only too well.</P>
    <P>Under the motion, the Government would have to implement reductions in expenditure to offset the cost of additions decided by the Dáil, even if it did not agree with those reductions.  No Government could reasonably be expected to do that.</P>
    <P>The proposals would totally disrupt the existing long-standing arrangements for voting and controlling expenditure.  If the Dáil were to be allowed to increase and reduce subhead provisions, Departments would have to wait until the Dáil had passed their Estimates before they knew how much was available for each subhead.</P>
    <P>Let us just think of the practicalities of that.  One would have to wait until an Estimate got into the House.  Depending on how the Whips were operating the business it could be four months down the line before that Estimate would be even through this House.  Then we would be talking about making adjustments here and adjustments there.  What would the Department do in the meantime for four months, since their expenditure depends on the Estimate being passed? We would end up back in the situation we were in years ago where we did not see Estimates at all except to just vote them through at the end of the year.  We brought them forward for discussion to try to improve the situation and have discussion on them early.</P>

      <P>I know, and, because they have not got the money early enough in the year, they are running around trying to spend it in November and December when it is lashing rain and it is bad value for money.  That is certainly a problem.  It is a problem I intend to attack but not in the silly way that this motion approaches it.  If the Deputy read my budget speech he would know where I was making the start.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed amendment the Minister for Finance would have to become involved in a time-consuming and bureaucratic certification process in cases where proposals to reduce expenditure would not achieve the savings claimed, and could have to give oral evidence in public before a Committee of Public Expenditure to explain the reasons for his certification.  There are a number of objections to this.  First, responsibility for presenting Estimates to the House lies with the individual Ministers responsible, not the Minister for Finance, and to cast him in the role proposed would be difficult to reconcile with this sound, established practice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nonsense for people who have been in Government to suggest that I should have to give detail of the Department of the Environment or Department of Health to a public expenditure committee.  If some backbencher who was never in Government suggested that one could say &ldquo;That is fair enough, he does not know the difference&rdquo; but these people should know the difference. The idea that the Minister for Finance should appear before a Committee of the House to explain and defend a certificate he had given is, I suggest, an undesirable <Col N="1011" /> departure from existing practices where Ministers answer to the full House.</P>
      <P>In reality the Minister for Finance could end up spending a considerable part of his time appearing before a Committee of Public Expenditure on potentially all Estimates, arguing detailed costings with Deputies who did not have any detailed background knowledge of the matters involved.  Deputy Gay Mitchell would have a ball.  The Minister could well end up having little or no time for anything else.  I do not believe that is what the people of Ireland would expect me, as Minister for Finance, to do all the time.  Certainly the people who elect me down in Longford would expect me to do a little more than that.</P>
      <P>The arrangements proposed would almost certainly lead to demands for more back-up staff for the Committee of Public Expenditure to enable them to duplicate and second-guess the detailed costing figures produced by the Department of Finance and the other Departments involved.  In view of the fact that nobody ever seems to agree with the Department of Finance figures, their actions or otherwise, it would be just one long harangue.  No work would be done in the committee and in 12 month's time you would wonder why you ever produced such a recipe for disaster.</P>
      <P>This Government have already made a significant contribution to improving Dáil procedures for consideration of the Estimates.  As I have said, in each of the past two years we have published the Estimates of departmental spending well in advance of the financial year and we have provided Government time for a general discussion on these Estimates, again well before the beginning of the financial year.  That is the way this House should continue to do its business.  Our predecessors in Government who have spoken long about such an innovation produced a document titled <i>How to Manage the Nations Finances</i> or some such name.  Whatever happened to that document?  Was it buried along with all the other documents they produced when in Government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but when you look for the action there is none.  Apart from ensuring that the Dáil was given adequate notice of the Government's spending plans for the year ahead, another central reason for the early tabling of the Estimates was to give spending Departments and agencies time and clear prior guidance on how much they would have to spend, on what the Government wished them to spend it and on the measures they had to implement if they were to remain within the allocations decided. This major improvement in financial procedures would be greatly weakened if Deputy Noonan's motion was agreed, since spending agencies would not know whether the allocations by subhead published in the Government's Book of Estimates would fall to be reduced or increased.  They would have no firm basis for planning, and financial planning and control systems would be seriously weakened.</P>
      <P>The scope for disruption of spending programmes is potentially far-reaching. There are very many ways in which a given amount of money in an Estimate could, in theory, be redistributed over subheads.  Different Deputies could well have contradictory ideas on how the reallocation should be made.  The uncertainty which spending agencies would face could be very great, and would presumably, continue until their Estimates had been voted on by the Dáil.  This could result in their being left in a financial limbo for weeks, if not months, precisely at the time when their energies should be directed to putting in place the measures required to live within their financial allocations as decided by the Government. Such a situation is simply unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall, the proposals in this motion <Col N="1013" /> would complicate, slow down and weaken the machinery for settling the Estimates.  This is the last thing we need at present.  They would introduce major uncertainty and weakness into public expenditure control, and hence into our whole budgetary system.  The Government have discharged effectively their responsibilities in relation to the public finances.  Over the last two years we have had a difficult task to perform in bringing the public finances back on to a more even keel.  We have had to make many difficult choices and implement many hard decisions and we have not shirked that responsibility.  The changes proposed in this motion would lessen Government control over the public finances.  They will put uncertainty in the place of firm and decisive management. They would put at risk the progress we have made in reducing Government borrowing. With the task of the restoration of order to the public finances still a primary national objective, I find it hard to see how any Member of this House could claim that the changes proposed in this motion would advance this task one iota. I would be the last person to stand up here and say that the system we have is perfect; it is far from it, but I hope I am around long enough to make some fundamental changes in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

      <P>If Deputy Carey puts any good idea that is workable and worth while in front of me I guarantee him that if I approve of it the Department of Finance will not turn it down.  That is the difference between firm, decisive management of government and standing back to let the theorists do the job.  We have been elected to do a job and we will do it.  I happened to hear in the corridors that the previous Government toyed for a couple of years with the idea of a tax amnesty but the Department of Finance shot it down, as one of the Deputy's colleagues said.  That is a terrible admission after four and a half years in Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan is talking about going into the public arena.  Maybe he is wasting his energies far too soon; however that is for him to judge.  He is talking about telling people about the problems that exist while Deputy Carey is prepared to admit openly that for four and a half years the Government had good ideas and they knew how to solve problems but the Department of Finance would not let them do anything.  They are not entitled to be ever re-elected to this House or into Government if they openly admit that.  That is not why the people elect a Government.</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputy Carey will take his opportunity tomorrow night.  He likes to come in here and have a bit of fun across the House.  We are dealing with serious business.  This is not a fun House and this is not a serious motion.  It could be better described as a fun motion because nobody sat down to think out the realities of the whole management of the public finances.  They looked at Europe, saw committee systems in operation and decided that we should have the same system.  They never sat down to think where the Government, the budgetary or the whole management position comes in.  Deputies may agree with management by committee system but there are plenty of examples of good businesses gone under because of committee systems under which there was nobody to make decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am all in favour of legitimate debate in this House and of giving this House more and more power but I am not in favour, nor would anybody who seriously thinks it out, of having Government by opposition.  People elect the Government and that Government should be responsible for their actions.  We do not for one moment hold out the view that we have a monopoly of wisdom.  We are an economic management team who sit around a table and make decisions.  If anybody in the country said that out of every ten decisions we took they were all right I would not believe him but other people do not make decisions at all.  Committees <Col N="1016" /> have the happy knack of not making decisions.  They go around in circles and try to get consensus but at the end of the day somebody has to grasp the nettle.</P>

      <P>This is the second time in two years that the Dáil is being asked to vote on this proposal, the gist of which is that the Estimates presented by the Government each year should be subject to a process of amendment by the Dáil. In favour of this proposal two conditions are laid down by Fine Gael; first, that the power of amendment should be restricted to varying amounts within each Vote &mdash; that would mean allowing the Dáil to allocate moneys within Votes &mdash; and, second, that the Minister could veto such a change if any increased spending was not matched by a cut elsewhere.  It is worth noting that the Fine Gael Party made this proposal on 20 October 1987 in an amendment to a Government motion asking the House to note the Estimates. It was defeated on 23 October 1987 by 70 votes to 38.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of that debate at the end of which my party, the Progressive Democrats, supported the Government, I spoke about the Fine Gael proposal and said I did not think the change proposed was a good idea and indicated that the Progressive Democrats would give their reasons for not supporting the proposal at a later stage.  At that stage, I described what was proposed by Deputy Noonan as &ldquo;superficially attractive&rdquo;.  I note he has predicted that I would say that this particular proposal was at variance with the Constitution.  He suggested that this was a lawyer's trick, a device which lawyers <Col N="1019" /> fling around this House on occasion on the unsuspecting laity and whenever they are stuck for a point they say something is unconstitutional.  Perhaps there is some substance in that, may be on occasion the legal eagles in this House do resort to that tactic, but on this occasion I can say, with some degree of confidence, that it is not a mere device, what is proposed in this motion does conflict with the Constitution and does conflict with the role envisaged for the Government in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>One of the things we had better not get carried away with is our own power at the expense of the Executive's power. We have a Constitution with three pillars &mdash; the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary.  To say to the Executive that they must come to the House every year with a shopping list, or an opening bid, in a debate which would turn into a negotiating process with the rest of this House is the way in which the budgetary affairs of this country should be conducted, is to take a very radical step indeed.  Deputy Noonan's arguments conceded what I think is the fundamental contradiction in his proposal.  He said he could envisage this proposal being married in some sense to a fixed term Government and could envisage it effectively, therefore, being part of some system such as the one they have in the United States &mdash; a congressional system.  If there were a fixed term Government and a fixed term Congress, then it might be appropriate to establish a system in which the Executive, which enjoyed office for a fixed term, had to negotiate on an ongoing basis with the Congress on budgetary matters, but we forget in this House that we have one power &mdash; the power at a moment's notice to dismiss the Executive.  That is the kernel of the difference.</P>
    <P>Under our system, as I understand it, under the 1937 Constitution and the one that preceded it, the Executive is responsible to this House, and at any time it can be told to go and pack its bags, and we give it its head and tell it to make decisions.  We delegate to the Executive, to some extent, our own legislative power and tell it get on with the business of running the country.  We do not ask the <Col N="1020" /> Executive to get involved in a tangling process with the Dáil in relation to how the country is run.  I do not like chastising people who come into this House with radical ideas but I feel on this occasion it is a radically wrong idea and it would be slightly dishonest of me if I were to change my position from that of two years ago and it would be less than truthful of me if I were to say that for any political purpose I thought it was constitutionally valid or sustainable.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy &mdash; and the Minister referred to this towards the end of his contribution to this debate &mdash; that a White Paper was produced on this general area by the Government of which Deputy John Bruton was a member, called <i>A Better Way to Plan The Nation's Finances.</i>  I look at that White Paper to see how this proposal measured up and to see if it was consistent with what was suggested in that White Paper. A close study of that White Paper shows that it does not conform with the substance of this proposal.</P>
    <P>The White Paper, authored by Deputy Noonan, did not suggest that the Dáil should have the right to reallocate Government spending.  It did suggest a committee type examination of the Estimates, with which I totally agree, and that Deputies might propose amendments either to reduce the Estimate for a particular item or to impose preconditions for expenditure on particular items, but &mdash; and this is the very important &ldquo;but&rdquo;&mdash; the proposals made at that time by Deputy Bruton gave the Minister the right to reject the amendment, and the right of a Deputy to propose an amendment was circumscribed by the fact that it could only be made if the Government, having listened to the argument, agreed with it.  That is a totally different idea from the one set out in this proposal, which is to force a reluctant Government to go with a budget which they do not accept.</P>
    <P>It has been argued &mdash; and stated here tonight by Deputy Noonan &mdash; that there is nothing in principle wrong within a Vote in the Book of Estimates in allowing the Dáil to move money from one subhead to another.  That sounds a very technical thing to do and as if it could not <Col N="1021" /> have huge consequences but it could mean moving hundreds of millions of pounds from hospital care to community care which would reverse the whole thrust of the Government's health policy. Is it seriously contended that this House should leave in place a Government but tell them to reverse the thrust on all their policies and to do things to which they are diametrically opposed?  If so, the authors of this proposal misunderstand the relationship which the Constitution envisages for the Executive and the Legislature.  I do not accept for one minute that it was ever thought that the Dáil would force a reluctant Government to implement a budget with which they disagreed.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, it would be even more absurd to have a situation where the cuts to counterbalance increased expenditure in one area were ones to which the Government were totally and implacably opposed.  How could a minority Government &mdash; which Deputy Noonan had in mind &mdash; be then asked to implement it?  This body are collectively responsible and are supposed to resign when they get to a stage that they do not agree with what they are asked to do &mdash; that is the convention at any rate &mdash; and how could you possibly ask a body like that to take a budget which was not of their making and to implement it against their own political judgment?  The idea is misconceived.</P>
    <P>The Dáil is constitutionally obliged to consider the Estimates, not to rewrite them, and the proposals now made would effectively make the Government's Estimates into an opening bid in a process which might, each year, force the Government to follow policies in which they were wholly at odds with a majority in the Dáil.  The present convention that the control of State spending is a prerogative of the Executive would be swept away and we would put in its place some kind of mutant system akin to the congressional system in America.  The Proposal if implemented &mdash; which it will not be &mdash; would tear up the idea of an Executive accountable to a parliament and put in its place an Executive obliged to negotiate with a congress.  That is not provided for in our Constitution and it is contrary <Col N="1022" /> to not just the letter but the spirit of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan is not an unintelligent and unsuspecting layman who is incapable of understanding the legal effect of such a provision.  Article 17.2 of the Constitution requires any expenditure from this House to be done on the recommendation of the Taoiseach.  The word &ldquo;recommendation&rdquo; is of some significance. How could the Taoiseach possibly recommend to this House something with which he fundamentally disagreed? It makes nonsense of the wording of the Constitution and it must be read as meaning that any expenditure is on the motion of the Government, in accordance with their wishes and that it carries the authority and responsibility of the Government and not of this House.  No other interpretation of the Article is possible. It is not a matter of a lawyer with a veneer of learning trying to shove a sophisticated argument down the throats of unsuspecting laymen, it is simple basic logic.  If Deputy Noonan studied the Article, he would realise that there can be no spending by this House unless the Taoiseach recommends it.  It follows that the majority in this House, where you have a minority Government with the Taoiseach introducing Estimates, could not be obliged to go with policies or Estimates which he did not accept.  It would do violence to the language of the Constitution to interpret the Article otherwise and, therefore, this proposal is wrong in principle.</P>
    <P>It would be far better if the House went back to Deputy Bruton's White Paper to look at what could be done by way of genuine reform of our Estimates procedures. It is noteworthy that some progress has been made, particularly by this Government but also by the Government of which Deputy Bruton was a member, in implementing some of the ideas in that White Paper.  This included the comprehensive public expenditure programmes and the Committee on Public Expenditure which were there under the previous Government; the introduction of Estimates for noting by this House in the autumn of the year prior to the financial year to which they relate are steps which were envisaged by that White <Col N="1023" /> Paper but which are still incomplete.  We have a lot more to do and one of the principal things is to respect the letter and spirit of the Constitution in carrying out what we are supposed to do, to consider the Estimates.  We should not have a rushed debate in a couple of hours at the end of a long hot summer day in June when we run through three or four Departments of State in a few hours. This involves Deputies, myself included, making points of particular interest to them but without any consideration of the substance of the Estimate or its global or budgetary strategic importance.</P>
    <P>With the greatest respect to all Members, Estimates debates are a bit of a farce because they do not amount to a considered evaluation of the Estimate but to an occasion on which individual Deputies let off steam.  They talk about individual items of interest to them at length in an unstructured manner.  Would it not be far better if this House when it received the Estimates in October &mdash; as it has done for the last two years &mdash; established a committee which would then report on the Estimates to the House and that the House would then consider the report of the committee and the Estimate together and make any points it wanted to in relation to the report and the Estimate?  That would be far more productive than the present system.</P>
    <P>It is not just Deputy Bruton who has addressed his mind to this issue.  I note that Deputy John Kelly has written about it in his book on the Irish Constitution where he examines the implications of the Constitution in regard to the control by this House of public expenditure and the consideration of the Estimates.  It is quite clear that this House does not do what the Constitution requires of it, to consider the Estimates as soon as possible after they are presented.  That is a breach of our constitutional duty and something of which we should not be proud.  We should tackle it as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Rather than attempting to embroil the Executive in a budgetary tangling match which would spell the end for decisive Government, the Dáil should take seriously the role which it does have.  We <Col N="1024" /> cannot have 166 Ministers for Finance. Not everybody can be a member of the Executive and just because it is in a minority position does not mean that it is open to the rest of the House to abrogate its functions or to decide that everybody will be a little Minister in his or her own right.  Sometimes, when I think about the composition of this House &mdash; again I include myself &mdash; I am reminded of the composition of the workforce of Waterford Glass, that we divide into cutters and blowers.  It is important to remember that some of us have one function and others, from time to time, have another function.  The people who have a function in regard to acting as the Executive of the State are required by our Constitution to be Members of this House and to be responsible to it.</P>
    <P>The best thing we can do in relation to budgetary reform of this House is to follow the line laid out in Deputy Bruton's White Paper.  I want to be generous to him; it is a good programme in general terms for making this House take its own role seriously.  It has been only half-implemented, a lot of further implementation is needed.  The Minister has said that he is willing to examine individual proposals for reform of the budgetary process in the House and I suggest that he should refer to the White Paper of 1984-85 and try to implement a few of the sensible reforms laid out in it.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the House has serious difficulties in living up to its constitutional role.  There is equally no doubt that the House is being invited tonight not to carry out its own functions properly but, because it is not carrying out its own functions, to invade the province of the Executive.  That is a mistake.  Although I am reluctant to be critical of any Member who suggests reform, particularly radical reform, I think this is radically wrong, as I said before.  Since I said so in October 1987, and believed it then, and because I have not changed my views in the meantime, I have to indicate yet again that the Progressive Democrats cannot support this proposal.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flaherty gave me notice of her intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the inadequacy of funds provided by the Minister for the Environment to Dublin refurbishment schemes, particularly at Ballymun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the adjournment. My main concern in raising this issue is to highlight how grossly inadequate is the allocation made available this year to Dublin Corporation bearing in mind the number of projects that are in progress and those that have been identified as necessary.  I accept that the Minister cannot do anything about this matter this year but very soon he will be considering estimates for next year.  I should like to point out to him the need there is for an expansion of the refurbishing programme next year.  I welcomed the allocation of £4.4 million by the Minister for refurbishment earlier this year.  I was worried that such a programme would not continue under the Minister in the same way that it had under his predecessor.  I welcomed the fact that the Minister had decided to continue with this relatively new development programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcomed the Minister's decision because for the first time Ballymun had been included.  In doing that the Minister was honouring a commitment he had made to the people of Ballymun. However, when the corporation considered how they should allocate that £4.4 million they discovered that £3.6 million had been committed to schemes which commenced the previous years.  That left a tiny amount of money available for any new projects, one of which was Ballymun. It was estimated that phase 1 of the Ballymun project would cost £4.4 million.  I am not suggesting that we should have spent that amount of money this year.  In regard to that I should like to ask the Minister if he has released the plans to Dublin Corporation so that they can commence with some of the work on that project this year.  The bulk of that <Col N="1026" /> money will be required for Ballymun next year.</P>
    <P>A number of other projects were scheduled for implementation with Ballymun. Phase 2 of the Darndale project requires £1 million this year and the other phases would cost £7 million.  The Fatima Mansions project requires £500,000; St. Mary's requires the best part of £1 million; Cherry Orchard requires £200,000 and the Oliver Bond project requires £500,000.  Most of those projects will require substantial funds next year.  Limited structural work will be carried out in Ballymun this year but it will not have the type of environmental impact we are looking forward to.  The Cherry Orchard project will require several million pounds more and the Fatima Mansions project will require a further £1 million. We have not estimated the cost of refurbishing pre-war schemes such as St. Joseph's Mansions or Marrowbone Lane flats where the windows are falling out of the houses.  It is not hard to picture the condition of houses and flats that were built more than 50 years ago and have not been refurbished since.  It stands to reason that a lot of work will need to be done on those buildings.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation engaged consultants to carry out a study of the maintenance needs of their housing stock and they identified 5,750 units as requiring refurbishment at an estimated cost of £90 million.  We do not expect funds of that scale to be provided in one year but when one considers that the allocation this year was £4.4 million one will understand what a drop in the ocean it is in relation to our needs.  I should like to point out that three years ago the National Coalition were committing up to £80 million annually to Dublin Corporation for housing but the Government have reduced that figure to £4.4 million.  That represents an outrageous cut in investment in housing in the city.</P>
    <P>I accept that due to our building programme, and our successful loans and grants schemes, we have vacant dwellings in the city and that that should not be allowed to continue.  I accept that it took Dublin Corporation some time to change their policies and prepare plans for refurbishment which is the clearly identifiable <Col N="1027" /> need and is in line with programmes in cities throughout Europe.  However, the Minister did not provide sufficient funds to permit us to carry out a refurbishment programme.  The need for such work exists.  The inner city is full of pre-war houses and flats blocks which are in a dreadful condition.  We have post-war creations like Ballymun, Cherry Orchard and Finglas south &mdash; it has not been listed on any programmes &mdash; in need of substantial refurbishment.</P>
    <P>There are problems in regard to the inner city flats blocks because they were built in the post-war period at a time when materials were scarce and the quality of the buildings was inadequate.  There are 700 houses that are without bathrooms. A bath had been provided in the kitchen of many of those flats or houses. It amounted to a tub with a top on it but it proved impossible for people to have a bath in privacy and it is not surprising that many people removed them.  Dublin Corporation are endeavouring to install showers in those units but, because of the limited amount of funds available, progress is painfully slow.  It is planned to install 59 showers this year but we should do something to speed up the provision of a basic human entitlement which gives a person an opportunity to keep himself or herself clean.</P>
    <P>Last year Cork Corporation, who have 7,000 housing units received £3 million while Dublin Corporation, with 38,000 units, received £4.4 million.  I had an opportunity of attending a housing conference in Glasgow last year and I discovered that Margaret Thatcher had provided £300 million to the local authority there for refurbishment in that year. The British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, with her image of a hard heart, contributed substantially to the attempts of the people of Glasgow to revive, revitalise and refurbish that city.</P>
    <P>Apart from that £4.4 million, I gather only 18 houses are being built this year in Buckingham Street in the inner city of Dublin whereas three years ago we would have invested £80 million in our housing stock, largely in new buildings.  As a result of the deterioration in our housing stock there are huge levels of vacancies <Col N="1028" /> in many flat blocks, for example, but in Ballymun I think the vacancy level is of the order of 500 to 600 flats.  These flats require substantial maintenance and refurbishment and a total commitment otherwise they will only be vandalised again.</P>
    <P>With the co-operation of the community in Ballymun something very special has developed in that area similar to what developed so successfully in Darndale.  An active community group interested in seeing their area revitalised and in creating an attractive environment have come together with the corporation and worked out a plan. Based on European experience, this is one of the vital ingredients for successful refurbishment.  None of us wants to throw money into refurbishing buildings only to find at the end of it all that we are back to the same old cycle of vandalism and destruction.  We want to be sure that the money spent will yield a permanent and healthy product.</P>
    <P>Based on experience across the water and because we are late in carrying out refurbishment, we have had time to learn from the experience of many of our British and European counterparts in the larger cities.  They have learned that the key issues to refurbishment are local involvement, consultation with local people with regard to design and giving maximum responsibility to local people to maintain estates once the investment is made.  There have been many great successes and I have no doubt that we could change the face of Dublin.  It is absolutely essential that we set about changing the face of Dublin because of the conditions in which many people live.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Mitchell, the Fine Gael spokesperson on urban affairs, produced a document last year which he launched in one of the flat blocks in the city of Dublin.  This drew attention to conditions in which thousands of Dubliners live, conditions which none of us would be happy to live in.  As a corporation official said, the windows and doors were literally falling off many dwellings and there were no sanitary facilities.  While the basic units of accommodation in Ballymun are attractive, the general environment is so badly planned, <Col N="1029" /> so inhuman and so large that people cannot make an impact on it and major investment is needed to make the area more people orientated.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows what we are proposing and I know that he supports it but his support will be little more than words if substantial funds are not made available for this area next year.  I acknowledge the fact that the Minister has given money and shown an interest in the refurbishment of Ballymun, but that interest will be nothing more than a token gesture if it is not backed up by significant funds. As I said 5,750 units are in need of refurbishment at a cost of £90 million, and obviously that figure will increase each year.  It is essential that these improvements are carried out.</P>
    <P>People should not have to live in that kind of environment when we are not spending money building new houses. This refurbishment would cost £10,000 to £15,000 per unit, which is the current scale of spending on refurbishment schemes.  For this sum we could provide a unit of accomodation for a family but if we allow these units to run down to the extent that they will be irretrievable, in the long term we will have to build new units of accommodation at a cost of £25,000 to £30,000 each.  Therefore, these improvements are desirable both from a social and an environmental point of view.</P>
    <P>Conditions here are not as bad as in some British cities, for example, Glasgow, which requires a great deal of investment because it has problems which thanks be to God, we have never had here in terms of ugly buildings, etc. There is lots of space in Ballymun which has great environmental potential and phase one of this scheme should go ahead quickly, and be followed rapidly by phases two to six.  The funds necessary to complete the scheme over a number of years would be of the order of £20 million to £30 million.  For this sum we could change this area and make it one which the people who are so committed to building it up deserve, which we can be proud of and which will be an addition to the city rather than an area of difficulty. This scheme will also have tremendous employment potential.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1030" /> For all of the reasons I have outlined I ask the Minister to ensure that the total inadequate level of funding provided by Dublin Corporation this year be increased.  The funding of £800,000 is only a token gesture and means that new projects cannot commence.  These projects are necessary to provide basic decent facilities where people can live. Phase one of the Darndale scheme has been completed but the people there are very disillusioned at the delay in starting phase two.  If in ten to 15 years only one phase of this scheme has been carried out and the rest of the area is left in the same depressing condition the Minister will have defeated the purpose of this programme.</P>
    <P>It is important that these programmes move at a decent pace so that the people are not let down.  Obviously it is a struggle to turn around an area, but if we implement these programmes at a snail's pace so that they have little impact on an area then we will be wasting the resources we are putting into the area.  The Minister has the right idea but he needs to put it into a new gear and give it more financial commitment next year in particular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for allowing me to make a few comments, and also Deputy Flaherty for bringing this matter before the House.  This is an opportunity for me to once again defend the Minister.  I am very much aware of the commitment the Minister made when he was approached by the task force committee in Ballymun. The Minister agreed to meet this committee on three occasions and on the final occasion he met them in Ballymun at their request.  On the third occasion the Minister said he would like to see Ballymun and I took him on a tour there, spending an hour doing so before attending the meeting, when he was afforded an opportunity of seeing its good and bad aspects.  On that occasion I showed him the results of some of the money he had previously allocated for landscaping and other such work in Ballymun.  At no time <Col N="1031" /> was there any doubt in my mind of the Minister's commitment.</P>
      <P>On three occasions in Dublin Corporation I had occasion to defend the Minister, twice at housing committee meetings and once at a city council meeting. I was very disappointed at the reaction of some politicians, particularly those of The Workers' Party who endeavoured to discredit the Minister, saying all sorts of things about him.  They even intimated he had no idea about environmental matters, coming, as he does, from the west.  I defended him, pointing out that although he came from the west he was, in my view, the most positive Minister for the Environment we have ever had.  In fact, I described him as the best Minister for the Environment on account of his commitment to Ballymun.</P>
      <P>The Minister committed himself to allocating the total cost of the phase one refurbishment plan, amounting to something in the region of £5 million.  He gave that commitment to all the committee members present on that occasion, issuing a press statement afterwards.  Therefore, there has never been any doubt in my mind of the Minister's commitment. Following on that meeting Dublin Corporation officials, having decided on the relevant plan, set about its preparation. Because in this year, approximately only £750,000 of that allocation will be spent, I endeavoured to explain to those people that the whole of the £5 million could not be expended between August and December, explaining that the £750,000 would be the amount of money spent in this year and the remainder in following ones.</P>

A good example is a box of apples with one or two rotten ones among them.  Even if one transfers those apples into another box, unless one extracts the rotten ones the rot will continue to permeate the others.  Therefore, when this work has been completed Dublin Corporation will have the important task of establishing proper management there.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flaherty mentioned phase two.  However, I heard a senior official in Dublin Corporation say that when phase one is completed a period of time will have to elapse before phase two can be considered, that its implementation will be entirely dependent on how the people of Ballymun deal with the results of phase one.  For example, if when phase one is completed the refurbished flats are vandalised, there would be no point in implementing phase two.</P>

The overall Ballymun complex will have to be examined People living in flats at present are making representations to me to move out of them.  There are a certain number of flats needed in Ballymun but it would appear that, if we are to stabilise the Ballymun population more houses will be needed, the stable population there at present being accommodated in houses with a most unstable population in the flats.  I am sure Deputy Flaherty holds a clinic in Ballymun also, when she will have ascertained that people at present living in flats there are anxious to vacate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to thank the Minister for his positive reaction to the people of Ballymun when they approached him. <Col N="1033" /> Throughout my years in politics I can say he is the first Minister who ever toured Ballymun and responded favourably to the requests made to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should thank the two Deputies who contributed to this debate, in particular Deputy Michael Barrett, and indeed the good people of Ballymun for having received me so kindly when I conducted a tour there together with the other members of the group involved.</P>
      <P>Before I turn to the matter of the allocations to Dublin Corporation, I would like to clarify some misconceptions which have arisen about the remedial works scheme under which these allocations are made.  The House will already be aware that, while the construction of local authority houses is funded in full by my Department, their management, maintenance and improvement is the responsibility of the local authority concerned. There are no funds available from my Department for that purpose.  It is, however, recognised that the financial limitations on authorities may prevent them from undertaking major structural works which have become necessary in certain cases.  For this reason 100 per cent capital grants may be made available under the remedial works scheme to enable authorities to tackle specific, serious problem areas.  The scheme is targeted, in particular, at remedying defective, low-cost housing and refurbishing pre-1940 estates, including the provision of adequate sanitary facilities. But we will aim also to assist local authorities to rehabilitate the designated run down and problem estates to which they have accorded the highest priority.</P>
      <P>One might get the impression sometimes that local authorities look on this scheme as a source of funding to make up for the inadequacy of their housing management and maintenance systems over the years.  That is not the objective of the scheme.  The scheme is not a substitute for a properly planned management and maintenance programme, nor does its existence relieve local authorities from the responsibility of adequately maintaining their stock on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> The capital provision for the remedial works scheme in 1989 is £15 million.  The fact that this is an increase of some 66 per cent on the 1988 expenditure figure is an indication of the importance which I attach to the need for a programme to tackle the problems which affect certain local authority dwellings.  In spite of this increase the demand for funds under the scheme far exceeds the amount of money available.  The fact that the funds available are limited and likely to be so in the future means that priorities, based on extent and urgency, have to be established and, in the case of larger projects, the works must be phased over a number of years.  Everybody appreciates that.  It was in that context that we said: let us have a look at Dublin.</P>
    <P>To date I have approved the six proposals, including Ballymun, which have been accorded the highest priority by Dublin Corporation.  The total estimated cost of these schemes is over £80 million. While this year's allocation of £4.4 million to Dublin Corporation may seem a small amount in this context I am satisfied that it is reasonable in the light of their probable spending in 1989 to which Deputy Flaherty alluded.  It should be borne in mind that Dublin Corporation this year received almost 30 per cent of the total funds available for these estates. It must also be remembered that nearly all of the projects are still in the initial pilot stages and that the scope for major expenditure in 1989 is limited.  Work is in progress in Fatima Mansions.  Pilot schemes are underway in Cherry Orchard and St. Mary's Mansions.  The technical and cost results of these will have to be evaluated before further phases are undertaken.  Examination of Dublin Corporation's proposals for phase two of Darndale is complete.  I will be in touch with them shortly in the matter.  I have approved in principle the projects at Ballymun and Oliver Bond House. Technical documentation in respect of these schemes is being examined.  I hope to be in a position to make a decision on both very shortly.</P>

      <P>I should also like to make it clear that, in considering any proposal under the remedial works scheme, it is necessary to look at more than the structural works to the dwellings in question. No matter how satisfactory these are, the remedial works will not succeed &mdash; and here Deputies Flaherty and Barrett are correct &mdash; unless similar attention is paid to the environment of these dwellings and to the needs and wishes of the residents.</P>
      <P>I have made it clear to all authorities, including Dublin Corporation, that continued remedial works funding is contingent on satisfactory progress being made in the areas of improved management and maintenance and the involvement and co-operation of tenants in the improvement of their estates. Future allocations to Dublin Corporation will be dependent on their overall response to the management and maintenance problems of their estates and the annual capital allocation available to me for the programme and the level of demand by other authorities for funds for remedial works to their housing stocks.</P>
      <P>I am committed to implementing a decent remedial works programme.  That is the reason the money has been increased this year.  I should like to give more and, progressively, I will give as much as I can to meet the demands.  I was very impressed with the reception I received in Ballymun.  There is a real problem to be tackled there, but it cannot be tackled in isolation, by merely doing up a block and then saying goodbye; it will not work that way.  The people themselves pointed out to me and to Deputies Flaherty and Barrett that they wanted to have a sense of belonging; that is the fundamental aspect being made clear at this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is quite right, I did approve phase one.  I cannot give the <Col N="1036" /> House the exact figure of what phase one will cost but I am satisfied that, when I release the figure in the near future to go to contract, whatever money can be spent in the intervening period of the contract will have to be met between now and the end of the year.  I do not know how much that will be but the House can rest assured we will fund it in that way and will continue in that manner into next year until that phase has been finalised.  It does involve a lot of money on phase one only. There is much money to be expended after that as well.  Therefore let us get good value for that money.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the two Deputies are present because they can convey to their colleagues that, as Deputy Barrett said, I want management and maintenance put on a proper footing, with a proper manager appointed out there to deal with that matter so that the money spent is not put to bad use, as Deputy Flaherty suggested, with the place being revandalised.  We are not going to waste money in that fashion.  This is a major project which will continue for many years.  My commitment is as good today as when I gave it to Deputy Barrett and his colleagues on that occasion.  Indeed the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was there as well, as were the other people.</P>
    <P>I propose finalising the phase one project for Ballymun in the immediate future, letting it go to contract when I hope we can arrive at a satisfactory solution with regard to the money to be spent this year on whatever is deemed to be necessary.  Then we can get Dublin Corporation to put in place what I consider to be just as important, that is an environmental arrangement for the people there with proper management and maintenance controls.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>In the Civil Service, the established travel arrangements are that officers make their private cars available for use on official business, and are paid mileage allowances at rates, and subject to conditions, which are agreed with staff interests under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the civil service. Given the voluntary nature of these arrangements, it would not be appropriate to attempt to impose a condition making the use of unleaded petrol mandatory for travelling officers.  There is also the consideration that there are no practical means of ensuring that a condition of this kind, if imposed, would be complied with.</P>
      <P>However I am sure that civil servants in common with motorists generally will appreciate the benefits of using unleaded petrol, in the interests of protecting our environment and the health of our community, and will do so whenever possible. To this end, promotional leaflets published by the Department of the Environment are being circulated throughout Government Departments and particular arrangements are being made to ensure that all travelling officers receive copies. Copies will also be sent to Deputies and Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not directly responsible for the travelling arrangements in State companies and other bodies throughout the public sector.  However I understand that the arrangements in operation in those bodies are on the same lines as the civil service system, so the same considerations would apply.  However I have <Col N="827" /> no doubt that the managements of State bodies will also co-operate fully with the promotional activities of the Department of the Environment concerning unleaded petrol, and that their travelling staff will use such petrol where practicable.</P>

      <P>The Delors Committee were entrusted by the European Council with the task of studying proposed concrete stages leading towards economic and monetary union in the European Community.  In their report, they have set out a programme of such stages. While they do not put forward a timetable, they recommend that the process should begin not later than mid-1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report provides a basis for further discussion on greater economic and monetary integration within the Community. The Government will participate in this discussion in a constructive manner because we believe that greater integration, accompanied by effective measures to minimise existing imbalances, will lead to greater stability to the benefit <Col N="828" /> of the Community.  The report underlines the importance of regional policies in order to promote an optimum allocation of resources and to spread welfare gains throughout the Community.  This emphasis is to be welcomed as Government support for greater economic and monetary integration must be conditional on appropriate support for the development of the peripheral and poorer areas of the Community.</P>
    <P>The report contains a number of proposals for institutional changes to assist the progress towards economic and monetary union.  It is too early to give an informed opinion on these and other proposals in the report, pending further discussion at Community level, and detailed analysis at departmental level.</P>

      <P>Section 2.1 of the Insurance Act 1953 empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make arrangements for export credit insurance.  Under agreed arrangements, the export credit insurance scheme is administered by the Insurance Corporation of Ireland plc (ICI) as agent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  ICI are delegated authority to underwrite export credit insurance without reference to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.

    <P>The Minister for Finance is of course consulted on any changes to, or policy issues affecting, the Export Credit Insurance Scheme, including any increase in the ceiling on the State's liability for export credit insurance to Iraq.

      <P>Plans for the relocation of the Department of Social Welfare in Dungarvan are at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>A building at Church Street, Dungarvan was acquired at the end of March, 1988 to house the Department of Social Welfare and a number of other Departments. One of these, the Department of Forestry, became a Semi-State body, Coillte Teoranta, and its changed status meant that that body had to be given time to consider its new position in respect of accommodation requirements and the funding for any fitting-out work to the area it was to occupy.</P>
      <P>I would estimate that the building will be ready for occupation in about 5 to 6 months, allowing for builders' holidays.</P>

      <P>A total of 115 otter hunts were carried out under licence in 1988.  Wildlife Officers of my Department were present as observers at 39 of these hunts during the year.  The number of otters reported killed was 7.</P>
      <P>For 1989, four applications for licences to hunt otters were submitted by the Irish Masters of Otterhounds Association and I have authorised the issue of licences for the four hunts involved.</P>
      <P>While the otter is a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976, the Act also provides that licences to hunt this species may be issued in accordance with its provisions having regard to the conservation of the species.</P>

The Government representatives stressed the importance of the plan for economic and social development in Ireland, the main requirements for development, the scope for involving the private sector and the need to maintain the momentum of the plan by early decisions on the plan itself and on the operational programmes through which it will be implemented.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner welcomed the timely submission of the plan and recognised the need to maintain its momentum. He endorsed both the economic framework and the individual sectoral proposals which the plan contains.  He also particularly noted the emphasis on overcoming the difficulties posed by our peripherality and on the need to upgrade our road system and tourism infrastructure. He welcomed our effort to involve private funding in the overall development effort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the procedures which are in place pursuant to the Air Navigation Act (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952 or otherwise to ensure that foreign military aircraft over-flying Irish air space do not carry dangerous nuclear fissible material or nuclear weapons; and whether prior assurances are sought and obtained in respect of any permission given for overflights, that no such weapons are carried.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952, provides that foreign military aircraft may not fly over the State unless at the express invitation or with the express permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Accordingly, permission for overflights of foreign military aircraft has to be sought from me.  The granting of such permission is dependent on certain conditions being met which are drawn to the attention of the countries concerned.  The most important of these conditions are that the aircraft be unarmed, not carry arms, ammunition or explosives and not engage in intelligence-gathering.  Further, the flights in question must not form part of military exercises or operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to these provisions the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order, 1973, provides that dangerous goods shall not be carried in any aircraft in or over the State save with the permission of the Minister for Tourism and Transport.  In accordance with general international practice the carriage in aircraft generally of certain goods, including fissile material, which are defined and listed as dangerous goods in the publication &ldquo;Technical Instructions for the <Col N="844" /> Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air&rdquo; and its supplement of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is allowed &mdash; subject to the condition that the regulations in regard to packaging safety etc., contained in that publication are complied with.</P>
    <P>I would add that while fissile material is included on this list and its carriage is permitted under ICAO practice, the conditions imposed by me as Minister for Foreign Affairs under the 1952 Order, which I have referred to, prohibit the carriage of explosives as such and this would of course include nuclear weapons.</P>

      <P>The other countries represented at Brazzaville at official level were the Federal Republic of Germany and Luxembourg.  I might add that the Danish delegation was headed by a Secretary of State in the Foreign Ministry who in Denmark is a civil servant comparable in our civil service with the grade of Deputy Secretary.</P>
      <P>The negotiations are scheduled to be concluded by the end of this year.  This timetable would require at least two ministerial level meetings.  It is my intention that Ireland will be represented at ministerial level at future EC/ACP ministerial meetings in these negotiations.</P>

      <P>The rates of daily allowance being paid by the State to members of the Garda Síochána serving with the United Nations Transition Assistance Group in Namibia were given in my reply to the Deputy's Question on 20 April 1989 (No. 18).  Similar information in respect of Defence Forces' personnel in Namibia was given by the Minister for Defence in his reply to Question No. 50 on 12 April 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rates of allowance being paid to members of the Garda contingent were struck on the understanding, as notified to us by the UN, that members would be provided with free food and accommodation and receive not more than US$ <Col N="848" /> 1.28 per day from the UN to cover incidental expenses.  The rate of daily allowance being paid by the State to Defence Forces' personnel takes account of the substantially higher daily allowance payable to them by the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The matter of daily allowances from the UN is the subject of ongoing discussion and negotiation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 88 together.  Offenders with alcohol problems have a number of services available to them including general medical, psychiatric, welfare and chaplaincy services. In addition, members of Alcoholics Anonymous visit the institutions regularly to befriend and counsel offenders with alcohol problems.  In recent years the Probation and Welfare service has organised alcohol education courses in a number of institutions.  These courses are of about ten weeks duration and every effort is made to involve the family of the offender in them.  In appropriate cases offenders can be allowed outings to <Col N="853" /> attend AA meetings in the community and temporary release can be granted conditional on attendance at, or residence in, a community-based treatment centre.</P>
      <P>The Probation and Welfare Service is available to offenders who have no home to go to on release from prison.  The service assists in arranging accommodation and my Department fund a number of hostels where such accommodation is available.</P>

    <P>With regard to the involvement of management grades in the development and use of IT, there is a local area network supporting some 314 personal computers in my Department which is extensively used by various management staff.  My Department also, through the Central IT Services Section, has a service-wide role in promoting and assisting the development of IT.  That section's management staff, therefore, are heavily involved in many aspects of IT promotion and development.</P>

    <P>Since the introduction of computers into the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in 1963, management grades at all levels have been involved in the selection, specification, building, testing, and operation of computer systems. Information technology is a key ingredient in the day-to-day work of most managers. In addition to the country wide computer network of 1,100 terminals, there are 300 microcomputers for word-processing, record management, electronic spreadsheets, etc. 120 of the latter are linked into a local area network which was installed specifically to meet the information technology needs of senior management.</P>

      <P>A system of accountable management, based on the principles outlined in the 1985 White Paper on the Public Service, is in operation in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  The system has operated since 1986.</P>
      <P>The operation of the system, on both the Inland Revenue and Customs &amp; Excise sides of the Office, is monitored by Management Committees, each of which is chaired by a member of the Board.</P>
      <P>Office of Public Works (OPW)</P>
      <P>A Planning Committee consisting of the heads of the staff support units headed by the Chairman of the Commissioners is in place in OPW to oversee the development of a corporate plan and to advise the Management Committee on an ongoing basis.  In addition, a study to design a comprehensive management information system is in progress.  In the Office's major area of Government building construction a Project Management Plan is being implemented.  Under the plan management accountability is essential and to this end individual officers are being designated with overall responsibility for particular projects.</P>
      <P>In the Office as a whole, the concept of budget-holding has been developed and extended so that, in so far as possible, heads of functions are fully accountable for disbursal of moneys voted for their functional areas.</P>

    <P>The grazing/tillage of lands at Barretstown Castle, County Kildare were offered publicly for letting by tender in the local provincial newspapers, on 25 February 1989.  In all 14 tenders were received in respect of the various lots.

The £6.6 millin includes a grant of £249,000 for county road improvements eligible for EC aid under the Western Package.  In addition, the local authority has been allocated a local improvements scheme grant of £243,000 in respect of non-public farm road projects eligible for EC aid under the package.

      <P>Local authorities have power to provide disposal sites for wastes generally and can raise loans for this purpose. There is no question, however, of any special form of grant assistance for facilities for disposal of refrigerators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to making the public aware of the danger involved from the release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), as CFCs <Col N="891" /> are non-toxic there is no immediate danger to the public arising from the presence of CFCs in refrigeration equipment. I assume, therefore, that the Deputy is referring to the depletion of the ozone layer which is caused when CFCs enter the stratosphere.  In this respect, I can assure the Deputy that I am doing, and I will continue to do, all I can by way of public statements, information notes and other relevant and appropriate mechanisms to keep people informed of the danger of releasing CFCs in the atmosphere. In addition, I am considering what steps might be taken to ensure that CFCs in existing equipment are recycled and disposed of, as appropriate, without damage to the environment.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, the only solution to the problems caused by the release of CFCs into the atmosphere is to eliminate their production and consumption internationally. In that respect the European Communities, in recognising that the provisions in the Montreal Protocol for an eventual 50 per cent reduction over 1986 levels in the production and consumption of CFCs by 1 July 1998 are inadequate, have now taken the lead internationally by agreeing that the production and consumption of CFCs be eliminated as soon as possible and at the latest by the end of this century.  This is a very positive step forward and I would hope that it will be followed by many more countries worldwide.</P>

They are both on the waiting list for admission to Brú Chaomhin and are being cared for at present in the Mater Hospital and the rehabilitation unit at the Royal Hospital, Donnybrook.  The Eastern Health Board are unable to give a date for admission to Brú Chaomhin as decisions on admission are a matter for the consultants concerned and depend on the availability of beds at the home.  The persons concerned cannot be cared for together at present because of their individual medical needs.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that on 8 March the Hospitals Committee of the Southern Health Board requested the board's management to prepare a report on the organisation of acute hospital facilities in Cork in the light of the board's financial difficulties.  I understand that the Cork voluntary hospitals have been consulted in the course of preparation of this report.  At its last meeting on 12 April, the Hospitals Committee decided to postpone consideration of the report in view of the application to the High Court for a judicial review of the provision of hospital services in Mallow Hospital.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick West):</i> A Management Advisory Committee was established in my Department in 1985.  As regards a system of accountable management it is the practice in my Department that senior officers i.e. Assistant Secretaries and Principal Officers have responsibility for specific functional areas of expenditure.  In that connection I would also refer the Deputy to the reply given by the Minister for Finance to a parliamentary question on 31 January 1989 in regard to the various proposals set out in the White Paper.

        <i>Limerick West):</i> A contract was placed in November 1988 for the supply of bread to military posts in County Kildare including the Curragh Training Camp for the period from 1 December 1988 to 30 November 1989, on the basis of competitive tendering.  In accordance with Government contracts procedures the lowest suitable tender was accepted in respect of each military post.  It is not the practice to disclose details of individual tenders received.</P>
      <P>My Department was informed on 24 April, 1989 that the firm which had been awarded the contract had ceased trading and tenders have now been re-invited for the supply of bread to the posts in question for the period ending 30 November, 1989.</P>
