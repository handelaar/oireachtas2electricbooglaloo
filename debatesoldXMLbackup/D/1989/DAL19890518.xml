    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to sum up what I said on the previous occasion.  Considering the importance of our ports in the context of trading as an island nation, one realises that good legislation is vital in this high priority area.  I fully endorse the Minister's point about the need to get our ports into shape to cope with the growth in trading in the nineties as a result of the expansion in food processing. We must have an efficient service to ensure that our goods are distributed in double quick time arriving in good condition on the supermarket shelves. This is the primary function of a port authority.  Our shipping costs are well out of line and we cannot continue that way. Food products are bulky and perishable and transport costs are a large factor in the success or failure of our export drive. European competition is very keen and only the fittest will survive.  There is a growing demand for fresh food.  This presupposes a 24 hour a day delivery service in order to develop food exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with this Bill as a pattern for other ports but the Minister must be congratulated on bringing forward the Bill if for no other reason than to emphasise the importance of our harbours in the battle for survival from 1992 on.  Our harbour costs and our ability to cope with all types of traffic must be in line if our goods are to be competitive.  Our exporters will not receive a carriage subsidy to the market.  We are on the periphery of Europe, and as somebody else said we could be described as being the Aran Islands of Europe.  We will not be helped into the marketplace.  We need not only to be competitive but to be better <Col N="554" /> than our competitors to get into the European market.  The European market share is there for us only if we can supply top class goods at the right price.  We have a major handicap because of our location on the periphery of Europe.  We must overcome this handicap.  A good efficient port authority is a prerequisite for success.  We must work on a proper model for this Authority, whether it be in Cork Waterford, Shannon or whatever.</P>
    <P>For this Authority we need a small team of businessmen and women who are involved and interested in harbour affairs.  We need people who know what is needed and how to go about getting it. We need people who will not be put off by telephone calls from higher places, people who are prepared to devote their time generously on behalf of the country. These people are available if we look for them.</P>
    <P>A natural evolution in other ports such as Cork, Waterford and Galway would be the establishment of a SFADCo type organisation to develop the ports.  Cork harbour needs an organisation to get the dockyard going again to ensure the future of our refinery and to canvas industry for the port area.  The power station at Aghada is daily discharging millions of gallons of boiling water into the harbour. This could be used in a major horticultural project or for a leisure centre. This is the sort of thing a SFADCo like organisation could and should get involved with.</P>
    <P>A port authority should also cater for the safe mooring of our fishing fleet.  This facility has been sadly neglected over the years by successive Governments.  Not many fishermen can rest easy when a force eight storm blows up.  Most of them spend the night out with their boats trying to make sure that the craft, valued at up to £1 million, will be safe.  Compared to what is being done in other countries, we have a long way to go in providing safe moorings for our fishing fleet.</P>
    <P>This Bill has given us a timely opportunity to discuss all aspects of harbour development.  I am not over-concerned to allow this port authority to get into too many areas.  Mariculture, for instance, is <Col N="555" /> well looked after by the Department of the Marine.  They have the technology and are doing a good job farming shellfish and so on.  We should leave them with that job.  Fishermen might crib from time to time about too much attention from the Naval Service, but basically the fishermen are dealt with very well by the Department of the Marine.  What is not provided is safe mooring facilities when the fishermen take their boats back to base.</P>
    <P>I live near the small port of Ballycotton and I know from experience that every time a storm blows up we are in fear and trembling.  Fishermen have to go out to work early in the morning and it is not fair that they should have to spend their night going up and down to the boats, even though they cannot do a whole lot about it.  I am sure that we would have no difficulty getting agreement from all sides of the House to spend money providing proper mooring facilities for the valuable sophisticated vessels being used by the fishermen.  In the North of Ireland, for instance, a lot of money has been spent providing proper mooring facilities. When I was on the Council of Europe I saw places where there were hydraulic doors in harbours and if gales blew up, the doors could be closed.  That is the sort of thing that should be provided in proper harbour development.  In proper harbour development we should have on-shore facilities, such as ice plants and proper hygienic handling of fish, the ability to deal with articulated vehicles and so on.</P>
    <P>Pollution is a major problem which has to be tackled.  We need a total change of attitude by the Government.  There is no point blaming county councils or county managers when raw sewage is pumped into our harbours.  We are to blame because we will not set aside the necessary funding for treatment plants in our major harbours.  We cannot achieve control overnight but we should look seriously at pollution controls.  I would prefer to see this type of authority in charge of it rather than the local authorities who, through no fault of their own, are often the greatest polluters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="556" /> I compliment the Minister on bringing this legislation before the House although I do not totally agree with it.  I am unhappy with this being a model for other harbours.  I would have preferred more time to tease out the sort of things I would like to see in this Bill.  I do not know if this Bill can be amended to include what I would like it to include.  There is a lot to be commended in the Bill but there is an awful lot more that I would like to see in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. D. Fitzpatrick Dr. D. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. D. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. Its gestation has taken a long time.  As far as I can recall, talks about the need for a coherent development of the Shannon Estuary have been going on since the end of the Second World War, or the early fifties.  The introduction of this Bill is very timely, taken in the context of developments in the European Community, and more so in the context of transport developments within the Community. On 1 January 1993 the internal free market of 320 million people will come into being.  The implications of this major development are of fundamental importance to Ireland.  With the opening of the channel tunnel in 1993 Ireland will be the only offshore island in the European Community, that is we will be without direct road or rail links with the rest of the Community.  In consequence Ireland will be totally dependent on port facilities in stark contrast with the rest of our Community partners.</P>
      <P>To put this development in its real context, Ireland's dependency on trade is exceeded in the Community only by the Benelux countries and those countries share land frontiers with other states in the Community.  Ireland is an exporting nation selling two-thirds of its national output abroad.  Seventy-five per cent of these exports go to states within the Community. The value of these exports grew from £3.9 billion in 1980 to £10.4 billion in 1987, almost a three fold increase resulting in the achievement of a trade surplus of £1.5 billion in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nation's trade depends on sea transport with the exception of a limited volume, less than 0.5 per cent, of high <Col N="557" /> value commodities which travel by air. Therefore efficient and cost effective links with the rest of the Community are essential for the economic development of the nation and for the prospects of increased employment for our people.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that this Bill is only the first in a series of Bills designed to put port development on a sound commercial and cost effective footing.  I ask the Minister, before he proceeds down this road, to consider setting up a national ports authority to exercise control and co-ordinate the activities of major airports and seaports in an effort to get the major facilities working for the greater national good.  Being an island nation we have got to develop for our own survival a coherent overseas transport policy. Without an adequate transport infrastructure we will find it harder and harder to maintain a standard of living for our people.</P>
    <P>Ireland is only about half the size of New York and New Jersey taken together.  These two states, whose gross national product either taken singly or together more than outstrips Ireland's, have one unified ports authority which not alone looks after the major seaports but also the airports.  They have evolved a coherent transport policy which takes all modes of transport into account.  We have a multiplicity of port authorities and there is a lack of co-ordination.  Aer Rianta look after the airports and the different harbour authorities, such as the Shannon Harbour Authority, the Cork Port Authority, Dublin Port and Docks Board, all look after their own small parochial interests with no regard for the greater national good.  Under this Bill we are setting up a Shannon port authority. On one side of the Shannon there is a major international airport which will act independently of and without reference to the running of the Shannon estuary port itself.</P>
    <P>In considering the future of our ports industry, and a major industry it is, another factor to be considered is that much of Irish industry, in fact much of industry worldwide, is now geared to a stock control concept of &ldquo;just in time&rdquo;, in <Col N="558" /> short JIT.  This means that products only arrive at the factory on the one hand and in the market place on the other as required, thereby saving immense costs in storage and warehousing.  What happens is that the unit of transport becomes the manufacturer's store and the freight operator must provide the service which fits the customers' timing requirements. In this way money is not tied up in holding large inventories on the manufacturer's or customer's premises.  These developments in the JIT concept both in Ireland and in Europe call for new legislation based on the commercial concept which enables the ports industry to give a cost effective and efficient service to the nation.  I regard this Harbours Bill as a step in this direction.  However it is only a first step.</P>
    <P>The <i>National Development Plan</i> envisages the development of the central and southern corridors to the UK and onwards by land bridge to Europe and direct services to the continent.  When we look at the Shannon we should be courageous and far seeing in our thinking. I hope the Government would look upon the whole island of Ireland as an <i>entreport</i> where goods can travel through from Europe to the United States or <i>vice versa</i> free of all taxes and with the minimum of bureaucratic hindrance.  I would regard the Shannon estuary as the axis on which this whole concept would turn. It is ideally placed to play a major role in this concept.  It is for instance a day's steaming nearer America than Rotterdam and I would see Shannon being developed as a key distribution centre for both England and Ireland for container traffic.  With the minimum of infrastructural development or dredging the Shannon could take 130,000 tonne container ships.  The Moneypoint jetty which at present is probably used less than 100 days a year is capable of unloading coal at the rate of 130,000 tonnes every four days or 2,500 tonnes per hour.  It can be safely taken that the capital investment in this jetty alone must have been in the region of between £10 million and £20 million.  It is a shame that this capital <Col N="559" /> intensive infrastructure should be lying idle for approximately 200 days a year.</P>
    <P>The development of adequate road and rail facilities onto Moneypoint pier and an adequate connection to Dublin and Rosslare now means that huge container ships could be unloaded quickly and the containers transferred expeditiously through these ports to south, central and northern England, I know this would require a degree of organisation and co-operation between management and unions but this is well within the scope of the stevedoring and port authority industry in the Limerick area.  If Ireland is to survive and give its population a high standard of living it has got to move into areas where we can perform as well as, if not better, than other people in the same line of business.  This is one area in which we can perform exceedingly well.</P>
    <P>We have to build on our national resources, the first and most important of which is the intelligence and adaptability of our people and their ability to work hard and efficiently.  The second is the Shannon, an estuary which could accommodate at one stage the British Atlantic fleet.  These two must be harnessed for the benefit not only of the people in the Shannon area but also for the rest of the people.  As I said previously, I think the answer to the development of our ports is a national ports authority who would take cognisance of our major ports around our coastline as well as our airports both east and west and north and south.  It is in this context that I would like to say a few words about the east coast, specifically the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>If the Shannon is the axis on which our Atlantic container traffic would turn Dublin would be the axis on which the east coast traffic to central and northern England and further on into northern Europe would turn.  Provision of adequate facilities on both ends of the corridor between Shannon and Dublin is essential.  In the present circumstances of financial rectitude and in looking for a pound's worth of value for every pound spent the provision of two terminals on <Col N="560" /> the east coast within seven to eight miles of each other is ludicrous.  Roll-on-roll off ferries must carry freight to be financially viable and the imposition of juggernauts on the beautiful and high amenity harbour and town of Dún Laoghaire is a backward step.  Dún Laoghaire is a harbour crying out for a marina.  With proper and careful development it can become the centre for seaport development on the east coast.  It does not need a ferry terminal that is going to get more and more choked with heavy through traffic. The sensible thing to do is to have a roll-on-roll off ferry centralised in Dublin port where there are adequate road and rail connections with the rest of the State.</P>
    <P>The sea crossing from Dublin to Holyhead takes almost the exact time as the crossing from Dún Laoghaire to Holyhead takes almost the exact time of the onwards to the channel tunnel are adequate.  The road facilities are being upgraded at a cost of approximately £500 million and should in the next two years be able to carry all the road traffic in comfort from Holyhead onwards.  Liver-pool is already well served with rail and road facilities and can accommodate any onward traffic from Ireland.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to reiterate both themes.  First, I welcome this Bill in the context of it being the first in a series of Bills aimed at the development of our port facilities and, secondly, I ask the Minister before he proceeds further to consider setting up a national ports authority to exercise control over airports and major shipping ports, to co-ordinate their activities and get them working for the greater national good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few brief remarks in relation to this legislation. I do so with a sense of frustration because this matter should have been resolved in the sixties, or at least in the seventies.  It is a sad indictment that we are dealing with it in the late eighties. This has been a potential resource in the Shannon estuarial area linking the counties of Kerry, Clare and Limerick, and perhaps some day a student will try to analyse the reasons for the failure to <Col N="561" /> develop this area into a properly coordinated and structured estuarial authority.</P>
      <P>The reasons for the failure are many; perhaps it is because of the multiplicity of local authorities involved or because of the narrow vested interests of the harbour authorities in question.  At any rate it is a sad indictment on us all &mdash; and those who have gone before us &mdash; that we have failed to organise this area into what is potentially one of the best harbours in Western Europe.  The facility is there and we, as a nation, have failed to exploit it.  It is a sad reflection on the public representatives of the areas in question down through the years and of those in management of the various harbour authorities.</P>
      <P>I cannot claim to go back as far as the Second World War like my colleague, Deputy Fitzpatrick, but from reading about the subject it is clear that many efforts have been made over the years to set the ball in motion to bring about some co-ordination.  In the sixties, there were various reports and attempts by the Shannon and regional development organisations to do something but nothing happened.  Our failure in this area has cost the nation dearly.  In recent years some development has taken place but, unfortunately, it has been in a totally unco-ordinated manner.  While we welcome individual projects I am greatly concerned at the lack of overall direction in relation to the requirements for the development of the area and that we have allowed developments to take place on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something like this Bill has had many airings over the years and there is not a great deal of difference between the parties in the House in relation to this matter.  Needless to say, the people of Kilrush have a different view from that of the people of Limerick and perhaps the people of Kerry have a different view from that of people in Foynes or other smaller harbours on the northern side of the estuary.  As long as we keep fighting development will not take place.  It is time for everybody to take a responsible <Col N="562" /> attitude to this Bill, to come together and to hammer out an agreement on the legislation.  The fact that legislation is necessary seems to be accepted by everybody although people have different views, perhaps because of their location in the House.  At any rate, that was the case in 1982 when a similar Bill was discussed and in 1986 and 1987.</P>
    <P>Looking through the contributions, very few points of substance seem to separate the various contributors to the debate and all at some stage of their political career seemed to accept that there is a need for some co-ordination development and structures to be put in place in relation to the development of the Shannon estuarial area.  The estuary is not the preserve of any one group, body or individual.  It should be shared, exploited and developed for commercial reasons for the benefit of the country as a whole and, more specifically, for the benefit of the surrounding counties and cities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Towns will be included in counties.  I do not know if this Bill is better or worse than previous legislation brought before this House.  The political exploitation of the area is second to none. Even in my time in Government, Ministers were trotted down to look at the Shannon and the waters there must have seen more Ministers gazing at it than any other strip of water in the country.  I often wondered what Ministers were saying to themselves as they looked across the Shannon Estuary.  They could hardly have said much more than &ldquo;I see Clare yonder&rdquo; or &mdash; from the other side &mdash;&ldquo;I see Kerry is still on the other side&rdquo;. Various Ministers and parties have at numerous times attempted to use the Shannon estuarial area for political purposes. My interest is somewhat peripheral. Kerry north has an interest in the Shannon Estuary and in its development, particularly in relation to the Ballylongford and Tarbet lands zoned for industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are very disappointed that nothing <Col N="563" /> has happened in the last ten to 15 years although there has been talk of oil refineries and smelters.  However, nothing has happened and I often wonder whether the reason for the failure is linked to the fact that we have not had a single estuarial authority in a position to market this area generally.  Questions have also been asked in relation to the location of the various projects in the area.  I often wonder why we built a coal burning energy station on the west coast. Obviously, the depth of the water was an attraction but, as the wind blew the fumes across the rest of the country, was it a political decision or did the ESB have clear authority in relation to siting the Moneypoint station?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me address specific concerns I have in relation to this legislation which I hope the Minister will examine on Committee Stage.  I will be tabling a number of amendments which I hope the Minister will consider.  Concerns have been voiced, particularly in the Limerick area, in regard to the matter.  I am puzzled regarding the attitude of Foynes because if they are asked to come in they seem to want to stay out, and if they are asked to stay out, they seem to want to come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have thought that the question of the location of the Authority is a matter for the Authority themselves. They might be located in Limerick or Foynes, I could suggest that they should be located in Tarbert and I am sure Deputies from Clare would suggest a location in that county.  Does it really matter at the end of the day?  We must get these people working and functioning on behalf of the estuary and I should like to feel that when they apply themselves to their function, they will sell the estuary <Col N="564" /> as a whole and that their decisions will not be based on petty considerations.  As we have seen from the coal burning stations in Moneypoint and Aughinish, the benefits spread to the whole estuarial authority region.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that Alcan is 30 or 40 miles from Limerick, Limerick city has benefited enormously.  Likewise, despite the fact that Moneypoint is across the estuary from north Kerry and west Limerick, the facility of the ferry at Tarbert linked to Kilimer makes it possible for people to live on one side and work on the other.  There are concerns in relation to the structuring of the boards of this company and the Minister may have to look at that question.  I do not have any objection to the appointment of small boards but the Minister will have to consider establishing sub-board structures to cater for industrial relations and local interests.  He will have to find some way to enable them to make a contribution to the development of the estuary.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the decision to give the Authority responsibility for the entire estuary has been well thought out particularly when one considers the need for amenity facilities, mariculture development and so on.  The Minister should elaborate on that decision.  The estuary holds out considerable prospects for development as an amenity area and for mariculture and I do not see any reason why all projects cannot be developed in tandem.  There is no reason we cannot have major industrial projects in operation alongside smaller projects such as sailing, the development of marinas and so on.  Such developments have taken place in other parts of the world.  I do not think that the increase in shipping in the estuary will endanger other projects.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the grave concern that has been expressed by staff of the Limerick Harbour Authority about their future position.  Those people have given many years' service to the Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  The Minister will have to listen to their views and cater for their pension and salary entitlements.  I do not accept the argument that has been put forward that those <Col N="565" /> matters cannot be dealt with.  They can be dealt with satisfactorily by the new Authority.  I say that as a person who represents workers and is concerned about the protection and preservation of status in jobs and the pensions of workers.  It should not be beyond the ability of the Department to ensure that workers who may have to transfer to a new location will not be any worse off than they are at present.  The Minister, if he established a sub-board structure, would be able to ensure that all technical matters are dealt with methodically.  I have no doubt that if that is done it will receive general agreement.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the chain of authority of the new harbour authority. The harbourmasters have authority within their areas but if there is to be a harbourmaster for the entire estuary, I do not see any point in having three or four people with the same status.  Some person will have to accept overall responsibility at the end of the day.  That is another technical matter which the Minister should be in a position to sort out during the course of the Committee Stage debate.  It is surprising that it has not been possible to get agreement in regard to the estuary in the last 20 years. We do not know if the Bill will pass all stages although it looks possible, unlike other ill-fated measures.</P>
    <P>However, in the interests of the region it is about time we forgot about political posturing and got together in a committee of the House to deal with the provisions of the Bill.  Such committees worked very successfully in the last few years.  I can recall a divergence of opinion energing during the course of the Second Stage debate of a Bill and that at a Special Committee, the Minister for Justice, and the Fine Gael spokesman reached agreement in regard to its provisions.  It should be possible to do something similar in regard to this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is fundamentally important that we use our knowledge and political skills to launch an estuarial authority that will receive general agreement.  We cannot hope for 100 per cent agreement but we should try to get consensus.  It appears <Col N="566" /> that the Government, and the one time main Opposition party, are heading for a collision on the Bill and that is regrettable. We have been sent here to represent our constituencies and to try to do something for the development of our areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider sending the Bill to a Committee of the House so that we will not have political bickering at local and national level that has taken place in the last 20 years.  It was because of that bickering that legislation like this has been on the merry-go-round, over fences and back again.  We have had <i>ad hoc</i> and mish-mash development in the Shannon estuary as a result.  The resource is too valuable for us to continue in this way.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to table amendments on Committee Stage in an effort to get clarification from the Minister on a number of issues.  I should like to ask the Minister to consider sending the Bill to a Special Committee and discuss the matter with the Whips.  At the end of the day we are charged with rectifying the mistakes made in the last 20 years.  We have an opportunity to do that now and we should produce a Bill that will augur well for the development of the Shannon estuary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss harbour development throughout the country.  In the course of his introduction the Minister made it clear that he was anxious that there should be a general debate on developments of ports and harbours.  A number of Members availed of the opportunity to deal with the position throughout the country rather than concentrating on the Shannon estuary. I was interested to note from Deputy Carey's contribution that there is a harbour at Clarecastle in the Minister's constituency but I am surprised it has not been included in the Bill.  That was a serious omission.  Deputy Carey has informed us that he was the harbourmaster. He has the right credentials for such a position in a nautical sense being like a person who is well fed on rum and all things nice that come from <Col N="567" /> the sea.  The Minister should have included the harbour in his constituency that is under the control of a Member of the House.  According to statistics 35 members are teachers, 25 are farmers, 13 are publicans and six are undertakers, but this is the first time I have heard of a Member being a harbourmaster.</P>

      <P>It is important to have a general debate on harbour development but it is a pity it is not being taken in conjunction with the amending of the Harbours Act, 1946, which is very discriminatory.  It selects 12 locations in the State for preferential treatment as far as State aid is concerned and excludes dozens of other locations from any type of assistance other than what they can obtain from local authorities.  That is unhealthy bearing in mind that local authorities have been drained of finance.  Our harbours are not simply involved in commercial activity.  Many of them would be self-sustaining commercially if they were brought up to a proper standard.  They also have massive potential from a tourism point of view and I believe the Minister for the Marine, in conjunction with the Minister for Tourism and Transport, should consider this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have many legacies from the time of the British occupation of this country, some of which are not very nice.  Some of them are divisive or ugly, and those are the ruins we tend to remember, but one of the better legacies we inherited from that occupation was a splendid network of harbours.  In conjunction with Britannia ruling the waves, the British <Col N="568" /> also built fantastic harbours but during our 67 years of self-rule we have been busy overseeing the collapse of most of these harbours into the sea rather than maintaining and using them beneficially. Most of the harbours have been totally neglected.  This is a disgrace.  Anybody who does a tour of part of the coast will see within the space of 100 miles dozens of brilliantly constructed harbours made of solid stone.  Even taking all the important factors into account, for example, weather, location and shelter, it is a pity that we have neglected these harbours.  I regret that this Bill is not much more extensive and ambitious.  We need an ambitious, innovative type of mind to oversee the maintenance and reconstruction of these harbours not just from a commercial point of view but from a tourism point of view also.</P>
    <P>Nowadays it is a bit of a cliche to hear the chairman of Bord Fáilte and the Minister talking about the need for special interest sports and leisure activities. Water sports and allied activities have great potential from a tourism point of view but if we want to utilise the water resource around this island we have got to have access to it and provide facilities where boats can be moored and kept in safety during storms.  However, instead of doing that we have gone in the other direction.  I should like the Minister, to use a nautical expression, to take on board the points I have made here today. He should broaden the coverage of the 1946 Act so that people in towns like Dungarvan, Youghal and Kinsale, to name some of the larger ones on the south coast, will have an opportunity of getting involved in commercial activities, as well as tourism activities, on a very large scale.  Boat sailing, yachting and motor cruising have become tremendously popular in recent years.  Twenty-five years ago one would not have seen a decent yacht in most harbours in this country, perhaps there would have been a few boats without outboard engines, but even though that whole scene has been transformed we are not in a position to capitalise on it.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is concerned about <Col N="569" /> the construction of marinas, and he is to be congratulated on this.  This is a very positive step in the type of development which is necessary.  I understand there are plans for the construction of seven marinas around the coast.  That is the type of activity we should be promoting. I cannot think of anything which would be more conducive to the development of the tourism industry.  It is real development, not just pie in the sky, which will be productive.  I should like to see an increase in that type of activity.  I get annoyed at times when I hear all the squabbling about the location of marinas for Dún Laoghaire and other places.  This squabbling is churlish and childish.  What we should be doing is getting on with such development.  I am often blamed for being a bit rough in what I say but I believe we are a nation of begrudgers. The biggest problem in regard to development in this country is that if somebody thinks you are going to make money and get on they will put a spoke in your wheel, as they say.  It is a bloody minded attitude and a curse of our society.  It is a pity that these developments cannot go ahead.  If planning permission has been given and the development is of a regular nature, it should go ahead.  We seem to object to everything, whether it is a factory or a marina.  This attitude of mind can be frightening at times.</P>
    <P>In the early seventies we had legislation relating to harbours which was useful and allowed for the development of four major fishing ports, at Killybegs, Castletownbere, Dunmore East and Howth. Those four developments have been completed for some years &mdash; I think Howth was the last development to be completed &mdash; and have been of tremendous advantage to the fishing industry.  For instance, Killybegs could hardly have been developed to its present state without such an ambitious programme.  I might say that Castletownbere never really realised its full potential but it is getting there even if only in fits and starts.  Dunmore East has a problem because of seasonality. When the development was <Col N="570" /> mooted in Dunmore East the herring catches there were enormous but by the time the development was finished the herring catches were quite small and restricted due to quotas.  The development at Howth is most exciting because not alone is a massive area devoted to fishing boats &mdash; they are not boats any longer but ships &mdash; but there is also the type of development I referred to earlier, a marina.  This must be of colossal advantage to the people of Howth and surrounding areas.  It is a magnificient venture and illustrates what can be done within the boundaries of the type of harbours I referred to which were originally built by the British but which we have allowed to fall into the sea in most cases.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to look at that overall aspect in regard to harbours, whether it is a harbour 20 yards long, 200 yards long or 500 yards in a semi-circle. As I have said, 90 per cent of our harbours are not even maintained to a decent standard but if we had a national policy in this area there is an awful lot we could do.  Even if we oppose the Bill at the end of the day one of the good points of this debate is that it allows us to exchange views on matters like this.</P>
    <P>I would advocate that, like the strategy for the four fishing harbours in the late sixties or early seventies, we should have a national ports strategy for the larger industrialised commercial harbours, one of which should be Shannon.  If we look at a map of Ireland it is easy to see where the opportunities and potential for major harbour developments lie.  As some Members of the House know, a series of proposals have been submitted to the European Community for the development of some of our major harbours, principally at Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick.  If we had a national ports strategy which governed the development of those four harbours alone we would be going a long way towards achieving an admirable objective.</P>
    <P>I am not saying we should omit smaller harbours, I would be contradicting myself if I so advocated because of the fact that I said we should repeal the 1946 Act.  At least we should have a two-tiered, if not <Col N="571" /> a three-tiered system under which we develop four major industrialised harbours &mdash; those I have mentioned &mdash; and at a lower level develop perhaps 50 or 60 harbours, giving assistance to a third category of very small harbours or inlets, whether it be Clarecastle or wherever. Let us not just take a shot in the dark and say we will do a bit here this year, stop Drogheda from falling into the sea next year, or whatever.  I know Drogheda was threatened in that fashion about four years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Very recently we prevented that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Another simple activity that might be undertaken with regard to harbours under the aegis of the Department of the Marine is that of dredging. The dozens, or hundreds, of harbours along the coast I have mentioned are useless because what should be berthage or mooring space is just a big bank of mud or silt.  One now has to depend on local authorities to get anything done and they do not have the necessary finance. A much more ordered system would be to have the Department of the Marine not just responsible for harbours, all harbours, but also to have the machinery with which they could actually operate those harbours.</P>
      <P>For instance, why do the Department of the Marine not have two or three dredgers around the coast at strategic points and systematically dredge each of these bays or harbours where there are the fortification, stonework and mooring facilities?  It would be a &ldquo;do it yourself&rdquo; system because, at present, the whole operation is hit-and-miss with some harbour being dredged perhaps once every 25 or 30 years.  Some harbour may be dredged and then allowed to silt up again for the next 25 or 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole operation is considerably disorganised.  The Department of the Marine should operate the overall system from A to Z and not shift part of their responsibility to local authorities or, worse still, to the Office of Public Works <Col N="572" /> which is a guarantee that nothing will ever be done.  Had the local authorities the money they would take a stab at undertaking the work but, if one leaves it to the Office of Public Works, that merely constitutes an excuse to have the operation postponed forever.  The Minister might consider that type of co-ordinated approach.  Let us have a national strategy on all harbours large, medium and small.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to an undesirable activity which has been raised in the House by way of question and also in the Seanad by way of the Adjournment Matter.  The Minister is well aware of the considerable power being wielded by an independent group of shipping companies. Power of that kind can destroy commercial activity in any or several harbours. I refer specifically to the North Atlantic Shipping Conference, a group of major shipping companies who dictate where they will collect and deliver cargo. It is incredible that an association of private companies can have power which supersedes that of a national Government or indeed the European Economic Community.  I would not have believed it possible had it not been brought to my notice so starkly.</P>
    <P>How can any group of private individuals decide what should be national or Community policy?  It is frightening that such powers should lie in the hands of a couple of companies or individuals, such as the P &amp; O Line, which I believe is one of the major components of that North Atlantic Shipping Conference.  In recent times they have had the audacity to advocate that Waterford port be omitted from their list of base ports, in other words, a port from which they collect or deliver cargo.  This should not be allowed happen. Our last Commissioner in Europe, Mr. Peter Sutherland, was Commissioner for Competition and did an excellent job when it came to any form of malpractice where competition was concerned.  As a result of his efforts and ingenuity, for instance, air fares to and from this country have been reduced by at least half.  Surely the present Commissioner for Competition &mdash; I do not know who <Col N="573" /> he is &mdash; should see to it that any activity that jeopardises the commercial viability of a port or interferes with the sovereign right of a State is prohibited; he should ensure that such people are brought into line.  There should not be any question of private companies dictating policy to countries or the Community in its entirety.</P>
    <P>In Waterford we have put forward a plan to the Community which entails the spending of £27 million on the development of a new facility about three or four miles downstream from the present harbour, which would enable that harbour to take in huge ships, obviously because of the deeper water and better berthing facilities there.  The whole concept of this plan is being undermined by the fact that cargo will not be collected or delivered by this shipping cartel.  I do know that the Minister is concerned about the matter.  I did raise the point the last day at Question Time.  Of course, time is restricted at Question Time and I did not receive a very clear answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely I am entitled to talk about national ports strategy.  I was making the point that a massive development, which is most desirable and which fits into what should be our national strategy, is being jeopardised by undesirable and unsavoury activities on the part of a <Col N="574" /> monopoly on the North Atlantic shipping routes.  All one has to do is look at the map of Europe or the North Atlantic and one will see what should be the obvious ports of call here; basically they are the Shannon Estuary, Cork, Waterford and Dublin.  Anything else would be totally unfair.  I want to see that system retained, with those ports receiving the type of moneys we are seeking from the EC and I want to see that nobody undermines that type of investment by intemperate decisions.</P>
      <P>For instance, the type of development in Waterford would well fit into any future plans for oil and gas exploration in the Celtic Sea.  Again, if one looks at a map of the southern coast one will see that at present Cork has the monopoly when it comes to servicing oil or gas rigs in the Celtic Sea.  It is undesirable to have one centre for any such activity in case of industrial disputes, a catastrophe or otherwise.  It would be far better had we at least two such centres.  Foynes and Galway do admirably for the west coast. However, in view of recent statements on the part of companies like Aran Energy who intend drilling for oil, in particular &mdash; which was the essence of their statement last week &mdash; I am advocating off the Waterford and Wexford coast a major deep water facility.  The obvious choice is Waterford Harbour. The development being sought there, with the aid of Structural Funds from Europe, would be ideally suited to that type of activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as the four main ports which I have mentioned from an industrial and commercial point of view, we have two other ports which in the old days used to be called terminals for packet steamers &mdash; which is an expression which is gone out of vogue for about 100 years.  They are Dún Laoghaire on the east coast and Rosslare Harbour on the south-east coast.  They are entitled to a certain form of development also.  We have the four major fishing ports, the four major commercial ports, the two major passenger terminals, and there is another exceptional type of port in Foynes which is within the ambit of the Bill and is in the <Col N="575" /> Shannon estuary.  Foynes has a particularly advantageous deep water facility. It is highly suitable for bulk cargo and it has considerable potential.  It is unique. It has that qualification to be listed as something special.</P>
    <P>The whole idea of port development in this country regarding the four major ports is becoming even more important with the advent of 1992 because at the same time we will have the opening of the Channel Tunnel which will link up the south-east of England with the north coast of France.  That means that we will be the only country in the EC which has not got direct road or rail access to other parts of the community.  Our industrialists and our exporters will be at a considerable disadvantage if they have to use &mdash; which they do &mdash; shipping facilities when importing or exporting goods unless they have first-class port facilities. We should be close to our competitors in Europe and the least we can do is to have good port facilities.</P>
    <P>It is pie in the sky at this stage to be talking about a tunnel between Larne and Stranraer or between Rosslare and Fishguard or between Dún Laoghaire and Holyhead.  That is not a practical proposition in the 20th century &mdash; perhaps it will be in the 21st century.  Naturally we will be at a considerable disadvantage with our competitors in the EC.  The Greeks might point out that they have many islands and that much of Greece is made up of islands.  Greece is reckoned to have 365 islands, one for every day of the year, as in the case of the number of cheeses in France.  Most of those islands are not operating on a commercial basis, their viability depends on the tourist trade.  Their problems are not comparable with ours.  We will have real problems with the advent of the Channel Tunnel because we will be left out on a limb.  Perhaps the Minister would take up some of the points I have stressed and consider a national strategy for all harbours in Ireland, great and small &mdash; in the words of the famous television programme &mdash; and not just those in his <Col N="576" /> own constituency or the very large ones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, as Deputy Deasy said, I would like to congratulate the Minister on his plans for the marinas. I can see those as a tremendous boost to our holiday and tourist trade and especially in the Shannon, a waterway that is not exploited to the full.  The Shannon is the most open waterway in western Europe that is not fully exploited.  I sincerely compliment the Minister in what he has done to put a marina or two on that waterway because everybody from the mount of the Shannon to Limerick city will benefit by that great incentive.</P>
      <P>For some reason the Bill before us today is called the Harbours (Shannon Estuary Development Corporation) Bill, 1988.  With such a title one would imagine that the Bill aims to deal with the harbours and other developments in the Shannon estuary area but this is not the case.  The Shannon estuary area is one of the most important areas in the whole country.  Unfortunately, like so many other areas, it has never been properly developed or planned although the authorities and agencies have done a considerable amount of excellent work. There is a real need for some authority to be set up to properly manage and develop the whole area but this Bill is not the way to do it.</P>
      <P>There are some problems, in particular, which I would wish to look at. The Bill does not really deal with the management and development of the Shannon estuary.  The most important assets of the estuary are the harbours, Limerick, Foynes and Kilrush, but these are the last areas which the Bill mentions. The Explanatory Memorandum shows the Government's priorities very clearly. It lists everything it hopes the corporation will do, and the last thing referred to is managing and developing the existing harbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By its own definition the corporation aims must be to promote and look after investment in industrial, tourist and recreational amenity facilities and activities which will contribute to the realisation <Col N="577" /> of the marine potential of the Shannon estuary.  Why do we need another authority to deal with these issues?  What are the IDA, SFADCo, Bord Fáilte and all the other local authorities who are now looking after these areas going to do? Why is there a need for another body to do the same thing?  The only thing this Bill can be assured of doing is adding to the bureaucratic mess which is already all over the mid-west and further complicate the entire issue.  Even while this Bill is being debated we have seen some of the confusion that will arise with all these agencies and all this bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>There were advertisements in the newspapers a few weeks ago which announced that SFADCo are carrying out a survey for a report on the development of the estuary.  This Bill will deal with one of the most important aspects of any development, so what is the point in SFADCo carrying out a survey?  Why are we having the Bill now before that survey is finished?</P>
    <P>Governments of this country seem to think that the answer to every problem is to set up an agency to look after the area or a committee to examine the situation. Large committees were set up by various Ministers in various Governments, and it now appears that there will be 21 agencies to look after Government policies in the mid-west region.  This is wasteful and inefficient.  What is needed is careful planning to decide which body should look after which area and which function. Instead of doing that the Bill shoves an extra agency into the area.  There are some other peculiar things as well: for example, what is going to happen to the piers which have been left out of the provisions of this Bill?  This Bill pretends to unify the whole area but it leaves out areas which have always been included in previous attempts to do this.  The Bill instructs the corporation on where to set up their head office.  Surely, the corporation should be able to decide where would be the best place for their headquarters. What will happen to the workers who will be affected by these changes?  The people who work for the Limerick Harbour Commissioners and <Col N="578" /> the pilots on the estuary do not seem to have been consulted about these changes and no special provisions seem to have been made for them.  The Government have had this Bill on their shelves for about a year and they have done nothing with it until now.  I thought the reason was that there were so many objections to it.  It is a rare occasion when groups who do not agree with each other on most issues agree that something is wrong, as has happened with this Bill.  Almost everybody objects to it for one reason or another.</P>
    <P>There is a need for the establishment of one estuarial authority to make the most out of the Shannon estuary.  That is the only way to get the full benefit from the marvellous facilities which are available in this waterway.  It would be wrong to pretend to be satisfied with a Bill which just is not good enough.  It is not the answer.  It does not properly address the real issue, which is the issue of what is the best way to organise the estuary, paying particular attention to unifying the managements in control of the harbours.  This legislation will add only extra confusion and more inefficiency.  The Government should be sitting down and working out a proper strategy for the mid-west region and for all the agencies there, instead of just rushing in and adding another authority.</P>

      <P>Certainly, today's debate has lifted the kind of depression present in the statements we have had here on the last occasion with reference to this subject.  I take this opportunity, first, to thank the Deputies for their interesting and useful contributions.  Especially, I thank the Deputies who spoke today and seem far more constructive in their approach than some of the speakers, especially the spokesperson for the Fine Gael benches on the last occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want in a general way to refer to some of the issues raised and specifically to deal with some of the points mentioned in the course of the contributions since the Bill came before the House.  As I said, when presenting the Bill to the House, I am <Col N="579" /> convinced that the establishment of the Shannon Estuary Development Corporation is the best way to manage the commercial harbours of the estuary and promote, co-ordinate and develop investment in the estuary.  While there has been much comment about aspects of the legislation in particular sections of the Bill, I do not believe that anybody here has made any constructive comment in opposition to the overall objective of an estuarial authority as such.</P>
    <P>All during last year Deputy Taylor-Quinn's predecessor as spokesperson for marine affairs questioned us here almost every day as to when a Bill of this nature would come before the House and subsequently put her own Bill on the Order Paper for the setting up of an estuarial authority.  For some peculiar reasons&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the difference between an estuarial authority and a development corporation.  I am talking about a development corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the last few months there has been a change from something which the main Opposition party had advocated and had campaigned for.  They had brought in their own legislation to deal with the situation and made numerous contributions both inside and outside the House about the necessity to establish an estuarial development corporation to get on with the development of the estuary. We now find that, for their own peculiar reasons which I know quite well and will go into if the Deputy pushes me too far, they have taken a totally negative view.  I am surprised, to say the least, that the Deputy is behaving in that fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estuary is an area of vast potential and the existence of the corporation will play a key role in attracting investment to realise the potential.  As I emphasised in my opening speech on Second Stage, it is one of the finest natural deep water harbours in Europe, with great potential for heavy industry.  Many of the Opposition Deputies place enormous emphasis on the priority, as they saw it, to be given to the functions of the corporation.  Let <Col N="580" /> me clearly state here that the principal function of the corporation will be to manage, maintain, operate and develop the harbours under their control and to get away from the parochialism we have seen, which has hampered development. The object is to think, not in terms of Kilrush, Limerick or Foynes, but of the estuary as a unit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should check the position since 1987.  He should look back on the record and see his previous contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything I said in 1987 &mdash; and the record is here &mdash; coincides totally and exactly with my comments here today and with my comments on other previous occasions.  They are totally consistent. Regrettably, I cannot say that for Deputy Taylor-Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is doing a full U-turn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>She says one thing to Clare County Council and something totally opposite in this House because of pressures that are on her.  I know where these are coming down.  They are not of her own making and they certainly did not come from Clare.  I know precisely where the needling is coming from; it is creating enormous problems.  The Deputy should put those pressures aside in the national interests and the interests of the development of the estuary and let us get on with the work we want to do down there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is designed to enable the new corporation to exploit, in conjunction with Shannon Free Airport Development Company, and put to use the very real potentials for, among other things, heavy industry but also for tourism within this area and to exploit all the areas of potential without detracting in any way from their primary role as a harbour authority. Let me refer to the comments made a few moments ago by Deputy Deasy.  He is arguing precisely what I am saying here. In the way harbours are developing, not only towards Europe but internationally, we cannot divorce the responsibilities of <Col N="581" /> the harbour authorities from some very important commercial activities such as the development of marine and recreational facilities.  I totally agree with what Deputy Deasy said in relation to the development of water sports.  The legislation we have before the House would be seriously deficient if it did not cater for and provide for the future undertaking of maritime recreational leisure facilities development on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>There is a huge development taking place across the Continent now.  I have had the opportunity, as a member of the Council of Ministers in the European Community to visit, with the Germans, Italians, Dutch and others, some of the major commercial marina and leisure facilities which are now developing rapidly. The Italians who for generations, centuries even, have been involved in the development of a commercial maritime business and traffic&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The gondolieri must have gone to the Minister's head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;have already taken measures to streamline their own legislation which, as did ours, dated back to the eighteen hundreds.  Very recently, the Italian Government introduced legislation to enable ports to be developed, not only for commercial benefit but also in a touristic sense.  They have already identified a number of ports which will be totally developed for tourism purposes and which will be known as touristic ports.  They also recognise that this is a very valuable commercial activity which is developing very rapidly.  It would be a serious fault on our part, in introducing new legislation like this at this time, in view of those developments all around us, especially in the Community, if we were to leave the corporation seriously deficient in their powers and functions to deal with the developments taking place in the whole maritime leisure area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition Deputies who spoke on the Bill are not aware that under existing harbours legislation any pier or slip-way constructed in the proposed <Col N="582" /> corporation's jurisdiction area will be under the control of the corporation, subject to by-laws, rates, orders and other regulations administered by them.  In this situation, it is imperative that the corporation work closely with the other agencies in the area, to ensure that any new investments proposed in the region, which impinge on the corporation's area and any other area of which they are aware, would be subject to these obligations.</P>
    <P>The point was made by numerous Deputies that we were duplicating the responsibilities of two agencies.  We have taken very special care to provide in the legislation that the other major development agency in the region, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, will have direct representation on the board of the new corporation.  I was surprised to hear the comments of Deputy O'Malley in particular who knows the area better than any other Deputy in this House and who attempted for ten or 15 years as a public representative in the mid-west region to establish an estuarial development corporation. He had numerous meetings and held numerous private consultations with politicians and harbour authorities in the region for nine or ten years with a consistent policy in his own area of establishing an overall estuarial authority. Now he is criticising here, for mean, petty purposes, the establishment of an estuarial authority.  He campaigned vigorously for it.  He called people in and bullied them into joining.  He made every effort to get the Authority established for years and years, and he failed miserably. I can say exactly why.  He ran away from the unpopular local decision-making required to establish this Authority.  For nine or ten years he spoke about it, he called people in, he tried to bully them into doing something about it, but when he was in a position to do something about it he ran away from it.</P>
    <P>He criticised the new Authority we are proposing here on the basis that there would be duplication between the Authority and SFADCo.  What did he do when <Col N="583" /> he was Minister for Industry and Commerce as regards SFADCo?  He brought the IDA into the region by his own decision.  He spoke here in this Dáil and moved legislation to establish the IDA alongside SFADCo and he justified it. We all know that at that time he probably had intended abolishing SFADCo but again, because of local political problems and other considerations, he ran away from that decision as well.  My view is that while initially he had intended having the IDA established in the mid-west region and abolishing SFADCo, when the time came to face the hard political realities and to make decisions, he ran away from that as well.</P>
    <P>He complains now that there will be some minor duplication in the overall marina leisure and recreational facilities between the new development corporation and SFADCo, while in his own time as Minister for Industry and Commerce he set up the IDA and put them right into that region with SFADCo, and we had to take them out again some time ago in an attempt to get some semblance of realism into the situation and not have the type of duplication we saw as a result of decisions Deputy O'Malley took when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>We decided last year to take the IDA out of the region and to give overall responsibility there to SFADCo for the development of large and small industry. We took out the Shannonside Tourism Development Organisation and Bord Fáilte and gave the whole responsibility to one agency, SFADCo, for the overall development of large industry, small industry, county development and tourism development, because of the difficulties that had arisen with duplication, overlapping and waste of human and financial resources there resulting directly from decisions Deputy O'Malley took when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Now he has the audacity to come in here sniping about this new Authority and the fact that there may be some confusion between the names or something <Col N="584" /> like that.  I never heard such rubbish. I would have thought we could expect something more constructive from the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, the mould makers who were going to transform the whole political system as well as the economic system, and already we see them running away from important decisions like this because of local, petty, political problems.  We saw it in the Barrington's Hospital issue and we see it in this issue now.</P>
    <P>The unified estuarial Authority Deputy O'Malley campaigned for year after year when he was in Government and outside it and ran away from when he could do something about it, is now before the House and he keeps running away from it because he is afraid to face up to the little political problems in different areas. He is prepared to take more serious note of them than the overall development of the mid-west region through development of the estuary.</P>
    <P>Every development agency in that region have advocated the establishment of an estuarial authority.  Comments have been made here about the fact that there may be some overlapping between the Shannon Estuary Development Corporation and SFADCo.  The chairman of SFADCo only a few weeks ago made a very strong statement about the necessity for putting in place a body like the one we are proposing in this legislation.  The present general manager of SFADCo has spoken out on numerous of occasions about the necessity for an estuarial authority of the type we are speaking about here.  The previous chairman and previous general manager of SFADCo, everyone in the company and every report that has ever been written about the necessity to develop the Shannon region, have come down firmly on the side of this as one of the major priorities.  The previous chairman and managing director of SFADCo have spoken about the necessity of putting in place an overall development company which will plan the estuary as a unit and get away from the piecemeal approach which has hampered development and inhibited the prospect of attracting large industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> In neglected areas like north Kerry that Deputy Spring spoke about and along the whole Clare coastline an overall Authority developing the estuary as a unit would have brought about a transformation. How long more are we going to delay doing that?  How long more will we keep running away because of minor political problems in local areas and parochial differences nobody has the courage to tackle?</P>
    <P>I said when I was appointed Minister for the Marine, and I make no apologies for saying it, that if, by knocking some heads together in the region, where after 25 or 30 years of dialogue, discussion and communication we have achieved nothing, we could get an overall estuarial authority in place to undertake the work that has been neglected, I was prepared to take such unpopular decisions.  I support fully the views Deputy Spring expressed here this morning, that it must be within our capacity in the House on Committee Stage and later, keeping in mind the overall principle we all agree with, to hammer out a Bill which will meet what our requirements and get on with the objective we have set down in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Spring that it should be possible to come up with a consensus which will give us the Bill we all desire.  He said, rightly, we will never satisfy everybody and that sniping will come from some areas, but the overall objective we have set in this legislation is to put in place an estuarial authority to plan, manage, develop and exploit the potential of, an enormous natural resource which for 100 years has been relatively dormant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor-Quinn and Deputy McCoy expressed fears that commercial port users' money might be used in other areas and some way be wasted.  The Bill clearly guards against this.  I refer the Deputies to the section that provides that the corporation shall not incur expenditure, including borrowings in these areas, without satisfying themselves that the investment they are becoming involved in is capable of achieving an acceptable rate of return, and they must <Col N="586" /> get the prior approval of both myself and the Minister for Finance where certain borrowings are involved.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that most of the investment in marine-related industrial tourism, recreational and amenity facilities, will be of a private nature possibly supplemented by funding from the EC and the Exchequer.  Already there have been an enormous number of inquiries from companies, organisations, bodies and individuals who have expressed an interest in investing money in the overall development of the estuary and particularly tourism-related projects.  I was surprised when an individual who was involved in a small commercial business in Kilrush said he would be in a position to put together a package of £1 million to invest in the marina leisure complex which is being planned by SFADCo in the Kilrush area.  This gives an indication of the willingness of people in the commercial area, if we provide them with the necessary framework, to invest substantially in projects which will have an enormously beneficial impact on the economy of that area.  The Kilrush marina project has been supported already by the European Community prior to structural funding and has received a Regional Fund allocation for the first stage amounting to £1.8 million. The Community will equally play their part in backing up financial investment by companies and individuals.  The total investment of £9 million will be used not only to develop facilities in Kilrush, which will be the centre of maritime leisure and recreational facilities in the lower Shannon area, but will also link in places like Saleen and Ballylongford, Tarbert, Glin and other areas.</P>

      <P>The lower Shannon from Loop Head to Limerick city is probably one of the richest coarse fisheries from the point of view of angling tourism anywhere in the world.  There is not a single commercial boat on the Clare side from Loop Head to Limerick city to exploit that opportunity for sea fishing; there may be one or two boats on the Limerick side.  About 40,000 coarse anglers come to Ireland each year.  We could quite easily accommodate and facilitate that number in the lower Shannon region alone.  Somebody must provide the mechanism to trigger off this kind of development. It would totally transform the tourism industry and the economy of the area on a year-round basis.  It would not be tied to seasonal considerations.</P>
      <P>There is no authority or agency in the Shannon area with the jurisdictional authority to do this.  One of the challenges facing the new body will be to reconcile the competing demands of the commercial sector on the one hand and the leisure and recreational interests on the other, as well as the aqua-culture and mari-cultural interests.  In bringing in this legislation are we to deny the new Authority the opportunity to become involved in that type of activity on a commercial basis?  If we allow this Bill to go through without this provision it will be seriously defective and will limit the prospect of further economic development, enhancement of the locality and exploitation of the resources there which have been dormant and under-exploited for over 100 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies mentioned the need for a ports policy, especially in view of the Single European Act and the considerations that will arise with the completion of the Channel Tunnel.  When one considers that over 80 per cent of our external trade goes through our ports, it is clear that the development of these ports is vital if we are to compete successfully in the Single European Market. Irish ports must make up for competitive disadvantages by investment in modern handling equipment.  This will ensure that <Col N="588" /> our ports provide an efficient, cost-effective service with the capacity to turn vessels around in a matter of hours.</P>
    <P>Between now and 1992 the objective of the Government is to ensure that port facilities are upgraded on a regional and strategic basis with particular emphasis, as indicated in the <i>National Development Plan</i>, on ports like Dublin, Waterford, Rosslare, Cork and the Shannon estuary. Bulk facilities must be provided.  The estuary we are speaking about must be developed as one of Europe's finest natural deep water ports in a position to compete with the very best for heavy industry.  The prospects for trans-shipment can be more fully expolited.</P>
    <P>The deep water jetty at Moneypoint, built with taxpayers' money, cost in excess of £100 million.  It is the finest deep water jetty in any European port but less than 20 per cent of its capacity is being utilised.  This is an opportunity to utilise that facility fully.  The estuarial Authority, working with the ESB and other agencies in the region, can transform that jetty into a hive of activity, involved in the trans-shipment of various commodities which can greatly enhance our economic performance and provide long-term sustainable jobs in the region.  It could handle some of our coal requirements, animal feedstuffs and fertilisers and greatly reduce the price of these commodities to the consumer.  The impact on the economy as a whole, and specifically on that region, would be enormously beneficial.</P>
    <P>I was interested in some of the comments made by Deputy McCartan in relation to the Shannon area.  He seemed to centre his main objection on the grounds that we are giving special recognition to Foynes.  I would refer to comments made by the former Deputy Prendergast in 1986 when he said that Foynes should be the central location for the development of a deep water estuarial authority.  Deputy Prendergast was not only a Member of this House representing Limerick but was also a member of the Limerick Port and Docks Board for many years.  It is well known that he was a representative of the unions and <Col N="589" /> the workers, and still is.  He said the whole centre of gravity in the Shannon area was Foynes, not in Limerick city. The reason we are putting the headquarters of the new Authority in Foynes is our recognition that Foynes is the centre of deep water activity in the lower Shannon.</P>

The fact that Foynes will now have special representation on the board of the new Authority is in recognition of the special position of Foynes and their success in developing their own facilities.</P>

      <P>I would like to put on record what the factual position is in Kilrush.  I attended a full meeting of the Kilrush Urban District Council with the Bill, which I had previously circulated to each member, including the county manager and the officials of the urban council.

The comments to which Deputy Madeline Taylor-Quinn is referring were made by the chairman of the county council, one of her own party members, before the meeting took place and before he saw the Bill.

He was very constructive in his approach, totally different from the Deputy.  The Deputy's attitude was contradictory and negative.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my appreciation of the comments made by Deputy O'Dea.  He spoke about the need to develop the recreational and tourist <Col N="594" /> facilities of our ports and this is something with which I totally agree; it is the way ports are developing all over Europe. The challenge facing the Authority is to reconcile the promotion of commercial activities with the promotion of leisure and recreational facilities.  Within an estuary like Shannon, it is possible to do that and develop the area to its full potential.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Dea was worried that the status of some of the employees would be diminished under this new legislation. I want to assure him that rather their status will be enormously enhanced because they will be working for a greater Authority with more responsibilities and opportunities to develop the economic prosperity of the region.  The staff need have no fears about their status.  That is guaranteed in the legislation.  None will be worse off.  A new superannuation scheme is being brought in so their rights will be protected.  Above all, there will be a whole new dimension to the development of the estuary and the status of the employees, and opportunities for developing their own interests and activities will be greatly enhanced.  There are far more challenges, opportunities and exciting prospects under the new Authority than there were under the old piecemeal arrangements.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCarthy made the point that there was no political statement in the legislation.  I am not certain that legislation is the place for political statements. We can make political statements in our contributions but the Bill must be a framework within which the various objectives for overall development of the Shannon can be implemented.  The Bill is enabling legislation so that this area of activity can be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My objective in relation to this estuarial development corporation is to transform an estuary which has been lying relatively dormant into one which is revitalised from the point of view of employment opportunity, job creation possibilities and so on.  That is the function of this legislation.  We must get away from the parochial and political differences in the region and look at the <Col N="595" /> overall objective.  We cannot be deflected from the overall objective which is the long term development of the economic prospects of a huge resource which has been relatively undeveloped, and which will remain undeveloped, unless we do something positive.</P>
    <P>This development cannot take place under the piecemeal operations there at the moment with three, four or more authorities being involved.  The Deputy must be of the same mind with me in that regard.  We cannot allow local jealousies and political differences in the region to interfere.  We must set down a framework which will enable us to open up the prospects for huge development.</P>
    <P>Deputy Foley made the point about representation.  We can never satisfy the demand for representation without having an Authority of about 45 members which would be totally unwieldly.  Deputy Spring suggested looking at establishing subcommittees when the Authority is set up.  That would largely be a matter for the board rather than for this legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey was very constructive in his approach to the port authority although he was critical of some aspects.</P>
    <P>A question was raised by Deputy Noonan about Clarecastle.  Perhaps if the Deputy understood where Clarecastle is he would have a better understanding. <Col N="596" /> There is no connection whatever between the developments that are taking place in Clarecastle and what is happening in Kildysart as Deputy Taylor-Quinn knows only too well.  Perhaps the Deputy would brief Deputy Noonan a bit better so that he will know about it next time he is making a contribution.</P>
    <P>We have a glorious opportunity in this legislation to do something worthwhile to develop a huge natural resource which has been neglected for far too long.  Are we to allow this opportunity to slip by? Are we to allow another 25 years to slip by before we take these unpopular but overall desirable decisions to set up this new Authority?  People should be aware that here we have an opportunity to revitalise the area, and to create long term sustainable employment and long term economic prosperity in this region by supporting this measure.  We can work out the details on Committee Stage where I would welcome amendments which we can work out and discuss fully. If I can facilitate anyone by amending the Bill I will do so.  The overall objective is what is being discussed here and everyone would agree with the necessity and desirability of getting on with this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill has been brought forward in answer to public concern about the law on sexual assaults.  It follows detailed consideration by the Government of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, contained in their report on rape and allied offences, and of the 1987 Report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights on sexual violence.</P>
      <P>There are few who will disagree with me when I say that rape is one of the most obnoxious and reprehensible crimes known to the law.  It involves a severe degree of emotional and psychological trauma for the victim and its physical consequences may be equally severe. Rape will normally give rise to subsequent feelings of insecurity and, of course, there is the very real fear of disease or pregnancy.  For all these reasons it is a particularly abhorrent crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supreme Court has made it plain <Col N="599" /> that it regards rape as a very serious crime which clearly merits a substantial immediate period of detention or imprisonment even when it is committed without any aggravating circumstance.  It has also adopted with approval the general proposition that neither a victim's previous sexual experience nor the fact that she could be considered to have exposed herself by imprudence to the danger of being raped could conceivably be considered as a mitigating circumstance in any rape.</P>
    <P>Yet despite the universal abhorrence with which this crime is viewed and the severe penalties that are handed down to those found guilty of the offence, rapes still continue in our society.  The figure for 1987 was 75 rapes known or reported to the Garda and that is the usual annual figure.  It behoves us as legislators, therefore, to keep the law in this area under continual review so as to ensure that any changes that are seen as necessary, whether they are aimed at increasing the legal protection afforded to victims or assisting in the prosecution of offences, are introduced as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>That is the background to this Bill. However, I must sound a note of warning on two counts.  First we must never forget that a person charged with rape may be innocent.  Any proposals for changes in the law must have regard to that possibility and must seek to achieve, as far as it is humanly possible to do so, a proper balance between the rights of an accused to a fair trial, the rights of society and, of course, the victim to see that justice is done.  My second note of warning is that too many people are apt to confuse change with reform.  Change for the sake of change is not a good policy.  Therefore, any changes we propose to make in the law on rape and other sexual assaults should be based on solid argument and aimed at worth-while reform of the law.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Bill now before you, I am pleased at the general welcome it has received.  Many of its provisions are, of course, based on proposals contained in the Law Reform Commission's report &mdash; and I would again like to congratulate the <Col N="600" /> commission and their president for their contribution to the debate on the issues in question.  The report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights was also valuable in this regard.  The Minister for Justice regrets that he cannot be here today because of other duties.</P>
    <P>Briefly the Bill provides for the following changes in the law: 1. It abolishes the rule that a husband generally cannot be guilty of raping his wife; 2. It replaces the offence of indecent assault (which has a maximum sentence of ten years' imprisonment) by two new offences of sexual assault (with a maximum penalty of five years) and aggravated sexual assault (with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment); 3. It provides that trials for rape and aggravated sexual assault will be tried in the Central Criminal Court and that the public will be excluded; 4. It extends to all sexual assault victims the procedural, evidential and anonymity provisions which now protect the victim in rape cases; 5. It abolishes the requirement for a mandatory warning about the dangers of convicting a person on the uncorroborated evidence of a complainant &mdash; leaving the question of a warning to the discretion of the judge; 6. It abolishes the presumption that a boy under 14 is incapable of committing rape or other crimes involving sexual intercourse; and 7. It makes it clear that lack of physical resistance does not constitute consent.</P>
    <P>In the remainder of my speech I will deal with the more important of these changes and with a number of other matters in relation to the Bill which have given rise to comment and debate.</P>
    <P>One of the major provisions in the Bill is the proposal to abolish the marital exemption in relation to rape.  This is one aspect of the law on rape that has been kept under continual review in my Department since the enactment of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981.  Some Deputies may recall the debate on this issue which took place during the passage of the 1981 Act through the Oireachtas. Strong views &mdash; which crossed party lines &mdash; both for and against change were expressed at that time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> In the absence of any consensus for change, the decision at that time was to leave the law as it was.  There is now general agreement that the marital rape exemption in so far as it existed until now should be abolished.  The Law Reform Commission's provisional recommendation in their consultation paper in favour of abolition was, on the whole, generally welcomed although some misgivings were expressed as to whether it might not lead to fabricated complaints and unwarranted intrusions in the marriage relationship.</P>
    <P>The intrusion of the criminal law into the relationship of husband and wife can, of course, be disruptive and can present evidential problems.  However, that possibility has not prevented assault, indecent assault or buggery by a husband on his wife being criminal offences and I do not think that such a possibility should prevent the removal of the marital rape exemption.  It is difficult to justify that exemption which appears to condone a type of behaviour which, I suggest, is not acceptable to the majority of Irish people.</P>
    <P>Evidential difficulties will invariably arise in marital rape cases but again the presence of such difficulties is not a sufficient reason for maintaining the existing position.  However, in view of these difficulties and in order to prevent the institution of spiteful or mischievous proceedings by a spouse or an interfering third party I am proposing that a prosecution of marital rape can only be brought with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  At present a private prosecution for rape could reach the stage of the preliminary hearing in the District Court but could go no further without the intervention of the DPP.  In effect under this proposal there will be no private prosecutions even up to the District Court stage for marital rape.</P>
    <P>Another major reform of the existing law contained in the Bill is the proposal to create two new offences, sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault, in place of the existing offence of indecent assault and the extension to all sexual assault <Col N="602" /> victims of the procedural, evidential and anonymity provisions which now protect the victims of rape.</P>
    <P>The view had been put forward by the Oireachtas joint committee in their fourth report on sexual violence that the existing law ignores the seriousness of other forms of sexual assault such as forced anal and oral intercourse and that, in so doing, it implies that one form of sexual assault is more serious than another.  The committee also felt that the gravity of forced sexual penetration through the use of objects should be fully recognised.  The committee recommended that the protection at present afforded to rape victims should be extended to victims of these acts.  Finally, the committee agree that there was no logic in keeping separate the treatment by the law of offences that reflect a correspondingly degrading level of sexual violence against women.  The solution proposed by the committee was to redefine rape to include these offences.</P>
    <P>The Government concur fully with the committee in their expression of abhorrence of these offences which can be as distressing and degrading as rape and it is for these very reasons that the Bill creates the new offence of aggravated sexual assault with the same penalty as rape and which, along with rape, will be tried in the Central Criminal Court. However, the Government do not agree that equal treatment by the law of these offences necessarily means that the name &ldquo;rape&rdquo; should be applied to them.  Indeed, in their report the joint committee put forward no arguments in support of their proposed solution that the definition of rape should be extended to include the offences in question.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission also considered the question of changing the definition of rape and split three, two on the issue.  The majority of the commission recommended the replacement of the existing definition of rape by a gender neutral offence which would include, in addition to non-consensual intercourse per vaginum, non-consensual oral intercourse and the non-consensual penetration of a woman's vagina by objects. <Col N="603" /> The majority's main argument in favour of this recommendation was that rape is a form of sexual assault which is no more distinctive than other similarly serious forms of sexual assault which are grouped together within a single offence.</P>
    <P>That argument does not stand up to scrutiny.  Rape has been known as a distinctive crime for centuries, and is clearly distinguishable from all other forms of aggravated sexual assault.  It is the abuse of an act which in proper circumstances constitutes an expression of human love. The essential ingredient of rape is the absence of consent to sexual intercourse. Although in many cases rape will be accompanied by violence the essence of the crime is the absence of consent, which has to be proved in every case.  On the other hand in the case of the aggravated sexual assaults we are talking about consent will not normally be an issue. Indeed, in the case of penetration by instruments it is inconceivable that consent would ever be an issue and to suggest, as has been suggested by the majority of the Law Reform Commission, that the offence of rape should embrace non-consensual acts of this nature must be wrong in principle since to do so would give rise to the startling implication that such acts if consensual would be acceptable.</P>
    <P>A further distinguishing feature of rape is that, unlike any of the other offences in question, only the act of rape can give rise to pregnancy.  One cannot get away from that fact.</P>
    <P>The only substantive argument I have heard advanced in favour of an extended definition of rape is that victims of serious sexual assaults not amounting to rape would benefit psychologically by describing the experience they have been subjected to as rape.  I can fully apreciate that argument being made in the context of the present law where the offence charged is indecent assault and the maximum sentence is ten years' imprisonment. However, any psychological assurance that may be thought to be needed will be supplied by the obvious seriousness with which the Bill as <Col N="604" /> presently drafted treats these serious sexual assaults.</P>
    <P>Let me say in conclusion on this point that if the Government felt that the correct approach would be to extend the definition of rape they would have no hesitation in doing so.  They must, however, consider the issue on its merits; in other words, on the basis of what they consider would be in the best interests of the victims of rape and of other serious sexual assaults and of the public generally.  It should be obvious that the whole thrust of this legislation is to afford the best possible protection to both men and women against sexual assault no matter what form it takes.  Indeed, in the international context, this Bill is in any view a radical measure.  It must be equally obvious that on the question of the definition of rape there is no consensus that what the majority of the Law Reform Commission propose is the right way forward. In the commission itself, both its president and its full-time commissioner were against an extended definition.  The law society and the Garda Síochána have argued against it.  So has a recent issue of the <i>Irish Law Times.</i>  In addition an article in the latest edition of the <i>Dublin University Law Journal</i> argues against a gender-neutral offence such as that proposed by the majority of the commission on the basis that in those jurisdictions where that approach has been adopted, it has failed to achieve many of the objectives originally envisaged and has fallen into disrepute.  It can be seen, therefore, that not only is there no consensus in Ireland in support of the majority recommendation of the commission, there is no international consensus either.</P>
    <P>The obvious conclusion we must come to, therefore, is that we should retain the existing definition of rape, which has not given rise to any difficulties.  The creation of the new offences of sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault, the trial of the latter offence, along with rape, in the Central Criminal Court and the extension to all sexual assault victims of the legal protection at present afforded to rape <Col N="605" /> victims, will in the Government's considered view meet all the criticisms of the existing law as it pertains to sexual assaults not amounting to rape.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the fact that the Bill provides that in future all rape and aggravated sexual assault cases will be tried in the Central Criminal Court.  I would like to make it clear that this decision is intended to be seen as an expression of the seriousness with which the Government view the crime of rape, and, indeed, the crime of aggravated sexual assault.  It should not in any way be taken as a criticism of the Circuit Court or the judges in that court who have handled rape cases.  Some disquiet has been expressed as respects the impact this decision will have on rural circuits. As the following information shows the proposed change will have only a very minor impact.  In the five years from 1984 to 1988, inclusive, there have been 32 rape trials held outside Dublin &mdash; that is an average of just over six trials per annum.  These involved only 15 counties. I would hope, therefore, that on reflection those who have expressed concern in relation to this proposal will appreciate why the Government have brought forward this provision.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes, by virtue of section 18 (a), that applications for bail in the case of rape and aggravated sexual assault may only be made in the High Court.  It has been represented to the Minister that the present situation on bail applications in relation to these offences should continue to apply, that is, that applications for bail be made in the first place to the District Court.  This would be a departure from the present position that pertains in the case of offences which are triable only in the Central Criminal Court.  On the other hand procedures for granting bail in these cases in the District Court are well established and, of course, the preliminary examination of the charges will be taking place in that court.  This is a matter to which I will give further consideration between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Another important change which the <Col N="606" /> Bill will bring about relates to the question of corroboration of a complainant's evidence in trials of sexual offences. Under existing law it is mandatory for the judge in such trials to warn the jury of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant. There are cases where this warning would be superfluous and could raise unnecessary doubts and confusion in the minds of jurors.  The Law Reform Commission recommended that the question whether such a warning should be given and, if so, its terms should be left to the discretion of the judge trying the individual case.  The Government accepted this recommendation and section 6 of the Bill contains the necessary provision.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that one of the main purposes of the Bill is to improve the legal protection the law affords to victims of sexual assaults.  I would like to spell that out a little more.</P>
    <P>The 1981 Act restricts the cross-examination of a complainant concerning her previous sexual history with any person other than the accused.  This provision is now being extended to the victims of all sexual assault offences and, in addition, will encompass the previous sexual relations of the complainant with the accused.  The 1981 Act also provided for the anonymity of the complainant in a rape case and this provision is also being extended to the victims of all sexual assault offences.  However, the Bill does not extend the anonymity provisions relating to an accused.  These will continue to apply only in the case of a rape offence and, indeed, there is some tightening up of the existing law in section 13 of the Bill by virtue of which the Director of Public Prosecutions may apply to court to lift the anonymity of the accused in the public interest.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Bill, apart from providing that all rape and aggravated sexual assault cases will be heard in the Central Criminal Court, also provides in section 10 that they will be heard in the absence of the public.  The exclusion of the public is to save embarrassment to the victim but because of the public interest in serious <Col N="607" /> crimes of this nature the press will not be excluded.</P>
    <P>These are provisions which I believe all right-thinking people will welcome and which will have a very significant impact. They clearly indicate the concern of the Government for the victims of sexual assaults and an understanding of the trauma they have to undergo not only as a result of the incident itself but during the subsequent investigation also.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I would like to refer to a number of other matters raised in the Law Reform Commission's report and by the Oireachtas Joint Committee.  The Law Reform Commission considered the recommendation made by the Oireachtas joint committee that evidence of the previous sexual experience of the complainant should no longer be admissible at a rape trial in any circumstances and, for reasons with which the Government fully concur, opposed the recommendation. The position is that there are cases where evidence of a complainant's previous sexual experience can be relevant to an issue in a rape trial.  The commission at paragraphs 84 and 85 of their consultation paper give examples where such evidence would be relevant. There is no legal system of which I am aware that absolutely forbids such evidence. Indeed most jurisdictions have a provision which, like section 3 of the Rape Act, 1981, limits the circumstances under which questions may be asked about the previous sexual history of the complainant.  To totally exclude such evidence, apart from the constitutional implications, could be grossly unfair to an accused and could lead to a miscarriage of justice.  This is where the balance between the rights of the victim and of the accused that I mentioned at the outset of my speech comes into sharp focus.</P>
    <P>This leads me on to another area where the Law Reform Commission strongly opposed a recommendation of the Oireachtas joint committee, that is, that separate free legal representation be made available to complainants in rape cases.  The commission raised the constitutional propriety of the proposal and <Col N="608" /> went on to point out that in some cases separate legal representation might actually lead to unjustified acquittals of the accused.  The reason this proposal was put forward in the first place was a perception that complaints were not being sufficiently protected by prosecution counsel and that as a result they felt alienated from the legal process.</P>
    <P>The commission expressed the view that these problems could be resolved within the confines of the existing legal system, particularly in a climate of changing attitudes towards the rape victim.  The Government are in full agreement with the commission on this issue.  It is absurd that the State should, in effect, be asked to pay on the double for the prosecution of sexual offenders because it is alleged, rightly or wrongly, that complaints are not being adequately protected by counsel for the prosecution during the trial.</P>
    <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions, with whom the Minister raised this matter, agrees generally with the commission's approach.  As the Minister mentioned in the Seanad, he is in the course of taking certain steps which when fully implemented will be of a particular benefit to complainants in sexual offence cases.  The DPP considers it important that the complainant in a sexual case be furnished without delay with a copy of her statement and be afforded access to the solicitor and counsel acting for the prosecution before the hearing of the case in court.</P>
    <P>He also proposes that what could be described as a familiarisation course be made available to the complainant on request in which the layout and procedure of the court will be explained to the complainant and in which she will be advised in very general terms of the type of question which she might be asked.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is a responsibility on the presiding judge to ensure that the specific provisions of the 1981 Act, which are being extended to all sexual assault offences in this Bill, restricting evidence of a complainant's previous sexual history, are complied with.  Over and above that he also has a duty to ensure that <Col N="609" /> no other irrelevant or improper crossexamination of the complainant takes place.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in the Seanad to the welcome change in attitude that had occurred in recent years towards the victims of sexual attacks and his belief that generally speaking the Irish criminal justice system is now more sympathetic to, and more understanding of, the trauma which victims undergo.  He also paid tribute in particular to the Garda Síochána, who have been to the forefront in giving practical expression to this welcome change in attitude.  I hope that others involved in the criminal justice system would follow suit.  Legislative changes can only go some of the way to relieving the trauma and distress of victims of rape and other sexual assaults.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure other Members will join me today in welcoming this Bill, which has received tremendous support both inside and outside the House in regard to the need and urgency for amending legislation in this area.  Now that we have the Bill before us I would appeal to the Minister and Members of the House generally to include therein everything we have heard, about which there have been submissions received and everything we have heard from people who have been victims of rape and those who have dealt with those victims.  Even bearing in mind the acknowledgment of the urgency for the introduction of this amending Bill and the support it has received, it has still taken quite a length of time to reach this House.</P>
      <P>I am acutely aware of the recent history of law reform on rape in that I was administrator of the Council for the Status of Women in the seventies when we lobbied for amending legislation and from which emanated the 1981 Rape Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join the Minister in welcoming some shifts in opinion and lack of prejudice toward rape and its victims in our society. When we lobbied then to have the concept of marital rape and the very serious issue of child sexual abuse included in the 1981 Act we were more or less told that <Col N="610" /> there would be tremendous difficulty in getting such legislation through the House because the majority of Members would not accept either the need for nor the seriousness of both issues and the need for legislative reform with regard to them.  I am glad to note that in this Bill there is included the concept of rape within marriage.  I commend the Minister for Justice and the Law Reform Commission for focusing on the need to bring forward legislative proposals to deal with child sexual abuse.  I know that the Minister for Social Welfare present has had an amount of experience and takes considerable interest in this area.  It would be my hope that those legislative proposals would come on stream very quickly.  I am aware that the Law Reform Commission would like as broad a consensus and sounding as possible of people dealing in this area in all its aspects.  Indeed they hope to hold a seminar similar to the one held before they made their last proposals on rape.</P>
    <P>Naturally it would be my hope that, when such legislative proposals emerge the parliamentary draftsmen would work on them as quickly as possible and introduce a Bill to protect another weak, vulnerable section of our society, that is, children who are sexually abused.  Like the Minister present, I welcome the fact that we can now speak openly, hopefully compassionately, about the victims of rape and children who are sexually abused within our society.  Sadly, that had not been possible up to quite recently and that, in turn, led to a lack of legislative reform, causing much suffering, guilt and trauma to many people who will never be able to benefit from the provisions of this Bill or of what it is hoped to have introduced in the House before the end of 1989 with regard to the sexual abuse of children.</P>
    <P>I shall refer to sections of the Bill and to recommendations the Government have not seen fit to include, such as the definition of rape, or the very considered submission that separate legal representation be afforded the victims of rape in certain specific circumstances. Those recommendations have not been <Col N="611" /> entertained and the Minister has explained why they have not been included.  On Committee Stage I shall be advancing substantial arguments as to why they should be included.</P>
    <P>To demonstrate how constructively and positively all parties in this House welcome the main amending provisions of this Bill I might refer the House to the deliberations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights, who made various recommendations to which the Law Reform Commission gave serious consideration.  By way of Dáil reform I would have to say the value of Oireachtas Joint Committees is aptly demonstrated by the recommendations of this report, the seriousness with which those recommendations were considered and the help they afforded the Law Reform Commission, in turn, in drawing up their recommendations.  I should like to pay tribute to the Chairperson of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights at that time, the Minister of State, Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn, who, since the emergence of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, has come out solidly in support of the recommendations of the joint committee on women's rights.  Indeed the Minister of State, Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn, has also reiterated that she believes that the recommendation of the joint committee on women's rights in regard to the extension of the definition of rape should have been included in this Bill and has expressed her regret that it has not been included.</P>
    <P>Running quickly through the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights, in particular we welcome the proposal that a complainant should be given a copy of a statement to the Garda, as a matter of course; that a complainant be kept fully informed of developments by the Garda and be afforded access to the State prosecutor before the hearing of the case.  This constitutes a huge step forward.  Formerly many victims of rape were not even aware of the implications of their court hearing. That ignorance was reinforced by the fact <Col N="612" /> that the victim might have had no background knowledge in regard to her case and received very little notice of when her case was likely to come up in court. That lack of knowledge led to a tremendous amount of fear and trauma, since she was not made aware of the implications for her of that court hearing.</P>
    <P>It is also our hope that there will be extreme discretion exercised <i>vis-à-vis</i> the introduction of a complainant's past sexual history.  Indeed the joint committee on women's rights did recommend that such should always be ruled to be inadmissible.  In consultation with the Law Reform Commission we reached a consensus that we would never endeavour to introduce a recommendation which might in any way tamper with the natural justice of anybody in court.  We accepted that there may be very exceptional cases, which should remain within the strict discretion of the judge, when a complainant's past sexual history may be relevant.  However, it is our view that that discretion should be very rigidly exercised.</P>
    <P>When I come to the relevant section I shall have more to say about treatment of a complainant and the present court treatment of an accused person.  I will be making strong recommendations in that particular section.  We also welcome the fact that in disallowing the public from the court it will go a long way to stop rape cases being spectator sports and the grist of the tabloid gutter press, which must add so much hurt and humiliation and embarrassment to the victim and to her family and friends.</P>
    <P>The joint committe on women's rights recommended that there would be an even balance of sexes on juries in rape cases.  However, in our further set of recommendations to the Law Reform Commission we took into consideration what many people dealing in rape cases within the legal profession told us, that it was not the balance of sexes with regard to juries that we should worry about but rather the age which could have an implication. In our later recommendation we asked that the age and gender be taken into consideration so that we would have <Col N="613" /> a balanced jury.  We particularly welcomed the fact that our recommendation on the criminalisation of sexual violence within marriage was accepted and also the removal of the immunity of a boy under 14 years from being charged with rape.  I will be making further comment on this issue when we come to it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We followed up that recommendation immediately with a further recommendation saying that where a boy of 14 years of age or under was charged with rape or sexual assault the sentence should be detention for therapeutic treatment to break what would seem to be a behaviour pattern at a very young age that certainly deserved treatment and not a prison sentence.  I will be adding to that aspect when I come to deal with the section.  I will be asking the Minister when taking a particular anomaly into consideration &mdash; hopefully after the introduction of other legislation regarding the criminal age of responsibility of children, which we are hoping to change &mdash; that we might even have to add something into this Bill as a result.  I will explain it more fully when I reach that section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Something which has tremendous influence on the perception of society to rape or the perception of men and women in society to rape and, indeed, influence on what I would see as one of the most fundamental debates we will have on this Bill in the House is whether the definition should be extended.  I clearly see a very different experience perception of the need to extend that definition based on gender.  I want to place on record at this stage that anything I am going to say &mdash; and argue for here &mdash; is not or should not be conceived as an attack on men <i>versus</i> women or on women <i>versus</i> men.  What I want to argue most strongly &mdash; and I appreciate the privilege of being able to do so &mdash; is to put the woman's experience, the woman's voice and the woman's history of how she is being treated in society, particularly in the ultimate violation of rape, on record in a forum where traditional male perceptions and male concepts of law and property held before.  I <Col N="614" /> want to expand that because I think it has a tremendous influence on the understanding of whether the definition of rape should be extended or not.</P>
    <P>In order to do that I believe I would have to go into the definition as it is perceived by society and certainly by women.  Sexual assault is a violation, particularly where it involves penetration of any orifice of the body, of the bodily integrity of the person.  It is a total internal invasion which does not happen very often at any other level of violence. Indeed, as it has been described in one violent crime, rape is an act against the person and the property, the property being the woman's body and her personal integrity.  The other myth which has been put aside and, I hope buried for all time, and which all women welcome, is that rape is not an act of sexual gratification.  It is not an act brought on by the attractive appearance or the seduction of the female, it is an act of violence, of domination and even of hatred.  It has nothing to do with sex, love or even with sexual gratification but it has everything to do with domination and violence and with fear, which has curtailed the activities of women even in modern everyday life.</P>
    <P>I accept what the Minister says that legislation is only part of the problem, but let us hope that legislation will go, as it usually does, towards changing attitudes, but one of the serious undertones to this Bill is the subconscious, in-built, traditional, patriarchal concept of rape that has worked consistently and constantly against women in all societies.  In this Bill it is highlighted in certain areas, such as the fear of wives in marriage taking frivolous or vexatious cases, the terrible fear of the accused in some way being found out, and at all costs the accused has got to be preserved and protected.</P>
    <P>In rape laws up to now that protection and that fear and threat by men has been so observed and so written into the law that women have ended up not having the same protection and the same treatment under the law.  That is the reason we must have this amending legislation.  The fundamental concept of men's attitude to <Col N="615" /> women and men's treatment of women in society must also be part of our thinking and part of what we are hoping to incorporate into this Bill to change radically and, if I am not incredibly optimistic, not alone change but perhaps reach a stage in our society where men do not have to rape women or threaten them them with rape and where they do not feel they have to dominate and violate them to keep them in control or to keep their place in society.  What we are talking about here is an equal status, an equal participation, and an equal partnership of men and women in society where women are not afraid to walk the streets at night, where they are not afraid to walk alone and where they are not afraid when confronted by a gang of young people that they will be gangraped.  That is the reality of modern life and, indeed, was the reality throughout history.  I hope we will counter it by approaching the problem with openness and by publishing it and giving women the strength of the legal protection to report it and receive some kind of justice in return.</P>
    <P>We have a lot to fight.  This is why I am not setting up any man <i>versus</i> woman debate in this House.  What I am pointing out is that down through history from the earliest human times, possibly from cavemen days &mdash; which we still smilingly put into cartoons of a man dragging a woman off by the hair into his particular cave armed with a large piece of rock &mdash; one of the spoils of war, engraved in our subconscious, generation upon generation, thousands upon thousands of years and carried on throughout history, was rape.  Men were allowed to rape the women of the country in which they were victorious.  To this day, as we know from veterans from Vietnam and elsewhere, that was part of the shame and the guilt they had to carry and part of what women, after war, had to cope with when the victorious armies had passed through and had used them as they wished.  Men being prepared for war are actively encouraged to see women in rape terms when going into an enemy country.  The very brutality that we demand of men <Col N="616" /> going to fight and kill in another country also demands that they be not seduced by the love or care of women.  They must be a subject for hatred and men must be trained to treat them in that way.  What has been demanded of men in acts of war has been hugely damaging to both men and women.</P>
    <P>We have the history of slavery.  One has only to read the history of black slavery in the United States to realise that any woman on a plantation was owned by the plantation owner, whether she was married to anybody else or not.  There was <i>droit du seigneur</i> in feudal times under which the lord of the manor had the pick and choice of virgins who were to be married the next day to a lowly serf. There is an in-built sense of women not being in control of there own bodies, not being able to assert their integrity and the personal ownership to which they have every right, and tremendous justice must be claimed for violation of that integrity.</P>
    <P>I shall not go further into history, except to point out, as did Susan Brownmiller in her classic book on rape, entitled &ldquo;Against Our Will&rdquo; that the first laws on rape punished the rapist on behalf of the father or guardian of the woman. He was suitably penalised, based on the marriage value of the daughter or ward. Susan Brownmiller goes on to say that, starting with the incautious rapist being stoned to death, if the raped girl had been destined to be the subject of marriage to an important or wealthy person and, particularly if she was betrothed, she would then be sold at a marked-down price to anybody who would have her.</P>
    <P>I am going into the beginnings of law in relation to this heinous crime, because we must see that the concept was of property. The penalty was based on the high value attributed to the virginity of women and the high cost to a woman of becoming pregnant by a man other than her husband. I am putting such emphasis on this because I believe that draftspeople, legislators, and the legal profession still put emphasis on the risk of pregnancy making the crime of rape so unique &mdash; that is the term used.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that no solid <Col N="617" /> argument has been offered by the women's rights committee and others on this.  I should like to put forward a few arguments.  In today's terms, thankfully, pregnancy is not a risk or threat that a woman need suffer.  However, there is a much greater threat which she must endure in attacks which should be defined as rape, in the incidence of communicable diseases such as AIDS.  If the argument is made that we must retain the crime of rape because of the danger of disease or pregnancy &mdash; the Minister said that this morning &mdash; I would put it to him and to the Department of Justice that surely it is at least as dangerous and deadly to have oral or anal sex forced on one where there is a higher risk, through that type of attack and violation, of AIDS being communicated.</P>
    <P>It is not correct to say that it is only the penetration of the penis into the vagina, thus causing or threatening disease or pregnancy, which can be defined as rape. Definitions are being extended and society has begun to recognise that some types of sexual attacks on women which are not at the moment termed rape should be defined as such.  These would be termed, if this Bill remains as it is, aggrevated sexual assaults.  Such attacks are as heinous, humiliating and punishing as, and perhaps more deadly in the long term than, the rigid concept held at the moment.</P>
    <P>It all comes back to the woman's voice being lost, ignored or put aside as regards her experience of rape when the Minister says that there is no real consensus to show that the extended definition of rape would be supported abroad by a majority.  I refer to page 6 of the report of the Law Reform Commission on Rape, paragraph 11 and I quote:</P>
    <P>Much of the difficulty arises from a disagreement as to whether the common usage of the word &ldquo;rape&rdquo; is different from its legal definition. Clearly, the Commission is not in a position to arrive at an unqualified conclusion on this matter.  It must, however, attach due weight to the large <Col N="618" /> number of submissions which have suggested that current usage in Ireland is broader than the legal definition.  Of the 28 submissions in writing received by the Commission at least 19 were in favour of extending the definition of rape.  They included submissions from:</P>
    <P>(a)  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights;</P>
    <P>(b)  Representatives of leading women's associations, such as the ICA;</P>
    <P>(c)  Representatives of professional associations, such as the Irish Medical Association;</P>
    <P>(d)  Trade Unions, such as the IDATU;</P>
    <P>and most important&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(e)  Rape Crisis Centres.</P>
    <P>The general consensus which emerged from those participating in the Seminar</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;which was a broad spectrum of Irish society&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>organised by the Commission also favoured an extended definition.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister how he can incorporate in his speech a statement that the request, indeed demand, of an extended definition of &ldquo;rape&rdquo; does not have a consensus, does not have broad support. Then I realise that it is quoted in this report that, of the Law Reform Commission, a minority, the Garda, had indicated that they did not know whether they could support it.  There were also quotations from legal documents and publications.  Any profession, particularly one like the legal profession, is established in its thinking and sees any radical departure such as extending a definition like this as almost a heresy.  Its first reaction, which is very human in any profession, is to defend what is there and to see the difficulties or the implications of changing it.  I accept that.</P>
    <P>When the committee on women's rights had submissions from the Garda we explicitly put in a straight question to <Col N="619" /> the Garda representative&mdash;&ldquo;Would the Garda have any principled objection to the extension of the definition of rape?&rdquo; The reply we got was, &ldquo;No&rdquo;, and that is on record.  Therefore, there is no difficulty with the Garda.  Like the Minister, I would like to pay tribute to the support, the urgings and the lobbying we got from the Garda to amend and strengthen the legislation and to protect rape victims, with whom the Garda are usually first to come in contact.</P>
    <P>We heard from women's rights committees, women's associations, Rape Crisis Centres, women victims and social workers, and the point I am raising is endemic to the debate on women's status and women's role in society.  Somehow the consensus view and experience of women and submissions from women do not carry the same weight, nor are they taken as seriously as those of the professionals, the majority of whom &mdash; if I may say so without being seen to be a man hater or anything else &mdash; are male.</P>

      <P>QED.  I thank Deputy Colley.  Some substantial arguments have been offered and because I do not want to spend all day on that section, I can give a list of submissions from people involved in dealing with and recovering from rape and its consequences, showing that these victims know they have been raped and they want it to be recognised as the serious and heinous crime of rape. It is not too much to ask in reforming legislation, when we get substantial submissions from the victims and carers of victims of this crime, that their voice be heard and their submissions recognised and included in the legislation, particularly in the light of the fact that the consultation document from the Law Reform Commission did not agree to extending the definition.</P>

    <P>However, having spent a day listening to professional people who deal with this at all levels of society, and the victims of rape themselves, I can say that at least a majority of them realise it should be <Col N="620" /> taken seriously and maybe a legally radical step should be incorporated in this Bill by at least including in it a definition that tries to sum up the enormity of what has happened to these people who have been violated.  If somebody is attacked and violated with anal sex, oral sex, or a bottle, scissors, knife or broom handle in her vagina, she feels raped.  She does not say she has been subjected to aggravated sexual assault.</P>
    <P>As can be seen, I can barely come to terms with this without being traumatised. I and everybody else who listened to submissions and to victims and carers of victims, knows that the view of those victims is that they have been raped and they want it legally recognised as rape.  I would like the Minister to take that and the majority view of Irish society into consideration and on Committee Stage to change and extend the definition of rape.  He will have our respect and &mdash; I was going to say thanks but it is not thanks &mdash; appreciation, because as legislators we should be giving the people what they need for their protection.  I will not be patronising either the Minister or the people who ask for this.  They will appreciate the fact that their voices have been listened to and will be acknowledged in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill abolishes marital exemption in relation to rape.  This has been welcomed.  I am delighted that the Law Reform Commission, followed up by the Minister for Justice and his draftspeople, agreed and accepted the justice of this.  Until this Bill is enacted, a husband cannot be prosecuted for the rape of his wife.  Because of the property rights of men, once a woman married a man, she was a chattel, she belonged to him, and therefore a husband could not rape his wife.  Because of property rights enshrined and inherited by us, wives in Ireland and in other jurisdictions where this has not been changed find they have signed away one of the most basic human rights of all when they entered into legal marriage &mdash; they signed away the right to take a case of rape against the man who rapes them if he happens to be their husband. A stronger case for co-habitation I <Col N="621" /> have never heard.  If we are serious about protecting the institution of marriage and respecting the partners in the marriage, then it is essential that the concept of marital rape be accepted.  Young women today, on learning that that most basic right would not be open to them, would have very serious thoughts about entering into legal marriage and giving up such a fundamental right.  Therefore, the provision in this section is to be welcomed and should be enacted as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is also welcome.  Research and evidence show that young men under 14 years of age, can be guilty of rape and what is known as sexual assault.  The committee on women's rights have established that young people of that age found guilty of this very serious crime need specialist treatment.  They need to be institutionalised and treated until they are no longer a threat to society and victims themselves.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to something that I have mentioned obliquely before.  I realise that the criminal age of responsibility for children is still seven years &mdash; a fact we all deplore and hope this will be rectified in legislation as soon as possible.  The section I referred to presents no difficulty where a young person is seen to have committed a crime and is sentenced for that crime, even with imprisonment. However, all of us would wish to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 14 or even 16 years and there is much debate about it.  If a boy under the age of 14 who is not criminally responsible commits the crime of rape or sexual assault we might have to include some provision to cover it.  Perhaps I am anticipating legislation. If we change the age of criminal responsibility an anomaly could be created in that this section would not work in the way we would wish.  People under that age might not come within the scope of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The next section relates to the corroboration of evidence in criminal proceedings. Up to now the judge had to warn the court and the jury in respect of an uncorroborated crime, which naturally <Col N="622" /> would have quite an influence on the jury.  It was a catch 22 situation for the victim in so far as most rapes and sexual assaults do not take place before witnesses and therefore must of necessity be uncorroborated.  I welcome the provision whereby the judge will be able to exercise his discretion.  The fact that a rape case must go through the Office of the DPP ensures that we do not get vexatious or frivolous cases or many cases of people being accused in the wrong.  I do not believe the removal of the corroborating provision will lead to injustice.</P>
    <P>All of us have welcomed section 9 because of what it attempts to do.  In order to indicate how seriously society views this crime, all offences shall be tried by the Central Criminal Court.  The Minister and the Law Reform Commission have commented that some people have queried the practicality of this.  One of the strongest recommendations from the Rape Crisis Centres was that there should be the least possible delay in taking cases before the courts because the length of time between the reporting of the case and its being heard is very traumatic for the victim.  The speedier and more protective the court case is, the better for the victim and the more reports of rape we are likely to get. I appreciate that this section is giving due seriousness and status to the crime of rape and aggravated sexual assault. However, if this results in long queues of cases waiting to get into the Central Criminal Court because they cannot be heard at Circuit Court level, we may have to re-examine the position.  I do not know what the waiting lists are like for either the Central Criminal Court or the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted some figures in his speech but data from the Rape Crisis Centres, where statistics are kept, would show that because of the lack of protection and the experience which rape victims have to face in court, most of them are not willing to go to court and a great number will not even report the crime to the Garda.  There is evidence based on research in the Rape Crisis Centres to this effect.  Of course, these figures <Col N="623" /> relate only to people who contacted the Rape Crisis Centres.  Some would suggest that the figures we have in respect of those going to court are only the tip of the iceberg.</P>
    <P>I hope the enactment of this legislation will make victims willing to report the crime and take their case through the courts.  The figures relating to court cases in the past may not be an indication of the number of cases reported and processed in the future.  We are attempting to ensure that women who are raped and violated have the protection and support of the law and will feel encouraged to go ahead and process their case.  The figures we have do not represent the extent of the problem and we may have to make a projection.  Section 9 might have to be looked at again with regard to the speed of hearing cases.</P>
    <P>The Bill also refers to the fact that in certain cases, especially where there has been a lot of personal, emotional or psychological damage or the threat of disease, a convicted rapist might be asked to pay compensation.  That happens in other cases where damage, pain, suffering, absence from work, etc. can be taken into consideration in court and compensation adjudged.  My worry is that there might be an attempt by certain affluent people who have been convicted of rape or sexual assault to buy their way out of it.  By offering a high rate of compensation, which might not be any great sacrifice on their part, they might incur a lighter sentence.  We must be very careful in this regard.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it would be possible to insert an amendment to the effect that compensation should never substitute for sentencing but should merely be an adjunct, not seen as a lessening of the crime.  The parliamentary draftsman would be able to say whether this is possible.  There have been attempts to dissuade a victim from taking a case by the offer of a large amount of money. There have also been attempts to buy off the victim and have the sentence reduced.  This implies that a person can pay off a woman in monetary terms for <Col N="624" /> being raped or sexually assaulted.  We must be very careful that there is no taint of that attached to it although I agree that the Law Reform Commission are quite right in suggesting that compensation should also be allowed.</P>
    <P>There was tremendous consensus and support from outside groups, particularly those working in this area, on the need for the victim, in certain circumstances, to have legal representation.  That represents a fundamental shift in the law as we know it.  It has been accepted that at the discretion of the judge a woman's past sexual history may be required to be gone into.  In such circumstances the complainant should have the right to have a legal adviser, if not a legal representative, to advise her of her rights and maybe even intervene because, as anybody who has followed some of the horrific cases in this area in the past knows, the prosecution can actually blacken a woman's reputation.  She may go in as the complainant and come out as the accused and the guilty.  Barristers who work in this area have said quite openly and blatantly to me that their whole case rests on being able to go in and attempt to blacken, subvert and undermine the reputation and the behaviour of the woman.  We know that, and that is the main reason so few women are willing to go through the process and put themselves in a position to be so humiliated; some victims of rape have described that treatment in court as being as bad as being raped all over again.  We must pay attention to that.  Once again what I am asking the House to take into consideration is the experience of the victims, not what the legal profession have laid down over the years, because a lot of our law is based on property and priority rights.  The law is not so monolithic and indestructible that it should not be open to fundamental changes, particularly when we want to ensure justice for the victim and the person who needs justice.</P>
    <P>I put it strongly to the Minister that the complainant's need for legal representation must be taken into consideration, maybe not in all cases but certainly in cases where we concede that, <Col N="625" /> in natural justice, a woman's past sexual history may be referred to.  The complainant must have her rights protected and know she will not become the accused because, at the discretion of the judge, this procedure has been allowed, since this is one of the most serious parts of the court process.</P>
    <P>I want to go on now to a matter on which there were many submissions from people working in this area.  If it is conceded that the woman's past sexual history may be referred to at the discretion of the judge, what about the accused?  A fundamental facet of our law is that any person is innocent until proved guilty. Therefore, something we would all uphold, as long as it does not become an injustice, is that an accused person cannot have any previous offence referred to while he is being tried on a specific charge.  So we have a situation whereby the victim or complainant, the person who has gone into that court expecting justice, can have her reputation torn to shreds, have all kinds of innuendos made and all kinds of past history thrown in her face which is not relevant, but clever prosecutors can and do this while the accused, with his own legal representation, can stand there and know that not alone has he got good legal representation but that nothing in his past sexual history can be taken up.  I do not believe that is natural justice as we now perceive and practice it.  That is why we offer a substantial argument when we ask, in justice, that if the accused has the right to have no previous offence of his in this regard gone into, the least that can be claimed when such an occasion arises in the case of the complainant is that she would have legal advice and representation to protect her, who is pleading that she is the innocent and not the guilty. I would put it that if in the discretion of the judge a woman's past sexual history is relevant, surely the accused's past sexual history with that person at least should also be relevant.  I do not think we would be perpetrating any great invasion of his rights to justice or protection if we allowed that.  I would like that to be seriously considered.  If we are going to <Col N="626" /> get complementary justice for the two people &mdash; and I am assuming that the accused is probably claiming that he is innocent &mdash; we must balance the scales, to use a clichè.  The demand for representation for the victim in such instance must be seen as a cry for normal justice, particularly when one considers that the accused is protected in the way he is and can be.</P>
    <P>I know there are other speakers who will cover areas that I will not and have no wish to cover.  I appreciate having the opportunity to speak on the Second Stage of this Bill.  I would emphasise that even if it needs a radical shift in legal procedure we must give the rape victims, the carers and the social workers and women in general what they require.</P>
    <P>When a rapist is convicted and sentenced he is imprisoned for a time and then, regardless of behaviour or tendencies, the person is released.  I do not know whether a remedy for this could be included in the Bill or if it would have to be included in guidelines.  At the moment we cannot detain a prisioner once the sentence is served, even if we know that the prisoner will continue to be a danger to society.</P>
    <P>Research has shown that unless the behaviour pattern of sexual criminals is altered they will continue to commit crimes.  We also know now that a great number of sexual abusers, sexually violent men, have themselves been the victims of sexual abuse.  That is sad, but hopeful in another way, as we can intervene to treat the abusers in order to change their behaviour patterns.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not give the protection that we would wish unless, when sentencing convicted rapists, there is a mandatory obligation for them to have treatment while in prison and a requirement that the sentence should not end until the person is no longer considered a danger to society, particularly to women.  In England and in some other countries a convicted person having served a sentence, having been treated, is allowed out into the community only as long as he continues to take treatment <Col N="627" /> in a community centre, just as some prisoners have to report for parole, and if the prisoner ceases to take treatment he is put back into prison.  In other countries sexually violent prisoners are treated and are monitored when allowed into society again.</P>
    <P>It would be a travesty of everything we are trying to do in this Bill if we did not build in procedures whereby the rape victim got justice and could feel the State would protect her.  When a convicted rapist is sentenced he should not be locked away as a punishment without including treatment and then allowed out, the authorities sometimes knowing that he poses a real danger to society. Medical treatment should be mandatory for a person inside and outside of prision until such time as it is effective.  That must be part of the sentencing process.  I must rely on the Minister and on the parliamentary draftsman in relation to this suggestion, which I know will be supported by all the Members, particularly in the light of some horrific cases on record where men who have served sentences have come out and raped and murdered women.  If we are talking about justice that cannot continue.</P>
    <P>I have talked about the treatment of the victim in court and the treatment of the offender.  As legislators we must ensure that the law gives protection and justice but above all it must give support and medical treatment to the victims. This Government and every other Government should see it as an absolute moral obligation to fund Rape Crisis Centres with State funding in the budget, so that the victims can get the psychological therapy, treatment and support they need.</P>

      <P>It is outrageous that Rape Crisis Centres are stumbling along dealing with money crises as well as rape crises.  They do not know whether they will be in existence from one week to the next, although they are dealing with the most fundamentally damaged victims in <Col N="628" /> our society.  A lot of long-term guilt results from rape and professional help is always needed.  If we really mean what we are putting into this Bill at one level, we cannot imagine that we are coping with the problem or recognising people working with the problem unless we give a State guarantee of funding to the Rape Crisis Centres.  That has to be part and parcel of the legislation.  We as legislators have every right to demand that.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I will not be able to speak to the principle of the Bill as I have done this afternoon on Second Stage, so I will put two further thoughts to the House now.  As long as we have illegal prostitution where women's bodies can be bought and men feel that they have the right to buy women's bodies to serve them sexually and the prostitute can be prosecuted but the man who buys her services is not prosecuted, then we are continuing the myth I started with, that women are available to be bought, sold and violated and are not really to be in control of their own bodies.  Secondly, as long as we allow pornography portraying the dehumanising brutalising imagery that it offers to men about women, we are not really getting to the core of the problem and we will have to bring in laws on rape trying to deal with offenders. We will have to solve this problem so that women will feel they are both independent and assertive and do not have to travel in their thousands in an effort to reclaim the night.  Women have done a lot in drawing attention to this problem but I say in the strongest terms that men also have a responsibility.  I am calling on the male Members of this House to take this problem seriously and to fight even more strongly because it is they who have to start the reform.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply, the present position is quite unsatisfactory. Hospitals and laboratories dispose of low level radioactive waste by storage on site. This presents certain problems.  High level radioactive waste is returned to the suppliers for disposal.  We all acknowledge that some positive action is needed but the question of identifying a site has presented some difficulties.  We will continue to work on this problem.  In the meantime we are having discussions with the Department of the Environment to see if some initiative can be taken on the disposal of toxic waste.</P>

      <P>It would not be appropriate to make a definitive application for EC assistance at this stage when no final decision has been made on the precise investment package which will be put in place at the refinery.  The task force on Whitegate upgrade, which will be looking at all investment options, will examine the possibility of accessing EC and other funding for those options and will make appropriate recommendations to the Government on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister clarify his reply?  In many other areas, for example, the provision of inter-connectors in the gas sector, applications have been made for EC funding, even though no precise decisions have been made.  Indeed, the Minister has deferred the making of precise decisions in this area for some time.  Why did he not include his tentative proposals in the <i>National Development Plan</i>, which was submitted to the EC?  Secondly, can he tell us if he has considered the EC's established policy of reducing refining capacity in the Community?  This has been established policy for some years.  Will this have any bearing on his proposals?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the Taoiseach's statement on the launch of the plan and can assure him that there will be a degree of flexibility in the management of that plan and in the negotiations with Brussels.  It is also <Col N="631" /> fair to say that the plan is fluid enough to allow the making of follow up proposals in respect of a project of this kind.  Finally, while no application has been made to Brussels, there will be ongoing discussions with the Commission on all these matters.  In my recent discussions with the relevant Commissioner I detected no reluctance on his part or on the part of his advisers to the Government's plans for the development of Whitegate.  I can assure the Deputy that no matter what policy is developed within the EC, it is acknowledged that we have only one refinery to meet our requirements.</P>

Secondly, given that the INPC are now being forced to endure losses of £2 million a month, can the Minister tell us if those funds are being used to cover such losses or are they to be reserved to ensure that they will be available for the purpose stated previously in this House, that is, in the upgrading of these facilities?</P>

      <P>Surely the policy of the Minister's Department is to encourage trade in the semi-mature market as this is the means by which private investment will be further encouraged to get into this area?  The stamp duty charges to which I referred are on the sale of timber &mdash; not land &mdash; and their abolition would encourage people to trade quickly in selling mature timber.

      <P>The Deputy is putting undue emphasis on the restructuring of Bord na Móna.  As he knows, the commissioning of that report was to examine quite a number of aspects as well as the question of restructuring.  While the main elements in the report deal with restructuring, they also cover in a much more emphatic way matters relating to the normal day to day management of the board and quite a number of suggestions in relation to where changes could be made.  These are of a fairly sensitive commercial nature and require negotiations between the management of Bord na Móna and the unions.

      <P>That view has been put to me on a few occasions and I have given it some consideration.  There is an urgency in regard to new arrangements which the board are making but, on deeper reflection, there is nothing in the Turf Development Bill which would be in conflict with the contents of the report. For that reason we should proceed with the Turf Development Bill as it is enabling legislation.  If, in due course, it is necessary to introduce amendments we can do so but I do not see the direct necessity for that now.  I would prefer to have the legislative mechanics to enable Bord na Móna to proceed more freely with future developments and I should like to have the support of the House in that regard.</P>

      <P>I did not regard that episode as creating confusion nor do I want to make light of the Deputy's problems in this regard.  When the Taoiseach dealt with this matter in the Dáil he indicated that no negotiations had taken place and we have continually emphasised the fact that that was the position.  We said that there had been discussions with a number of interested parties with a view to developing a satisfactory linkage with an oil producer in the context of the development of a refinery for the future.  That position still obtains.</P>

This has presented some problems for a number of interested countries but it is important to lay down the ground rules very firmly in the beginning.  We have done that and, in spite of the rather stringent measures, which I hope will be in place ultimately, we have been able to get a reasonably satisfactory response up to now.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The medium targets have been set out for the company in the context of the recent national plan.  In this, Coillte Teoranta's first year of operation, the emphasis is on the establishment of a new <Col N="639" /> commercial structure and an overall reduction in costs while, at the same time, maintaining a planting rate of a least 10,000 hectares and timber production of at least 1.5 million cubic metres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Alyward Mr. Alyward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alyward</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to bear in mind that the company was established on 1 January last.  They have been making exceptional progress since and, in fact, will exceed their target.  There is little the company can do about the growth of timber in State forests.  The only avenue open to them is to improve their operations, and they have done that since they were established.  The objectives set out in the national plan must be met by 1993 and, judging by the progress to date, there is little doubt but that the company will meet those objectives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>During 1988, the Whitegate Oil Refinery processed approximately 1.35 million tonnes of crude oil.  All of this crude oil originated in the North Sea.  Whitegate refinery can process a variety of different crude oil types and blends.  Since coming into State ownership in 1982 the refinery has processed crude oil from several oil producing areas.  INPC monitor a series of different crudes on an on-going basis in order to determine an optimum purchasing policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The refinery has been able to process crude from Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the North Sea.  Specifications change from time to time and environmental considerations and others will require stiffer specifications for petroleum products in the future.  Two considerations arise from that: do we confine ourselves to the import of crude which, at the initial stage, is more environmentally desirable and capable of producing a high percentage of petrol, the product we are concerned about, or do we import a different product which would require more expenditure at refinery level to produce a comparative product?  There are risks involved in both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we choose the more environmentally desirable product and there is not sufficient of it the price could go through the roof.  If we select the more difficult process we will be involved in considerably higher expenditure in the context of the development of the refinery. Those matters require detailed study and I would not want at this stage to come down heavily on either side.  A degree of flexibility in the refinery is most desirable. We should be able to shift from one emphasis to the other so that we will not be constrained by international considerations which could, if we were bound <Col N="641" /> to one product, force up the price to an extraordinarily high level.</P>

Irrespective of whether the Whitegate refinery is upgraded and improved to such an extent that it can refine Russian crude oil, will the environmental problems continue in relation to oil from that source?</P>

However, the technical advice to me is that it is possible to have a blend which would meet the necessary specifications. In other words, we would not be purchasing from one producer, we may well have a number of producers and that combination will have to be put into a proper form.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy whether he has carried out any study of the structure of gas pricing in Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Natural gas pricing is monitored by my Department.  Gas prices in Ireland, in line with other European countries, are also periodically surveyed by the European Commission and other international agencies.  Moreover, I am empowered, under section 11 of the Gas Act, 1976, to issue directives of a general nature on pricing policy, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  In the circumstances I do not consider a formal study of the structure of gas prices in Ireland to be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister why there is such an enormous contrast between the £1.32 per therm which small <Col N="645" /> users in Dublin pay and the cost of 15p per therm industrial users pay?  It would seem that that enormous gap would take some explanation particularly in view of the fact that the Dublin low user is paying 50 per cent more than his EC counterpart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain aspects of this matter which are not easy to deal with and I do not think that the trotting out of EC averages in this context is very helpful.  So far as the EC is concerned, as the Deputy knows, on average we are below it in some cases and slightly over in other cases.  The problems in regard to the smaller consumer relate to the usage of the gas.  If we could succeed in getting a higher proportion of this trade it would seem that the case for a reduction would be all the more meritorious.  The Gas Board have been seeking ways and means of trying to improve their position with regard to that premium market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, does the Minister not agree that it is disturbing that other countries have succeeded in supplying gas to the low volume consumer at dramatically lower prices than we have been able to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy continually surprises me in regard to this area.  When we make comparisons with the EC it would be nice if we were like the UK, where there is a massive network and a number of wells which project a secure source of supply for a very long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have cheaper gas than the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We are just developing the infrastructure and much effort has been put in during the past few years to try to expand the network and corner the market.  That has to be given some time to develop.  We are not comparable with many other countries in the way the Deputy seems to suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, there is room for improvement in the pricing area to the small consumer and I would welcome the <Col N="646" /> possibility of being able to do more in that area but it is fairly closely related to the potential development of that market.  In relation to the larger consumer, the price is directly related to the cost of fuel which is being displaced by the use of gas.  We are into a totally competitive position there and any adjustment upwards to compensate for what would appear to be happening at other levels would lose you that transaction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the small consumer subsidising the major industrial consumer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he is pursuing any strategy with the Minister for the Environment, particularly, in relation to the environmental aspect of fuels generally?  Given that the Air Pollution Act is in place, smokeless zones have been designated in various parts of Dublin, that natural gas produces no smoke at all and that, as we know, domestic coal fires are responsible for about 80 per cent of all smoke pollution here, would the Minister not agree it is highly desirable that greater encouragement be given to domestic consumers to take up natural gas?  Would the Minister not further agree, if he accepts that, that the way to do this and bring it about is to have a tariff structure and pricing system which would encourage greater use of natural gas by the domestic sector? Is there any formal strategy being pursued by the Minister or his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, in relation to this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but naturally we are concerned to ensure that the best possible <Col N="647" /> use is made of this national natural resource which is so environmentally friendly in the context of the present environmental problems.  There are commercial aspects to this matter as well and the Gas Board, in the light of their current financial situation and the infrastructure which has to be developed have to operate on the basis of good management and commercial practices.  We are doing all we can within these constraints to enhance that market and I have taken every opportunity available to me both inside and outside this House to emphasise the value of this developing energy infrastructure.  If there are other suggestions I can take on board to enhance this I would be very glad to hear them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there are commercial considerations involved but what I am really asking the Minister is whether he would not accept also that there are very major environmental and public health factors involved and that this matter should be given very serious consideration when gas pricing is being taken into account?  It is the ideal solution to this major problem which exists in Dublin in particular and it should be pursued vigorously and a price structure arrived at whereby there would be a greater uptake of natural gas by domestic consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>During 1988 Bord Gáis Éireann completed the extension of the natural gas network from Dublin to Dundalk. During the coming months Bord Gáis Éireann plan to construct a series of spurlines from this pipeline to supply <Col N="648" /> natural gas to the horticultural areas of North County Dublin.</P>
      <P>Further extensions to supply commercial and industrial customers adjacent to the network will continue to be undertaken where it is commercially viable to do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The prospect of additional gas, better security of supply and the greater interest which is now developing so far as exploration in the Celtic Sea is concerned, all combine to enable Bord Gáis to look afresh at new commercial opportunities for an extension of the main pipeline.  I have already met the chief executive with this in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister to expand more on the present state of play with regard to the extension of the line to the horticultural areas of North County Dublin?  Will the Minister indicate to the House the likely degree of take-up of the service among the growers in that area?  Has he in any way liaised with his colleagues in the Department of Agriculture and Food to ensure the takeup and availability of the service to that area will be matched and married to a proper development of agricultural and horticultural growth in the area, particularly in regard to glass house development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned in my earlier reply, that work is proceeding.  Bord Gáis Éireann have got commitments from 20 growers covering approximately 50 acres of heated greenhouses.  If you like, this was the minimum required at the initial stage to make a commercial decision with regard to these spurlines. That has been achieved but clearly there is room for growth there.  The whole reason for the development was to enable <Col N="649" /> horticultural interests in that area to compete more favourably with their counterparts abroad.  Clearly consideration of further developments and enhancement of that field is central to all of this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been reported in recent days as favouring a new look at the provision of a gas line to Northern Ireland.  Is the Minister thinking in terms of present gas resources or additional ones which appear to be about to come on stream from the Celtic Sea? Has the Minister had any talks with his counterpart in the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>My discussions with the Secretary of State for Energy earlier in the week covered that general agenda. The question of additional gas resources in the Celtic Sea are central to future possibilities for the security of gas supply and the extension of the existing pipeline. Arrangements are in train at present for a meeting with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Mr. Tom King, which will probably take place in the course of the next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on from that reply, in the past price has been the impediment.  During our term in Government they refused to take the gas when <Col N="650" /> an offer was made to them.  I do not know whether there were political reasons but the reason advanced was price.  Does the Minister think he can now offer gas to them at an acceptable price?  Is the Minister afraid that there may be a parallel here when it comes to sabotage and destruction with regard to the rail line between Dublin and Belfast and the electricity supply line between South and North&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the IRA may well sabotage any such connection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the second part of the Deputy's question, I said I would not be paralysed or compromised in this matter by security considerations.  We have a clear responsibility to try to explore the potential of sales, where we can, with these resources in the South and particularly where we can facilitate our neighbours in Northern Ireland. However, I am under no illusions.  The Deputy has pinpointed difficulties which might well arise.  We must endeavour to surmount any such difficulties and not have ourselves consigned to being unable to take action on an absolutely permanent basis on account of actions by totally irresponsible groups in the country.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's earlier question as to whether the price of gas will be acceptable ultimately, I should point out that there are two aspects involved.  It is not merely a question of the price being acceptable to the people with whom I will be negotiating.  I must also obtain an acceptable arrangement from my point of view.  At least there appears to be the basis on which a better understanding can be reached.  While the price was an issue in the previous negotiations, the Deputy will agree that there may well have been extenuating considerations also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would constitute a major <Col N="651" /> coup if the Minister could achieve some success in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that, to some extent, that horse has bolted in that the major consumer markets in Northern Ireland have made substantial investments in conversion that close off many of our options in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that, in the intervening years, the dismantling of some of the older systems and the transference to new energy sources have limited the possibilities and potential of this market.  Nevertheless, the information furnished to me is that there are some fairly strong commercial and industrial interests that maintain a very keen eye on developments in this area.  There is also the other question of the best possible use of our resources in the context of the closeness of the geographical link, since the pipeline has now been developed to Dundalk, and the potential for a spurline northwards even on a testing basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if his Department have any plans to reduce the price of petrol by recommending to the Minister for Finance the reduction in the level of excise and tax; the level of taxation in the gross price of a gallon of petrol; the estimated profit margin to the oil companies and retailers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Price control on petroleum products is the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce while the Minister for Finance has responsibility for setting rates of excise duty and value added tax on such products.  I do not propose to inform the House of discussions of a confidential nature between myself and other Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current level of excise duty and <Col N="652" /> value added tax on leaded petrol is 30.35 pence per litre and 25 per cent respectively. At a current retail price of 62.5 pence per litre &mdash; or £2.84 per gallon &mdash; excise and VAT together amount to 42.85 pence &mdash; or £1.95 per gallon &mdash; or 68.6 per cent of gross price.</P>
    <P>I do not have official information on estimated profit margins enjoyed by either oil companies or retailers.  The margin on petrol currently allowed to companies and retailers under the maximum price order is 3.97 pence and 3.38 pence per litre respectively.  These permitted margins cover all overheads including profit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the fixed excise which goes to make up most of the 68 per cent tax constitutes an enormous barrier to any price competition in this market between existing suppliers?  Would he agree that it would be preferable that a large part of this exercise be made <i>ad valorem</i> in the same way as applies to tobacco duties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Primarily these are matters for the Minister for Finance in the context of budgetary considerations.  In these areas clearly it would be very desirable if there were financial scope to make adjustments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the combination of VAT and excise duties on petrol &mdash; which comprise 70 per cent of its retail price at the pump &mdash; is an appallingly high level of taxation on a vital commodity?  The Minister has said he does not have responsibility in this area.  However, he is a member of the Government and certainly has collective responsibility as far as these matters are concerned.  Rather than resort to the type of <i>ad hoc</i>, artificial arrangements that have obtained in the past couple of weeks &mdash; whereby the INPC are being forced to incur losses and an effective subsidy being given the consumer &mdash; would the Minister <Col N="653" /> agree it would make a lot more sense for a reduction in VAT or excise duties on petrol to bring our costs in that sector more into line with those of our competitors elsewhere?  Furthermore, would he not agree that, as far as the cost of petrol is concerned, we have reached the point of diminishing returns, with serious consequences for economic development generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the light of the prevailing financial situation.  I do not accept the description of the present arrangements as being <i>ad hoc</i> and undesirable. We have managed in a fairly difficult international climate to keep price rises to an absolute minimum against very considerable odds.  The part of that burden which is being borne by the INPC can very well be adjusted as the price of oil lowers from now until the autumn.  We clearly indicated at that time that we anticipated a drop in prices and our consideration of that has been justified in the light of international events.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>

Would the Minister also agree that this a remarkable state of affairs for a Minister for Energy to say that he has no hard information with regard to the profits of the multinational <Col N="654" /> oil companies on the one hand when, on the other, he is compelling his own company &mdash; the Irish National Petroleum Company &mdash; to incur losses of £2 million to maintain an unreal price to the companies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy the results of the most recent survey of the Dublin Gas network; and in particular (i) the percentage of gas being lost from the system and (ii) the number and classification of accidental leaks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin Gas have carried out two complete surveys of the mains network, the first in late 1987 and the second in early 1988.  A third survey which commenced in September 1988 is nearing completion.  Since mid-1987 apartment blocks have been surveyed eight times.  The ninth such survey is currently under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scope of the most recent surveys has been broadened from that of the earlier ones.  The results of the latest surveys indicate an increase in the number of leaks being detected as compared with the numbers detected in earlier surveys. I am informed by Dublin Gas that this is due in part to tighter technical procedures, experience and to the increased level of quality control being applied to these surveys.  Variations in the results are to be expected from time to time and give no immediate cause for concern.  I can assure the Deputy that I am keeping a close watch on the results and that there will be no diminution in the level of <Col N="656" /> monitoring being carried out by officials of my Department.  The frequency of these surveys is in excess of the requirements of all of the safety reports and will continue so.</P>
    <P>The other principal means of measuring the improvements in the safety of the Dublin Gas network is the level of gas lost from the system and the numbers of publicly reported escapes.  In 1988 gas lost from the Dublin Gas network was under 4 million therms or approximately 4 per cent of gas issued.  At present, the level of lost gas in Dublin compares very favourably with the levels encountered in the best run European gas utilities.  This also means that the task force requirement of reducing lost gas to 2,000 therms per kilometre of main per year has already been comfortably achieved.</P>
    <P>The number of publicly reported escapes (PRE's) in Dublin has continued to decline steadily.  Typically, these publicly reported escapes are averaging 300-350 per week, about one-third the early 1987 level.  The current level of PREs is equivalent to less than 7 PREs per kilometre of main per year, which is lower than the task force target of 8.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Bord Gáis Éireann on the progress they are making in this area.  Can the Minister give the House an assurance that the high level of monitoring which is going on will continue at the present level until we can be absolutely satisfied that a lower rate of survey can be allowed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy with regard to safety standards that any monitoring, any surveying that is required will meet not only the best standards &mdash; as far as comparison with the EC level is concerned &mdash; but the optimum possible.  In relation to safety, people can be assured of a safe network, which is paramount.  As the Deputy has acknowledged, Bord Gáis Éireann have not only met but have exceeded the expectations of the task force in this regard on all fronts and are to be highly complimented on their capacity to deliver on a fairly tough assignment.  There will be no <Col N="657" /> relenting and no going back from carrying this through to the ultimate degree of safety and assurance to the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the quality of the surveys being carried out?  I understood him to say in reply to the question that the most recent surveys had indicated that there was actually an increase in gas leaks.  I further understood him to say that that was attributed to improved methods of detecting gas leaks.  While it is comfortable to note from the Minister's reply that the task force's targets have been achieved in relation to gas leaks, I would like an assurance that he is happy with the quality and the way in which these surveys are carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is always a bit strong to say that one is happy because there are always areas which require constant and dedicated attention.  On the basis of my discussions with Bord Gáis Éireann, I am satisfied that an all-out effort, begun a couple of years ago, has been maintained and is now being strengthened by new technical measures of detection.  From a purely commercial point of view, whatever the rate of escape, it is costly.  If there is a better technical way of detecting that leak it is not only in the safety interest but in the commercial interest of Bord Gáis Éireann to detect it more quickly when it requires less treatment to change and to make it safe.  All in all, I can assure the Deputy that I am quite satisfied.  That will not, of course, change my determination to make sure that we have ongoing discussions and that every effort is made to use the most up-to-date technical knowledge in order to improve still further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Col N="658" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest estimate of recoverable reserves for the Kinsale Head gas field, which is to date our only commercial oil or gas discovery, is 1.45 trillion cubic feet.</P>
      <P>Other gas discoveries have been made in the Celtic Sea and oil accumulations have been discovered in both the Celtic Sea and the Porcupine Basin off the west coast, but none of these has so far been deemed commercial by the companies concerned and estimates of recoverable reserves have not been announced. Marathon's discovery of gas last month on block 48/20 off the Cork coast is being assessed further by appraisal well drilling. While very encouraging, it is too early yet to estimate recoverable reserves.</P>
      <P>While all information relating to these discoveries, including estimates of recoverable reserves, in many cases is available to my Department, I am not at liberty to disclose this information until such time as a declaration of commerciality and an announcement of estimated recoverable reserves is made by the operating company in each case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be anything like as significant as the original find.  The problem is that the original find took on a completely different complexion after further assessment.  One must wait.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>How long does the Minister expect it will take before we have confirmation of the actual potential or output of that field?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the <Col N="659" /> licence, as far as I can recall, companies have approximately two years to declare commerciality, or otherwise.  That is the legal or statutory requirement.  It would be unusual if the company were to delay that long.  Since drilling which is going on at present would appear to be aimed at assessing the full potential of the most recent find, I would expect a decision in relation to its commerciality to come fairly soon thereafter.  The closeness of this find to the existing Kinsale Head gas field adds to its commercial potential in that it would not require a new head works, is only 8 km, and could be linked into the existing field on the sea bed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I understand correctly that the Minister said he had not yet been advised by any of the other exploration companies beyond Kinsale Head of their estimated finds?  Could he explain to the House why this is so? Would he agree that this is an unusual position, that it leaves the Minister in an extremely weak position in terms of planning and knowing how this whole area of our resource is progressing and what its potential is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what I said was that the other areas were not deemed to be commercial.  Estimates have been given on the reserve.  For instance, the oil in the Porcupine Basin is at such a depth that current technology in relation to the extraction of the oil has not been able to satisfy the commercial criteria for a find of that kind.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the international oil price at its current level, and from my own and the national point of view I would hope it would stay at that level, probably presents some problems for companies where oil is in what we call expensive waters, in determining its commerciality, or bringing it on stream.  There are physical problems as well as commercial ones in this regard.  It is not a question of leaving the Government at a disadvantage. We understand the problems that exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Accepting that an individual company may well have commercial difficulties in realising a potential find, I presume that in all these licences available to companies there are revocation clauses if the Government are not satisfied that the companies are moving with speed.  It appears that the Minister is relying on company by company information, as opposed to any independent source of information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I did not make myself clear.  There is a requirement on the companies to give very detailed information to the petroleum division of my Department, not on a monthly, bi-monthly or annual basis but sometimes on a 24 hour basis on, for instance, seismic data.  The companies are obliged to pass on these details, so there is no question of the Department of Energy and their petroleum division not knowing exactly and precisely what is happening.  I assure the Deputy on that front.  I have gone to some length to look into all these arrangements in recent times and I am quite satisfied that there is no area for doubt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that while he has certain information, there are reserves, for instance in deep waters like the Porcupine Bank, which are not commercially viable.  I think he explained that they are not commercially viable by virtue of the fact that <Col N="661" /> the international price of oil at this time may not be sufficiently high to make them commercially viable.  Has the Minister any indication from any source as to what level the international price of oil would have to reach before those reserves become extractable?  This is an important factor, given that the Minister has used it in his argument as to why these reserves have not been exploited.  If they are dependent on international oil price factors, he must have some indication as to what level the international oil price would have to go to before the reserves are commercially viable.</P>

      <P>Correct.  You can look at oil development in any part of the world. A find in the Porcupine Basin now so distanced from any other infrastructure possibly could be dealt with if there were a network of infrastructure in that area.

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if, in view of the failure of Tara Mines to pay any royalties to date despite being in operation for more than ten years, the Government will ensure that any future mining leases specify that a royalty should be payable on each tonne of ore extracted from the ground, rather than on disclosed profits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware from my recent announcement, the question of payment of royalties by Tara has been resolved in a most satisfactory way.  The terms of any future mining lease will be a matter for my discretion based on the individual circumstances of each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most disappointed at the Minister, who had earlier described himself as helpful.  Would he not agree that the saga of Government involvement in Tara Mines is probably the sorriest story that has ever emanated from his Department or any Government dealing with the area of natural resources?  In 1988, a company achieved profits of £18.5 million; over their period of life to date they have extracted 4.25 million tonnes of zinc and until this month had not paid one penny in royalties. Would he not agree that this is a disgrace and a national scandal?  Would the Minister not agree also that if one lesson clearly comes out of this matter, it must be that the Government should change the base on which royalties are extracted from companies?  In other words, it <Col N="663" /> should not be based on profit &mdash; we have been danced about by the owners of Tara &mdash; but based on the rate at which ore is extracted or the resources taken from the seabed or wherever else.  Surely Government can make that decision in principle if nothing more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am entirely satisfied, and any independent assessment of the deal that has been done on Tara substantiates this, that that was a successful conclusion from the State's point of view, I admit it is in the State's interest in any future deliberations of this kind to change some of the ground rules in regard to the way that arrangement is structured. While I would not go so far as to describe it in the way the Deputy has, it was a rather unique arrangement.  Thank God, we have nothing like the same problems with a number of other companies and mining operations.</P>
      <P>Suggestions have been made to move away from royalties based on profits and on to tonnage.  It may be that there are certain kinds of mines where royalties on the basis of tonnage would be a desirable option.  One would have to take into account here the difference between the ore and the waste.  There are problems in using that type of criteria and maybe in the long run a blend or mix of the two would be more desirable.  There are lessons to be learned and I intend to examine any new cases in the light of these experiences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister scope at this stage for looking at the royalty terms of the other major finds that now exist in Ireland on this point?  If not, will he be in a position to publish, in the way he did in the case of oil terms, some royalty system perhaps with allowance for marginal fields or whatever, so that the House can be assured that the lessons have been learned from this experience and that we will not be left depending on what emerges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to go down that road completely.  Naturally, I <Col N="664" /> am very interested in trying to keep things as open as possible, but there is a terrific variation in mining operations.  In certain mining considerations if you were to operate on a tonnage basis, particularly those that are more or less on the margin of being commercial, with the risk involved, you may well end up not being able to get the operation off the ground or you may force a premature closure, losing jobs etc.  Bearing in mind the different constraints, I will go as far as I can to prepare a blueprint for this area, but the Deputy will have to take into account that ultimately I will have to make decisions on the basis of each operation. The general principles on which the State would negotiate contracts concerning royalties, dividends, etc. can be put in place by allowing the Minister, depending on the kind of mine, to have the greatest degree of flexibility possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the ground rules do not need to be changed in the sense that the terms under which a mining company would extract ore from the ground are not agreed until a mining lease has been issued, and the exploration lease which they are given to determine whether there are any resources there at all does not lay down any preconditions under which it would be extracted?  Effectively, the Minister has total freedom to impose whatever kind of taxation, royalty or State participation system he wishes.  In view of what Deputy McCartan referred to in relation to Tara Mines, where the State obtained no royalties, would the Minister agree it would be much more appropriate and to the benefit of the State that we should go for production royalties?  In relation to Tara the Minister confirmed he was very satisfied with the price. About one third of the price included writing off royalty payments which were due to the Government anyway.  That is all the more reason we should have a production system.</P>

      <P>Earlier we had a debate initiated by the Minister for Social Welfare on behalf of the Minister for Justice and I thought it was noteworthy as I glanced around the Chamber to see that four of the 14 women Deputies in this House were present and very few of the male Deputies were present for that debate.

      <P>Or not coming up.  The point I am making is not so much to berate the male Deputies as to point out that this Bill has implications not just for women but for men.  This Bill sets about changing the perceptions that have been in existence in relation to rape over a long number of years.  The process was initiated in 1981 but it is being continued now, and major changes in approach are incorporated in the Bill.  Despite the fact that like Deputy Barnes I would look for even further changes, I think all Deputies in this House have a duty to lead public opinion on this and to inform the public at large of their views.  I hope that by the end of the Second Stage debate we will have had a chance to hear a wide variety of views, particularly from a good proportion of male Deputies.</P>

      <P>This Bill is to be welcomed. A number of groups, including the Oireachtas committee, the Rape Crisis Centre and the Law Reform Commission, have sought changes in legislation on rape.  It has taken many years to come about.  This I do not understand because there has been a great deal of discussion and work on this subject. Nevertheless, we now have a Bill which makes a good deal of headway in dealing with rape.  Once more it is simply catching up on public opinion.  Members of this House, far from being the leaders of public opinion, more often than not lag well behind.  When they get around to changing legislation, events have often overtaken those changes.  This is one of the things we might come up against in relation to this Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome a certain widening of the definition of rape compared to what we have at present.  A major flaw is that there has been something of a cop out by substituting the offence of aggravated sexual assault for the widening of the definition of rape.  In a very strong report the Law Reform Commission recommended, having looked at a number of jurisdictions and developments in law throughout the world, going as far as New Zealand, Western Australia and Canada, that the definition of rape be widened to include the kinds of offences which are now included under the heading of aggravated sexual assault.  They further recommended that the 1981 Act should be amended so that the words &ldquo;sexual intercourse&rdquo; should read &ldquo;sexual connection&rdquo;. Whereas that seems at first glance to be a very major step, a grave change in thinking, it is very logical in terms of the perception of sexual offences today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me back to my initial comment that this Bill affects men as well as women.  It very definitely includes offences against men.  There is no doubt that there are offences committed against men from time to time which could be classified as rape in ordinary parlance.  It <Col N="687" /> is not for this House to stray from ordinary parlance.  It is differentiating between what is the law and what is understood to be right and proper in the outside world.</P>
    <P>I would pose a question to the Minister. In bringing in new definitions under this Bill and the new offence of aggravated sexual assault, from what vantage point do we define rape?  Deputy Barnes spoke earlier about the very strong property-based approach to rape, the very strong emphasis on the loss or maintenance of one's virginity if one is a female.  I would have to contrast that with what I believe to be the proper approach, which is to decide on the definition of rape in terms of its effect on the person &mdash; it is a crime of violence against the person, whether male or female.  The bulk of thinking on the crime of rape has developed over the past ten or 15 years and it is now very much regarded as a crime of violence which does not involve the loss of virginity <i>per se.</i>  To find that a Bill is presented to this House in 1989 based on that differentiation is an indication that it is ill-judged and out of touch with reality.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission recommended changing the word &ldquo;intercourse&rdquo; to &ldquo;connection&rdquo;, which would have allowed a wider definition of rape to involve what is included in the aggravated sexual assault offence.  There is no doubt that those who have suffered the kinds of assaults we are speaking about, even though they may not be defined statutorily as rape, feel that they have been raped or invaded.  It is interesting that in writing my notes for this debate that is the word which came to mind.  I note that Deputy Barnes used the same word.  The sense of invasion of one's bodily integrity, no matter whether it is committed with a penis or inanimate objects is similarly felt.</P>
    <P>One cannot simply disregard the effect of the crime and the sense of being violently abused when drawing up legislation. To differentiate in those terms is <Col N="688" /> to fly in the face of reality.  The feeling of degradation which the victim has is as strong in the case of non-penile rape as it is with the understood definition of rape up to now.  Those who have worked with victims of this type of violence say that the feeling of degradation is even more present when oral or anal sex is involved. There is a greater sense of disgust.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the definition recommended by the Law Reform Commission, strongly argued for and researched very widely, has been simply ignored in this legislation.  The Minister in his speech did not put forward an acceptable explanation for that.  The major reason mentioned was that it would cause difficulties, fly in the face of tradition, somehow be too awkward to handle.  If one is introducing reforming legislation one should be open to radical change when necessary.  There is no doubt that radical change is necessary in this area.</P>
    <P>Research into the crime of rape and other associated crimes in recent years established that the overriding feeling of a victim of this offence is of being powerless, of being a victim.  They are subject to the kind of violence that makes them feel they have no power, they cannot change things and their humanity is denied.  They have no option, no choice and they are being used as objects.  This is true whether we apply the normal definition of rape or non-penile rape.  I know that the feelings of these victims are the same.</P>
    <P>In other jurisdictions definitions are not confined to whether or not pregnancy follows the rape or assault. It seems to me that the kind of thinking that has gone into the change in perceptions and attitudes over the last ten or 15 years is totally ignored in the definition in this Bill.  To concentrate on the old definition of rape is to concentrate on the sexual aspect of the assault and not on the violent aspect, and all thinking and research in regard to these offences in recent years <Col N="689" /> point to the fact that this is a crime of violence.  To refer to the sexual aspect of the assault and to maintain that definition in this legislation is to confuse the issue. In 1981 when the previous legislation was brought about there was not perhaps as clear an understanding of that, certainly in Ireland.  That understanding has developed over the last eight years.  It has developed with the openness that has come about because of the work of the Rape Crisis Centre, because of the opening of debate and discussion and it is a very healthy thing; but why, when this is our one opportunity in eight or nine years to form this legislation, are we not taking into account the reality that this is not a crime of a sexual nature but a crime of violence and maintaining the differentiation between rape and aggravated sexual assault on the basis that it is a sexual crime and not a violent crime?</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister why there is such resistance to redefinition.  I do not understand why the older style of definition is retained.  From what vantage point is the Minister looking at it?  In the speech which the Minister delivered earlier he says that the obvious conclusion we must come to is that we should retain the existing definition of rape which has not given rise to any difficulties. That is not the point at issue. The point at issue is that it is not the rape cases which are causing problems but the other cases which are not now defined as rape.  It is the other cases which we wish to see defined as rape which have given rise to difficulties and have allowed women, and men too, who were subject to those attacks to feel degraded because it is not admitted officially that they have suffered this attack; they feel as if they had been raped but the State, the court and other institutions do not recognise that.  It is those cases which do not neatly fit into the rape definition which have given rise to difficulties, and the Minister studiously ignores that and attempts to say that because rape cases have not <Col N="690" /> given rise to difficulties in terms of definition that everything is hunky-dory.</P>
    <P>I would strongly urge the Minister to review his approach to this Bill.  He will find that we on this side of the House will be of any assistance we can in helping him to come to a different conclusion. We are going to get one shot at this for the next decade.  We will probably not get another chance to change the definitions and review the legislation.  If we do not do it now, if we persist in maintaining this old-fashioned attitude, we will soon find ourselves out of touch with reality.</P>
    <P>Let me move to the issue of consent.  I note that the Bill has failed in its attempt to improve the situation about consent and to ensure that there is no doubt that a lack of struggling or offering resistance does not constitute consent, by not defining consent positively.  Again the Law Reform Commission report strongly recommended that there should be a positive definition of consent.  They instanced in their draft of a Bill that they were to put before the Attorney General a particular part of the code in another country in which it was quite clear that consent meant a consent freely and voluntarily given and without in any way affecting or limiting the meaning otherwise attributable to those words; a consent is not freely and voluntarily given if it is obtained by force, threat, intimidation, deception or fraudulent means.  Further, they say it should include that a failure to offer physical resistance to sexual assault does not of itself constitute consent to sexual assault.  In drafting this Bill the Minister has sought only to include the second part of that, which is a negative approach to the problem, and there is no doubt that it would serve the purpose of prosecuting these cases in a clearer manner if the first part, that is, the actual definition of consent, were to be included.  I do not understand why it has not been.  Perhaps the Minister has a good reason.  Perhaps in his reply he will indicate that there are major pitfalls and that therefore it cannot be included; but I <Col N="691" /> think the defining of consent involving the reference to force, threat, intimidation, deception or fraudulent means is a worthwhile addition to the Bill and should be included.  The Bill as it stands falls very far short of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission. I believe including this definition would not cause a problem but would improve the prosecution of these cases and also inform prospective complainants of exactly what is intended by the Legislature when they define consent.  All around, it is something that should be included.</P>
    <P>I welcome provisions removing any misunderstandings in our present law relating to rape within marriage.  It would be incomprehensible to insist that a wife in a difficult marriage situation must be subject to her husband in matters of sexual intercourse.  I cannot see how one can defend the situation where a wife can prosecute somebody whom she knows, not necessarily a stranger, who rapes her but cannot prosecute her husband.  To go back to the definition which I was talking about earlier, if it is a crime of violence and it is committed by her husband, it is still a crime of violence, something on which she should have redress.  I welcome the provision in the Bill in that connection but I do have a query: there is no provision in the Law Reform Commission Report relating to the requirement for the Director of Public Prosecutions to initiate prosecutions under this section. If they saw no particular reason to insert it, I am puzzled as to why it is there.  The Minister has not explained it.  I could understand it if the Bill had required all prosecutions for these offences to be initiated by the Director of Public Prosecutions; but why should the prosecution of an offence that might be committed within marriage be alone singled out to be initiated by the Director of Public Prosecutions?  That needs to be answered.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of that requirement is <Col N="692" /> that when the Director of Public Prosecutions is approached to initiate a prosecution by a wife against a husband how is he to decide whether to follow it up? On what is the Director of Public Prosecutions to base his decision?  There is no guidance for him in this Bill and there is no precedent in this Bill or in any similar legislation.  I have no violent objection to the Director of Public Prosecutions being involved in these cases but I cannot differentiate between the situation in a marriage and that outside of a marriage.  I seek the Minister's explanation on that.</P>
    <P>The provision that the judge may warn the jury of the danger of convicting an accused without corroboration is important. In these cases there is a difficulty in that very often it is one person's word against another and contrary to the perception of the general public, most rapes occur between people who know each other.  I noticed in the consultation paper of the Law Reform Commission that they fell into the trap of differentiating or contrasting rape within marriage and the rape of a woman by a total stranger.  In reality very few rapes are committed by total strangers.  Rapes are often committed in the privacy of home or in private surroundings so that it is one person's word against another together with the other evidence adduced.  It should be open to the judge not to have to warn a jury of this danger about lack of corroboration. A judge should be able to use his discretion as to the weight of the evidence and so on.  However, this is something that is a very useful addition in legislation on these matters.</P>
    <P>A major difficulty for those who were dealing with victims of sexual assault in the past relates to where the complainants previous sexual experience was introduced in evidence.  Like Deputy Barnes, I welcome the new provision that an application must be made at the beginning of the trial in order to adduce this evidence later.  I hope that in allowing for that evidence to be brought forward the courts will not find it necessary to grant <Col N="693" /> this permission on a regular basis because to do so would devalue the intention of the section which is to bring to an absolute minimum the necessity to examine the complainant's previous sexual history. The past sexual history of a complainant with anybody other than the defendant should almost never be involved in the case.  In some cases her history with the defendant may need to be looked at but the courts should not allow this in most cases as it would defeat the purpose of the section.  There is no doubt that many defence lawyers have set out to blacken the character of the victim so that in the end the balance of the burden of proof was left within the victim and not with the defendant.  By innuendo and snide remarks some defence lawyers make it their business to go after a victim in this way.  This practice has not been as prevalent in the last year or 18 months as it was before because there has been a lot of controversy about it.  Obviously the spirit of the Bill should be maintained, even if this is allowed under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill in its references to bringing all rape and associated cases to the Central Criminal Court sets out to give a certain status to these crimes.  Since 1981 all criminal cases have been tried in the Circuit Court, except for murder and attempted murder.  This is not a good enough reason in general to put witnesses, the police, the accused, friends and relatives, court officials and everybody else involved to the trouble of coming to Dublin for every rape case. There are plusses and minuses in this policy.  Among the plusses would be that judges in these cases would work up a great deal of experience in dealing with them.  On the minus side, there probably would be delays.  After all, the 1981 Courts Act in its provisions intended to reduce delays that had built up in the system.  It would be unfortunate if by providing for the centralisation of all rape and associated cases, we were to go back to the bad old days.  There is no doubt <Col N="694" /> that the sooner a case is heard the better from the point of view of all concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the number of cases last year and said that that was the general run of things.  That is not the case.  There has been an increase in the number of cases over the past few years and there will be an even greater increase in the number of cases when this Bill is passed.  Only the tip of the iceberg is being dealt with at the moment.  Anybody who works with the rape crisis centres or in any of the helping agencies will confirm that the number of cases that come to the courts is minimal compared with the number of cases investigated by counsellors and which even get to the stage of being reported to the Garda but do not get past that for all sorts of reasons. Hopefully this Bill will help in that area.</P>
    <P>There will be a growth in the number of cases coming to the courts.  I am under no misapprehension about that and neither should the House be.  That will put an extra strain on the Central Criminal Court, not to mention the cost, the inconvenience and strain that would be put on everybody who must come to Dublin and put themselves up in hotels or whatever away from their normal surroundings. There is also the fact that those who are legally involved, solicitors, barristers and so on, all have to come from their normal working areas so that a sort of caravan effect will be created.  I wonder if it warrants that.  I am not certain that it does.  This aspect should be looked at again.  I know the Minister is aware of some apprehensions that have been voiced by people working in this area.  Perhaps he should consider those again.  If we want to give the impression that we regard rape seriously, the least we can do is define &ldquo;rape&rdquo; properly.  If the Government, in having all cases brought before the Central Criminal Court, are simply engaging in a cosmetic exercise of redefining rape as a serious offence they can do this by defining it properly having regard to some of the defects in the Bill. <Col N="695" /> As defined up to now it is not, in the legal sense, a serious offence.</P>
    <P>The question of separate representation for a victim has arisen in recent years and is tied up with the other matter I referred to, evidence being adduced on the previous sexual experience of the complainant.  In recent years those who work with the victims of sexual assault and rape find that, because of the conduct of these cases, very often the role of the prosecution becomes blurred and that the objective of the prosecution, which naturally must be to obtain a conviction, gets mixed up with the objective of the complainant which is to survive intact and to come out at the other end of the trial with some shred of her character and self-esteem left and not to be psychologically damaged.  That is the impression, too, that the victims themselves have been getting.  Because of this a request has been made that there be separate representation for the victim, the complainant.</P>
    <P>There are those who believe that this is unnecessary.  The Minister has said that in some way this may work against the interests of the complainant, but I do not see how this could happen.  It is useful to have separate representation or guidance of a legal nature for a victim.  I am talking of someone who would maintain a watching brief.  I am not thinking in terms of someone constantly interrupting in court but of someone whose role would be to ensure that the victim is properly advised and properly prepared before the court hearing and that her rights are protected during the hearing.  Perhaps this would not be necessary during the trial but it would vindicate the rights of the complainant.  An appreciation of the plight of the victim has almost disappeared from our society.  There is a growing belief that the defendant must have every right under the sun.  Do not get me wrong, the defendant must have his rights vindicated but on the part of the State the complainant is the victim of <Col N="696" /> a crime and is entitled to be properly protected, not only of the courts but of the prosecution process.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there have been changes in the attitudes of the Bar Council in recent times in relation to communications between the barrister involved in the prosecution of a rape case and the victim.  Prior to this the barrister was prohibited from speaking to the victim before the case.  The Bar Council now advise, and this is a real change in their rules, that prosecution barristers should consult with the victim prior to the hearing to explain the procedures and to outline what may be expected to happen in court.  I do not think it is spelt out sufficiently enough either in the Bill or in the rules of practice that the role of the prosecution is not alone to obtain a conviction but also to maintain the dignity and character of the complainant.  This is not spelt out in the Bill and the Bar Council have only an informal rule in regard to it but it is necessary to incorporate in the Bill some recognition of the different role that has evolved as between the prosecution and the victim.</P>
    <P>Is the role of the State in prosecuting rape cases or other such crimes to achieve convictions no matter what?  I do not believe that is the case because if it is we are abandoning the victims, those whom the State is supposed to be representing. The State not only represents the public at large, it represents the individual on whose behalf it is supposed to be acting. Because of the feeling of unease about the plight of the victim I ask the Minister to reconsider his attitude to this matter. There should be some middle ground. The conduct of cases could be held up if there was to be present in court a counsel actively participating on the part of the victim.  That is not what I am looking for. I am thinking of someone who would have the role of protecting the rights of the victim.  This should be considered seriously.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision which would <Col N="697" /> exempt males under the age of 14 from prosecution and I take the point made by Deputy Barnes earlier on about raising the age of criminal responsibility from seven to 14 years but I see this matter in different terms.  We should not raise the age of criminal responsibility without also overhauling the juvenile criminal justice system.  One needs to approach the juvenile criminal justice system in a way different from the adult criminal justice system.  The effect of punishment in terms either of a deterrent or of rehabilitation is almost nil as the Whitaker report on the prison system brought out very clearly.  There is simply no point in punishing young people in the hope that they will not go on to become adult criminals. When we come to raising the age of criminal responsibility to 14 we will also have to have regard to sexual crimes.  Young boys or men should be prosecuted but what happens next is most important.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the hearing of cases in private.  I believe that the name and address of a complainant should not be mentioned.  Neither should there be any mention of the defendant's name until a conviction has been achieved. There are two aspects to this issue.  First, there is the effect which the reporting of the salacious pieces of information has, and, secondly, there is a need to have proper reporting of the decisions in these cases so that the public would know what has been decided, that they would know if a person had not been convicted despite the evidence or if a person had not received the sentence that is warranted in the particular case.</P>
    <P>During the past year or two there has been a spate of reports in the newspapers of horrific crimes.  I particularly say the newspapers because television and radio do not seem to go in for the same kind of reporting.  At times they have gone to town on it and it is difficult to know whether the degrading aspects of cases should be reported in such detail because such reporting dulls the edge of our consciousness regarding appalling acts of <Col N="698" /> violence.  We all know the arguments about violent acts on television and that seeing them so often dulls the edge of our appreciation of how violence affects us.</P>
    <P>I query whether detailed reporting of the evidence given in such cases is necessary or advisable.  On the other hand, we have to weigh the fact that the public have a right to feel outraged if some people act in such appallingly violent ways.  There has to be a happy medium and I do not know if the Bill can accommodate this.  It probably cannot but it is worth commenting on the fact that the multiple cases recently and the degree to which they have been reported is a double-edged sword.  Public visibility of justice being seen to be done is extremely important.  We must know that cases coming through the court system are being properly treated, that the evidence presented is treated in a proper way and that convictions and sentences are proper.  Therefore, there must be access to these cases without identifying those involved in the media.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to mandatory prison sentences, which are not mentioned in the Bill.  In cases of rape and aggravated sexual assault mandatory prison sentences should be the norm. Anybody who has worked with offenders in these cases will know that they are &mdash; almost without exception &mdash; anti-social in nature and do not have a developed sense of responsibility towards their fellow human beings.  Rape is akin to murder, the sense of violation of the person is as close as one can get to the crime of murder and there should be compulsory imprisonment.  I would not stop there because imprisonment will not rehabilitate these offenders.  In cases of this kind it is absolutely essential that every effort is made to rehabilitate the offenders.  I know there is a pilot programme in Arbour Hill at present operated by the probation welfare service and that there are a number of other programmes being run in England and &mdash; I think &mdash; in Belfast.  They are somewhat <Col N="699" /> experimental but a lot of work has been done and it is well worth continuing.</P>
    <P>The other aspect is that when a sentence has been served and an offender is released to the outside world, there should also be supervision.  Too often in these cases the offenders are released to the same community in which they existed before and they go back to their same habits, particularly in the case of child sex offenders.  The same routine starts all over again and there is no contact with anybody.  They do not have to report back to anyone and they are not on a continuing programme; it is as if we assume that what has driven them to rape or to sexually assault has been exorcised by simply being in prison.  We know that that has not been the case and that there are habitual offenders.  What are we doing about it?  If we are serious about protecting society we must go further than simply locking them up for five or ten years and letting them out to do the same thing.</P>
    <P>This Bill offers us an opportunity to do something about it but we are not taking it.  It will be at least a decade before we get another chance to do it although it is essential.  Why are we not taking into account the kind of information available to us here and now?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which has been long awaited.  We obviously agree that it is needed and I look forward to Committee Stage because I hope the Minister will take on board some of the suggestions which Deputy Barnes and I made, and which others will make.  There are flaws in the Bill but this is the one opportunity we will get for many years to do something about a subject which has been written about and discussed.  A comprehensive discussion paper was issued by the Law Reform Commission followed by a full report which was measured and very well researched.  I should also mention the work done by the Oireachtas Joint Committee.  I urge the Minister to take all this into account and <Col N="700" /> to come to Committee Stage with an open mind.  I hope he will do so.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill as is the case with any law reforming measure brought before the House.  Unfortunately, there are all too few law reforming measures brought before this House, which is a great shame.  We have an excellent Law Reform Commission which do a great deal of work and research and produce many reports.  However, very few of them reach this House for examination. This is one of them, which is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>This Parliament has fallen very substantially behind in tackling the very many law reforming measures necessary. I know there are great pressures on parliamentary time and that many important measures dealing with the economy, employment and so on have to be dealt with in the House.  That is understood and perfectly acceptable.  However, the House should sit an additional day or days per week to deal with law reforming measures.  I suggest that it should sit on a regular basis every Friday to deal with non-contentious law reforming matters which could be examined in detail and which would result in very worthwhile and much needed reform being brought into our legal system.  The days of a three day sitting week should be finished as it is in most other democratic parliaments. If Fridays were allocated for that purpose it would be a major step forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to go through this Bill section by section or examine every aspect, but I want to make a few comments in connection with it. I agree with the directive given by the Supreme Court in a decision on a rape case given on 13 May 1988.  They laid down the general principle that, except in very exceptional cases, the penalty for rape should be an immediate and considerable custodial sentence.  That is a <Col N="701" /> correct definition of what the punishment should be in cases of rape or &mdash; as it will also now be &mdash; aggravated sexual assault. I do not agree with Deputy Colley that a mandatory sentence should be prescribed. The directive of the Supreme Court that except in very exceptional circumstances the penalty should be an immediate and considerable custodial sentence meets the case.  Any prison sentence for an offence of this type should be significant and the primary purpose of it should be to protect society from such people.  The issue of community safety must be the primary consideration.  We must protect people from assault, rape and so on by those who need treatment.</P>
      <P>I should now like to deal with my second point, which was touched on by Deputy Colley.  Treatment is essential for those people.  I find it highly regrettable that that aspect has not been dealt with in the Bill.  I see no ultimate advantage in the medium or long-term in taking people who are sick &mdash; it is my belief that those who commit such offences have serious psychological problems &mdash; and locking them up in prisons for whatever period, five, ten, or 15 years and releasing them afterwards untreated.  When they are released their condition is the same as it was when they were sent to prison and, in some cases, worse.  It is unacceptable that such people should be released into the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My information is that a pilot scheme was in operation in Arbour Hill but that it has been wound down through lack of resources from the Department of Justice. We do not want a pilot scheme but an indepth plan for treating such people. We are lucky that we have a group of highly qualified people who are capable of managing a rehabilitation and treatment programme for sex offenders. Those people are dedicated to that task. I have met many of them.  I am, of course, referring to members of the Probation and Welfare Officers' Association who have prepared an excellent report on this issue.  I should like to bring the Minister's <Col N="702" /> attention to the final paragraph of the report which, regrettably, the Minister ignored when preparing the Bill.  That report stated:</P>
    <P>We would request the Minister for Justice, and the Government, to positively consider our proposals when drawing up the new legislation on rape and allied offences.  Any legislation which does not include provision for a treatment programme will be deficient in terms of the offender, the victims and, ultimately, society itself.  Other countries are already moving ahead in establishing and extending their treatment programmes.  It is now opportune for Irish society to further develop the work in this area.</P>
    <P>I do not know how anybody could disagree with that statement but there has not been any reference to it in the Minister's speech.  The Bill does not contain a provision that will tell us that the parameters for sexual offences will be widened and, at the same time, that it is being recognised that it is an essential element for the protection of society that those who are convicted of sexual offences will be treated while in prison so that when they are let loose on society people will no longer be at risk.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give a guarantee to the House that the resources required by the probation and welfare officer service for this purpose will be given to them.  He should give us a guarantee that the accommodation, equipment and resources they need will be provided. There should not be a cutback in the allocation for that service, as has occurred.  There has been a good deal of discussion whether it would have been better to deal with the various offences by an extension of the definition of rape or whether it is a good thing to introduce the new definitions and new offences of sexual assault or aggravated sexual assault.  I do not think it makes a great deal of difference provided that the person who has committed an offence <Col N="703" /> along the lines indicated does not escape on technical grounds.  That should be the essential objective.  The retention of the original definition of rape, coupled with the new offences of sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault, will meet the needs of the case.  If the evidence is forthcoming in regard to such offences society's needs in the matter will be met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be that some circumstances have not been covered but I cannot think of what they are.  Looking at the definitions it appears to me that virtually all circumstances are covered by section 3.  If there are others that Deputy Barnes can think of I have no doubt she will include them in amendments for Committee Stage.  If they have merit I can assure her of my support, and that of my party.  I look forward with interest to reading her amendments.  I take the view that offences that interfere with women in any way from the sexual or physical point of view should be treated as serious offences and those found guilty should be punished accordingly.  The Bill appears to do that but I may have missed something. If I have we can deal with it on Committee Stage.  Any amendments tabled by Deputy Barnes, if I consider them to be reasonably necessary, will receive my support.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another aspect to this.  It is very easy to get caught up and swept away along a line of emotion in regard to such cases.  Many people come to the conclusion that the person they see in the dock, man or woman, is guilty of the offence with which they are charged, but that is not always so.  In many cases the person in the dock is guilty but the offence must be proved against him or <Col N="704" /> her.  One should take great care that one does not swing too far with the pendulum in one direction thereby causing a difficulty in the other direction as far as the person in the dock is concerned.  There is a famous true story told in legal circles of the juryman who when passing the prisoner in the dock was heard to murmur to the person charged, &ldquo;I suppose you would not be there if you had not done something wrong&rdquo;.  Needless to say that juryman was immediately discharged for having made such a remark.</P>
      <P>There have been instances, in the realm of sexual and other offences, of people being wrongly charged due to mistaken identity.  There have been cases where people instituted prosecutions maliciously and were prepared to perjure themselves for the purpose of securing their ends.  That happened in murder cases.  I can recall the Christie case where the unfortunate Mr. Evans was hanged following conviction based on perjured evidence.  It is one of the weaknesses of the legal system &mdash; I suppose there is not much one can do about this, but it is a weakness nonetheless &mdash; that the law relies on the truthfulness of the evidence which is given in the courts.  Judges and jury men and women are human beings and they have no prophetic insight into when the truth is being told and when it is not.  The courts can only rely on evidence given and they do their best to ensure that that evidence is the truth and is given as the truth.</P>
      <P>One has to have great care that the truth is achieved, and that is the object of the prosecution.  Even Deputy Colley who is a trained lawyer was, I think, unwittingly perhaps to some extent caught up in the mainstream of the object of the prosecution.  The object of the prosecution certainly is not and should not be &mdash; and I do not believe it is or that prosecutors will lay any claim to saying this &mdash; to secure convictions.  Their objective is and should be to get the truth out.</P>

      <P>The court procedure must, subject to the necessary precautions, allow all the evidence to be given and give the opportunity to the judge and the jury to make a proper assessment.</P>
      <P>When you are dealing with a case, as many sexual offence cases are, of simply one person's word against another's it does present any judge or jury with great difficulties in deciding which person is telling the truth.  I know that Deputy Barnes is very anxious on the subject matter of this Bill, and she has my full support on that, but I am sure that Deputy Barnes being the liberal person she is would not wish to see any innocent person convicted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well assured of it. Knowing the Deputy I would know that even without having heard her speech.  It is a fact that there can be malicious people who are articulate, put across false evidence and can be very convincing, whereas a very honest person may give a shifty appearance, perhaps unwittingly, and find himself in difficulty in a court when there is no outside evidence to back up one side or the other. Therefore, great care and caution is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity that we do not direct ourselves more in the Bill to the matters of evidence and the greater use of technical aids to evidence.  The question of DNA fingerprinting and so on comes to mind, and we should ensure in every possible way that every scrap of evidence that can be got through scientific means is made <Col N="706" /> available to the court to avoid the very difficult situation a judge or jury would be placed in in having to make a horrendous decision on whether they will believe the complainant or the defendant when there is a simple yes or no answer and there is absolutely no additional outside evidence to guide them.  The implications of getting that decision wrong one way or the other are horrific.  It would be horrendous in the case of a complainant who has been raped, seriously sexually assaulted, sexually assaulted or assaulted if the defendant who, in fact, did it, escaped as a result of a jury not being able to make up their minds and convince themselves of his guilt.  That is a horrific prospect to contemplate but it is an equally horrific prospect to contemplate that a person who is innocent would be convicted of a charge like rape or a serious sexual assault when he is innocent.  There is no perfection in this and there is no scientific reality about it.  One is dealing with people all the time and all the frailties of people.</P>
    <P>I can understand, therefore, how the rule about caution against convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant alone in these cases grew up in the law over many centuries, and we should have great care before we dispense with it altogether.  Even as the law stands at present, unamended, a jury are perfectly entitled, as I understand it, to convict on the completely uncorroborated evidence of the complainant alone even if there is no other evidence but that person's word.  The requirement is that the judge should draw attention to the fact that great care is required before that would be done.  I am not convinced that it is a good idea to dispense with the necessity of any kind of caution whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Maybe the nature of the caution which has been required up to now has been too strong but perhaps it would be appropriate for the judge to have to review the evidence and if there is absolutely no corroboration at all &mdash; if there is any <Col N="707" /> corroboration, of course, that would not arise no matter how flimsy it was &mdash; and it was simply one person's word against another's certainly it must and should be open to the court to convict that person if they believe the complainant and they are satisfied, having seen the complainant, that she is telling the truth. However, a note of caution might not be inappropriate if there is not a shred of any other evidence there.  Because of the very serious nature of the offences we are talking about and because the implications are so serious, that degree of extra care must be required.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the jurisdiction of the trial court for these offences.  There is a provision in the Bill, and previous speakers have referred to it, under which all these offences are to be directed to the Central Criminal Court in Dublin to be tried by a High Court judge rather than a Circuit Court judge.  I have thought about this long and hard but for the life of me I can see no basis for it whatsoever.  I thoroughly disagree with the suggestion that all these cases must, of necessity, be brought up to Dublin to be tried in the Central Criminal Court.  I will need a good deal more convincing than has been adduced so far before I will accept that proposal.  I see no need for it whatsoever.  Are we saying that the Circuit Court judges are not fit and proper people to try cases of serious crime?  Quite frankly I believe it is an insult to the Circuit Court judges, and it is an insult which is entirely unwarranted. From time to time we criticise in our minds and openly a judgment or sentence that was or was not given in a particular case in the Circuit Court but I can think of a few similar situations which arose in cases in the High Court where there was some criticism of High Court judges, and people attempted to speak in this House about cases where High Court judges were concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for having given me this opportunity to bring this matter before the House this evening.  Being a native of Clonmel I know it is a matter near and dear to your heart.  Were our positions reversed I have no doubt that you would be eloquently imploring the Minister to grant designated status to Clonmel forthwith.</P>
      <P>The reason I raise this issue is that, on 9 May, when I tabled a question to the Minister for the Environment, who is present, about the designation of Clonmel for urban renewal, in replying he indicated &mdash; at least my interpretation of his remarks was &mdash; that he had no intention whatsoever in the short, medium or long term of giving such status to the town of Clonmel.  I want to give him an opportunity this evening to spell out clearly and unequivocally where he stands in that regard so that, in turn, members of Clonmel Corporation and their officials will know exactly where they stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public perception of Clonmel is one of a very prosperous town situated in idyllic surroundings, as the Ceann Comhairle knows only too well, on the banks of the Suir between Slievenamon and the Comeragh mountains.  Until quite <Col N="709" /> recently the town had been quite impervious to the draughts of economic winds, the stresses and strains other towns had had to ensure.  It appears that the town would be totally immune to the economic failings of the recent past.  Unfortunately, that scene has changed.  Clonmel had been the envy of many provincial towns and is reputed to be the largest inland town in the country.  It was the envy of other towns with its high levels of employment and busy commercial life. But the winds of change have overcome Clonmel.  That is why I am this evening beseeching the Minister to throw a lifeline to the commercial and industrial life of the town.</P>
    <P>On inquiring today I was told that there are 1,735 people on the live register which, for Clonmel, consitutes an all time record.  The numbers on the live register have risen significantly over the past nine months, an increase of some 500, representing an increase of approximately 30 per cent on the level of unemployment obtaining there.  But for the safety valve of emigration &mdash; with so many of the young girls and boys of Clonmel and surrounding areas leaving to seek employment in England, America and Australia &mdash; that figure would be much higher. Therefore the figure of 1,735 gives a false impression of the real level of unemployment in Clonmel.</P>
    <P>Over the past couple of years a number of industries have gone out of business or being wound down.  For example, in 1984 Padmore and Barnes, shoe manufacturers, closed with a loss of 95 jobs. Last year Alamac Limited, an engineering firm, closed with a loss of 35 jobs. Earlier this year the old firm of Edmund Burke and Sons, bacon curers, was acquired by Avonmore.  The promise of a new bacon industry to be built on the fringes of the town has not materialised which has meant there has been a subsequent loss of between 80 and 90 jobs. Likewise Currans, a firm in Clonmel that once gave significant employment, at <Col N="710" /> peak of 50, is gradually winding down to single figures.</P>
    <P>It was against the background that Clonmel Corporation, in their wisdom and foresight, decided to do something about the position.  When the Urban Renewal Act was enacted they decided its provisions would be the lifeline to save Clonmel.  They set about readying themselves, preparing their application for such a status.  In that exercise they earmarked three areas &mdash; the Market Street/Emmet Street area, near the centre of the town with great commercial potential was the first.  The second area was the Main Guard one, constituting the real heart of Clonmel the focal point of the town, an area of great historical and architectural beauty.  The third area was that in the vicinity of Mary Street, an old historic area going back to the greatest traditions of the town.  They pinpointed these three areas and set about acquiring them either voluntarily or compulsorily. I am informed that they spent in excess of £1 million and much time and energy in acquiring these properties so that they be ready for designation.  They acquired all of these properties out of their resources without any funding from the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>In October 1987 I understand they submitted their very detailed application, indicating the relevant areas, giving appropriate reasons, fulfilling all of the conditions of the requisite application. When that application was not being dealt with the urgency they felt it warranted they sought an interview with the Minister.  The Minister kindly met a deputation on 2 February last when, once again, they put forward what I regard as their impeccable case for the designation of Clonmel for urban renewal.  As a consequence of other major provincial towns, such as Limerick, Waterford, Kilkenny, indeed Athlone having been designated already, Clonmel Corporation felt their town was losing out, <Col N="711" /> especially bearing in mind the designation of the towns of Kilkenny, Waterford and Limerick, towns located in the vicinity of Clonmel vying for the same type of commercial and industrial development.  As a consequence of those other areas having been granted this designated status they feel they are losing out to developers who, naturally, will go where enticements and reliefs are greater.  Be that as it may, I understand that contractors are inquiring daily from Clonmel Corporation when this designation status will be granted so that they can develop these areas for commercial and business activities.</P>
    <P>I should like to praise the members of Clonmel Corporation, their officials and indeed those of the county council on their foresight in having had everything in readiness, in having foreseen an opportunity to improve their town.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated in his reply to my question that there were 15 centres designated under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986.  In May 1988 nine provincial centres were designated, some of which I have mentioned.  Some of these centres have progressed well and have made a success of their designation status while others have not.  For the Minister to indicate that he is awaiting the outcome of the designation of these areas before he makes a decision in favour of Clonmel is totally unfair to Clonmel.  The Clonmel case should be judged on its own merits. A town must go forward, it has to develop, expand, progress and make itself commercially attractive to developers. That is what I feel Clonmel Corporation have done; they have given the lead.  Everything is ready for take up. The areas are specified.</P>
    <P>I understand there are no legal barriers whatsoever, that there are no financial hindrances, that everything is ready and that all it needs is the go ahead from the Minister and his Department.  That is why I am asking the Minister this evening to match forward thinking enterprising <Col N="712" /> Clonmel Corporation and its officials by responding to the efforts they have made. Indeed, It would also encourage other areas to seek this status.  If other areas were given that status further development, both commercial and industrial, would take place with consequent downstream employment.  It would invigorate and generate employment and activity in many towns.  It would prove the success of the Urban Renewal Act, 1986.  If the Minister was looking for areas to prove how we can be successful, then this would be one area to which the Minister could point.  Everything is ready.  All we are asking is that the Minister cast off bureaucracy and the chains that are holding down Clonmel at this moment.  With a stroke of his pen the Minister can give the go ahead this evening.  Perhaps he wants to get some kudos out of it, I do not.  We will allow the Minister to announce it, and we will give him whatever facility he needs in Clonmel or in South Tipperary to make the announcement if he so wishes.</P>
    <P>The business people of Clonmel are awaiting his decision.  The commercial life of Clonmel are awaiting his decision. They want him to react to this forward thinking activity and enterprise by their corporation.  I ask the Minister not to impede the progress of Clonmel or the development of central Clonmel especially, but to give them this designated status which they so eagerly await and which they are ready to avail of.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the Minister will not be disappointed because I understand, if he gives the go ahead, the developers can virtually start in the morning to transfrom the centre of Clonmel.</P>
    <P>I await the Minister's decision and hope it will be a positive one for the benefit of the people of Clonmel who, in the past, have indicated by their local enterprise, initiative and drive that, given a helping hand, they can withstand the winds of change and prepare themselves for the Single European Act and the challenges of the nineties.  They can do all <Col N="713" /> this if they are given this shot in the arm which they so eagerly expect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to get the opportunity to discuss the important question of urban renewal.  In common with most developed countries, we are experiencing some physical degeneration in many of our inner cities and towns.  These areas are often characterised by derelict sites, unused and run down buildings, defective and outdated infrastructural facilities and exceptionally high rates of unemployment and welfare dependency among the resident population.  The poor physical environment and urban fabric reinforces the perception of the areas as undesirable locations for private investment.</P>
      <P>A programme of urban renewal is being implemented to deal with this extensive decay.  The State cannot at this stage invest substantial amounts of public moneys in urban renewal because of budgetary constraints.  Accordingly, the programme is based principally on the stimulation of redevelopment by the private sector in targeted urban areas.  This is being achieved by means of a scheme of incentives designed around tax and rates reliefs for developers and end-users of completed developments.</P>
      <P>Under the Urban Renewal Acts, 1986 and 1987, two broad new strategies have been conceived to promote urban renewal.  In the Custom House Docks area of Dublin, a special development authority has been created with flexible financial and physical planning powers to secure the redevelopment of part of the North Docks area of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Elsewhere in Dublin and in the rest of the country, specific urban renewal objectives are being pursued through the designation of selected areas within cities and towns for an intensive campaign of redevelopment.  The local authorities concerned are principally responsible for co-ordinating and advancing urban renewal programmes in these designated <Col N="714" /> areas.  Originally, parts of the five county boroughs were designated in 1986.  Since then, however, I have taken the initiative of extending the scheme to nine provincial centres: in May 1988 I made an order designating parts of the following towns for urban renewal purposes &mdash; Athlone, Sligo, Castlebar, Tralee, Kilkenny, Wexford, Tullamore, Letterkenny and Dundalk.  In November last year, I also designated an area in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>Common to the urban renewal programmes in the Custom House Docks area and elsewhere are tax incentives, subject to some variation according to the type of area, involving rates, corporate tax and income tax.  I would like to point out that conferring designated area status on an area does not automatically or immediately confer tax and rating incentives on the area concerned. The incentives to apply to any given area involve a separate policy decision by the Minister for Finance in consultation with myself, for the tax incentives, and by the Minister for the Environment for the rating incentives.  In general, however, these allowances are applied to all designated areas.</P>
    <P>Overall, the urban renewal scheme has enjoyed considerable success to date. Since its inception, some £111 million worth of investment has been definitely generated &mdash; between schemes completed, in progress or in planning.  Furthermore, an estimated £63 million worth of extra investment is expected to reach planning application stage shortly, bringing total investment to a figure of about £173 million.</P>
    <P>This must be regarded as a considerable success; most of this development is genuinely additional and would not have occurred without the active promotion of urban renewal measures.</P>
    <P>The example of Dublin is worth quoting. Between 1976 and 1986, no new developments took place along the quays.  Since the introduction of the urban renewal scheme, 17 projects have <Col N="715" /> been completed, six are in progress and at least 15 more are at planning stage, with a total value in the region of £40 million.</P>
    <P>I readily admit that there are extensive problems of urban decay in many of our towns and cities.  Although we have only formally designated some 160 acres in Dublin for urban renewal, much of the larger inner city area between the two canals could readily be classified as being in need of urban renewal.  For a variety of reasons, however, the designated areas scheme must be selective.  It would be wholly impracticable to suggest that designation should be extended immediately and in blanket fashion to each and every run down area of our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>In the first place, the cost of such a widespread scheme would be prohibitive in terms of the amount of taxes and rates foregone.  The Exchequer and local authorities could not contemplate such a loss in the immediate term.  Secondly, it should be borne in mind that the more widespread designation becomes, the less it is seen as something special and the more it is seen as the norm.  The various special incentives under the scheme would soon be regarded as standard ones and the scheme would lose its desired stimulus and effect.  Thirdly, the more widespread the scheme, the more dissipated the results.  It is likely that some redevelopment would take place, but not to the extent that it would have a noticeable impact on the level of dereliction.  It is only by targeting specific areas that we can hope to see results.</P>
    <P>Deputy Griffin is, understandably, pressing the case for the Borough of Clonmel which he represents.  I have no difficulty in acknowledging that there are some parts of Clonmel in need of renewal which could, in principle, benefit from the urban renewal scheme.  However, I must also point out that there are many other towns and cities throughout Ireland which could make equally strong claims for designation.  For the reasons already <Col N="716" /> given I am faced with the difficult and sometimes unenviable task of deciding which areas must be given priority under the scheme.  I can assure the House that all representations and submissions by interested parties are borne in mind when and if I am considering proposals for designation at another time.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I received a deputation from the members and officials of Clonmel Urban District Council and Tipperary (South Riding) County Council last year. As I indicated at that time and to Deputy Griffin in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 11 of 9 May 1989, I cannot give any guarantee about future designations, or if any future designations are going to take place.</P>
    <P>I am monitoring the progress in the nine provincial centres that were designated in May 1988.  While progress in some of these areas is somewhat disappointing, it is perhaps too early to judge the overall level of success of the scheme in these areas given that they were designated only one year ago.  I would wish to evaluate fully the progress of the scheme in these provincial centres and then make some decisions about further designations if such is warranted.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that the economic recovery achieved under this Government has created conditions which are now much more favourable to property redevelopment than when the scheme was introduced in 1986.  This is another matter which I will have to consider in the context of the need for further designations.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may rest assured that the case for Clonmel made by him and his colleagues has been noted and that it will receive my consideration in any future proposals to extend the designated areas scheme.</P>

      <P>There has been no change in Government policy in relation to the terms for development of oil and gas discoveries in the Irish offshore since the statement in September 1987 by my predecessor when he announced a revision of the 1975 licensing terms.  The 1987 revision provided for abolition of State participation in profits from oil or gas developments as <Col N="667" /> required by section 29 of the original 1975 licensing terms, and exemption from royalty payments as provided for under section 23 of those terms.</P>
      <P>Marathon's leases have never been subject to the 1975 licensing terms, and so were unaffected by the 1987 changes in these terms.  Therefore payment of royalties in respect of production of oil and gas from discoveries in the marathon leased acreage continues to apply.</P>
      <P>With regard to hard minerals, the terms of future state mining leases, including royalty and State participation, will continue to be settled by reference to the particular features of the deposits concerned and other relevant factors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 36, 39 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>When the treatment benefit scheme was extended to cover dependent spouses, dentists on the Department's panel were given the option of signing a new contract which included the provision of dental treatment to spouses. Those who did not opt to sign a new contract were allowed to continue providing dental treatment under their existing contract.  Any dentist wishing to be admitted to the panel for the first time may only do so by contracting to operate the extended scheme, which includes the treatment of dependent spouses.</P>
      <P>The number of active dentists on the Department's dental panel at present is approximately 670.  Since 31 January contracts were terminated in respect of 30 dentists by reason of death or retirement. Of these, there were 16 in 1987, ten in 1988 and four to date in 1989.</P>
      <P>The number of dentists who have signed the new agreement covering dependent spouses is 191.  Eleven dentists indicated that they were no longer willing to treat dependent spouses.  I have been informed that one of these has since withdrawn his objection to treating dependent spouses.  The contractual position of the remaining dentists is being considered at present.  The present position is that some 2,200 claims monthly are being received in respect of dependent spouses, mainly wives.  Since the new scheme was introduced some 42,000 such claims have been received and dealt with.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of fully insured workers who were eligible under this Department's PRSI dental benefit treatment scheme in 1988; the number who received such dental treatment; and the fees in total which were paid by his Department to dentists in respect of these.</P>

      <P>Information relating to dental treatment is recorded on the basis of claims received from dentists.  The fact, however, that a course of treatment may extend over a period of time and that in some cases claims are not made to the Department until the treatment is completed or even later, means that the information available at any time is not complete.</P>
      <P>The number of insured persons who were eligible under the social insurance dental benefit scheme in 1988 was approximately 1.08 million.  A total of 324,305 claims were received from this category in that year.  The total amount paid by the Department to all panel dentists in 1988 in respect of the treatment of insured persons was £11.321 million. Fees paid to dentists ranged from £5 to £101,000 depending on the amount of work which a particular dentist did for insured workers.  These figures do not include payments in respect of dependent spouses, for whom a further 26,300 claims were received.</P>

      <P>There is no record of any application for a grant from national lottery funds from <Col N="676" /> the North Kildare Branch of the Irish Wheelchair Association.  I have already given grants totalling £225,000 to the national headquarters of the association to enable it to finance its home care attendants scheme.</P>
      <P>However, as I indicated to the Deputy in a reply to a similar question last June, the health board concerned is the appropriate body to give assistance to the local branches of national organisations.  The health board is in the best position to assess the needs to be met locally and the contribution of the organisation concerned in meeting these needs.</P>

      <P>As I announced recently in the Dáil, arrangements for the introduction of a new drug subsidisation scheme are under active consideration.  The proposed <Col N="677" /> scheme will operate at retail pharmacy level and will be intended to cater specifically for persons who have an ongoing and continuous requirement for prescription medication due to a long term condition.  Under the scheme proposed, patients would not have to spend more than £28 in any month.  It is envisaged that before a patient will qualify for inclusion in the proposed scheme, the health board will require medical certification of the fact that the patient will require ongoing and continuous medication for the treatment of a long term condition.</P>
      <P>Given the proposed introduction of this new scheme it is not my intention to extend the long term illness scheme to include any further illnesses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 to 61, inclusive, together.  I have had these matters investigated by the Western Health Board and the position is as follows:</P>
      <P>On receipt of the notification of discharge of homeless persons, the director of community care and medical officer of health make the necessary arrangements in relation to appropriate aftercare including medical and nursing services. A liaison public health nurse has been appointed for the Galway community care area who provides appropriate nursing care after discharge if required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The patient was assessed as medically fit for discharge by a consultant physician on 2 February 1989.  The decision to discharge a patient from hospital is a function of the consultant under whose care he/she is.  In this case, the decision to discharge was made after all medical and social aspects were considered by the consultant physician.  He was, in fact, discharged to Fairgreen House, Galway, which is a hostel for homeless persons.  A <Col N="680" /> medical card was granted to the patient on 13 February 1989.</P>
    <P>The patient was in receipt of £37 per week supplementary welfare allowance, plus £10 per week rent allowance, up to last week.  He was also granted £43 for a deposit on a flat which he has now vacated, and returned to Fairgreen House.  He will continue to receive £37 per week supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>On a previous discharge on 17 Janaury 1989, the patient was given an outpatient appointment for 2 February 1989, which he did not attend as he was an inpatient again on that date.  He was examined by a consultant physician and assessed as medically fit for discharge on that date. The decision to recall a patient to outpatient is a clinical matter for the consultant under whose care the patient is.</P>
