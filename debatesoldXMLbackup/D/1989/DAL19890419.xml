      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I have given you notice of my intention to ask you for leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil on a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration.  This request is made under Standing Order 30.  The matter in question relates to the current situation in the Permanent Defence Force and notably the poor state of morale and problems in relation to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Having considered the matter fully I do not consider that it is one contemplated by Standing Order 30 and I cannot, therefore, grant leave to move the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I informed you that there are at least 12,000 people who regard this <Col N="2050" /> as an important matter of public concern requiring urgent consideration &mdash; they are the members of the Permanent Defence Force.  Without being disorderly a Cheann Comhairle, I must say I am extremely disappointed at your decision because I believe it has deprived this House, unless the Government change their minds, of an opportunity of discussing this most important issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is disappointed but, apart altogether from the Standing Order which I have quoted, the Chair is sustained and follows carefully, as did his predecessors, the rules in paragraph 22 of the Report of the Informal Committee on Reform of Dáil procedure, 1972 &mdash; the precedence are at column 563 of the Official Report for 23 February 1984, and at column 1683 of the Official Report for 13 May 1987 &mdash; the main criteria being that the matter raised has arisen suddenly.  The matter to which Deputy Dukes referred has been ongoing for some considerable time.</P>

With all due respect to Deputy Noonan, the &ldquo;steady as she goes&rdquo; policy is preferable to the &ldquo;down she goes&rdquo; policy which he administered while Minister for Finance and in which he participated when in Government.  Unquestionably, during the period of the last Coalition Government the problems facing the Government were never tackled, and certainly were never solved, and the problems facing the economy were exacerbated to a degree previously unheard of.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;this Government laid the foundation for growth in the Irish economy.  It was rather amusing to hear people who were involved in the previous Administration say that there should now be radical tax reform. Indeed, there were even suggestions from the Progressive Democrats' spokesman that caution should be thrown to the wind and a 25 per cent tax rate introduced across the board.  Of course, that is a most desirable objective and it is something <Col N="2058" /> which every taxpayer, including myself, would want, but is it realistic?  It is obvious that such a course, would bring us right back to where we were, facing an uphill struggle which, on the second occasion, would be a more mountainous one than that undertaken to date, of bringing order to the public finances.  It is true that taxation levels are too high and that they are to a large extent a great disincentive in the private sector.  Not only are they a disincentive in the private sector but one could safely say that they are driving out many very talented people from the public sector, but it would not be prudent to have radical tax reduction at this point, because all the benefits that have been achieved would be lost.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill recognises that there is need for tax reform and in this context the reduction in the rates and the expansion of the tax bands is to be welcomed. It is not a radical but a prudent step which I hope will continue in the coming years. Until order is brought to the public finances one cannot honestly speak about the possibility of having radical tax reform.  When order is brought to the public finances, and hopefully we are nearly there, we will be in a position to have further decreases in the tax rates and further expansion of the bands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible to contribute to this debate without mentioning the national plan which has come in for severe criticism from Opposition spokesmen, from people who have no plan at all.  If something positive is put forward in this country it is ironic that a lot of people with nothing positive to offer will be extremely negative about it.  The <i>National Development Plan</i> concentrates on those areas of activity in our economy which require rectification.  Without doubt one of the greatest drawbacks in our own resource industry has been the state of the infrastructure required to service it.  Our roads are not up to the standard of European roads.  Indeed, we are very far behind which means that areas on the periphery are left in a very disadvantaged position. The same has happened with regard to our piers and harbours in various parts of the country where the fishing industry <Col N="2059" /> has been unable to lift off because of inadequate infrastructure.</P>
    <P>There have been tremendous improvements in the telecommunications network largely due to the present Minister for Finance, but the national plan will have to concentrate on infrastructure in order to take Ireland into the year 2000 and beyond.  If we fail to grasp that opportunity now there is little prospect of the infrastructure being improved in future decades.  The strategy of the national plan in conjunction with the Finance Bill is the correct way forward.  It is the only way forward.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan in his contribution yesterday suggested that the economic analysis in the national plan had been ignored.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  One cannot build a house on sand; one must have a solid foundation. In the same way we cannot hope to build large industries from our own resources without the infrastructure required for their development.  We will reap the fruits of this national plan in the future and it will be a tremendous success.</P>
    <P>One of the largest problems in the economy which is indirectly addressed in the Finance Bill is unemployment and consequential emigration.  We have to improve the baseline before there can be any improvement in these areas.  We have tried to get the fundamentals of the economy in order with a view to having a consequential spin-off in the creation of wealth and employment.  There is evidence today of a strengthening of economic activity and present projections are that the budget targets may well be bettered.</P>
    <P>While the public finances were in disarray we could not hope to have tax reform which is desirable.  Tax reform will have to be a phased programme spread over a number of years.  There has been a sizeable reduction in personal taxation in the provisions of the Finance Bill and that is to be welcomed.  The Bill also contains new development incentives.</P>
    <P>We must have a tremendous amount of political co-operation in relation to harmonisation which will involve huge <Col N="2060" /> credits and losses for the Exchequer. There will have to be across the board agreement in the interests of the country regarding harmonisation if we are not to make a mess of it.  I hope we will see that broad political consensus, without which harmonisation will be difficult to achieve, without gravely damaging the economy.</P>
    <P>The reduction of tax rates begins the process of driving down income tax rates, it is not the end.  Over the period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> we have already seen reliefs amounting to over £700 million.  One of the provisions which I most welcome in this Bill is the proposal to change the accounting facilities for small businesses.  Up to now people in small businesses found themselves involved in a morass of paper work each month making returns of PAYE and PRSI.  This work can take many mandays to complete even if one has only ten employees.  The facility whereby those people will be allowed to pay their PAYE and PRSI every year will be of tremendous benefit to small employers, and small employers throughout the country are delighted with it.</P>
    <P>The novel proposal about toll roads is long overdue.  If this proposal had been in operation even ten years ago it would have made a huge difference to the state of our national primary and secondary roads.  However, the danger is that development would naturally tend to occur in the major centres of population only, and centres of medium or low density population would be ignored.  It would be a good idea if incentives regarding toll roads in areas of medium or low density population were improved beyond those that exist in areas of higher population.  That is the only way to get private investment in toll roads in these areas.  I welcome the concept of toll roads generally, but the eastern part of the country will be the major benefactor unless incentives are improved in the western and mid-western parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister saw fit to look at the position of disabled drivers. Without question there were anomalies so that a small minority found themselves <Col N="2061" /> in difficulties because of the law.  I sincerely hope that an accommodation can be reached between all parties to give relief to those who require it.  I welcome as well the reduction in VAT on works of art and literary manuscripts.  The area of works of art and literary manuscripts is of tremendous importance to our heritage and it is desirable that we try to facilitate and encourage those involved in the arts in every possible way.</P>
    <P>I greatly welcome the decision to renew the bank levy.  In view of the strengthening of economic activity I wonder if that levy should have been increased this year.  The banks have a social obligation to the people, as has any large financial organisation.  It is fair to say that over the years the banks have made very large, sometimes embarrassingly large, profits at times when the people were finding the going tough.  The banks also have an obligation with regard to the stability of the economy.  There is absolutely no reason why they should not make a substantial contribution.  If present economic trends continue, if we continue to see a more buoyant economy, the bank levy should be increased.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision introducing mandatory self-assessment in capital acquisitions tax cases.  This will have the effect of releasing the staff of the Revenue Commissioners from a very cumbersome task.  It is not too difficult to make one return, but to have to assess thousands of these creates considerable bureaucracy.  The change is for the better.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the extension of the favourite nephew concept under the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act.  Up to now, a favourite nephew or niece got the benefit of the highest threshold, provided it was an inheritance.  The extension of this concept to inheritance creating trusts is to be applauded.  Very often, in rural areas in particular, a person wishes to transfer a farm to a niece or nephew in his or her lifetime.  The capital acquisitions tax was a disincentive.  I agree with extending the obtaining of an insurance bond to a husband or wife.  Up to now this <Col N="2062" /> concept, whereby one protected oneself against a charge under capital acquisitions tax, applied to the individual but not to a joint disposition.</P>
    <P>I refer now to the financial services area, which is one of growth.  Because of our excellent telecommunications system we are now in a position to take full benefit from the growth in the technological industry.  The Custom House Dock centre appears to be working well and extension of the financial services industrial base to more peripheral regions in the country must be broadly welcomed. High technology does not depend on location.  It can exist on the Aran Islands and possibly prosper more there than in the heart of Dublin city.  It was a courageous step taken by this Minister and Government to set out for tender the processing and distribution of prize bonds.  This contract which was won by FEXCO Ireland from Killorglin, in my own constituency, had the immediate effect of creating 80 jobs in an area which very badly needed them.  There are other State services, other areas of administration which are run by the public sector which could be run by the private sector to give much needed employment in areas where this is badly needed, without creating redundancies in the public sector.</P>
    <P>Distribution and processing of the prize bonds in Killorglin, in conjunction with An Post, is a new and innovative step which will have tremendous benefits for the Killorglin area of south Kerry in future years.  It will prove to be a marvellous success.  Is it not wonderful to see a town in the west actually leading the way in our technological industry? Nobody would have believed that this could be possible, even up to five years ago, but that company have proved that it can be done.  This kind of development should be encouraged in every possible way.</P>
    <P>It was rather ironic to hear Deputy Desmond, the Labour Party spokesman on Finance, yesterday criticise every kind of public expenditure cut.  It is easy to adopt that attitude when one has neither responsibility nor power, or even the <Col N="2063" /> prospect of power.  Deputy Desmond is now uninhibited and untrammelled by his days as Minister for Health, when he left a deficit of £35 million facing the health services.  He is in a position to speak <i>ex cathedra</i> in a populist manner, without ever having to implement the policies which he propounds, or defend the actions which would have to be undertaken to implement them.  This kind of argument from the Deputy cannot be accepted on that account alone.</P>
    <P>It is true that we have seen a certain degree of boom in the building industry over the past number of months.  It is also true that house prices have increased. This is symptomatic of the present low interest rates and it fulfils the prophecy of the previous Minister for Finance that if the interest rates came down the buildings would go up.  We are seeing a welcome recovery in the building industry, one of the most labour intensive industries which we possess.  I sincerely hope that that growth will continue, that we will see a return to the greater days of the industry.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to take issue with Deputy Desmond for saying that the school transport system was now to be terminated.  I cannot see why anybody should say such a thing and can only assume that it was election propaganda with a view to getting that Deputy elected to Europe.  This kind of scare tactic is not fair, because ordinary people worry a lot about it.  I do not know if Deputy Desmond realises what it is like to have a young family of five or six children, or one child for that matter, and live about 15 miles from the nearest national school. Statements by people such as the Deputy to the effect that the school transport system is to be terminated to some degree frightens people in that position.  It is not right to make such a suggestion when it is not based on fact, when it is purely fictitious, mischievous and is blatant propaganda.  I am glad further consideration has been given to the film industry.  It is fair to say that it can make an enormous contribution to the Irish <Col N="2064" /> economy.  Following the filming and distribution of &ldquo;Ryan's Daughter&rdquo;, which was shot in the beautiful Dingle Peninsula, tourism boomed.  Indeed, to this day many thousands of visitors wish to see the village where it was made and visit the various places where the film was shot.  It is good to see further encouragement being given to the film industry under the provisions of the Bill.  We have some of the most beautiful scenery in the world and it would be marvellous if major films were to be made as a result of this incentive.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell in the course of his address on behalf of the Progressive Democrats stated that we should have radical tax reform on the one hand and also have a tax on property.  However, he did not say this directly; he just said we should finance local government separately and have major decreases in the tax rates to compensate for that.  To a large extent this suggestion means that we rob Peter to pay Paul and I am not sure that it would be acceptable to the majority of people.  I believe we should continue with the phased reduction of our tax rates and that we should try to hold inflation at present levels, although that is going to be extremely difficult because our economy has a high dependence on imports, particularly on oil.</P>
    <P>When you import goods, it is fairly clear that you import inflation so that to a certain extent we are not the masters of our own destiny and to a certain degree we are dependent on outside factors as to whether inflation comes down or goes up.  This will be one of the great challenges facing our Government over the coming years.  Only last week we saw the battle the Minister for Industry and Commerce had with the oil giants. However, we must be seen to stand up to any multinational organisation which would presume to instruct a sovereign Government how it should or should not conduct its business.  I congratulate the Minister for Industry and Commerce on his stance.  It was the correct thing to do, but it clearly illustrates the difficulty our economy faces in keeping inflation down.</P>
    <P>In so far as we are masters of our <Col N="2065" /> own destiny, we have been tremendously successful in keeping inflation and interest rates down.  The foundation stone for the revival of the economy has been laid and I sincerely hope that in future years we will see the benefits of today's measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I have had to sit through a speech by Deputy O'Donoghue from Kerry which could only be described as either playacting from beginning to end or means that Deputy O'Donoghue is totally illiterate as far as economics are concerned. I prefer to believe it was mere playacting.</P>
      <P>There are a number of things that have to be said at the outset.  There have been three Social Welfare Bills and three budgets, but unemployment remains at crisis level despite the fact that &mdash; according to the Government's own figures &mdash; emigration has multiplied from Kerry, Donegal, Mayo and Dublin and from every parish in the country.  When Mr. Haughey left office in 1982 inflation was running at 21 per cent but when he took office in 1987 it was 3 per cent.  In 1982 inflation was twice the European level but by 1987 it was only half that figure. Contrary to what Deputy O'Donoghue has said, inflation is now higher than when the Government assumed office and it is going up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, I wish to recite the indisputable facts and put right a great deal of the revisionism by economic and political commentators which reflects the sort of outrageous claims by Fianna Fáil.  As I have said, when the present Taoiseach left office in 1982 inflation was 21 per cent &mdash; was it or was it not?  Does Deputy O'Donoghue admit that it was 3 per cent when they returned to office?  When Mr. Haughey left office in 1982 the trade deficit was £1,800 million &mdash; a crisis in our balance of trade.  Was it or was it not? When Mr. Haughey returned to office in 1987 we had a balance of trade surplus for the first time in 40 years.  In 1982, when Mr. Haughey left office every single State company was losing money, with the exception of Aer Rianta who made a <Col N="2066" /> profit of £100,000 and they do not have depreciation expenses.  However, when he returned to office almost all State companies were making profits, some of them for the first time.  Indeed, in 1982 the top rate of VAT was 35 per cent but it had been reduced to 25 per cent by 1987 when Mr. Haughey again took office.  The top rate of income tax was 60 per cent in 1982 but this was reduced to 58 per cent.  Mr. Haughey himself has estimated that emigration for the year ending 15 April 1987&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be grateful if the Deputy would refer to the Deputy by his appropriate title, be it Deputy, Minister, or Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The present Taoiseach has estimated that emigration for the period ending 15 April 1987 &mdash; the intercensus period &mdash; when he had just resumed office was 8,000.  However, he has admitted that for the period up to April 1988, the first full year of his Government it was 35,000.  The figures are not yet available for the period ending 15 April 1989 but the estimates are that the numbers will be a great deal higher than 35,000.  The highest increase in registered unemployment by far in any one year was when the present Taoiseach was in office in 1980 when it increased by 40,000.</P>
      <P>The eighth point is that all the major development in urban areas are because of the designated areas which were introduced by the last Government and of low interest rates achieved because of public expenditure cuts by the Government. However, those were the cuts which the Fine Gael Party proposed in Government and which were recklessly opposed by Fianna Fáil as &ldquo;monetarist and That-cherite&rdquo;. The reduction of interest rates which followed was exactly as we had predicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ninth point is that when the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, left office in 1982 no airline, apart from Aer Lingus, had been licensed for international routes.  I changed that three months after coming to office and it has led to the air fares revolution which is a specifically <Col N="2067" /> Irish phenomenon.  The expansions of Dublin, Cork, Galway and Shannon airport were decisions of the last Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>They can take credit for that because it cost ten times what Sligo and Galway cost.  It is a disgrace.</P>
      <P>The eleventh point is that not one single employment scheme was introduced by Fianna Fáil.  All the employment schemes were introduced by the last Government.  The enterprise allowance scheme, the employment incentive scheme, the social employment scheme and the teamwork scheme were introduced by the previous Government and that is why the rate of unemployment was less when we were in office and why there was less emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My twelfth point is about the economic foundations.  The family income scheme was introduced by the last Government to help those on low pay.  The Combat Poverty Agency was introduced by the last Government.  The business expansion scheme and the major road building programme now on stream was initiated and provided for by the last Government and they also eliminated housing waiting lists.  In Northern Ireland affairs it was the Fine Gael-Labour Government who negotiated the Sunningdale and Anglo-Irish Agreements.  That is the background to Fianna Fáil coming into office. The outgoing Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, and his successor as leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Dukes, offered in the so-called Tallaght strategy, support for the new Government in tackling the fundamental economic problems.  We told Fianna Fáil that expenditure cuts were necessary, something they had recklessly opposed in opposition.  We also told them that urgent tax, social welfare and social insurance reforms were necessary. Deputy O'Donoghue, in his economically illiterate speech, talked about tax cuts.  Nobody is talking about tax cuts, people are talking about tax reform and <Col N="2068" /> at least Deputy McDowell of the Progressive Democrats has pinpointed an alternative for high income tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McDowell referred to property tax as a means of getting more taxation but Deputy O'Donoghue spoke about robbing Peter to pay Paul.  Deputy O'Donoghue or his Government do not appreciate that the problem in the economy is the failure of Fianna Fáil to do anything about unemployment. There are still 243,000 people unemployed although a minimum of 7,000 have emigrated during the term of office of this Government.</P>

      <P>We did not.  The public sector borrowing requirement was reduced from 23 per cent under Fianna Fáil in 1982 to 10 per cent in 1987.  Unemployment, which Deputy O'Donoghue did not even mention, is registered at 243,000.  Unemployment among the over 25s has gone up by 5,500 since Fianna Fáil came to office.  It has gone down somewhat among the under 25s because, as Deputy O'Donoghue knows, many parishes in his constituency can no longer field a football team as all their youth are in Boston, Croydon or Camden Town. We tax everything dynamic to the hilt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Deputy's benefit I will repeat my earlier remarks. Inflation was 3 per cent when we left office and we had reduced the public sector borrowing requirement from 23 per cent to 10 per cent.  The enterprise allowance scheme, the employment incentive scheme and the teamwork scheme were introduced by the last Government.  Moreover, unemployment went up by 40,000 when Deputy Haughey was Taoiseach in the early eighties.</P>
      <P>I do not want to keep going over the past but I am trying to illustrate the foundations which were laid due to the unprecedented political support which was offered.  All the Government have done is to aim for lower interest rates which, of course, is a desirable aim as far as it goes but it leaves our economy extraordinarily exposed.  The alarm bells which are now sounding were evident six months ago and in six months' time we will be reaping the whirlwind of the failure of the Government to do anything else except base their economic policy on one-leg interest rates.  If interest rates go up &mdash; as they are almost certain to do &mdash; given that we have a national debt of £26 billion a 1 per cent increase costs £260 million in a full year which goes straight on to the current budget deficit.  A 2 per cent increase costs £520 million and a 3 per cent increase costs £780 million which goes straight on to the current budget deficit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If interest rates go up by 3 per cent all the progress of the past two years and the euphoria of organisations like the CII will be hollow.  I hope that does not happen but I am fearful that it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inflation and interest rates are very much intertwined.  Inflation is on the way up again.  It was down to 2 per cent, but <Col N="2070" /> it is now estimated that it could be as high as 4.5 per cent this year, much higher than the Government's estimate of 3 per cent, an increase on last year.  If interest rates increase and the progress of the last two years is reversed, what will we have to show for the sacrifices we have made? What are the prospects for job creation with both inflation and interest rates increasing when in a period of low interest rates and low inflation we failed to create jobs?  We should bear in mind that there has been low inflation for almost five years.  Yet after a prolonged period of low inflation and low interest rates, unemployment remains at crisis levels and emigration has grown to new heights, If interest rates go up, what would be the outlook?  That is where the great weakness in the Government's economic policies lies.  They have failed utterly to make any fundamental changes in three budgets, three Finance Bills and three Social Welfare Bills.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the figures.  In June 1988, the average industrial wage was £201.88. According to the Central Statistics Office of the European Community, Eurostat and confirmed by the FUE, the additional costs to employers, to cover the payment of disability benefit, maternity benefit and so on, amount to 35 per cent of that figure.  Therefore the cost to the employer of paying the average industrial wage of £201.88 is £272.54.  In the hands of a married employee with four children this becomes a net disposable income of only £108.82 which, after medical cards and so on are taken into account, leaves him worse off than a married man with four children in receipt of long term unemployment assistance.  The man on the average industrial wage is actually worse off than the man in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance.  That is not a rare example; our system is littered with examples of this kind.</P>
    <P>Because of our tax and social welfare structures, the gross earnings of a married person with a family would need to be just over double the long-term unemployment assistance rate to prevent him being worse off at work.  The employer cannot afford to employ and the <Col N="2071" /> employee cannot afford to take up the job or even stay in it &mdash; the classic poverty trap.  This is precisely the problem the Government have not only failed to address but have actually worsened.</P>
    <P>In this year's budget to which the Social Welfare Act, just passed, and this Bill give effect, we have widened the poverty trap because the difference in the net disposable income of those in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance and those in work on the average industrial wage, or less, is now even greater.  What does this mean?  It means that those in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance who want to work &mdash; the vast majority want to work &mdash; cannot afford to go to work unless they manage to get a job carrying a salary way above the average industrial wage, which of course they will not get.  They cannot afford to go to work because then they will be worse off.  That is a fact.</P>
    <P>That is only one of the many anomalies that litter the system.  It arises out of the fact that the man on the average industrial wage of £201.88 ends up paying out about £92 per week in tax, PRSI, pension scheme contributions and transport costs.  If the person lives in a local authority house his rent is assessed on gross income rather than net income, with the result that he pays £17 a week more than the man in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance.  Medical card entitlement and the family income supplement are also assessed on gross income rather than net income with the result that the man on the average wage will not get either.  He ends up worse off.</P>
    <P>This highlights the real problem in the economy &mdash; all enterprise is trapped.  We will never get the economy right until we get employment right.  We will never get employment right as long as we tax the living daylights out of all enterprise while leaving the statics untaxed.  This is the reverse of what happens in all the more progressive countries.  We levy the lowest rates of tax on wealth and property and the highest rates on labour.</P>
    <P>With dangerous warnings of higher inflation and interest rates being sounded <Col N="2072" /> we continue to have huge unemployment figures, the highest in the Community. Because of the failures of the Government, if interest rates and inflation rise, it is likely our unemployment figures will also rise with a consequent increase in emigration.</P>
    <P>The Government have been offered unparelleled latitude by the Opposition to get the affairs of this country in order but they sought to base their entire economic strategy on one leg and one leg only, low interest rates.  This is a partial policy which is exposed to outside developments over which we have no control.  The alarm bells which the business organisations and economic commentators have been ringing over the past six months are beginning to ring even louder now.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill does absolutely nothing to address the underlying problems. The point that should be made is that it is not too late to do something. We have yet to take the Committee Stage of this Bill and there are between eight and ten weeks of this session left.  What can we do?  We could agree to accept proposals from this side of the House to dramatically reduce the rates of income tax and to pay for it we suggested a combination of proposals.  Two years ago we proposed that an all party committee be set up to agree a means to pay for sharp reductions in the rates of income tax but this was refused by the Government.  We have been pressing for sharp reductions in the rates of income tax and have listed a number of items which could be considered, among them the cancellation of some of the concessions to industry which were designed to encourage job creation but have not done so we proposed also the cancellation of grants to industry as these discourage the Employment of people and encourage the employment of machinery.  We grant aid machinery but we tax payroll and labour.  We proposed, too, some form of local or property tax in order to return local responsibility to the councils and relieve income tax.</P>
    <P>On last years Social Welfare Bill when I was spokesman for my party on social <Col N="2073" /> welfare I proposed extensive amendments which would help to remove many of the anomalies on the social welfare side.  I will highlight some of those anomalies, which have in no sense been addressed by this Government.</P>
    <P>First, absenteeism in this country is twice the level of that in the UK &mdash; to be precise 1.8 times &mdash; which is another major disincentive to employing people. Employers do not know when their employees are claiming disability benefit; they are not notified.  Therefore, we have the widespread practice of people claiming disability benefit while still at work or sometimes on holiday from work.  Prosecutions are beginning to take place and people are beginning to lose their jobs, but this is still happening on a wide scale. Last year I proposed the simple expedient that when a disability benefit cheque was being issued by post to the recipient a stub of the same cheque be sent to the employer and that when employees submit their medical certificates they should have to supply the name, address and registered number of their employer. That simple expedient, which was not adopted, would have solved that aspect of absenteeism which is one of the great curses preventing employment.  When workers progress towards the end of the tax year many of them go into a higher tax band.  Consequently, they decide they are not going to pay 56p. in the £ and they go sick for a few weeks and get their tax rebated.  Disability benefit is not only not taxed but the person is counted as having no income so he gets a rebate of the tax he paid previously.  Therefore, people can be as much as £50 a week better off out sick than at work.  There was no reform by the Government of that.</P>
    <P>In the Social Welfare Bill last year we sought to give the Minister power by regulation &mdash; not forcing it on him, just giving him enabling power &mdash; to start to shift the payroll tax, of which social insurance is 12.5 per cent on the low paid from pay to turnover.  Nothing was done. We also sought enabling power for the Minister to exempt the first £1,000, £2,000 or £3,000 of income from both <Col N="2074" /> employer's and employees' PRSI to help the low paid not be worse off in work than on social welfare.  Nothing was done about that either.  At the moment the more capital employed, the more machinery employed and the higher the turnover is per head employed, the less social insurance you pay but the more you employ the more tax you pay.  In our situation of grieviously high unemployment it is absurd that we should so penalise employment.</P>
    <P>The Government refused to take the offer of enabling legislation to inch their way across from payroll to turnover so as to relieve the burden, even in part, on those who employ people.  They refused to take the offer of enabling power to stop inching away social insurance contributions from the first few thousand pounds of income and to abolish the upper limit, which would greatly help labour intensive industries.  As the House will know, social insurance is payable on the first £16,200.  Therefore, an employer who has a large number of employees all earning under £16,200 &mdash; there is a considerable number of such employers &mdash; pays social insurance on every single penny of payroll.  The employer who hires a small number of very highly paid people does not pay unemployment social insurance on every single pound of payroll because anything over £16,200 is exempt.  Companies employing high salaried people pay a much smaller contribution than those who are employing low salaried people.  Therefore, despite low inflation for the past four or five years, low interest rates for the past two or three years and other good economic indicators, we have not made an impact on employment.  We have had trade surpluses for four or five years.  We exported more for five years than we imported, yet our unemployment figure is still 243,000. This Government have done nothing whatever to bring about fundamental reform.  It has not been for lack of firm offers, firm proposals or firm invitations from this side of the House.  Even at this late stage and given the warning signs now emerging on the horizon all the more clearly, the offer of my party to have an <Col N="2075" /> all-party committee to report within a given number of months, two or three, on tax reform still stands.  The Government refused the offer over the past two years but I am pleading with them to accept the offer now because we need urgently to do something that transforms completely the environment for employing people.</P>
    <P>If interest rates go up and if inflation continues to go up as is now evident, what are the prospects in respect of employment and emigration when the figures in these two areas remain at such crisis levels at a time of low inflation and low interest rates?  We could have a major crisis in the offing despite the uncritical euphoria of many economic commentators over the past few years.  We could be in a crisis in six months.  It is not too late for the Government to recognise that much more needs to be done than just relying on low interest rates which can be set aside very quickly owing to international factors.</P>
    <P>The great failure of the Government has been on employment.  The second emerging failure looks likely to be inflation.  The cost of things in this country is already very high and now inflation is creeping up again with all the implications of that for competitiveness, labour costs which transmit themselves into public sector costs for public sector employment and more taxes.  Inflation, brought down so successfully by the last Government despite opposite trends internationally, is now looking like a second major problem for us.  We can already hear the Fianna Fáil apologists saying inflation is bound to go up by this year, that it has gone up in England.  Let them remember that the last Government got inflation down when inflation was going up in England.  One of the awful failures of Fianna Fáil in the past ten years has been in controlling inflation. They left office in 1982 with inflation ranging at 21 per cent, twice the European average, and it looks again as if they are going to fall into the same bad habits of high inflation and high costs.  They have been an abysmal failure on the <Col N="2076" /> inflation side in the past ten or 12 years. They let inflation rip.</P>
    <P>In Britain the Thatcher Government have to some extent fallen into the same trap as this Government, that is depending excessively on one aspect of economic policy alone.  They have placed incredible reliance on the control of inflation as the key to economic success, a one-legged policy, just as our Government have had a one-legged economic policy of depending on low interest rates.  As a result of their failure in regard to inflation, huge interest rates have emerged in Britain, as well as balance of payments crisis.  This is 1989.  Seven years ago precisely the same situation pertained here as the present Taoiseach left office.  Inflation raged at 21 per cent and we had a balance of trade deficit of £1,800 million, the worst in our history.  There was an enormous crisis.</P>
    <P>Both these problems were brought under control and in the case of trade it was brought into surplus for the first time by the previous Government.  Inflation is beginning to rise again in an economy which is already a high cost economy because of past failures.</P>
    <P>We talk about the promotion of tourism, yet we tax to the hit two major commodities which affect tourists, namely petrol and drink.  Our greatest market in the past was Britain but the British tourists have stopped coming. Initially that was due to the Northern troubles.  Any who come now are absolutely shocked by the prices of petrol and drink compared to the position in the UK, yet the Government in the budget increased the price of petrol by 4p. Anyone who lives here knows that it is very expensive to buy anything.  There has been progress in the past four years because our inflation rate fell below the British rate and was actually half that rate.  Their inflation is going up now, as ours is.  How can we expect tourists to come here to buy excessively priced drink and excessively priced petrol?  In the latter case 70 per cent of the cost is represented by an imposition by the State.</P>
    <P>On the employment front, 1992 is supposed to be all about the Single Market, <Col N="2077" /> to create jobs in Europe.  The greater the market the fewer the formalities which will be required, the more easily goods and services can flow between countries and the more jobs will be created.  It is a sound economic proposition but this Government, while talking a great deal about 1992, are not only doing very little to prepare for it but are putting matters into reverse.</P>
    <P>One of the areas of maximum hope for the expansion of employment is the transport sector, yet our road haulage industry is at a 27 per cent disadvantage compared to the same industry in the United Kingdom, who will by 1992 have direct access to our roads and our market. They will be able to pick up goods in this State and deliver to a second point in the State.  Of course the reverse is true.  Our hauliers will be able to pick up in Birmingham and deliver to London or Glasgow. They would be able to do the same in France but we cannot do it competitively if our hauliers through excessive costs in regard to fuel, insurance and excise duties are at a 27 per cent disadvantage, together with distance from the main market.</P>
    <P>I proposed three years ago that there should be a five-year plan to eliminate that 27 per cent disadvantage by stages. The cost would be too great to do it in one or two years.  Not only have this Government done nothing about it but the Minister for Tourism and Transport allowed the Government in this year's budget to increase petrol costs yet again, thereby increasing the disadvantage of our transport sector.  I also proposed that we as a nation should set up a major Irish distribution centre somewhere in the north-west area of the Continent, a centre where our hauliers could locate as a base, with overnight facilities, translating office and communication facilities, and repair and garaging facilities.  I proposed that our small industries would have advance warehouse facilities at cheap cost.  Thereby they could have advance goods close to the market so that no strike in the British docks, no shipping crisis or inclement weather could be a factor in delaying the delivery of their <Col N="2078" /> goods to the customer.  Nothing has been done by the Government to pursue that proposal, despite many communications and a lot of pressure from me.</P>
    <P>If we believe, as I passionately do, that 1992 offers tremendous scope for increased employment for Irish drivers and the whole transport industry, it will only do so if we are able to increase our market share of the carriage of goods within the entire Community.  If we could get even 1 per cent of that business we would be able to employ as many as 30,000 or 40,000 people in transport. Rather than forcing people to emigrate, we should set up this major distribution centre which would allow drivers to work week on week off.  It would be possible to get home quickly and cheaply.  Unless we overcome the disadvantages of cost and peripherality we will lose the opportunity that 1992 presents for employment on the transport front.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism and Transport is here and he might elaborate in detail during his contribution on the present statistics as to the relative disadvantage of our haulage industry as compared to the haulage industry in the UK and other Community countries. Perhaps he could tell us what has happened since he became Minister over two years ago.  What have the trends been in regard to disadvantage?  What has happened in regard to fuel, excise and insurance costs?  What plans has the Minister to overcome the problem of peripherality for our transport industry or for that industry to capture a market share of the transport business in the Community after 1992?  If he has any plans he has kept them very much to himself.</P>
    <P>One of the most outrageous claims made by the Minister for Tourism and Transport was at an infamous press conference about tourism figures which he called but at which he arrived half an hour late.  It was attended by many people from Bord Fáilte.  He claimed it was he who introduced low air fares.  The <i>Evening Press</i> is not known to be a supporter of Fine Gael&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Col N="2079" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The next day the <i>Evening Press</i> derided the outrageous, silly and untrue claims of the Minister, Deputy John Wilson, who had been previously Minister for Transport and had done nothing about opening up the airways. Claiming credit for the airfare revolution was such an absurdity as to be mocked by the <i>Evening Press</i> itself.  They said that while they held no brief for Deputy Jim Mitchell it was he and his Government who introduced competition in the air and reduced air fares.</P>
      <P>What has the Minister done to promote cheaper air fares and encourage the introduction of more services to continental Europe?  What has he done in the Council of Transport Ministers to get increased market access for our airlines?  The reality is that we, under the previous Government, decided to open up the airways. Three months after the change of Government in March 1983 we licenced Avair to British mainland airports. Unfortunately that experiment collapsed after a period, as we feared it would, because the airline in question overreached itself too quickly, as we told them we thought they were doing.  Some time later Ryanair came on the scene and I was facing a barrage from two sides.  The Air Transport Users Committee wanted me to rush my fences and licence them for everything they asked for.  On the other hand Aer Lingus and the trade unions said that licensing them would bring ruin.  My own judgment was that a progressive opening up of the airways would not bring ruin but would be advantageous not only to the air traveller but to the airlines themselves, and so it proved. That was a phenomenal success.  It was described on television last week as one of the most profound economic decisions taken by any Irish Government in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That needs to be developed.  Alongside that policy, we in the Council of Transport Ministers insisted that we would agree to no package of reform unless it <Col N="2080" /> led to increased market access.  If 1992 is to mean anything it has to mean the removal of distortions of competition. Any airline confined to be a base of three million people is at an enormous disadvantage compared to an airline based on 60 million people as are the British, German, French and Italian airlines.  Our objective must be to achieve completely free access to all Community routes.  This cannot be done overnight, but it must be the clear objective.  The other side of the coin is, of course, that European airlines will have more access to routes within Ireland and from Ireland, but Aer Lingus and Ryanair would be more than willing to take on all on the level playing pitch of equal access.  It is difficult for small airlines to compete with those based on populations 20 times as high and having enormous fleets.  We need more and cheaper access.</P>
    <P>There has been very little progress in regard to air fares to continental Europe. The progress has all been in regard to Ireland and Britain.  Sometimes one hears credit being given to the Commission and in particular to my esteemed colleague, Peter Sutherland, in regard to the progress in air fares.  While I would not wish to detract from his sterling performance as commissioner, the lower air fares have nothing to do with the Commission.  They were local decisions made by the Irish Government to open up the airways to competition.  The sharp reduction in air fares between Ireland and Britain is an Irish phenomenon; it has not happened elsewhere in the Community.  It needs to happen, and this will only be done by allowing more access, and people will only travel if there is more access, more competition and cheaper fares.  That is the lesson of our experience since 1983. That experience needs to be built on in Europe.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned the Minister, Deputy Wilson, while fully embracing the policies espoused by me in office, has had little success in opening up the airways to Europe or in reducing air fares to continental Europe.  If the Minister thinks I am wrong perhaps he will cite figures.  What was the air fare to Paris <Col N="2081" /> when he came into office, and what is it now?</P>

      <P>It relates to the economy, Sir.  The Finance Bill always allows a wide-ranging debate on the economy. My contention is that the Government's policy has been a one-legged policy which depends solely on low interest rates and if that leg is kicked from under them, as it could very well be in the coming months, their economic policy will be in ruins and this country will be ruined with it.  I am trying to illustrate that this Bill, the third Finance Bill of this Government, fails to address many of the key economic <Col N="2084" /> problems which continue to force on the country high unemployment and high emigration.  There is no reform of income tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there is no reform of social insurance, there is no reform of social welfare, there is no reform of transport and there are no jobs.  This is a repetition of the performance of the 1977-82 Fianna Fáil Government which, I will remind the Minister, allowed unemployment to go up by 40,000 in 1980, the worst ever increase in any one year. Inflation rose to 21 per cent by 1982, twice the European average, and the Government are now at it again.  I am pleading with the Government not to waste the opportunity in this Finance Bill, if not on Second Stage then on Committee Stage, to accept the proposal of my party for an all party committee on tax reform to report on agreed tax changes and the funding there of within, say, three months.  We offered this suggestion before but the Government refused it and we are offering it again.  The parameters of that committee could also include changes in social welfare and social insurance as they relate to wages and tax so that we would remove the many anomalies and traps that litter the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If people in work apply for a medical card they are assessed not on their take home pay but on their gross pay.  Similarly if people apply for family income supplement they are assessed on their gross pay.  If people go to the community welfare officer for assistance to buy school uniforms or to pay bills they will be told they cannot be helped because they are employed.  When people go for a means test for legal aid, for education grants or for anything else, they are assessed on their gross pay, but they do not receive their gross pay because there is such high tax and PRSI deducted.  That means many people with families are much better off unemployed but they do not want to be unemployed.  They are <Col N="2085" /> taking from the economy when they want to contribute to it.  This is creating all sorts of problems in morale, an increase in crime and so on.  If we do not address the unemployment problem &mdash; and the Government have singularly failed to do that &mdash; we will have many other problems. Having failed to address the unemployment problem over the past four or five years when interest and inflation rates were low, we will have less chance of doing so if, as now seems likely, inflation and interest rates rise again.</P>

There were no housing waiting lists because we had solved the housing problem.  The road building programme had started as had the air fares revolution.  The maximum rate of VAT was reduced from 35 per cent to 25 per cent.  The maximum rate of income tax was reduced from 60p in the pound to 58p.  They were the achievements of the last Government.</P>
      <P>We were told by a reckless Opposition that we were monetarist Thatcherites. Those same people are now trying to accuse us of increasing the debt too much.

I believe we could get thousands of extra jobs for Irish workers driving trucks around Europe on a week on week off basis if there was a major national distribution centre for Ireland on the Continent, which I have proposed but about which nothing has been done.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill has again been a major disappointment.  It does not contain any fundamental reforms.  If inflation and interest rates rise, as predicted, the policies of the Government which have been eulogised so uncritically for two years will be seen to have failed.  The unfortunate fact is that thousands of our people now in jobs will be forced on to the unemployment queues.  They will add to the legions of unemployed and emigrants. That is not a future any of us wants.  I appeal to the Government to accept some of the proposals made by this side of the House in the last two years on tax and social welfare.  It is not too late for them to do so.</P>

      <P>As was suggested by a Cork Deputy behind me earlier, Deputy <Col N="2088" /> Mitchell who has concluded his contribution on the Finance Bill, has a selective memory.  He did not remind the House, for example, that when we left office in the early eighties the price of a barrel of crude oil was $39-plus.  It dropped and dropped since then but it is going back up.  At present it stands at about $19 per barrel.  The drop impacted very much on the economy at that time.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that, as was called to the Deputy's attention, when the National Coalition took office our national debt was roughly £12 billion but when we returned to office it was £25 billion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it was not surprising because we could not get from the national Coalition any type of agreement on what steps to take with regard to the increasing national debt.  The Coalition donkey was being pulled to the right by Deputy Bruton, it was being pulled to the left by Deputy Desmond and it got the head staggers to such an extent that it finally lay down in the middle of the road.  The result was that the country was at a complete standstill and the economy was stagnant.</P>

      <P>I should like to indicate to the House that had the Coalition Government stabilised the national debt at £12 billion, which they found it at, there would be £1,000 million available for economic development today.  It should be noted that I am not talking about reducing the national debt but stabilising it.  The national debt has been stabilised and we intend, despite the messages of doom and gloom which we <Col N="2089" /> heard from Deputy Mitchell, to stabilise and reduce it with the other consequent good effects on our economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>For obvious reasons Deputy Mitchell's party leader switched <Col N="2090" /> him from Tourism and Transport to be spokesman on some other Department and, consequently, I can forgive him for not knowing what has happened in the Transport area since then.  I should like to point out to him that on 14 December 1987 we, after a long and very tough tussel in the Council of Ministers during which I representing the Irish Government, we fought very hard on the liberalisation front and got an interim package which has revolutionised transport in Europe in every way.  It is only part of the deal and the next part comes up for treatment in the first six months of 1990.  We hope to extend the liberalisation process.  Fifth freedom rights are now being exercised once more by Aer Lingus to Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Milan on a combination of points, and four or five other destinations in Europe. That is being done by an Irish company, and it is important to stress that seeing that Deputy Mitchell wants to beat that drum.</P>
      <P>I have signed a liberal package with Lord Brabazon with regard to air transport between Ireland and UK.  I have had the privilege of asking European Ministers in Council to take that agreement as an example of where we should go with regard to aviation liberalisation.  All party committees, the last refuge of failed politicians, seem to play a big part in Deputy Mitchell's thinking.  He should know that a camel is a horse designed by an all-party committee.  The Deputy referred to stagnation in transport but I should like to tell him that as far as car sales are concerned the figures for this year show a substantial increase.  I will not mention cement sales or wander like him.  The Deputy could not concentrate on the Bill before the House and I will not follow him in that bad example.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill incorporates changes which reinforce and continue the commitment of this Government to bring order to the public finances and to building up the economy. This commitment is consistent with the broad strategy set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  That programme, which has the support of the major social partners, will continue to provide the framework for economic and social development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its adoption in October 1987, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has achieved considerable success and it provides the basis for substantial further progress. The National debt has been stabilised relative to Gross National Product and interest rates have been reduced.  Cost and price trends have moderated and there have been realistic improvements in take-home pay.  At the same time, business confidence and investment have strengthened.  Most significantly, there has been a recovery in economic activity and employment.  In these circumstances the Government intend, quite wisely, to adhere to the broad strategy in the <i>Programme for <Col N="2092" /> National Recovery</i>.  By adhering to that strategy, the Government are reaffirming their commitment to the maintenance of a fiscal, exchange rate and cost climate conducive to sustained economic growth. In turn, this will require a strict discipline on public expenditure and a broadening of the tax base.  It is important to realise that the Finance Bill which we have before us today constitutes a key element in our overall strategy for growth and development of the economy.</P>
    <P>We are very fortunate that the foundations for improving the growth and employment prospects of our economy have been laid during the past two years by the achievement of a broad consensus on economic and social development. The <i>National Development Plan, 1989-1993</i>, which was submitted to the European Commission last month, builds on those foundations.  The plan is designed to prepare the Irish economy as a whole to compete successfully in the single internal market of the European Community. The plan sets out the structural measures, which Ireland proposes to implement over the next five years, in conjunction with the European Community Structural Funds, with a view to achieving the national and Community aim of greater economic and social cohesion.</P>
    <P>I will not dwell on the gamut of detailed measures contained in the plan, as such measures were debated thoroughly in the House last week.  Of course, I recommended them to Deputy Jim Mitchell for deep study and contemplation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <P>Rather, I wish to mention just one dimension of the plan which is relevant to this debate.  Of course, Deputy Mitchell's interruption encourages me to ask him by how much he reduced excise duties on vehicles or by how much he reduced fuel in the four years and two months during which he was Minister in that Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the commitment in the plan to achieving a movement towards greater equity and fairness in the tax system.</P>
      <P>The Government recognise that the level of personal and certain other forms of taxation, by adversely affecting the cost competitiveness of the economy, is a major impediment to the achievement of sustained economic and employment growth.  There is broad agreement that high personal taxes are a disincentive to enterprises, undermine work incentive and directly inhibit job creation.  Against this background, it is necessary to recognise how the reliefs in income tax introduced by this Government in recent years have played an important role in underpinning the moderation in pay settlements agreed under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  Of course, Deputy Mitchell did not mention anything about reduction of income tax at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What about transport costs?  Will the Minister tell us about transport costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As is indicated in the national plan, the further easing of personal taxation, therefore, will be an important objective of fiscal policy over the medium term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have been pursuing a phased programme of tax reform, whilst <Col N="2094" /> having regard to achieving an overall reduction in Exchequer borrowing, so crucial to the stimulation of sustained economic recovery.  That tax reform programme has been continued in this year's budget and is spelt out in the Finance Bill.  Three key features of the tax reform programme were highlighted by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in the Dáil yesterday.  They merit repeating here today.  They are: further sizeable reductions in personal tax including a highly significant cut in the actual rates of tax I think the proposal was a reduction from 60 per cent to 58 per cent.  I suggest that Deputy Mitchell takes a look at the rates now; new development incentives and, at the same time, measures to ensure that earlier incentives are not abused; and further improvements in tax administration and reasonable measures to counteract transactions which are aimed primarily at tax avoidance and which, if not curbed, could prove costly to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Of course, as Deputies will be aware, in the heel of the hunt, it is only by effective tax administration and a broadening of the tax base, combined with savings on Government expenditure, that we will be able to achieve the lower level of personal tax that we all desire. In this context, ordinary taxpayers will welcome the measures introduced in the Finance Bill to counter the avoidance of tax.  Section 76 of the Bill has been introduced to counteract certain transactions which have little or no commercial reality but are carried out primarily to create an artificial tax deduction or to avoid or reduce a tax charge. Under the terms of the section, the Revenue Commissioners are entitled to form the opinion that a transaction is a tax avoidance transaction.  Where they form an opinion that a transaction is a tax avoidance transaction they will give to each person whom they consider is attempting to avoid tax, by reason of the transaction, a notice in writing describing the transaction, the amount of tax which they consider the person is attempting to avoid and the steps which the Revenue Commissioners would propose to take <Col N="2095" /> in order to ensure that the tax is not avoided.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance pointed out in the Dáil yesterday this anti-avoidance provision of the Finance Bill represents a new development in Irish tax law but is by no means a new development in the international context.  The need for a general provision here was highlighted by a decision of the Supreme Court last July in what has become known as the &ldquo;McGrath case&rdquo;.  It was clear, following that decision, that the means to counter tax avoidance schemes had to be fundamentally reviewed if the Exchequer was not to incur a major loss of tax revenue.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise, however, that the introduction of this section on anti-avoidance is designed specifically to ensure that only those who are intent on avoiding tax will be affected.  This section of the Finance Bill is not designed to create uncertainties for genuine business transactions or for the normal use of recognised tax reliefs.  For that reason this section contains explicit safeguards to allow legitimate transactions to continue.</P>
    <P>In short, there is no question of this Government coming under the influence of the Sheriff of Nottingham School of Taxation, about which Miriam Hederman O'Brien wrote in the current edition of <i>The Irish Banking Review;</i> for the uninitiated, the doctrine of that school of taxation is summarised as &ldquo;You have money, I need it, you hand it over&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I now turn to a Government scheme which encourages investment in tourism and in certain Irish shipping activities.  I refer to the business expansion scheme. As Members of the House are aware, the development of the Irish tourism sector, having regard to its labour intensive nature, is central to the Government's medium-term strategy in relation to employment.  At present the sector sustains 67,000 full-time job equivalents, or 6 per cent of the labour force, while export earnings from the sector make it Ireland's third largest source of foreign earnings.</P>
    <P>But the tourism sector has a lot more <Col N="2096" /> potential which still needs to be harnessed. It was in this context that the Government extended the business expansion scheme in order to stimulate tourist-related investment in the 1987 budget.  The extension of the scheme was specifically designed as a means of maximising our share of the fast expanding specialist holiday segment of the tourist market.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, some criticisms have been levelled at the operation of the business expansion scheme.  It has been suggested that the scheme has not been achieving the original objective of encouraging the provision of equity capital for high-risk companies, which offered the prospect of substantial gains to the economy in terms of output and, above all, jobs.  The Government are concerned to ensure that the scheme applies only to those projects for which it was originally designed.  Accordingly, the Government decided to make certain changes in the business expansion scheme, which strike a balance between ensuring that action is taken to restrict relief under the scheme whilst, at the same time, enabling BES funding for deserving projects to continue. Section 7 of the Finance Bill contains a number of significant changes which are intended to redirect the scheme back to its original purposes.</P>
    <P>Specifically, section 7 of the Finance Act introduces five measures.  It provides that, where BES money is being used for the purchase of a ship, that ship must represent a beneficial addition to the Irish shipping register; it imposes a limit of £2.5 million on the amount of money a company or group of companies can raise under the scheme; it excludes from the scheme international leasing and related financial services; it also excludes self-catering accommodation in the city or county of Dublin and the urban areas of Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway; and, finally, it provides that BES relief will not be available on shares in relation to which options or guarantees are held which provide for sale at other than market value at the end of the five-year period for which shares must be retained under the scheme.  Its original purpose <Col N="2097" /> was to aid high risk ventures.  Under the section of the Finance Bill the new measures will apply in respect of shares issued on or after the date of publication of the Finance Bill, that is, 12 April 1989.  I am quite confident that these measures will enable the business expansion scheme to operate.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposal in section 7 of the Bill to exclude the operation of self-catering facilities in certain urban areas from the scope of the business expansion scheme, the following comments are applicable.  As the House will be aware this scheme was extended by the Government to the export tourism sector for the first time in the 1987 Finance Act.  The scheme existed before that in relation to manufacturing industry and others.  This reflected the Government's desire to encourage private sector investment in tourist accommodation and amenities catering primarily for overseas tourists.  This decision met with a welcome and most positive response from the private sector, with Bord Fáilte, to date, having approved marketing and development plans in respect of some 74 projects involving total planned investment of over £110 million.  This adds very considerably to our tourism product which we want to develop to attract tourists here.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this response, both the Minister for Finance and I have been concerned that a few projects involve investment in self-catering houses and apartments in urban areas of the country in whose asset value is appreciating at a high rate.  This type of investment has, of late, because of rising house values in isolated areas, received quite a bit of media publicity, highlighting the potentially low risk nature of the investments. This could obviously encourage increased use of the scheme for ventures of this nature thus deflecting investment funds away from tourism products in need of development in other areas of the country.  As the House knows one of the strengths of the tourism industry is that it can be developed in areas which have no other industry, either manufacturing or otherwise.  Na háiteanna iargúlta, as <Col N="2098" /> they say, can benefit very substantially from this industry as distinct from others.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, one of the main objectives of the scheme is to encourage high risk investment.  Projects involving investment in the type of property, which is now being excluded under section 7, scarcely reflects this objective.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Minister for Finance, in the Bill before the House, is now acting to avert this type of situation.  I, therefore, fully endorse the proposal in the Bill to exclude from the scope of the scheme self-catering accommodation in the areas mentioned.  This will ensure that the scheme achieves the type of investment which will be of most benefit to tourism, and that investment will be in projects which, while having the potential to considerably increase tourist traffic also carry high risks for the investor.  That is the important point.  It will also copper-fasten the spirit of enterprise and risk taking which the scheme is designed to encourage.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes an upper limit of £2.5 million on the amount of shares issued by a qualifying company in respect of which relief can be reclaimed.  This should have the positive effect of creating a greater and more flexible spread of private sector funding across a broader range of qualifying tourism activities rather than a concentration of large funds into a small number of projects.</P>
    <P>Finally, in regard to the business expansion scheme, the Bill proposes that no relief will be provided in respect of shares which are subject to agreements, options or guarantees in regard to the buy-back of investors' shares at a price other than a price equal to the market price at the time of acquisition.  Guaranteed pay-back arrangements currently being offered by promoters effectively attempt to use the scheme for profitable low risk returns for the investment.  This proposal, therefore, again reflects one of the main purposes of the scheme, namely, to promote risk investment.</P>
    <P>I know that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Padraig Flynn, will deal very adequately with the <Col N="2099" /> whole environment and the road situation in particular.  In my negotiations and discussions with the Irish Road Hauliers Association and IOTA, the international hauliers association, the Confederation of Irish Industry, with whom I met recently for a very long and exhaustive treatment of the transport business in the country, they brought to my attention the importance of the development of the road system, particularly the arteries which take our exports to ports in Dublin, Rosslare, Waterford and Cork.  I know that the blueprint for the road development programme which the Minister for the Environment has put together and lodged in Brussels to attract the Structural Funds will cover this area more than adequately.</P>
    <P>In the course of my speech to the House last week I referred to the fact that the most significant reason for the relatively high transport costs in this country was the deficient state of the national roads and the access roads to the principal ports and airports.  For the record of the House, it is reckoned that transport accounts for 9 per cent of total costs in this country as against 4 to 5 per cent on the mainland of Europe, which is an indication that we have double costs. We have to deal with that problem and the Government and the Minister for the Environment are committed to reducing the difference in costs.  Competitiveness is at present the name of the game and will continue to be so in an enhanced and increased fashion after 1992.  As a means of reducing transport costs, the Government propose to invest £775 million in the improvement of national roads during the five year period, 1989 to 1993.  In addition, the private sector are being encouraged to invest in toll roads.  Any such investment will be used to accelerate the programme of investment proposed by the Government for national roads.</P>
    <P>In this context, I should like to refer the House to a section of the Finance Bill which introduces a major incentive for private sector investment in toll-road projects.  Section 15 of the Finance Bill &mdash; and I take it, a Chathaoirligh, you will <Col N="2100" /> agree that I should address myself to this Finance Bill&mdash;contains an amendment whereby the existing 50 per cent capital allowance relief for expenditure on toll-road projects, which expired recently, is now being replaced by a provision to allow the write-off in full of this expenditure against toll income.  In addition, pre-trading interest which arises on capital borrowed to fund this expenditure will also qualify for relief.  The new concession will run for a period of three years, and will encourage the active participation of the private sector in a significant way in the future development of toll roads.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that this Finance Bill, which gives effect to the taxation and other changes announced in the budget of last January, forms a vital part of a consistent and comprehensive strategy for economic growth and employment creation.  The Bill also demonstrates how this Government are continuing with the process of reforming the structure of the taxation system as well as introducing certain specific incentives to help develop the key economic sectors.</P>
    <P>The Government are concerned to foster the efficient working of markets and competition within accepted social conditions.  This is necessary in order to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the economy, to ensure that resources are used to the best effect and to minimise impediments to economic growth and job creation.  More economic growth and more jobs are our key objectives.  It is towards those objectives that the budgetary strategy, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, the <i>National Development Plan</i> and the Finance Bill are all directed.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the point raised by Deputy Mitchell about the need for a continental distribution sector. Given the changes that are taking place in the market place, making a large investment in a centre may not make as much economic sense as Deputy Mitchell believes.  I think his few years away from the transport scene was apparent in the remarks he was making.  He does not <Col N="2101" /> know what the evolution or the development in the transport field have been since he left office.  The people with whom I am discussing the improvement of our access, the improvement of our road system, our port system, our shipping services and our air services are very insistent on the importance of &ldquo;JIT&rdquo; as far as the development of transport is concerned.  The &ldquo;just in time&rdquo; concept is one that is strongly evident in the European scene.  Much more relevant in the economics of transport is the concept of &ldquo;JIT&rdquo; which means moving goods from the factory to the customer without any delay in warehousing.</P>
    <P>There was one reference to air fares. Deputy Mitchell fails to accept that there have been radical initiatives by this Government in relation to air fares into Ireland which have resulted in a dramatic increase in travel to and from Britain and to and from mainland Europe.  Over 250,000 people came last year.  As is pointed out in the <i>National Development Plan</i>, in the past two years the increase has been in the order of 50 per cent.  I do not find it in my heart to criticise Deputy Mitchell for being out of touch because he has not been spokesman on transport in recent years and he was wandering all over the place.  He did not have many effective or punchy points to make regarding transport.  I have no doubt that had he been left in transport his contribution would have been more effective and more germane to the issues as they are now and not as they were two years ago when he left office.</P>

      <P>This Finance Bill comes at a time when we are told that all the indicators in the economy are correct and that the economy is in a period of growth.  Economic growth is of importance because it is a measure of the material progress of the country, but there are problems in the measurement of its economic growth and in reflecting how it is affecting the people in the economy. In terms of economic growth if you dig your dinner in the back garden and shoot a rabbit you do not appear in the economic indicators but if you go down to the supermarket and buy a frozen meal you are increasing the national income. There are difficulties in deciding what effect economic growth is having on people.  Similarly, the measure of GNP has become less important as people realised that the huge profit outflows are included in the GNP.  The huge outflows in the economy in recent years are gone out and are of little benefit to the Irish people.  Therefore, Irish economists no longer focus on GNP in relation to economic growth but on GDP because the gross domestic product excludes these outflows of profits.  The outflows have been very considerable for some years and the forecasts are that they will continue to increase.</P>
      <P>The ESRI, in its medium term forecast, said that the outflows of profits, dividends and royalties in 1987 was £1.413 billion, in 1988 it was £1.652 billion, in 1989 it is forecast as £1.880 billion, in 1990 as £2.141 billion, in 1991 as £2.384 billion and in 1992 as £2.649 billion. There is no evidence that the outflows from the economy will fall or that they will be restricted.  This Finance Bill, no more than any other Finance Bill, has done nothing whatever to deal with this enormous loss to the economy of the outflows in profits, dividends etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of the shortcomings in the measurement of what is called economic growth it has been relatively consistent. Several years of the 1980s actually saw a decline in growth in Ireland compared to growth in most European countries. Industrial output has increased substantially each year in recent times, rising <Col N="2103" /> very rapidly since 1980.  Unfortunately, it is the result of greatly increased productivity by fewer and fewer workers who produce more and more and in that way produce more profits, much of which flows out from the country.  The resulting profits are exported particularly from the multinational companies which have shown the greatest increase in industrial output and, of course, they are also free of tax because they are exporting.  The benefits of the Irish economy are enjoyed not in Ireland but elsewhere.  In the last two years we had growth in gross domestic product between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent.  The Economic and Social Research Institute has forecast economic growth of 3.5 per cent a year until the early 1990s.  I believe the Government concur with this.  This is an improvement on previous years but with different policies it could be of real benefit to the country.</P>
    <P>Ireland's present economic growth is mainly of benefit to those with capital; it no longer spills over to the mass of the people.  In other words the rising tide no longer lifts all boats; the reasons are obvious, and this Finance Bill does not deal with that problem.  All the economic indicators are marvellous and yet unemployment and emigration are of huge proportions. The Government have given the impression that nobody can understand why this happens.  It is very clear why it is happening.  Nothing illustrates the failure of conservative economic policies more clearly than the demographic denuding of Ireland.  Had those one million Irish people who live in other countries stayed here and raised families then the economic growth would have been higher and also domestic demand would have been much higher and there would have been more job opportunities and tax revenue and Ireland would be a more prosperous country.</P>
    <P>There was unprecedented net immigration of over 100,000 people between 1971 and 1979 but this was reversed between 1981 and 1986 with 72,000 emigrating. Ireland's population is likely to fall by about 200,000 between now and <Col N="2104" /> the end of the century.  Using optimistic forecasts an estimated 25,000 people will leave Ireland every year up to the year 1996.  This is up on the average of 18,000 a year between 1981 and 1986.  A total of 325,000 people will have emigrated between 1986 and 2,001 based, as I say, on optimistic forecasts.  The medium assumptions are that 25,000 people will emigrate each year from 1986 to 1996 and 20,000 a year after that up to the year 2001.  The high assumption is 35,000 a year from 1986 to 1991, 30,000 a year between 1991 and 1996 and 25,000 a year from 1996 to 2001.  From the actual outturn in 1986, 1987 and 1988 the high assumptions are the ones which are being reached.  In 1986, 27,000 emigrated, in 1987 the figure was 28,000 and in 1988 it was 32,500.  These figures are based on the CSO figures and on replies to parliamentary questions.  Even taking the medium assumptions a total of 325,000 people will have emigrated by 2001 giving a net loss of 200,000 in the population.</P>
    <P>The Irish will no longer be the young Europeans in the next decade.  They will be a middle-aged and ageing population the same as the rest of Europe at the moment, with the largest growth in the 45 to 65 age group.  There will be a decline in the numbers of young people under 15 &mdash; a fairly massive decline depending on the rate of emigration.  These changes will have implications for the construction industry, for housing, for education, and for health and welfare spending which will be increasing because of the growing elderly greying population. There will be a decline in the dependency ratio due to the decline in the under-15 age group.  In 1971 Ireland's dependency ratio was 42.3 per cent.  In 1986 it had declined to 39.5 per cent and by the year 2000 it is estimated it will be 33.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is forecast to remain at present levels into the next century. There will be stabilisation in the decline in industrial employment but there will be a continuing decline in agricultural employment.  It is interesting that <Col N="2105" /> Michael Dillon one of our leading agricultural economists said perhaps six weeks ago that there had been a loss of 20,000 farmers in the last decade.  It is estimated that 40,000 will have left farming in the next decade.  I do not hear any of the Joe Rays or the Clintons or any of the IFA people screaming about that. Why?  Is it because they will be grabbing up the land as the smaller farmers get out?  That forecast should shake many people particularly Fianna Fáil in Government who say they have fought for the small farmers for many years. While industrial employment will be stabilised, there will be a continuing decline in agricultural employment and in the number of farmers.</P>
    <P>There will be a reduction in public services which will probably have to cease in another year or two because of the need for growth in the numbers in the public service.  We have the lowest percentage of people in the public service and in the civil service taking all other countries in Europe, except Greece.  The fall in employment in the public service will probably ease off in the next few years but unemployment will remain roughly around its present figure up to the end of the century.</P>
    <P>Prices are likely to rise by less than 4 per cent a year in the next few years thanks to the substantial contribution of workers in accepting very moderate wage increases under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in spite of very high and grossly unfair income tax.  Productivity has grown enormously in the eighties.  Output per worker has doubled and in some modern industries output has trebled.  In the past, high productivity profits were shared with workers in the form of higher wages.  Workers used to get a wage increase equal to the rate of inflation plus the growth in productivity. That day has gone.  In that day as well if a worker got a wage increase he would have been able to keep it and not hand it back in tax.  At the end of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> it is very likely that workers will seek to make up lost ground on the wages front, particularly as they know that they have generated massive <Col N="2106" /> profits with increased productivity, and because they see in this Finance Bill, despite all the promises in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, that there is no sign of tax reform.</P>
    <P>One of the major things workers looked forward to in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was tax reform and jobs.  Neither has materialised.  This Finance Bill is a betrayal of the taxpayer. The Government have failed to deliver on the promise of significant tax reliefs to the PAYE sector.  We have the usual minor reshuffling of tax bands with no real tax reform.  Since the great tax marches of the late seventies and the early eighties every Government has promised tax reform yet the burden on the PAYE taxpayer has continued to grow.</P>
    <P>This year's Finance Bill will do nothing.  In fact, the total tax take from the PAYE taxpayer will continue to increase this year.  Since the new tax year started most workers have had an opportunity to see in cash terms what exactly the much-heralded tax changes announced in the budget will mean for them.  In the case of the lower paid especially, the changes have been derisory. In some cases people on lower incomes have been left worse off.  In general terms inflation and the tax concessions will not even be enough to ensure that people are no worse off at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The only tax concession of any significance affects the better off.  A married couple with two children, one spouse earning £8,000 a year, will benefit to the extent of a measly £82.42 a year.  A similar couple earning £30,000 will benefit to the extent of £718.28 in a year, nine times as much.  A single person on £6,000 a year will have an additional £85.92 at the end of the year.  A similar person earning £30,000 will have £648 extra in a year, almost eight times as much.  It is the well off who will benefit most from the reduction in the tax rates and not those who really need tax relief.  The highest rate of tax has gone from 77 per cent in 1976-77 to 56 per cent this year.  That is at the top end.  That relief will apply to the super rich, the Tony O'Reillys, the <Col N="2107" /> Michael Smurfits and Tony Ryans, if indeed they pay any tax at all.</P>

      <P>They are not the people who need tax relief.  Similarly, the decrease from 35 per cent to 32 per cent will also apply to non-earned income such as bank interest to which the DIRT tax is applied.  This is also the case with regard to professional fees covered by the withholding tax.  Once again in this Bill, Fianna Fáil have shown where their real allegiance lies &mdash; with the rich and the super-rich.  On a number of recent occasions I have quoted figures given to me in reply to Dáil Questions by the Minister for Finance, from last October onwards.  These show just how much the tax burden has increased on the PAYE sector when compared with other groups. I make no apologies for repeating these and having them written into the record once again.  An analysis of the figures given to me by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, shows that during the period between 1983 and 1987 the average tax take from PAYE workers increased from £1,911, to £2,920.  That represented an increase of more than £1,000, or 55 per cent.  In the same period the average tax paid by farmers decreased from £705 in 1983 to £585 in 1987, representing a decrease of 17 per cent.  That means in actual figures that the average PAYE worker was paying £56 a week in tax in 1987 when the average farmer was paying £11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incredibly, the average tax paid by farmers decreased in each of the last five years but there has not been any significant improvement, either, in relation to the self-employed.  In 1983 the average PAYE worker paid £401 per year more than the average self-employed person. Given that the self-employed category <Col N="2108" /> includes very many high earning professions, such as medical consultants, engineers, lawyers, accountants, businessmen, employers of all kinds, it is an outrage that the average return from this sector of self-employed should be only £2,526 compared with £2,920 in the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>We are constantly being told that we are the highest taxed people in Europe. That is totally untrue, of course.  What is true is that our workers are the highest taxed workers in Europe.  Corporate taxes have been consistently reduced over the past two decades.  While they used to constitute 10 per cent of taxation, they now bring in only 3 per cent.  Similarly with property taxes, which have also been consistently reduced and are now by far the lowest in Europe.  The wealth tax has been abolished and the capital gains tax is just a farce.</P>
    <P>Both Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats now accept that work is overtaxed, what we have been saying consistently over the years.  They make great play of the need to reduce tax on employees' wages and salaries, something which we have constantly called for but neither Fine Gael nor the Progressive Democrats have said how this should be done.  Labour is overtaxed.  How would the shortfall in income to the Exchequer as a result of reducing the tax on the PAYE worker be made up?  Are Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats saying there should be further cuts in education, in health, in social welfare&mdash; or perhaps its abolition altogether&mdash;if there is to be the enormous drop of intake from the PAYE worker?  We say that the shortfall would be made up by an increase in corporate taxes, in property taxes, in wealth taxes, etc.  We believe that the total tax take must be maintained.  We are not overtaxed in the total tax take. In some cases the tax take must be increased in order to avoid any further cuts in health, in education or social welfare.</P>
    <P>A very substantial part of this Bill is devoted to anti-avoidance measures. This is novel in Ireland.  It is most unusual, a completely new initiative.  It is <Col N="2109" /> not a bit novel in many other countries where it has existed for many years.  We welcome very much the sections in this Finance Bill on tax avoidance.  I hope it is an indication of the Minister's understanding now that what we in The Workers' Party have been saying for many years is true, that there is a crock of gold out there, for a start, in tax evasion and there is another crock of gold in shutting off the loopholes of tax avoidance. We have always been told that everybody was paying his or her fair share but the truth was uncovered last September when £500 million unexpectedly flowed into the Exchequer by post.  I hope that this is an indication that Minister Reynolds understands that the finances will never be got into order, that no tax reform can take place and that the PAYE take cannot be reduced until all loopholes have been closed off, all avoiders stopped and all tax evaders punished.  We have raised this question of tax avoidance and evasion year after year.</P>
    <P>The specific anti-avoidance measures in this Bill arising from the McGrath case are also welcome in so far as they go.  It is disappointing that the measures have not been made retrospective, even if it be necessary to change the Constitution to do so.  There must be some doubt as to the adequacy of those measures.  Too often in the past specific and well intentioned sections of different Finance Bills aimed at ending one vehicle of avoidance ended up opening up further loopholes for the rich to exploit.  Tax avoidance has become one of our few growth industries in recent years.  People involved in this activity have also had the wealth to employ accountants and tax consultants, availing of every possible device and loophole to limit or totally remove tax liability while the tax burden on workers grew heavier each year, it is outrageous that at a time when those on relatively modest incomes are paying up to 58p in the £ on PAYE the small wealthy elite should be permitted to avail of artificial devices to avoid payment of tax on very substantial capital gains.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to contrast the generous way in which our tax regime <Col N="2110" /> and our courts treated the McGraths with the way in which the same parasites treated those who had worked loyally for the Irish Sweepstakes.  Most of these workers had given decades of loyal service to that company.  Yet, when they were no longer necessary to the McGraths' money making exercise, they were cast on the scrap heap, with only token redundancy and little or no pension provision.  These workers were left to pick up the pieces of their lives and eke out a miserable existence while the McGraths, courtesy of their lawyers, accountants and phoney companies in the Isle of Man, were able to laugh all the way to the bank.</P>
    <P>The tax avoidance schemes are in total contrast with the commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> that greater tax equity would be achieved. The Government made a specific commitment in that programme that in the tax area they would make whatever changes are considered necessary whether administrative or legal.  Trade unions must now ensure that there is no pulling of punches on the part of the Government. Legislation to close the loopholes must be watertight.  It should be retrospective and, as I say, the Constitution should be changed, if necessary, to allow for this.</P>
    <P>There are two specific areas in the Finance Bill to which I want to make reference. Section 8 of the Bill &mdash; and I mentioned this following the budget &mdash; allows the employer to hold on to the employees' PAYE deductions for a period up to one year.  In effect this gives the employer a one year interest free loan, and not alone does he have the benefit of the money but he can invest it and gain interest for himself.  This money belongs to his employees or to the Government, but certainly does not belong to the employer.</P>
    <P>I must raise the constitutionality of the section.  A number of people have discussed the constitutionality of the PAYE system and whether it is in accordance with the Constitution to deduct from an employee's rightful earnings, which is the only property that an employee or worker <Col N="2111" /> has under the property provisions of the Constitution.  It may well be unconstitutional but whether it is or not, I believe it is unconstitutional to hand that money back to his boss.  Money is not deducted from the worker's wages to give to his boss but to give to the Government to sustain services, such as health, education, local government and social welfare. The worker is prepared to pay PAYE for these services and does not mind paying a fair rate of tax, if everybody pays the same rate of tax because he understands that it is absolutely essential for running the economy.  Everyone should pay as everyone benefits.</P>
    <P>The workers are prepared to pay their taxes and have them deducted from their week's wages.  However, under this section, the Government are telling the employers that they can deduct the tax from their employees' wages, that they may retain it for one year and that it is theirs to do what they like.  That is my understanding of this section, but I cannot believe it.  It is totally unacceptable that a boss could be told he can deduct the tax from his employees and hold it for a year.  I doubt very much if it is constitutional to hand the tax deducted from the employees to the boss.  Why not leave it to the employees until the end of the year?</P>

      <P>I resisted the introduction of the PAYE system some 30 years ago because the employee lost the right to pay or not to pay his tax as he wished.  Everybody else had that right and availed of it, but the employee has no such right under the PAYE system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now wish to comment on section 15 &mdash; incidentally we will be opposing both sections on Committee Stage.  Section 15 deals with the allowance for certain expenditure on roads, bridges, etc. and I will now refer to it as the Tom Roche section as it was brought in specifically for him.

      <P>I am not criticising Tom Roche, but I am simply saying that there is only one person who has so far built toll roads or bridges.  So I will just call him &ldquo;Mr. Toll Road&rdquo;.  At present 50 per cent of the capital expenditure is allowable against the income from the tolls and now the allowance which can be offset against the income from the tolls is being increased to 100 per cent.  In effect, this will mean that no tax will be paid on the toll income over the first ten or whatever number of years, and the amount he can set off each year is set out in the section.  The total expenditure is being set off against the tolls.  The odd thing is that one of our economists, Mr. Ron Bolger of Stokes, Kennedy, Crowley, thinks it is most unfair that he can only offset his expenditure against his toll income and that he should be allowed offset it against all profits.  This gives you an indication of the thinking of the economists writing in the media.  It is doing no harm to his job to come out with comments like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am opposing section 15 on the grounds that it is an attempt to remove the possibility of taxation from people who are picking up public money from tolls &mdash;&ldquo;picking up&rdquo; money is precisely what it is.  At present the second toll bridge is being built at the Strawberry Beds by the same person &mdash; I suppose I cannot mention his name as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has said that to mention his name is to criticise him &mdash; who built the East Link toll bridge.  The odd thing is that a highway with two lanes of traffic approaches from each side but the <Col N="2113" /> bridge is a little narrow bridge that holds one lane of traffic on each side.  How it was ever passed and agreed I do not know.  However, it means he can build the bridge for half of what it would cost to build a bridge wide enough to take traffic from the approach roads.  There will be a big bottleneck at the approach to the bridge and everybody will have to pay a toll to cross it.  Under this section he will be able to double the expenditure he can offset against his profits in the future.</P>
    <P>Finally, we have been compaigning for many years for the immediate reduction of the burden of PAYE.  We want to do it in three ways: first, by equalising taxes on all incomes by shifting some of the burden to the self-employed, the farmers etc; second, by leaning much more heavily on capital taxes, increasing corporation profits tax, property tax, wealth tax and capital gains tax and in that way shifting more of the burden from the PAYE worker and labour to capital; and third, by pursuing tax evaders and treating them as criminals, which they are, and by closing the loopholes.  I am very glad to see the Minister has taken a first step in closing the loopholes that allow for massive tax avoidance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very omnibus reply, if I may say so.  Could the Taoiseach indicate how it happened that there were reports in the newspapers after the <Col N="2115" /> visit of President Gorbachev to the effect that the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six cases were discussed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may be permitted another supplementary given the fact that the Taoiseach has taken several questions together, let me ask if it would be the Taoiseach's intention to take up, in diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, the subject matter of my Question No. 2, that is the plight of Soviet Jews who wish to be allowed to leave the Soviet Union.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach think it useful or appropriate that the group of Ministers shortly to go to Moscow to talk about trade deals would raise this issue also, given the backing Governments here have always expressed for approaches of that kind and in particular the Helsinki Declarations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our position is well known, and it is a part of our continuing policy to pursue that issue.  I am not too sure though that the visit of the Ministers, which could be very much an economic visit, would be an appropriate forum.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not consider that during the course even of an economic visit there would be occasions for more informal discussions which might be appropriate moments at which to take up questions like this?  As my final supplementary, let me ask him if he would consider also in the same context asking the Ministers to take up the subject matter of my Question No. 4 which is a matter of grave preoccupation to all of us in this House, with a view to seeing whether action could be taken to cut off the sources of supply of weapons and Semtex to the Provisional IRA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, a fair amount is being done in that area, particularly where Semtex is concerned. Naturally, these matters are kept on the table at all times.  The Deputy is quite right in suggesting a fair amount can be done in informal discussions on matters of this kind and any opportunity that presents itself will be availed of.</P>

      <P>Since the Taoiseach went outside his own restrictions on answering Questions Nos. 1 and 4, will he address Question No. 5?  Since the Taoiseach will be President of the Council of EC Ministers from early next year, the question of Austrian membership is a matter over which he could have considerable influence in the EC.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of well <Col N="2117" /> established international protocol a meeting between heads of state would not have been appropriate in the circumstances of the short working visit by President Gorbachev to Shannon recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely as a matter of protocol Mr. Gorbachev as a Head of State and President Hillery as a Head of State should have had some arrangements for a meeting?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, certainly not.  It would have been entirely inappropriate. Meetings between Heads of State have a very special protocol attending to them and require certain very necessary preparations and circumstances.  The short working visit President Gorbachev did us the honour of paying us would not have been a suitable occasion for such a meeting. The matter did not arise in any quarter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Fully adequate arrangements exist for co-ordinating all aspects of our policy towards the European Community, including issues relating to 1992.  The Taoiseach, therefore, sees no reason to establish a separate committee of the kind described by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again I find myself hearing an answer from a Minister of State when the Taoiseach is in the House and not answering questions put to him. Across Europe, unemployment is higher among women than any other group, women's pay is still less than 70 per cent <Col N="2118" /> of men's pay, women are virtually excluded from all decision making roles in the wider areas in EC politics, trade unionism and professions, and women are grossly under-represented in the whole new area of new technology and employment.  These are just some areas. In view of the fact that all these problems face women as we approach 1992 and what we might call an economic lift up for Europe, is there not a need for a special committee to look into the very special needs of this large group of the European population?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the importance the Government attach to the social dimension of the single market within which the very special position of women, as of others, is directly addressed.  A great deal of co-operation has taken place and much work has been done with regard to legislation concerning health and safety at work with particular reference to women. The Social Affairs Ministers in Council have already progressed quite a substantial amount of work in this whole area.  I do not think it would be beneficial in any way to depart from the situation we have now where we have two Government committees dealing with 1992 and EC affairs.  Were we to depart in one area it would be necessary to set up several committees in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I must take it then that neither the Minister of State nor the Taoiseach has raised the matter of the special position of women as a disadvantaged group with the Council of Ministers in the context of 1992 or had a discussion with Commissioner Papandreou on this matter.  Am I also to take it, therefore, that the opportunity of the Irish Presidency next year will not be used to give an impetus to the work for women as we approach 1992?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that the Irish Presidency in the first half of 1990 will be a successful Presidency.  The Government and Ministers in the various councils will make <Col N="2119" /> every effort to advance not only the position of women but many other matters which will have priority during our six-month Presidency.  I would remind the Deputy that she has a separate question, Question No. 85 to the Minister for Labour, which deals in some degree with some of the issues raised now.</P>

    <P>The Government are closely monitoring all aspects of the Gibraltar shootings. As the Deputies will be aware, there have been a number of new allegations and developments recently, including the <Col N="2121" /> report by Amnesty International published yesterday.

He was sent there on behalf of the Government and the people because of our concern about what happened at Gibraltar on 6 March 1988.  In view of what occurred yesterday with the publication of the Amnesty report and the various doubts which I have held for many months about the affair, does the Taoiseach not think it would be in the interest of this country and primarily in the interest of the administration of justice in Northern Ireland if the information and whatever views the Government may have were made public?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 24, 31, 32, 35, 36 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>I should like to convey to the families of Corporal Heneghan, Private Walsh, Armstrong and McNeela my condolences on behalf of the Government and, I feel sure, of every Member of the House on the tragic deaths of these courageous soldiers who died in the cause of peace while serving with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.  Private McNeela was killed at UNIFIL Post 6-38A in South Lebanon on the morning of 24 February by a round of heavy machine-gun fire from the Haddathah Compound which is manned by the so-called &ldquo;South Lebanon Army&rdquo;.  According to UNIFIL, there was no armed activity in the area at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immediate steps were taken to have the Israeli Chargé D'Affaires summoned to the Department of Foreign Affairs to convey to his authorities our strong protest.  The grave concern of the Government at the killing of Private McNeela at a time when there was no armed activity in the area was conveyed in the strongest possible terms.  It was made clear that, as the so-called &ldquo;South Lebanon Army&rdquo; was armed, financed and trained by Israel, this incident was bound to have a negative effect on IsraeliIrish relations.  It was also pointed out that these incidents of firing close were totally unacceptable and contrary to the Security Council's request to all parties to co-operate with UNIFIL.  The Israeli <Col N="2124" /> Chargé D'Affaires undertook to convey our protest to his authorities.</P>
    <P>Our serious concern was shared by the United Nations.  The Under Secretary General of the United Nations, on behalf of the Secretary General, called in the Israeli Chargé D'Affaires in New York on the same day to lodge a vigorous protest about the unprovoked killing of Private McNeela.  In addition, UNIFIL headquarters protested to the authorities in Israel.</P>
    <P>The United Nations has undertaken a full investigation into this killing, the results of which are not yet available.</P>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs have been informed by the Israelis that as a result of an investigation carried out by the so-called &ldquo;South Lebanon Army&rdquo; a member of that force has been detained and that the unit at Haddathah Compound has been removed from there and dispersed to other units of that force.</P>
    <P>On 21 March, Corporal Heneghan, Private Walsh and Private Armstrong were killed when the truck in which they were travelling hit a mine near Brashit in South Lebanon.  The Government are deeply concerned and are determined that everything possible will be done to minimise future risks for members of UNIFIL.  The United Nations share this concern and this determination.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence arranged for the Chief of Staff to visit Lebanon immediately to assess the situation there and to liaise with the United Nations authorities in their investigations.  The detailed investigation which they are conducting is not yet complete and so far it has not been possible to establish who was responsible for placing the explosive device or against whom it was directed.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Defence has already informed the Dáil, in the course of his visit the Chief of Staff met UN Under Secretary-General Marrack Goulding, UNIFIL Force Commander Lt. General Wahlgren, Irish battalion personnel and local leaders.  Security in the Irish area of operations was examined and a number of measures to enhance the safety of Irish personnel were agreed, including the provision of specialists in <Col N="2125" /> mine discoveries and bomb disposal, certain engineering works and the closure of a high risk post.</P>
    <P>The mandate under which UNIFIL operates is determined by the Security Council and is reviewed by them every six months.  The mandate comes up for renewal again at the end of July.  The Government have recently decided to rotate the Irish contingent with UNIFIL and will keep under continuous review our position with regard to the Force in the light of the developing situation on the ground, particularly with regard to the security of our contingent, and in close consultations with UN Headquarters and with other troop contributors.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for that very comprehensive reply, with which I fully agree.  I want to make three points.  The Taoiseach referred to the Chief of Staff's conducting an investigation on the instruction of the Minister for Defence.  I asked the Minister for Defence last week if that report would be published so that we in this House could come to a more authoritative view as to precisely what happened.  The Minister did not reply to that question last week and I repeat it now to the Taoiseach. Will the report of the investigation conducted by the Chief of Staff be published? I do not wish the Taoiseach to reply now because I understand that he will have to consider the implications, but I would be grateful to get a reply sometime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs called in the Chargé D'Affaires in Dublin.  He is not the official representatve of the Israeli Government.  The official representative is the ambassador in London. He should have been summoned here and told, in no uncertain terms, that we consider the Israeli Government, by extension because of their funding, financing and organising of the South Lebanese army, to be responsible for the deaths of Irish soldiers, and that they cannot continue to look for a resident ambassador here or to have friendly <Col N="2126" /> relations with the Irish people if that continues. That should be done by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in a formal and serious way without further delay and not by an official from the Department of Foreign Affairs through the Chargé d'Affaires; it must come from the Minister himself to the ambassador.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if, in view of the dangers highlighted by the recent accident involving a Soviet nuclear submarine off the coast of Norway, the Government intend to take any initiative through the United Nations or other appropriate body to have all nuclear submarines banned from the Irish Sea; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Priority Question No. 12 and Questions Nos. 19 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>In my address to the UN Third Special Session on Disarmament in New York in June 1988, I availed of the opportunity to voice Ireland's concern about the growth in nuclear submarine traffic in busy coastal and fishing zones, such as the Irish Sea, and of the potential environmental dangers posed by such nuclear powered vessels in the event of accident.</P>
      <P>The specific question of submarine traffic was not raised in discussions with President Gorbachev at Shannon. However, I discussed with him the question of nuclear disarmament and underlined Ireland's firm commitment to this goal.  It is clear that movement towards nuclear disarmament could help reduce the number of nuclear submarines operating in the Irish Sea and elsewhere.  The recent incident involving the Soviet nuclear submarine off the coast of Norway has highlighted the potential risks posed by such submarines.</P>
      <P>The safety of Irish fishing vessels at sea has long been a matter of particular concern to the Government.  As the Minister for Foreign Affairs has previously indicated to the Dáil, the Government have brought this issue to the attention of all concerned through the channels of the International Maritime Organisation where we sponsored an initiative aimed at focussing attention on the problems posed to fishermen by submarine traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2128" /> The IMO is the international body responsible for safety at sea.  The initiative resulted in the unanimous adoption by the General Assembly of the IMO of a resolution entitled, &ldquo;Avoidance by Submerged Submarines of Fishing Vessels and their Fishing Gear&rdquo;.  It is our hope that these efforts will make a positive contribution to the avoidance of incidents involving surface vessels and submerged submarines at sea.</P>
    <P>Ireland's territorial waters now extend to 12 miles from our coast.  Under international law, vessels, including submarines, of other countries have a right of innocent passage through these waters without notification &mdash; provided, in the case of submarines, that they travel on the surface and fly their flags.  The Department of Foreign Affairs have no record of transits of this kind by submarines within our territorial waters during the past five years.</P>
    <P>International waters begin at the edge of our 12 mile territorial limit.  Vessels of all nations, including submarines, have free access under international law to these waters and we have no right to bar or limit their access or transit.  While therefore, I share the Deputies' concern about the dangers which nuclear submarines passing through the Irish Sea could pose, I have to say that in the present state of international law, it is not possible to ban submarines from innocent transit on the surface through our territorial seas or to ban or limit in any way their passage through seas which, beyond our 12 mile limit, are regarded as international waters.  I would however appeal to the sense of international responsibility of the countries which operate such submarines.  I would ask them to understand the dangers which they can cause to innocent surface vessels such as fishing boats; and, at a wider level, the extremely grave dangers which could follow an accident involving a nuclear submarine in a narrow body of water such as the Irish Sea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In reference to the Taoiseach's talks with President Gorbachev, does he agree that the reduction <Col N="2129" /> in nuclear missiles has meant that the nuclear challenge has gone to sea rather than faded in view of the fact that 500 nuclear reactors out of the 900 in the world are located on the high seas at the moment?  Might I further ask if the Taoiseach is not concerned that there have been 38 deaths since 1981 for which no member of the international community has accepted responsibility, and if he is satisfied with the procedure for submarines surfacing and identifying themselves?  Is the Taoiseach suggesting to me that it is the responsibility of, for example, the fishing community, to avoid having their nets dragged or losing their lives, rather than taking a bold initiative and declaring the Irish Sea a nuclear free zone?  Would he consider that kind of radical proposal in view of the loss of life, international irresponsibility and the fact that the Irish Sea is becoming the most radioactive stretch of water in the world?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally all of us are deeply concerned at the general situation in regard to nuclear submarines transiting our waters.  Indeed we are particularly concerned at the danger they pose to our fishermen.  We try to do everything we can.  We raised the matter at the IMO which is the international body responsible for safety at sea.  I do not know that the sort of declaration the Deputy suggests, of declaring the Irish Sea a nuclear free zone, would be more than an empty gesture.  The present state of international law is such that we cannot legally in international fora or courts do anything about international waters. What we can do is use whatever influence we have to appeal to the nations concerned to act responsibility, even though they are exercising their international rights, and have a sense of responsibility and due regard for civilian shipping of all kinds, particularly those who have to earn their livelihood by fishing at sea.  I am no more happy about the situation than the Deputy is.  We all have a horror of the prospect of these nuclear submarines transiting through either our domestic waters or the contingent international <Col N="2130" /> waters, but unless we can get something done universally at international level there is little more we can do about it than we are doing at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not consider that it is necessary to bring home to Mr. Molyneaux, the Leader of the Official Unionist party, the fact that <Col N="2131" /> remarks like that have the effect of fingering leading members of the GAA in the North for paramilitaries on the Loyalist side?  It would be very helpful if the co-Chairman on this side of the Anglo-Irish Conference asked his fellow co-Chairman in the North to, at least in private, say to the two leaders in the North that they should not identify people who might become targets for gunmen on either side of the divide.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions <Col N="2134" /> Nos. 14, 15, 17, 23, 27, 41, and 61, together.</P>
      <P>With the adoption by the United Nations Security Council of Resolution 632 on 16 February 1989 the final step was taken allowing for the implementation of the UN plan for the transition of Namibia to independence contained in Security Council Resolution 435 of 1978.  It will be recalled that Resolution 632 was adopted following the agreements reached last year between Angola, Cuba and South Africa which provided for the withdrawal of Cuban Troops from Angola and opened the way for independence in Namibia on the basis of Resolution 435.  The date set for implementation to begin was 1 April 1989.</P>
      <P>Under Resolution 632 adopted on 16 February last, the Security Council approved the dispatch of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG).  The military component is to comprise 7,500 persons of which, on the proposal of the Secretary-General, 4,650 will be deployed initially, with 2,350 remaining in reserve.  The deployment of the contingent within this limit is the responsibility of the Secretary-General. The Government attach importance to the Secretary-General's views on the operational requirements of the force. While the Secretary-General proposed the initial deployment of 4,650, he has stated that he intends to keep the deployment and the size of the military component of UNTAG under review.  He has promised to inform the Security Council if the situation in Namibia should require the deployment of additional military personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the terms of the agreement between the parties enshrined in the Geneva Protocol of 5 August 1988, and confirmed to the United Nations Secretary-General by both SWAPO and South Africa, a formal ceasefire was to come into effect as of 0400 GMT on 1 April.  Also, by this date South African troops were to have been confined to bases and SWAPO forces to have withdrawn to bases in Angola North of the 16th Parallel.  However, on 1 April <Col N="2135" /> SWAPO was found to have infiltrated a large number of armed personnel and material into Namibia.  In view of the situation which rapidly developed on the ground, the UN Secretary-General, upon the joint recommendation of his special representative and the UNTAG force commander, agreed to a limited and temporary suspension in respect of certain specified South African Army units, or the requirement that all forces be confined to bases.  This was agreed to enable additional support to be provided to the Namibian police where necessary.  It was further agreed with the South African Administrator-General that the situation would be kept under continuous review and that the movement out of bases would be monitored throughout by UNTAG military observers.  I believe it must be left up to the United Nations to determine in the light of the developing situation on the ground when the terms of this temporary derogation from the agreements are rendered inoperative.</P>
    <P>The events since 1 April are naturally disturbing and it is the Government's fervent hope that the agreement reached between South Africa, Angola and Cuba at Mount Etjo on 9 April on the return of SWAPO forces to Angola and their confinement to bases there will ease tensions in the immediate term and allow the implementation of Resolution 435 to remain on course.  In a statement on 6 April the Twelve, in expressing concern at the fighting on the border with Angola, stressed the fundamental importance attaching to the scrupulous respect by all parties of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and of the agreements entered into.  I believe we must now await further developments before we can judge whether the UN plan is still on course.  In this regard, we, together with our partners in the Twelve, have reiterated our unqualified support for the United Nations Secretary-General, his special representative and for UNTAG.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, Ireland is contributing to the UNTAG operation through the provision of 20 Defence Force personnel as military observers as <Col N="2136" /> well as 35 Garda officers, who will form part of the civilian police contingent headed by former assistant Garda commissioner, Mr. Stephen Fanning.  The direction of operations on the ground and the security of UNTAG personnel is of course a matter for the UN Secretary-General, his special representative and the UNTAG force commander.  The Government will naturally monitor developments in the implementation of the UN plan continuously.</P>
    <P>The Government are not aware of any request for parliamentary observers.  The Government would of course lend their full support to any proposals of this nature.</P>
    <P>The United Nations appeal for funding support for their programme or repatriation of refugees to Namibia has already met with a very generous response from the international community.  That included a pledge of 1.75m ECU from the EC to which Ireland as a member state is a contributor.  Provision has been made by the EC for a community plan of 10m ECU in favour of Namibia.  The UN have undertaken to make a technical assessment of any further relief needs and to bring the results to the attention of the international community.  In the circumstances, there is no need at present for any initiative at United Nations level in respect of extra support for refugees returning to Namibia.  My Department will, however, continue to keep the situation under review.</P>
    <P>Regarding the terms of Resolution 435, I am aware of certain concerns which have been expressed.  Among these concerns are those expressed by Deputies regarding voting arrangements, visas for observers, infrastructure, utilities and state services in Namibia.  Resolution 435 is, like all Security Council Resolutions, binding on all members of the United Nations.  It sought to establish the board framework of a settlement.  Since 1978, efforts have continued to develop this framework in an attempt to bring the parties to a negotiated solution.  Following the agreements reached in late 1988, the Security Council was able to take the necessary action to initiate the <Col N="2137" /> plan for the independence of Namibia established in Resolution 435.  While South Africa has undeniably a central role to play in the implementation of the UN plan for independence, the overall authority of the United Nations was restated in Resolution 435.  This makes it clear that the transition process in Namibia is being carried out under the responsibility of the Security Council and under the direction of the Secretary-General, assisted by the special representative and the force commander in Namibia.  Resolution 435 reaffirmed the mandate of the UN special representative to &ldquo;ensure the early independence of Namibia through free elections under the supervision and control of the United Nations&rdquo;.  The Government have every confidence in the United Nations' ability to implement their mandate.</P>

      <P>First, I would like to thank the Taoiseach for a very comprehensive reply to these questions. There is one particular matter that I would like to raise.  Given the temporary derogation of aspects of the peace plan for Namibia which the Taoiseach has outlined, and the fact that Irish personnel are serving in Namibia in circumstances that were not envisaged when they went there, I should like to ask the Taoiseach if he has any undue concern for the safety of Irish personnel there.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is always concern when our personnel are serving under such circumstances.  Such situations are often tense and confused and it is difficult to ensure that the role of the UN personnel is always fully understood and respected by others.  However, we have to be guided by the UN authorities, by the Secretary-General and his special representative, in matters of this kind.  At present, apart from the general position <Col N="2138" /> that I have outlined, we have no particular reason for concern.  I say that with great caution and prudence because, unfortunately, history teaches us that in Lebanon and elsewhere the unexpected can tragically occur.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply.  Did I gather from it that he is by and large satisfied with the way the UN handled this matter and that he does not anticipate taking initiative to express the range of concerns included in the questions tabled by Members?  I respectfully suggest that rather than clapping the UN on the back we should be asking them very specific questions as to why on 1 April the UN were there in such tiny numbers and allowed the situation get out of control.  What do they propose to do to retrieve that situation?  Will the Taoiseach consider taking on board the view of many Members of the House, including those who were in the general area and were considerably critical of the UN at the time, that if the UN are to establish control there they should increase resources and the full strength of the reserve force should be drawn up? Will the Taoiseach undertake to discuss with us our concern about this matter with a view to the Government taking a more aggressive stand with the UN rather than accepting the lines handed down from them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy is being quite fair.  The UN have assumed an enormous responsibility there.  They made their best estimate of the strength of the observer force required, put the figure at 4,650 and retained 2,000-odd in reserve.  This is a totally unpredictable situation and all they could do was make the best estimate of what would be required.  I suggest that had it not been for the SWAPO intrusion there might not have been any problems and the numbers might have been quite adequate.  I am certainly prepared to arrange for the Deputies who are interested to get as much information as possible about the situation.  We can <Col N="2139" /> arrange briefings, perhaps, through the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>We are a contributor and the role of a contributor is a tenuous one.  Our sole duty is to supply the personnel when requested.  We do not have any official control over the operation as a whole; that must be left to the UN and the Secretary-General. If all the contributor countries tried to control the operation there would be chaos.</P>
      <P>Over the years we have worked out a fairly satisfactory way of handling these situations by being good and responsible contributors.  At the same time, if the need arises we make our concerns known to the UN but, apart from that, we must leave it to the good judgment of the UN authorities to handle this very tricky and sensitive operation which has to be centrally directed by the UN.  In the course of my reply I said that we would monitor the developments in the implementation of the UN plan.  We will do that continously and if any other action appears desirable we will certainly undertake such action.</P>
      <P>By and large, this is a UN operation and it must be conducted by the UN who have the responsibility.  The important thing from everybody's point of view would be for all parties, South Africa, Angola, Cuba and SWAPO, to adhere to the settlement.  If that occurred we would not have the sort of problems that are concerning the Deputy.</P>

I would advise caution in regard to the use of that.  One section of the press is using that term and in my view it is being used out of context.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach the precise reply he is giving to Question No. 23 which was included in the list of questions <Col N="2140" /> he has answered.  That question referred to the selling off of the resources of the people of Namibia in advance of its independence. What practical steps is the Taoiseach taking to object at the denial of visas to the international community and the international organisations who have been invited to look at the registration process for the elections by the South African authorities?  I am referring to the international lawyers group, the respectable international organisations and members of parliament who are being denied visas to travel to Namibia to observe the crucial registration process. Is this not a matter for objection by the Irish?</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the Taoiseach's reply and I am sorry to say that I do not agree with a lot of what he said.  Will the Taoiseach not agree that as our personnel are involved in this peacekeeping exercise in Namibia we have a perfect right to object to the United Nations if we consider what they are doing is not sufficient or well thought out?  Looking from the outside in, it appears to me that the plan was illthought out, badly prepared and tardily put in place.  The UN cannot complain of <Col N="2141" /> lack of experience in South-West Africa because they have been involved in Namibia for ten or 12 years.  They have had peacekeeping experience all over the world.  I say with great regret that this was the worst performance the UN put on in a role like this.  We should protest about it and I say that with great regret.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach ensure, through the auspices of the United Nations, that fair elections take place in Namibia on 1 November next? Could he ensure, again through the auspices of the United Nations, that on this issue the United Nations would be particularly conscious that there is a major illiteracy problem obtaining in that country, with up to 70 per cent of the Namibian people being unable to read or write and who should be entitled to impartial assistance on the part of ours or United Nations observers when going to the polls?  Would he ensure that the United Nations would be conscious also of the lack of clarity with regard to registration of voters there, of the urgent need for computerised registration of the electorate, bearing in mind the need to give a vote to those who are 18 years of age or over, not merely to those over 21, as would appear to be the wish of the South Africans?  There is a large problem with regard to these forthcoming elections. Therefore would the Taoiseach ensure, through the United Nations, that the whole electoral process is a fair one, in particular the run-up to the November elections?</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply to my question in relation to the adequacy of numbers and reliance on United Nation forces &mdash; it being difficult to ascertain what might have happened on the ground &mdash; is the Taoiseach aware that there was widespread concern expressed that, when the final decisions were being taken in relation to numbers, they would be inadequate?  Furthermore, is he aware that the reason the numbers were decided on were monetary rather than any decision in principle on the basis of what would be the best size of peace-keeping force?  Furthermore, is the Taoiseach aware that there being only 700 United Nations personnel there on 1 <Col N="2143" /> April, when the problem broke out, the United Nations should not have called up the 101st battalion, which is known to be notorious as a heavy brigade, a battalion which engages in violence and exploitation, a strong arm battalion, when there were other battalions available to them and that their failure to do so only aggravated the problem?  Would he agree that it is an indication of the total lack of preparedness and commitment, resulting from which the UN peacekeeping efforts have been seriously undermined?  Would he agree that in order to get it back on the rails, the kinds of concerns we are expressing should be made known to the United Nations?  Perhaps the best way of having this moved forward would be that Members who have particular concerns be allowed meet officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs in order to ascertain how we can channel such concerns most constructively?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The history of the matter is that the Security Council approved the dispatching of the force on 16 February last.  The force was originally planned to number 7,500.  The Secretary General of the United Nations announced on 24 January 1989 that the initial deployment would consist of 4,650 only, 2,850 being held in reserve, as I have said.  The permanent members of the Security Council had argued that the December 1988 arrangements on Namibia, between South Africa, Angola and Cuba, made the deployment of a large force unnecessary.  Therefore, there were divided views at the Security Council. South Africa had given repeated assurances that they would respect the transitional arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then the General Assembly approved the budget for UNTAG on 1 March last and, as has been repeatedly stated by the Secretary General, at least six to eight weeks would be the absolute minimum period necessary to permit UNTAG to be fully operational; that is reasonable. The Government here considered that due weight should be given to the Secretary General's views on the operational <Col N="2144" /> requirements of the peacekeeping forces, as the deployment of the contingent is the responsibility of the Secretary General who has promised to keep the size under review and will inform the Security Council if the situation in Namibia requires the deployment of additional military personnel.  I do not suggest that we should not say anything or make our concerns known to the United Nations. On the other hand, specific responsibility for the size, deployment and operational requirements of the peace-keeping forces are all firmly placed on the Secretary General.  It is his decision.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, there are a number of criteria to be considered in relation to the appointment of an honorary consul in a particular country or region.  The prime consideration, in this context, is the size of the Irish community and its need of and access to consular services.  The existing, or potential, situation regarding foreign earnings and investment is also an important factor in making such appointments. While the strong cultural link between Newfoundland and Ireland is acknowledged I feel that this, and the other criteria just mentioned, are at the moment adequately and effectively managed by our embassy in Ottawa and that the making of such an appointment would <Col N="2145" /> not appear to be warranted at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that our embassy in Ottawa is approximately 2,000 miles away from this part of Newfoundland, basically comprised of the capital, St. John's, and the south coast which has a unique connection with the south east of Ireland, particularly the Waterford estuary area, a uniqueness because there is no similar connection with any other ethnic Irish group in the world.  I suppose it can only be compared with Wales and the Welsh settlers in the Patagonian desert in South America.

      <P>The Deputy makes a good case.  These things have to be decided, on balance, in regard to each particular situation.  I have some idea of the factors to which the Deputy refers in Newfoundland.  In fact my cultural adviser has just returned from a very successful tour of poetry readings in Newfoundland and has impressed on me the very things to which the Deputy is drawing my attention.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have not received a formal request to give recognition to the independent state proclaimed by the Palestine National Council on 15 November 1988.  The subject has, however, been addressed by the Government.  I would refer the Deputy to the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Dáil Éireann on 21 February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement on that occasion on the question of Ireland's relations with the PLO incorporated the Government's position on recognition of the Palestinian State which the Minister for Foreign Affairs had first set out for the House on 13 December 1988.  The position is as follows: Ireland follows the criteria in international law which are applicable to the recognition of states.  These criteria are that the state in question possess (i) a defined territory (ii) a permanent population (iii) a sovereign government exercising effective control and (iv) a capacity to enter into international relations.  It is clear that while Israel continues to function as an occupying power, the Palestinian State proclaimed on 15 November 1988 will lack some or all of these attributes.  The conditions for granting formal legal recognition are, therefore, not present.  The Government consider, however, that in the context of <Col N="2147" /> a negotiated settlement, the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination includes their right to an independent state.  It is our hope that the Palestinian State proclaimed on 15 November 1988 will &mdash; in the context of a negotiated settlement &mdash; become an entity to which Ireland can extend formal legal recognition.</P>
    <P>I would add that none of the Twelve members of the European Community has recognised an independent state of Palestine.  The Twelve have, however, indicated that they attach particular importance to the decisions taken by the Palestinian National Council in November last, saying that they reflect the will of the Palestinian people to assert their national identity.</P>

      <P>On 21 February last the Department of Foreign Affairs received a proposal by the Irish Immigration Reform Movement for funding towards the employment of two full time staff members to provide advisory services to Irish immigrants in the US.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Department and of the Consulate General in New York have discussed the proposal with representatives of the IIRM who agreed to submit further details in support of it. When these are received, further consideration will be given to the matter.</P>

      <P>It is being assessed and I should like to remind the Deputy that we have undertaken a fair commitment in this area: consular services are now being provided fairly extensively and intensely and liaison committees have been established.  I know, and I have heard this at first hand, that the activities of our consuls, especially those in Boston and New York, have been widely appreciated by these young people.  My information is that they are doing a very good job and a fair number of new types of services are being provided.  I do not think any of us can be satisfied with the situation but a fair amount of work is being done by the embassy, the consular offices and, of course, diocesan organisations in New York and Boston and also by the cities, again Boston and New York.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have no plans to establish a timescale for reaching the United Nations target for aid to developing countries in the present state of the national finances.  Successive Irish Governments have accepted the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for official development assistant but no date has been set for its attainment. I would like to point out, however, that the amount allocated for official assistance in 1989 shows an increase of almost £1 million over the amount allocated last year.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach how he can live with this situation at a time when the need for aid is greater than ever.  Since the beginning of the eighties there has been a disastrous downturn in the economies and social conditions of developing countries which had been making progress until then.  Irish people have been dipping into their pockets more than ever but the Government have in this area, more than in any other area, cut funds over and above the average in any other Department.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach if he is happy with the situation where we are third lowest of the 24 OECD countries in reaching our target and are nowhere near the EC or general average.  Since he has taken over stewardship of this State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Following the visit of the President the other matter came up and it was decided that we should send a delegation of Ministers to pursue economic matters and issues. That was at the invitation of the Soviet President.  We decided then that the best thing to do would be to combine the two: that the Tánaiste would lead the economic delegation&mdash;this is the plan at the moment to see if we can do the whole operation together&mdash;sign the cultural agreement and carry out the economic co-operation discussions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Just before lunchtime Deputy Mac Giolla had various things to say about the Finance Bill.  I was surprised at some of what he had to say because on a number of occasions he complimented the Government and the Minister for Finance on some measures brought forward in this Bill, particularly the tax avoidance measures.  They must be welcome by all in this House.  He acknowledged that an effort had been made by the Government over the last two years to collect the outstanding tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2187" /> Obviously we have much further to go down that road.  He also said that the economy was growing and that the indications were very good but he went on to say that this was not affecting the general public very well.</P>
    <P>I would not agree with what the Deputy had to say because a report issued last week proved that the differential between prices in Belfast and Dublin has now all but gone.  As a Border Deputy from the town of Dundalk this was an issue that affected my town particularly in the early and mid eighties when there were huge differentials between prices in Dundalk and Newry.  That has all but gone now and the overflow into Newry from the Dundalk area has, by and large, stopped.  There are still one or two items for which people go to Newry, for example, petrol.  The fact is that as a result of the economic measures taken by the Government since they came into office in February, 1987 the situation regarding the price differential where the public are going into shops and buying goods has all but evaporated.  The Government should be completed on that.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the outflow of profits from this country.  The fact is that during the Coalition years, we had the black hole phenomenon.  That is all but gone.  Most commentators would say there is an in-flow of funds into this country as a result of the confidence that has been engendered by the economic measures that have been taken by the Government.  I see that Deputy De Rossa is still here.  We on this side of the House are often accused of doing U-turns.  I compliment.  The Workers' Party on embracing the European Community concept.  I noted that at their last conference Deputy De Rossa took.  The Workers' Party into the European concept. That is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill is just another step in a number of steps taken by the Government since coming to power to put the economy on the right road.  The major initial step was the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which had the idea of <Col N="2188" /> bringing the social partners along with the Government, as the social partners have a major role to play in bringing this economy back on an even keel.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was followed most recently by the national plan which is one of the best documents to be put before the House in my time, and I understand that others are of the same opinion.</P>
    <P>Our national debt is somewhere in the region of £24.6 billion.  When one looks at the sum of over £9 billion that we are talking about in the national plan it is a very small amount in comparison with the national debt.  The figures of our national debt and GNP ratio show that we are the worst in Europe.  That situation will have to be addressed.  As Minister Wilson said earlier, we have succeeded in stabilising the figure at 133 per cent but we have to get it down.  It is the Government's intention as per the national plan to reduce that if possible by 1993 to 120 per cent.  Most commentators agree that that is possible.</P>
    <P>I did not get an opportunity to speak on the national plan because of some of the bleatings of Deputy Barrett on the day I was due to speak which resulted in a delay which lost me my opportunity, but I would recommend the national plan to the House as an excellent guide on how this economy has progressed over the last few years and how it is intended by this Government to advance the economy in the coming years.  The national plan indicated in its initial pages that the income levels in Ireland are well below the EC average.  That is something the national plan hopes to redress, but the fact is that from the time we came into Government inflation has dropped to 2.1 per cent although it is rising slightly now. In England the inflation rate is in the region of 8 per cent.  That has a tremendous effect on our economy and on our ability to trade outside this country.  We are 3.5 per cent below the average EC inflation rate.</P>
    <P>The rationale behind the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was to get the social partners involved in negotiations in order to try to cool down the economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2189" /> Pay increases have been held back to 2.5 per cent annually and that is something on which the general public ought to be complimented.  By accepting those increases they have indicated their acceptance of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>Recently figures were produced to show that last year we lost far fewer days because of strikes than in any other year for the last 20 years.  That is because this House and the general public are working to get the economy back on the rails.  The average growth in GNP is 3 per cent; interest rates have fallen from 14 per cent to 8 per cent in the last two years.  That is a phenomenal decrease in the rates.</P>
    <P>Recently I was speaking to someone from just across the Border who was querying a bank bill from a bank in Newry.  I was astounded to see the amount of interest this person was paying on his current account and when I checked with the bank they said it was correct and that basically the situation had been reversed from that which obtained two years ago when interest rates here were 15 per cent and 8 per cent across the Border.  Now it is the exact opposite with our interest rates down to 8 per cent and interest rates at 14 to 15 per cent across the Border.</P>
    <P>Deputies on the other side of the House referred to unemployment and there is no doubt that unemployment is probably the biggest problem this nation will have to face in the next ten to 20 years.  The figures over the last two years prove that employment is on the increase.  Employment last year increased by 6,000 and this should be acknowledged.  It is a small start but hopefully it will improve.  Once the general aspect of the economy is held and once there is general consensus, employment will rise.  This can be seen on the ground as well as in the facts and figures produced.</P>
    <P>Our debt/GNP ratio is somewhere in the region of four times the European average and because of that we are not in a position to compete properly with our European counterparts.  From just looking at a number of other European <Col N="2190" /> countries, not necessarily in the EC, where the debt/GNP ratio is listed I note that the country at the very bottom is Norway who have a minus ratio. However, the average is about 33 per cent while we are at 133 per cent.  Everyone in this House must work to ensure that we get that figure down.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made about tax reform.  An effort has been made in the three Finance Bills to reduce tax.  Obviously we would all like to see tax reform. There is no doubt that major improvements have been made, although we would all like to see the tax base increased.  One thing people tend to forget is that mortgage and loan repayments have come down dramatically in the last two years as a result of the interest rate decrease and that actually means money in the pockets of people who are buying houses.  That is as good as extra tax relief and it happened very early in the life time of this Government, quite apart from any tax reliefs brought forward in any of the Finance Bills.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla found fault with the PAYE and PRSI changes mentioned in the Finance Bill.  I would be totally on the opposite side.  It is quite obvious that there are quite a number of very small businesses around the country who generally feel that they are working as tax collectors for the State, they quite rightly feel that they are doing this without any compensation from the State and that they have to set up a whole system within their small business to collect tax for the State without receiving any compensation. The fact that they are collecting tax on behalf of the State has lead many people into financial difficulties one way or the other, and they feel that they should be compensated for that.</P>
    <P>The changes in the Finance Bill whereby these people will be allowed, subject to the consent of the Revenue Commissioners, to make annual returns rather than monthly returns are welcome and most people welcome them because they will relieve them of a lot of the paper work they are doing at the moment and allow them to get on with their business. Ultimately that will help any employees <Col N="2191" /> they may have.  Deputy Mac Giolla was trying to say that perhaps the fact that these returns will be annual now rather than monthly may lead to a situation where those people will use the money for their own benefit.  That is very unfair. Most people want to return that money. They are so tied up with paper work at the moment that this change would help them immeasurably.</P>
    <P>Capital taxation is a much vaunted subject. Many speakers, particularly on what we call the left, say there is more scope there; perhaps there is.  This is something that future Governments, and also this Government should look at.  There may be one or two areas where capital taxes could be examined in order to bring in some extra taxation.</P>
    <P>Self-assessment is now being made mandatory, which is to be welcomed.  In my practice I have had occasion to use self-assessment for capital tax over the last year or so and it makes matters much easier for practitioners.  Being made mandatory will help, although there may be teething problems in the changeover. This is something the Minister should examine.</P>
    <P>There is an in-built surcharge for under-valuation which needs to be included in self-assessment.  There is always the danger of under-valuing in property.  This may not be found out by the Revenue Commissioners for years to come, which would lead to problems later.</P>
    <P>Favourite nephew relief is being extended, which is a very good measure. This relief has been used on quite a number of occasions where a farmer who, perhaps through sickness or for some other reason, is not working his farm and has a nephew looking after it for him. Under previous rules, if the nephew got the farm later he had to pay a substantial inheritance tax.  This relief has been invoked for the last number of years.  Its extension will particularly benefit people in rural Ireland.  There has been a great deal of correspondence with the Revenue Commissioners in regard to individual <Col N="2192" /> cases on the aspect of whether these people are substantially working on a full time basis on the farm.  By and large, the Revenue Commissioners have been fairly realistic in dealing with these cases.</P>
    <P>The maximum interest-free concession where an assessment is put in and the taxpayer has three months grace and then a further month, should be looked at. Four months is a very short period and perhaps the Minister could consider extending it slightly, because it causes some problems in very complicated estates where people may be living outside the country, for example.  Having to return the assessment in this short time leads to interest being put on the outstanding tax, if there is such.  This has caused hardship in the past and should be looked at with a view to extension.</P>
    <P>The extension to both husband and wife of relief for insurance policies which take care of possible inheritance tax is a very good measure.  On this whole idea of taking out an insurance policy to guard against possible inheritance tax there have been changing attitudes on the part of the Revenue Commissioners.  Previously they were totally against it, but recently they have been for it.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to read that there is a revised approach to the Commission's proposals on tax harmonisation.  I implore the Government to tread very warily in this regard.  I come from a Border constituency and we are in the firing line in this regard.  While we all welcome harmonisation, there is no doubt that this country, because of its high rates, will lose substantial amounts of revenue if we reduce our taxes, unless we are compensated in some way.  I am glad the Minister said there is a revised approach among the Ministers to the Commission's proposals.  This country will probably lose most in Europe as a result of tax harmonisation.</P>
    <P>Recently I met deputations from the customs and excise unions and also the customs clearance agents in my town of Dundalk in relation to the implications of tax harmonisation from 1992 on.  These people wanted to know if they would have jobs by the end of 1992.  I have no <Col N="2193" /> doubt that even with an element of tax harmonisation there will always be a need for customs clearance, or some check at borders but these people are genuinely worried.  The customs clearance industry in Dundalk is one of the bigger industries. Between that and the customs posts, they are one of the biggest users of the telecommunications system in and around Dundalk.  There is a proposal to decentralise a Government Department to Dundalk and it is felt that that Department should be decentralised as soon as possible, so that any adverse implications of 1992 for these people would be taken care of.  I would agree with that.  Decentralisation is to be welcomed and I know an effort is being made towards progress as quickly as possible.  We are in the second phase of that programme and sites are being examined by the Office of Public Works at present.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme has been a great success.  Yet, there have been abuses in that area.  Unfortunately, they have given the scheme a bad name. In recent months a figure in the region of £50 million has been invested in BES type schemes.  This can only be of benefit to the country in the long term.  In the Bill the Minister lays down the upper limit on money invested in the BES scheme as £2.5 million.  I am slightly worried about that; in my constituency Ceimicí Teoranta went out of business and were succeeded by the Cooley alcohol factory which suffered quite a number of lay-offs a couple of years ago.  That factory is now up and running again, and is called Cooley Distillery.  It has been taken over and quite a few people are employed there.  They are now planning to produce Irish whiskey.  That has been financed more or less under the BES scheme. Before the publication of the Finance Bill, notice was issued saying that the business wanted £3 million investment.  I do not know if this will be affected by the limit of £2.5 million; I hope it will not. Perhaps the Minister would clarify this.</P>
    <P>With regard to the questions of a united Europe and the EMS, Minister Reynolds has stated that as far as we are concerned there must be a stronger attempt at <Col N="2194" /> achieving economic and social cohesion before we look at a monetary union.  I feel that we will never have a united Europe unless we have a united currency. It is disquieting to hear the British Chancellor, Nigel Lawson, say that Britain is against this.  Ultimately, the EC will have to face up to that whole question of monetary union.  A report on that subject was tabled recently and it is planned to start discussions in July.  Again, this is something that will have to be faced up to. The attitude of Mr. Nigel Lawson and Mrs. Thatcher goes against the grain of European unity.  I think we will have to make it quite clear that we are in favour of monetary union.  Because we are one of the less developed areas in Europe, we would, as the Minister has said, have to have some economic and social beefing up.  That is where a document like the <i>National Development Plan 1989-93</i> comes into its own.</P>
    <P>The question of toll roads was referred to.  This is something that is dear to my heart because phases 3 and 4 of the inner relief road have yet to be completed in the town of Dundalk.  One problem is that the road has to cross the Castletown river.  The provision in the Bill which will increase the capital allowance relief from 50 per cent to 100 per cent will obviously help someone who may be interested in putting a toll bridge across that river. One individual has let it be known that he would be willing to get involved in the project.  I know the question of toll roads has featured in the <i>National Development Plan</i> and both the Minister for the Environment and the Taoiseach have encouraged their use.  This is a follow on from that aspiration.  There is a provision that a pretrading interest will qualify for relief also under this section.</P>
    <P>Another area that is close to my heart and should be looked at is the question of advance factories.  I fully appreciate that there are empty IDA factories around the country but a number of areas &mdash; including my own &mdash; are bereft of advance factories.  In both Drogheda and Dundalk there are no advance factories. Proposals have been made under the EC <Col N="2195" /> Structural Funds to build advance factories and I ask the Minister for Finance to see if there is any assistance that can be given in that regard.</P>
    <P>Last night I listened to Deputy Noonan comment on the Minister's phrase &ldquo;steady as she goes&rdquo;.  This made me smile, especially when I thought of the years of mismanagement under the Coalition.  Is it not better to go at a steady pace than to meander as Deputy Wilson so aptly put it?  The fact is that the economy has gone from strength to strength over the past two years and it ill behoves anyone to put a stop to that.  Efforts have been made by the Opposition to help the situation, but unfortunately some people have been negative about anything that has been done.</P>
    <P>The budget and the Finance Bill have been widely welcomed both by the people on the ground and by the financial institutions. Recently a friend of mine from England took a taxi from Dublin Airport and she wanted to know how the budget had been greeted by the people.  To her surprise the taxi driver told her that it was an excellent budget &mdash; maybe you will say that he was a member of Fianna Fáil &mdash; and that the Government were making an excellent effort to bring the country back to its feet.  Despite Deputy Mitchell's earlier comments &mdash; which Deputy Wilson referred to as his meandering speech &mdash; the economy has gone in a straight line upwards all the time, whereas when Deputy Mitchell and his party were in power, things were absolutely out of control; our debt-GNP ratio, our emigration and unemployment were out of control.  Thankfully, things have come right and the Government should be congratulated.</P>
    <P>The Bill is yet another small step on the road to recovery and I think it should be welcomed by all Members of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on the Finance Bill as it presents an opportunity to Deputies like myself to cover a number of items that are of importance to the <Col N="2196" /> economy.  This is a very important Bill indeed.</P>
      <P>When the Minister introduced the Bill he talked about &ldquo;a milestone in economic development&rdquo;.  When the Minister for Social Welfare was introducing the Social Welfare Bill, he referred to it as a &ldquo;major step forward.&rdquo;.  When we teased out the social welfare proposals we found that it was not a major step forward but I accept that it was a step forward.  The point I want to make is that Fianna Fáil are never given to understatement.  They always overstate and create a lot of ballyhoo about the proposals they are introducing &mdash; none more so that the recent £9 billion <i>National Development Plan</i>.  I am not a preacher of doom and gloom and I believe in putting the best foot forward but if we are to be taken seriously, we must be factual.  There is no point in saying that we are making major improvements and have reached a milestone in economic development when in fact the opposite is the truth.  If it were otherwise why are the people still leaving the country?  If we are moving so solidly in the direction in which we would all like to see ourselves going why are the alarm bells sounding and why had the Minister for Finance to refer to impending rises in inflation and tax rates?  Why had somebody outside Government to come along to wield the big stick of curbing credit? If a big stick has to be wielded, it should be wielded by the Taoiseach.  I think this is a sad reflection on the Government, and they are treating the people like children.  People have their money taken from them by crippling taxation and when they try to borrow to carry out some realistic improvements, somebody tells them that they cannot have any more money and that credit will be restricted. I do not think that is the way to move forward.  If such statements have to be made they should be made in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We saw a similar exercise when the Minister for the Environment tried to bring in property tax by the back door. He had an organisation called LAMA make the proposals for him nationwide, but they were not accepted and were turned down by the councils, the <Col N="2197" /> majority of which are held by the Fianna Fáil party.  If there are legislative proposals, they must come from this House. I am not in favour of the introduction of a property tax.  There is far too much taxation and the people are crippled by it.  We talk about reducing the tax bands from 58 per cent to 56 per cent and the lower rate to 32 per cent but that is not the real figure.  There is no point in talking about the tax taken in the pay packet because when the worker leaves the office or factory he starts to pay tax again when he moves outside the door.  When he puts petrol in his car, he is paying the highest rate of tax in Europe; if he decides on his way home that he deserves a pint after a hard week's work, he will pay the highest rate of tax on it in Europe.  We are not only talking of the tax bands of 56 and 32 per cent, but whether, out of every £100 earned, a person has even £20 by the time he reaches home to the good wife to maintain the household for the week.  They are the realities which are driving so many people out of the country.  They have decided they have had enough, and until we face up to reforming our whole tax system people will not take any more.</P>
    <P>It is sad to see emigration.  In my constituency whole townlands are completely depopulated.  If you go for a country walk on a Sunday afternoon there is an eerie silence.  Households are closed down and gates are barred.  Can we do anything about it?  Of course we can, in a number of ways.  There are a number of areas of development into which we are not putting sufficient resources.  We are not going about this in a proper way.</P>
    <P>I have a contribution to make on tourism, agriculture and small businesses.  I had hoped the Minister, Deputy Wilson, would have been present.  I have a high regard for him.  He is a very capable man, doing a great job internationally for us as a country.  The international promotion is second to none but it is wasted effort. People are leaving the country to go on holidays, and I see no national tourist organisations operating here to woo them to their venues for holidays.  I take it <Col N="2198" /> people go into travel agencies and pick the places they wish to travel to.  They hear the comments of people who have returned home and are attracted to the areas they hear about wherever they may be.  There is nothing to beat a satisfied customer.  One satisfied customer leaving our shores is better than £1,000 or maybe £10,000 spent on promotion in Britain, France, Germany or the US.  In that regard we must look at what we have to offer in tourism.  We have so much we take for granted and abuse.  In regard to accommodation we are paying vast sums of money to people whose knowledge of the business I would question seriously. They may be high fliers but are they the people we need to do the job?  If that money was spent in grants for people to upgrade and improve the accommodation they have to offer we would be doing well.</P>
    <P>Fishing is a major tourist attraction here particularly in my constituency and in this regard gross abuses are being perpetrated by people coming to this country for a fishing holiday.  They are taking away vast amounts of fish.  People in the fishery field know this is happening and nothing is done about it.  Continental fishermen are denuding our lakes and rivers of coarse fish, in particular pike. They will ask people providing them with accommodation if they have deep freeze facilities for them to store fish they catch here so that they can bring them home when they leave.  It was brought to my attention that a group of fishermen came into this country and first they set about closing of a part of a stream at the bottom of the land adjacent to the house in which they were staying.  Having done that they went off on their fishing expedition, as they were entitled to do.  They brought their catch to the stream.  The pike were trapped in this stream and could not get out of it.  On the night before these people left they took the fish out, killed them, packed them in ice and brought them away with them.  That is a unique, new development.  It would be well nigh impossible to investigate every household where people are staying.</P>

      <P>Deputy Boylan, let me make a small point.  The Deputy indicated earlier he was going to refer to certain matters.  The contribution to date made by the Deputy would be excellent but in respect of an Estimates debate.  The Finance Bill requires him to relate all that to taxation.  I know he has the capacity to do it.  I ask him not to stray too far from taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can curb this abuse and generate income and taxation.  At airports and seaports at point of departure persons should be appointed to search and if illegally caught fish are found a penalty can be imposed.  I would have no hesitation in confiscating all the equipment plus maybe £1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear much criticism of farmers and the contribution they are making.  I have no doubt that the farmer is more than paying his fair share and has always done so.  We should end once and for all the argument about the contribution farmers are making.  All of them are now in the tax net.  If they are not paying tax it is an indication that they have not got a taxable income.  If that is so it ill behoves anybody to say farmers are not paying their fair share.  If they had the income they would pay their fair share.  Some farmers are doing exceptionally well.  Some small farmers are finding it very hard to get by and to look after their families.  The Government can bring about a major improvement in farm income by bringing into the severely handicapped areas all areas submitted by the previous Government and which were omitted.  I heard unwarranted criticism from the previous speaker.  The work done by the previous Government was the foundation on which the progress we are making now was built.  What I say in relation to the severely handicapped areas is relevant to the Finance Bill because it would mean an improvement of income and would create activity in agriculture where major developments can still take place despite quotas and restrictions.  Approval from the EC is easily obtained.  There is great goodwill in the EC in relation to approval for including vast areas of the country, <Col N="2200" /> in particular my constituency of CavanMonaghan, in the severely handicapped areas.  There is no criticism at all from the EC with regard to applications from those areas.  An application was submitted; unfortunately it was not followed up.</P>
    <P>A debate took place here last week in which I did not get time to contribute because of the eagerness of my colleagues to make their contribution to it.  It was in reference to the £9 billion national development proposals.  I cannot accept that at face value.  There is a great deal of pie in the sky.  Exactly five years ago on the eve of the last European elections&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Boylan, the fact that you did not succeed in getting in on a particular debate last week would not justify your using the Finance Bill as a mechanism to say something that would have been appropriate to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to it because it is all part and parcel of economic development and it has been referred to by previous speakers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to make a passing reference in that I do not believe there is a plan.  I cannot be expected to accept there is a plan.  On the eve of the last European elections Seán Flanagan, MEP, announced a £500 million capital investment for the 12 western counties, and not as much as one penny of that came our way.  He was questioned on numerous occasions.  It was thought at first hand it might not have been factual when it was announced in Brussels, and when he arrived in this country he was questioned by reporters and economic correspondents and he said this plan was in place, that a major development was to take place, and not as much as one penny of it came.  I take the £9 billion capital investment in the same frame of mind until I see benefits from it on the <Col N="2201" /> ground, and I will be the first to acknowledge them.</P>
      <P>With regard to small businesses I have heard differing viewpoints expressed regarding the proposal that people could make a once-off lump sum tax payment at the end of the year.  There are arguments for and against such a proposal. Nowadays people do not pay bills until they become due.  It is easier to pay in small amounts rather than expend a large amount at the end of the year.  Small business people have asked me if it is in their best interests to put on the long finger something which has to be paid.  A bill of perhaps £200 or £300 per week could become £15,000 or £20,000 by the end of the year.  Where is the money to be found?  There is no point saying it will be put into a bank or a building society. It is human nature to use the money for some other purpose and I believe people will run into problems at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>I will refer to registration for VAT, and I am subject to correction on the figures.  I believe that a person must register for VAT if he or she has a turnover of under £500 per week or £25,000 per year.  It has been suggested that those figures should be raised to £1,000 per week or £50,000 per year.  Prices have risen over the past few years and a turnover of £500 three or four years ago would not have the same effect as £1,000 now. Small businesses cannot afford this kind of book-keeping and it would be of benefit to them if the Minister increased the threshold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a problem with regard to the rebate for handicapped persons.  The Minister has stated his intention to deal with this problem in amendments to the Bill.  Notwithstanding that undertaking, I read an article yesterday expressing the concern of the Irish Wheelchair Association about this proposal.  I had understood there was agreement.  The Taoiseach certainly indicated that he understood the problem and was prepared to meet the requests from the IWA and other organisations dealing with the handicapped, but it would seem now that the position is not so clear.  It would be <Col N="2202" /> small minded and penny pinching not to meet the legitimate requests of these highly respected organisations on behalf of the people they work for and represent. We had the sad case of one young man whom I had the pleasure of meeting and to whom I would pay glowing tribute. Although he has no arms and only one leg he was debarred from a refund.  This is an indication of a bigger problem in that people cannot apply common sense. They are tied up with red tape.  Nobody would have questioned giving the grant to this young man.  I hope the Taoiseach and the Minister will carry through their concern by amending the Bill and that excise duty and VAT refunds will be made available.</P>
    <P>We in the Border area have a major difficulty with regard to the harmonisation of taxes.  We looked to the budget for some movement in that direction in the lead up to 1992.  We had hoped that the excise duty on petrol would be reduced but instead the Government increased it by 5p per gallon.  They said there was no increase because it was absorbed at the pumps.  That is a nonsense. It cannot be seen as anything other than a net increase of 5p per gallon.  Further increases have taken place recently and apparently there are more increases in the pipeline.  I cannot say whether these increases will apply in Northern Ireland but I am aware of a major loss to the economy in the whole Border region due to the price differential.  There is an opportunity to be grasped and we should have the courage to do it.  It has caused people in that area to wonder if anything other than lip service is paid to the problems of the Border region when it is politically favourable to do so.</P>
    <P>The case has been made to me that grant aid for the installation of modern equipment and machinery &mdash; 100 per cent grants in some cases &mdash; should be dropped, as also should the practice by some local authorities of granting rate rebates to new industries for a period of ten years. These are props to businesses which, if they cannot stand on their own at the beginning, do not have much hope of success.  Perhaps that is why so many <Col N="2203" /> businesses have fallen by the wayside in the past decade, and particularly in recent weeks.  We should move our resources towards giving employment. There is no point talking about economic development and the various indicators pointing to improvement if the people are not there.  Many townlands are totally depopulated and that trend will spread into our small towns and villages.  People will not stay unless they have work.  There should be more grants and more favourable taxation designed to encourage the creation of jobs rather than capital grants for the installation of machinery which in many cases can reduce employment.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to be competitive but our people will respond to encouragement. They are the best workforce in the world and are acknowledged as such. Irish workers in health care and the building industry are more than welcome in England, France and Germany.  Their skills are widely acclaimed.  They do not suddenly develop these qualities when they leave this country and we must give them the opportunity through tax benefits to enable them to settle here and rear families.</P>
    <P>These are a few of my comments.  It is not good policy to overstate a case because if we are to be taken seriously we must be factual.  The people will then respond.  If doubtful statements are made, it will be very hard to discern fact from fiction and people will become very disillusioned.  I pledge my support for any developments.  There will be none of the nonsense which went on when Fianna Fáil were in Opposition, trying to bore holes in every Government proposal.  A peculiar term was used for it this morning by the Minister for Tourism and Transport who was, I think, referring to his own party.  We are prepared to support proposals that are worthy of support.  If we find things that are not worthy of support, then our support will not be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>The enactment of the Finance Bill, 1989, will represent another major step by the Government in the implementation of their policies for national recovery.</P>
      <P>These policies were clearly charted in our pre-election programme; were consolidated with the social partners in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and have now been amplified in a major way in the <i>National Development Plan.</i></P>
      <P>At the heart of our policies has been the remains the need to restore and improve the basic confidence in our economy both at home and abroad.  Without that fundamental ingredient there is no sound basis for progress.</P>
      <P>The restoration of confidence requires leadership and authority from Government. It requires disciplined management of the public finances and the national economy.  It requires coherent economic policies which concentrate on improving competitiveness in all its facets as the only foundation for sustainable economic and employment growth and improved social provisions for all our people.</P>
      <P>Central to the task of improving competitiveness is the restoration of budgetary stability.  The progress that has been made since 1986 has indeed been remarkable and has exceeded most commentator's expectations.  In 1986 the Exchequer borrowing requirement was almost 13 per cent of GNP.  This year it is targeted to be less than half that figure. The Exchequer returns for the first quarter suggest that we are firmly on course to meet our fiscal objectives this year.</P>
      <P>The debt-GNP ratio has been stabilised ahead of schedule on the foot of good economic growth and related revenue buoyancy as well as the major reductions made in Government expenditure.  That reduction is the equivalent of 9 per cent of GNP since 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But as we all know only too well and as has been highlighted in the <i>National Development Plan</i>, we are still saddled with an enormous burden of debt which leaves the public finances and the <Col N="2205" /> national economy severely exposed to any deterioration in the international economy or in domestic conditions.</P>
    <P>The level of national debt as a proportion of GNP must be progressively reduced.  This will require continued tight discipline in the public finances as well as improved growth in the economy.  We are now in many ways at a most critical juncture.  If expectations start rising unrealistically and if sectional interests are encouraged to press home their claims, our situation could rapidly deteriorate and the gains of recent years quickly evaporate.  This situation cannot be allowed to develop.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, imperative that discipline be maintained in the public finances and in the economy at large. As debt is progressively reduced, increased resources will be released for productive purposes.</P>
    <P>We see from the progress made in recent years that rapid gains can be made on many fronts with proper discipline and the correct policies.  Interest rates have fallen dramatically.  Price increases are at a low level.  Costs have been contained and competitiveness improved.  The balance of payments is in a sound position and the real economy is improving on many fronts.  Employment prospects are gradually picking up.</P>
    <P>We must continue with the policies that have brought this resurgence about.  We can initiate a cumulative process which should put the economy reasonably quickly onto a higher growth path.  With good labour relations, low inflation and interest rates, a stable rate of exchange and a continued major emphasis on competitiveness and development policies, along with the benefit of increased Structural Fund receipts, there is no reason the Irish growth rate should not exceed the EC average over the medium term.</P>
    <P>These policies have opened and will continue to open the way for the changes in taxation that we would all like to see in the interest of both economic efficiency and equity.</P>
    <P>We have already undertaken considerable restructuring and reform of the <Col N="2206" /> tax system.  The administration and collection processes have been greatly improved.  This year's budget marks a further significant stage in the improvement of the tax system.  The Finance Bill 1989 puts these measures into effect.  The Bill also provides for changes in certain tax incentive schemes, new development incentive measures, new anti-avoidance measures and some other mainly technical taxation items.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boylan asked if we could do anything in regard to income tax reliefs? We would like the reliefs to be greater but we are in a difficult position.  We must not forget that in the four years from 1982 to 1987 we doubled the national debt and one third of our income goes to serving that.  Deputy Boylan cannot criticise because, while he may not have been a Member of the House at that time, he was a member of one of the Government parties.  That did not make our problems any easier to solve.  We stated in Opposition at that time that we would bring about a situation whereby two thirds of the taxpayers would be paying the standard rate of income tax which at that time was 35 per cent.  Our Government have reduced that rate from 35 per cent to 32 per cent and the maximum rate from 58 per cent to 56 per cent.  Deputy Boylan may say that this is not a lot, but it is an indication of our commitment to the many people who are hard pressed.  With less pressure on the taxpayer there is the knock-on effect of more money available to be spent within the economy.</P>
    <P>The Bill implements the income tax reliefs announced in the budget.  The full year cost of these reliefs will come to over £200 million.  This is a major programme of relief which benefits all taxpayers.</P>
    <P>These reliefs include increases in the general and age exemption limits and the introduction of a child addition of £200 per child in conjunction with these.  They include a reduction in the top rate of income tax to 56 per cent and in the standard rate to 32 per cent &mdash; the first reduction in the standard rate for more than 30 years.  Provision is also included for the extension of the 48 per cent band by £200 for a single person and £400 for <Col N="2207" /> a married couple, and extension of the standard rate band by £400 for a single person and £800 for a married couple. These measures will significantly improve the position of low-paid taxpayers with children and will reduce the marginal tax rate faced by over 600,000 taxpayers.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance pointed out in his budget speech these changes mark a major improvement for many taxpayers. For example: a single person on PAYE with an income of £10,000 will gain up to £235; a married couple with an income of £16,000 will gain up to £324; and a married couple with an income of £20,000 will gain up to £470.</P>
    <P>These major improvements result from the successful pursuit of the Government's overall economic and budgetary policies.  These changes are consistent with those policies and reinforce their continued successful operation.  They do this by supporting income moderation and improvements in cost competitiveness. They increase the reward for hard work and initiative and will increase the numbers at work.</P>
    <P>The tax system must reward initiative and productive investment.  It must encourage genuine investment and not distort the economy or the financial system through the undue support of purely artificial transactions where the loser is the general taxpayer and where there is no gain to the real economy.  We have all been aware that the business expansion scheme has in certain of its applications been causing concern.  This is an important investment incentive scheme and we must make sure on an ongoing basis that it is properly meeting its essential objectives.  Following a review of the BES by the Department of Finance, I note that a number of significant changes are now proposed.  These changes will ensure that genuine investments are fully safeguarded while non-genuine ones are excluded from the scope of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives effect to a decision previously announced to exempt from tax the income and capital gains of unit trusts and similar investment funds established <Col N="2208" /> in the International Financial Services Centre for the benefit of non-residents. The same arrangements are being introduced for funds in the Shannon Airport zone.  This is a positive move which will improve Ireland's ability to attract these funds and related jobs to this country.</P>
    <P>The tax system must be geared towards economic development through the use of carefully defined incentives for activities which will generate additional sustainable employment.  In this context the film industry is deserving of special attention. I therefore particularly welcome the proposal in the Bill to encourage investment and job creation in film production in Ireland by increasing substantially the ceiling on investment; by extending the time limit for qualifying investment to mid-1992, and also by extending the concessionary capital gains tax relief.</P>
    <P>As a further development measure the categories of computer services which qualify for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax are being extended to include consultancy and technical services related to software and data processing. This is an imaginative proposal which will enhance our emerging status in this high technology sphere.</P>
    <P>The development of our road infrastructure forms a central and major element of the <i>National Development Plan</i>.  Our location as an island on the periphery of the Community places us at a major cost disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> our European competitors.  The most significant reason for the high transport costs is the poor state of the national roads and the access roads to our principal ports and airports.  The plan proposes Exchequer expenditure of almost £1 billion over the five years on the development of our roads with £755 million on national roads.</P>
    <P>Private funding will have a significant role to play.  Proposals for possible private investment in key projects have been identified.  Realistic investment proposals in relation to these projects will be welcome. This investment in toll roads will be used to accelerate the investment programmes in national roads.  The Finance <Col N="2209" /> Bill includes provision which will encourage the further development of toll roads. The Bill enhances and renews for an additional period of three years the tax relief available for the development of toll road projects.  It will now be possible to write off in full the capital expenditure on such projects against the toll income instead of the 50 per cent write off at present.</P>
    <P>Last year saw dramatic improvements in tax administration and enforcement. The tax system must be seen to be effective and fully and fairly enforced.  For too long, however, there was a widespread perception that the whole assessment and collection system was very ineffective. This perception did nothing to encourage the support that was, and remains, required from all the social partners and the general body of taxpayers for the implementation of tough but essential fiscal and economic policies.</P>
    <P>After many years of tampering with the system, the problem had to be taken by the scruff of the neck and decisive action implemented.  The two major actions taken in 1988 &mdash; the tax amnesty and self-assessment for self-employed taxpayers &mdash; proved to be dramatically successful.  Substantial amounts of arrears have been cleared, the timeliness of payments has been significantly improved and the whole collection system has been put on a much sounder footing.</P>
    <P>This process must and will be continued and developed.  Those who try to exploit the rest of the community by defaulting on tax payments will be confronted with the full rigors of the stringent enforcement measures now available to the tax authorities.  The honest taxpayer has nothing to fear.</P>
    <P>This whole change in the tax collection and enforcement environment reflects again the Government's firm resolve to provide leadership and impose a sensible discipline on the management of the national economy.  This approach embraces all facets of the State's activities. Public agencies must be efficiently staffed and effectively managed. Resources that are not aiding the national <Col N="2210" /> economy or justified on sound social grounds must be released to more productive uses or diverted to more pressing social needs.</P>
    <P>We accept, or course, that this causes difficulties and pressures for many groups and individuals but these problems are the consequences of failed policies in the past.  The measures that the Government are now implementing are unavoidable and are in the national interest.  We have all learned a hard lesson from the experience of the last two decades.  There must be a national commitment never again to relax financial and economic discipline. On the contrary, such policies and discipline must become the hallmark of policies in this country right into the next century.  It is only through that route that our debt levels can be reduced and the long-term growth and solvency of the economy assured.  That is the only road to ending emigration and providing jobs in this country for all who require them.</P>
    <P>On the question of indirect taxation, I welcome the Minister for Finance's statement in his opening speech on this Stage of the Bill in relation to the implications for tax reform of the 1992 indirect tax harmonisation proposals.  The Minister indicated that there are now clear indications which were confirmed by the proceedings at the EC Finance Minister's meeting earlier this week that the earlier set of proposals put forward by the Commission will be revised.  This, as the Minister said, confirms the wisdom of the Government's approach in not rushing to implement the earlier proposals.  At the same time, of course, the prospect of some harmonisation cannot be ignored in our management and development of the tax system.  We must at a minimum avoid exacerbating any problems or gaps that exist.</P>
    <P>We and the public at large must continue to have a sense of reality and proportion about the early prospect of substantial tax harmonisation.  The process of harmonisation will involve a huge tax revenue loss for the country.  It would involve substantial reductions in the level of indirect taxation on what are in some cases highly import intensive goods.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2211" /> If this loss was to be made up by other tax increases then it could only fall on direct taxes such as income tax, corporate tax or PRSI.  The consequences for employment and economic activity would not be favourable and could, depending on the reaction of economic agents, be extremely serious.  The Government have, therefore, made it quite clear to the Community that the revenue and other implications must be fully taken into account in any firm proposals that may emerge.</P>
    <P>The budget measures have attracted widespread acceptance.  The proposals have been welcomed as fair and balanced while giving priority to the needs of the public finances and the national economy.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance has already emphasised, developments since the budget suggest that the strategy on which it is based is firmly on course.  The Exchequer returns for the March quarter are very promising.  The revenue returns suggest that the pick-up in economic activity which was projected earlier is coming through.  Retail sales are strong. The level of unemployment over the first three months was substantially down on the first quarter of 1988.  Manufacturing employment is up for the first time since 1980.  The building industry is also showing significant evidence of recovery. Employment is some 7 per cent higher and there is an increase of 20 per cent in housing starts.</P>
    <P>We can confidently expect a further substantial balance of payments surplus. Exports value is growing by some 24 per cent reflecting continued growth in export markets and the continued improvement in competitiveness. Imports of capital goods are up by 20 per cent signalling an upturn in investment and output potential.  The Minister has said, and I note that his view is shared by most independent commentators, that real GDP may grow by 3.5 per cent this year and, indeed, this projection may be bettered.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier substantial progress is now being made on many fronts.  Most of <Col N="2212" /> this is due to our own efforts but some of it is due to the fair winds that are blowing in the international economy.  There are no grounds for complacency.  We must knuckle down to the task of continually pruning the public finances while at the same time actively seeking out development opportunities where the State can play a positive role in removing constraints and in better mobilising both human and financial resources.</P>
    <P>The Government have shown by their imaginative development policies combined with sound overall fiscal and economic management that substantial progress can be achieved quickly and in a dramatic fashion with the proper leadership and discipline at Government level.  We intend to continue with this process.  We will accept support from any quarter in pursuing this task of national recovery.  But, as has already been stressed on a number of occasions, we will not accept tactics from the parties opposite that are designed to undermine our budgetary strategy, by giving aid to discordant sectional groups or which seek by personal attack or innuendo to dent the Government's credibility and authority.</P>
    <P>Of course, we have elections for the European Parliament to fight in June and I have no difficulty in fighting them with gusto.  But let us fight them within the parameters of the real issues and not jeopardise all that has been achieved by throwing the broad measure of consensus that has been reached in this House aside for the sake of a few votes here and there.  The issues at stake in our national recovery programme are too important for that and I have no doubt that public opinion will not tolerate the use of spoiling tactics in that context by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>In conclusion let me emphasise again the importance of this Bill as a further major step in the implementation of our policies for a national recovery.  These policies are working and are working well.  The <i>National Development Plan</i> has set a clear and positive framework.  I do not think it is necessary to refer to it because I do not think it can be compared <Col N="2213" /> with any previous plan.  I am satisfied that in the next four or five years it will achieve all its targets and I have no doubt that it will be welcomed and approved by the Commission.</P>
    <P>The fiscal and economic indicators are positive.  The task ahead, however, remains enormous.  With leadership and discipline, and the continuation of our policies, we could look forward with confidence to the future.  This is the only way in which our pressing employment needs will be properly met.  The Finance Bill advances our policies in a realistic and practical way.</P>

      <P>The Finance Bill is lengthy, running to 94 pages.  It is full of all kinds of detail but within it there is nothing radical with the exception of one section, section 76, about which I will speak later and which is, perhaps, a bit too radical for what it sets out to do. Otherwise, the Bill is a whole series of minor amendments from a legislative or accounting point of view of the existing law with slight modifications in one direction or another that are of little real consequence.  It is very hard to believe that the Bill is being introduced in the context of unemployment of 240,000 people and of emigration from here of somewhere between 40,000 and 50,000 people per annum.  Not all of those people are unemployed before they leave and a great many of them leave good employment by Irish standards because of the taxation system.  Instead of having a radical look at our taxation system, which is the most penal in the western world and which does more to harm employment than the taxation system of any other country, we do nothing with it except make minor adjustments one way or the other.  The Government try to suggest that in some way those adjustments, or the Bill before us, are significant. Unfortunately, they are not and they will not do anything to change the context in which we speak of 240,000 unemployed and of the incredible emigration that is sapping the best people from our country leaving vast parts of <Col N="2214" /> rural areas almost denuded of young people in particular.</P>
      <P>The one radical provision that I referred to is quite new and different to anything that was tried before in legislative terms.  In my view we will hear a lot about section 76 which runs to eight pages, is extremely detailed and is not easy to read.  It will be contested almost continuously in the courts if it is passed in its present form.  I should like to ask the Minister to have a serious look at it because what I am afraid of in relation to this omnibus anti-avoidance measure is that it will benefit the very people whom it was intended to catch.  The reason is that it is so global that they will immediately challenge it.  They are well equipped to do so because they have the best lawyers and accountants.  In fact, I understand that some of them are getting ready to do so on the basis that this provision, or something close to it, will be enacted. If they do so it is hard to imagine how the courts will uphold all eight pages or 13 subsections of the section.  It seems to me to be very regretable that we are not introducing anti-avoidance measures that are likely to stand up but we are going so far that we are introducing anti-avoidance measures that are likely to fall down.  The result will be that we will have no new legislation of the kind we should have in this regard.  We will have no new enforceable legislation because there is not much point in introducing legislation if it is found, as a result of examination by the courts, that it will not be enforceable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an attempt to make this retrospective in particular, to anything that was done after budget day of this year, which was 26 January.  I can quite sympathise with the anxiety of the Minister and indeed of the Revenue Commissioners to make these retrospective but I am afraid they will not stand up in law and I am advised accordingly.  There is the case of Doyle v.  The Taoiseach and Others reported in the 1986 <i>Irish Law Reports Monthly</i> which deals with the efforts of section 79 of the Finance Act, 1980, to make a two per cent levy on cattle retrospective.  That was found to <Col N="2215" /> contravene Article 15.5 of the Constitution. It was made quite clear that that article applies not just to retrospective penal legislation but also to retrospective taxation legislation, that one cannot make an activity subject to taxation subsequently if, at the time it was carried out, it was not subject to taxation.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting provision in section 76 of this Finance Bill that I think will stand up properly, that is in respect of things which were put in place before the passing of this legislation, it proposes that they should not retain the exemption from taxation that they would have otherwise in respect of income or profits arising after the passing of this Act.  That is all right because that is not retrospective in that sense.  The action in setting up the scheme was taken before the passing of the Act but the actual period in respect of which the taxation is collected is subsequent to it.  That is perfectly all right because anybody who engages in business or other financial activity in this country has to operate on the basis that the law may be changed by the Oireachtas from time to time.  But they should be allowed to operate on the basis also that the law will not be changed retrospectively by the Oireachtas, and the Constitution seems to bear them out on that.</P>
    <P>I am not making the case for these people.  On the contrary, I am making the case against them because it is my belief that it is wrong to give them an &ldquo;out&rdquo; which I believe they will have if they challenged some of the many detailed provisions of this lengthy, complex section.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the Doyle case where it was sought to impose a levy retrospectively and which the courts struck down.  There are other examples one could give where the same principles apply.  They do not all necessarily consist of taxation cases, but the same principle applies.  There was another case decided in 1982, that of <i>Hamilton</i> v. <i>Hamilton</i>, where the court decided that one cannot apply the provisions of the Family Home (Protection) Act retrospectively.  It seems to me that these kinds of provisions <Col N="2216" /> are far more penal or onerous than anything contained in the Family Home (Protection) Act.  In the case of <i>The State (McEldowney)</i> v. <i>Kelleher in 1983</i> the courts held that if there is an appeal to the courts and there is a justifiable issue before them, the Oireachtas cannot, by statute, take away the right of the courts to pronounce on issues of law and of fact. That case related to the Street and House to House Collections Act, 1962, where there was an appeal to the District Court against the refusal of a superintendent but where one was not allowed, in the District Court hearing, to question the superintendent's opinion.</P>
    <P>There are very definite parallels between that and what is here because, in section 76, the Revenue Commissioners are allowed to form an opinion and the courts are not allowed to interfere with that opinion unless the formation of that opinion on the part of the Revenue Commissioners was unreasonable, in other words, unless they had no grounds on which they could come to the conclusion they did.  It seems to be similar in that respect to the Act of 1962 except that, in many respects of course, it relates to much more important matters.  It is perhaps much more open to challenge even than was the 1962 Act.</P>
    <P>There was a further recent case decided only last month by Mr. Justice Barron in the High Court &mdash; called <i>Cashman</i> v. <i>Clifford</i> under the legislation relating to bookmakers' licences and their renewal, where there is a provision in the relevant Act which says that, on an appeal to the District Court arising from a refusal of a licence by a superintendent the Revenue Commissioners and the gardaí only may be heard by the court as witnesses or as parties and that other interested parties are excluded. The High Court found against that Act and did so without any great difficulty on the grounds that it was quite improper not to allow people the right to argue their case before the court and that legislation that purported to prevent them having the various issues of fact and law considered by the court was not acceptable under our Constitution.  I believe <Col N="2217" /> there are more cases to the same effect. I am picking out one or two only to which to refer briefly.  This might be done more fully on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am referring at some length to section 76 for the very simple reason that I regard it as one that will give rise to an enormous amount of litigation unless amended fairly significantly from the way it stands now.  I predict that if the litigation, or any part of it, is successful it will mean that the very people whom this House would legitimately want to prevent evading tax will be allowed to continue in their activity.  Therefore, it is in the overall interests of this House and of the public at large that we get this section right and that we would not approach the problem in such an extraordinary global fashion that the chances of the courts upholding it were slim.</P>
    <P>To give an example of what is entailed, in subsection (8), where it deals with the question of appeals, it is said:</P>
    <P>Provided that on the hearing or rehearing of the appeal&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  it shall not be lawful to go into any grounds of appeal other than those specified in subsection (7) and ....</P>
    <P>I find it very hard to believe that the courts will accept that the four grounds of appeal set out in subsection (7) are to be only ones that can be considered by the courts.  A number of the cases I have already cited seem to suggest that the courts will not allow themselves to be tied down in that way, that they will insist on the facts being argued before them, that they will insist on the right of a citizen to bring forward whatever arguments he or she thinks are relevant and which the court are prepared to accept as relevant and not have themselves confined in that way.</P>
    <P>It is interesting then, having read pages of all the provisions contained here which give the Revenue Commissioners almost <i>carte blanche</i> as to what they can do provided they have some colour of reason for doing it, the courts are to be excluded from interfering with them.  But if, by any <Col N="2218" /> chance, the courts were to set aside their opinion in relation to something being a tax avoidance measure, one comes to subsection (10) which says:</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners may, at any time, amend, add to or withdraw any matter specified or described in a notice of opinion by giving notice... in writing of the amendment, addition or withdrawal to each and every person affected thereby, in so far as the person is so affected, and the foregoing provisions of this section shall apply in all respects as if the notice of amendment were a notice of opinion and any matter specified or described in the notice of amendment were specified or described in a notice of opinion:</P>
    <P>If I could take the analogy of a football match.  Let us say that at half time the Revenue Commissioners are losing as against the taxpayer &mdash; and there will not be many cases of that because of the powers they have, but if we assume that they are losing &mdash; they will go into a huddle at half time and come out before the second half and inform the referee &ldquo;We lost the first half but we do not want to lose the match, so now we are changing the rules and the following are the rules for the second half, so kindly administer them as follows&rdquo;.  I do not think the courts are going to stand over that.  One of the many points of having a written Constitution is that we have certain guarantees. The only people who are there in the last resort to enforce those guarantees of rights for the citizen are the courts.  If own supremacy to interpret and declare the law and if they do not uphold the sole prerogative of this House and the Seanad to make the law then we are in difficulties as a nation and individual citizens.  The courts know that and that is why I think they will be keen to ensure that that is upheld.</P>
    <P>What this is saying in essence, when you try to distill down the eight pages of text in this one section, is that the law in relation to tax shall no longer be what the Oireachtas declares it to be but shall be whatever the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="2219" /> wish it to be.  If the Revenue Commissioners make a mistake in agreeing to a particular thing they can always change their minds and declare the law in effect for that particular citizen to be what they now want it to be.  That is not law; that is an arbitrary decision.  It is one thing to say that this is only designed for Paddy McGrath and others who are supposed to be regarded as somehow slightly less than desirable.  I have the highest regard for Paddy McGrath and other people like him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Every citizen is entitled to the protection of the law and if we are to accept this principle that somebody other than this House, as the law making authority, or the superior courts, as the interpreting and determining authority about the effect of that law, is to make the law, where is it going to stop?  As I said, some people will suggest that because this section is about tax, tax avoidance and so on, the rights of citizens do not matter, but if we are going to extend this principle to other things like, for example, the right to personal liberty and people being deprived of their liberty by the decision of groups other than this House and the courts acting together &mdash; one making the law and the other interpreting it &mdash; then where do we stop?  Are the Garda going to be given the right to declare people guilty of offences without any determination by the courts?  Where will personal liberty stand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of what is happening in this section, therefore, deserves to be considered.  While its basic objective may be commendable and one we will all agree with I have to ask the Minister, the Department of Finance, the Government and the Revenue Commissioners to think again about it and to appreciate in particular that if they bring in something <Col N="2220" /> which is as wide-ranging as this and which contains such a relatively high degree of likelihood of being challenged and set aside in the courts, then they do not achieve anything because it means that all the people who have engaged in these practices which are disapproved of will have <i>carte blanche</i> until some other method is worked out of trying to overcome these problems.</P>
    <P>This Bill is strange in the sense that where it tries to give tax reliefs and control some of them and goes on at some length about it, it picks out things like, for example, the business enterprise scheme which we all know has been widely abused, particularly in the past 12 months, and used for all kinds of purposes which I think this House never foresaw it being used for.  A lot of time is given in this Bill to changing the arrangements in relation to that.  I welcome all these changes of arrangement so far as they go but I question whether or not they are adequate.</P>
    <P>One of the most flagrant abuses of the scheme, of course, has been the building of large numbers of houses all over the country, particularly in cities, in the past 12 months under the guise that somehow or other they are supposed to contribute to the development of tourism.  In fact all they are doing is enabling people to use this scheme to build houses in a way which probably costs them, in net terms, about half of what they would otherwise have to pay if this scheme was not available. By all means it is a good thing to wipe that out but it is only wiped out so far as the cities are concerned.</P>
    <P>If you tried to build a scheme of houses in Cork or Limerick of the kind of which has been built in Donnybrook, Ballsbridge and everywhere else, the probability is that you would not be building them within the city boundaries of Cork or Limerick anyway because there would not be sufficient space or suitable locations in which to build them.  You would be building them in the suburbs outside the city boundaries.  So far as those cities are concerned the proposal in this Bill to do away with the county <Col N="2221" /> boroughs, so far as this scheme is concerned, is absolutely useless because it will not affect people at all.  It is more extensive in Dublin because it includes the county as well as the city but again all one has to do is go to somewhere like Bray, Leixlip or somewhere else which is just marginally outside County Dublin and one will still retain all these extraordinarily generous incentives simply to build ordinary houses.  It seems to me incredible that at a time when we have appallingly penal taxation &mdash; and Deputy McDowell drew attention to this yesterday &mdash; ordinary people who are on PAYE and paying two-thirds of their income in many cases on their marginal earnings should be let stew because they are genuine people who are genuinely working and trying to increase productivity, but people who are purely speculators are given all these sorts of incentives to go away and build houses or do other things that really contribute only in a very limited way to the economy here.</P>
    <P>I thought when the business incentive scheme was introduced first that it was a good idea.  It was extraordinarily restrictive at the time but the present Government decided to do away with most of the restrictions and we have gone from one extreme where it could hardly be used at all to the other extreme where it is used by all kinds of speculators for noneconomic and non-productive purposes, which I believe is just as bad.  The scheme should be abolished so far as the building of houses or any other property of that type is concerned and it should be confined to genuinely productive activity such as manufacturing where genuine risk is involved.  It seems incredible that for the last year, up to the publication of this Bill you had to take no risk at all because you could get your risk under the scheme guaranteed by a bank or some other institution and you were taking no risk.  It seems mad to have allowed that situation at all.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes which are being made in relation to that section but they should go further.  The building of houses under this scheme which could never <Col N="2222" /> have been envisaged as a business expansion scheme or anything that would properly be used under it should be abolished altogether and not simply abolished in relation to county boroughs and County Dublin, which seems to be pointless.</P>
    <P>I heard a number of speakers, particularly the last speaker, Minister of State Gallagher, speak about great changes for toll roads because there would now be a 100 per cent write off instead of a 50 per cent write off.  That is typical of the sort of illusion which can be created in these things.  I am afraid toll roads have almost been finished by the provision in this Bill, if this section on toll roads is allowed go through.  The write off is increased to 100 per cent but what Deputy Gallagher and the Minister for Finance, in his speech yesterday, forgot to tell us was that the write off is now confined to income from the tolls and not to any other income.  I do not see much point in having a 100 per cent write off in respect of income from the tolls if it is going to be many years before there is any sort of return from those tolls.  If that is persisted in, it is a great opportunity missed.  It should be made more attractive because the existing scheme of a 50 per cent write off generally is far more attractive than a 100 per cent write off from the tolls only, which seems to me to be a pointless exercise. I say this not in aid of those who might build roads but in aid of trying to get roads built which, God knows, we certainly need.  I suppose in all our most recent history &mdash; and by that I mean in the last 30 or 40 years &mdash; the roads have never been in the state in which they are now and, in particular, our arterial roads are not able to cope with the demands that are put on them.</P>
    <P>I see references to major roads being proposed under the plan which was debated here last week radiating out from Dublin.  I would have thought the only realistic way of getting those built, within the foreseeable future, would be to make them toll roads.  I think all of them should be toll roads and it is extraordinary that in the entirety of this country I can only think of one toll that is chargeable, that is the toll on a bridge over the Liffey <Col N="2223" /> in Dublin, and no other.  I would much prefer to see these roads provided within the next few years and subject to tolls rather than wait ten, 15 or 20 years to see a proper road built to Portlaoise, Kinnegad and such places and have them free of toll.  Every other country is glad to have roads built on the basis that they will be subject to tolls.</P>
    <P>One of the important developments that seems to be taking place in the last few months and, in particular, in the last few weeks, is in relation to the level of the availability of credit here.  The Government finally &mdash; against their own promises but as a result, I think, of the directly opposite views which were put forward in the last general election by the Progressive Democrats &mdash; decided to abandon their own principles and to adopt the policy on the cutting of public expenditure, a policy we put forward in 1986 and 1987 and for which they derided us, saying it was impossible.  Because they have now adopted that policy and because they have happily and beneficially reduced the amount of Government spending and, therefore, the amount of Government borrowing, there is a great deal more credit around.  One of the consequences is that interest rates are very much lower and it gives us some advantage now that they are very much lower.  The disappointment about the availability of these low interest rates is that the major beneficiaries appear to be, in practice at any rate, people who are are wishing to engage in productive economic activity.  For some reason which I can never totally fathom, it has always been a feature of the approach in this country that if people perceive things as going a little better than they were, the first criterion by which they judge it or what they regard as a reliable barometer is the price of housing.  If the price of houses is going up things are supposed to be looking promising, if the price of housing is low then things are supposed to be bad.  I would say we are the only country in the world that applies that <Col N="2224" /> criterion or principle to judge our economic activity.  Perhaps, that is why we have frequently got it wrong.  In other countries, particularly within Europe, if interest rates are low, the people who will rush to avail of them are those who are engaged in productive activity, particularly people in manufacturing.  That is not happening here.</P>
    <P>I can recall, only a few years ago that if you were holding a clinic as a TD, one of the frequent requests you got was from people who were trying to buy houses asking if you would get in touch with building societies, insurance companies or banks to see if there was some possibility that sometime within the following 12 months the person concerned would be able to get a mortgage.  You were treated with disdain by the building societies and told they had all kinds of rules, that money had to be deposited with them for 12 months, two years or whatever else.</P>

      <P>Now, as I walk down the street &mdash; apart from the building societies &mdash; even the banks who were giving no money have such notices up as: &ldquo;Home Loans available here, please call in&rdquo;.  As the Central Bank, and as recently as yesterday Mr. Connellan of the CII, pointed out, there is unfortunately nothing more inflationary than that particularly so far as secondhand housing is concerned.  It reminds us all, as it should, of what happened when we had something like that in respect of at least one sector of activity here in the late seventies when the banks chose to fall over themselves in trying to lend money to farmers, when they were telling farmers, for example, that they were mad not to pay £3,500 or £4,000 for a statute acre of land.  They were offering them huge sums of money &mdash; hundreds of thousands of pounds &mdash; to buy more land.  The fate of many of those farmers is that quite a number of them are bankrupt and others have literally worried themselves into the grave because of the obligations they undertook and are now unable to meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2225" /> The price of land came down to one-third and at times even to a quarter of what they were prepared to pay with the assistance of the banks only a few years earlier. What was the effect of all that except inflation?</P>
    <P>At least in regard to farming it was a productive activity, though perhaps not as productive for many farmers as it should be put, nonetheless, it was essentially an economic activity.  This pouring out of money into the purchase of houses today is in no way a productive activity. We had an example which I read in the newspapers the other day &mdash; and I heard it referred to by many people in many parts of the country &mdash; of somebody paying more than £200,000 for a one-bedroom gate lodge somewhere in County Dublin.  I hope that is the peak of how ridiculous this is going to be and that sense will be garnered from now on.</P>
    <P>When the British had this kind of problem to some extent a few years ago, even though it was by no means all involving property, there was a tremendous amount of retail buying, the Chancellor of the Exchequer decided that the way to attack the problem, when he recognised the inherent difficulties, was to increase interest rates.  So far as their Exchequer finances are concerned they are in a different situation from us; they are actually many billions of pounds in surplus on their current budget which is extraordinary. They had to increase interest rates, or at least the Chancellor felt he had to.  Even he, possibly, would now agree that the results have not been advantageous to the British economy as a whole.  That is why I hope we will avoid that situation.  We need far more than the British do to avoid it.  That is why I hope that the suggestion made yesterday by Mr. Connellan and that made a month ago by the Governor of the Central Bank will be adopted as the solution to the problem.  In their monetary statement published about a month ago the Central Bank said as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of today's date:</P>
    <P>Some aspects of credit growth &mdash; in particular the rapid expansion of <Col N="2226" /> mortgage credit &mdash; could become a cause for concern if they resulted in a bidding up of the prices of existing assets, rather than an increase in real economic activity.</P>
    <P>The Governor went on to say that these trends could not be ignored indefinitely. Mr. Connellan's suggestion of yesterday is that the banks be instructed to stop lending a vast amount of money, as should the building societies who will shortly be coming under the control of the Central Bank, a move with which I agree and which makes sense.  One of the paradoxes in this country is that we are short of capital, but those who have money to lend have very few places to lend it for productive activity.  The traditional place to lend surplus cash has always been the property area and then we get this ridiculous cycle of property being grossly inflated in value with inflationary effects, and genuine productive activity is handicapped and penalised.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank laying down guidelines will not necessarily put money where it should be put, but at least it can prevent money going where it should not go.  It should not go into the property market in the volume and readiness with which it has been over the last six months, or there will be serious consequences for us.</P>
    <P>I noticed in today's paper an article on the appointment of a receiver to an economic productive activity in County Mayo.  That productive activity has been carried on over the last three or four years, in a bit of a struggle against all the odds, by a former Member of this House who should be commended for his work. Yesterday, he had to succumb to the appointment of a receiver.  I know this has been imminent for a long time.</P>
    <P>I would like to contrast his enterprise with the Dublin property speculator type enterprise and underline how much more useful is the man in County Mayo to this country than the kind of people who extract by foul means or fair £2 million from the taxpayers of County Dublin <Col N="2227" /> because they are not allowed to do something that the planning laws of County Dublin do not allow them to do anyway. We see the useful County Mayo man go under and we are seeing these developer type parasites living as millionares and flaunting themselves as if they were great and valued members of society.  It is a pity that our mentality allows that sort of thing to happen.</P>
    <P>That mentality is reflected in this legislation. This Bill in some way perpetuates the situation where it is fair game for the fellows who engage in strokes and deals, while they may be caught in three or four years time, to engage in highly profitable non-productive activities while we penalise either with personal taxation or by putting them into receivership those who make a genuine effort to improve the lot of this country.  That is why the Bill is such a disappointment.</P>
    <P>If there was the political will to do what needs to be done in relation to taxation, so much could be transformed.  Two and half years ago when this party talked about the necessity for severely controlling public expenditure and for taking a radical and fundamental look at personal taxation, we were told it could not be done.  It has been done because there was determination to control public expenditure.  It is no more difficult to do the same to taxation, particularly personal taxation.  The will and determination is not there at the moment but I hope a time will come when the people on the Government benches will be prepared to do it.</P>
    <P>I do not talk about this now nor did I talk about it three years ago, as some kind of attractive electoral package, which is sometimes suggested.  I speak about the necessity for having sensible rates of taxation because it is necessary not just for the prosperity of the country but for the very survival of the country.  We should ask ourselves if this country will survive if it loses 40,000 of its best young people each year as it has been doing for the last couple of years, and as it is doing this year.  I have grave doubts whether it will if that trend continues. <Col N="2228" /> Within 70 miles of this House there is a jurisdiction where there are two rates of taxation, 25 per cent and 40 per cent. It is very relevant to us that those should be the British rates of taxation, and the United States rates of taxation are lower. Our young people are not held down with enormous bolts to prevent them from moving.  They are free to move, they move and will continue to move.  In their assessment of where they will stay, they have no particular commitment to this country and they will look to see what is the most attractive and rewarding environment for them.  Up to now they have been voting with their feet and have decided that London, New York and various other cities in Britain and America as well as Australia, Canada, France and Germany are the most attractive environments for them.  They will continue in that way until such time as we make the necessary changes.</P>
    <P>There are some fiddling little changes of 1 per cent and 2 per cent in tax rates that are of very little significance.  The best one can say is that there is some sort of vague move in the right direction but it is so slight that it will have no influence whatever on whether people will stay or leave.  Unfortunately, all the indications are that people are leaving in just as great numbers this year as last year.  That is the ultimate tragedy, combined with the unemployment problems which has never before been parallelled in this country and hopefully we will never again have nearly 250,000 unemployed.  That saps the morale of an entire nation.  That is very noticeable as one travels around the country.  That is the kind of challenge that should be tackled in this Finance Bill, not the minor fiddling changes that are there.  It is regrettable that this Bill is simply some kind of tidying up measure by the Revenue Commissioners and that it is of no basic political consequences. That is a measure of its failure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Finance Bill is part of the annual budgetary process.  It gives effect to the <Col N="2229" /> taxation and other changes announced in the budget statement by the Minister for Finance.  While a Finance Bill for a particular year is at the heart of the economic strategy for that year, this Government have clearly set out their long term economic and development strategy in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> published in October 1987.  The programme set out the four main objectives of Government economic policy for the period to the end of 1990, including the creation of a fiscal exchange rate and monetary climate conducive to economic growth and the move towards greater equity and fairness in the tax system.</P>
    <P>Two years of good economic management by the Government have created the conditions for the achievement of these objectives.  We have only to look at the outturn for last year to see how well the Government have re-established control over the public finances.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement was reduced from nearly 13 per cent of gross national product in 1986 to 3½ per cent of GNP in 1988.  This is an enormous achievement and one which the main Opposition Party look at with envy because they were unable to achieve such a reduction when in Government.  Again if we look at the Exchequer returns for the first quarter of this year, we are on target to achieve the 1989 budgetary targets and perhaps even improve upon them.  The first quarter results confirm that the increase in economic activities projected at budget time is occurring.</P>
    <P>We will continue to monitor carefully the controls established on public expenditure to ensure that for the third year in succession our targets will be met.</P>
    <P>The encouraging results for the first quarter will maintain confidence in the Government's ability to successfully manage the economy.  The results provide a guide to the financial markets which, in turn, leads to retention of low interest rates despite the recent increases in the UK.  We must continue to take measures which will enable us to keep interest rates as low as possible.  These measures include keeping our costs from <Col N="2230" /> rising at a rate higher than our European partners.</P>
    <P>The Government have given a lead in controlling public expenditure and the private sector must now do their part by controlling price increases and keeping costs, especially pay costs, in line with those set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which was agreed with the social partners.</P>
    <P>The economic indicators are going in the right direction.  Inflation and interest rates are still at a low level compared with some of our competitors and we must keep them that way.  Real GNP is expected to increase this year.  The indicators augur well for achieving sustainable growth, increased employment opportunities and improved living standards in the short-term.</P>
    <P>However, these objectives could be rendered unattainable unless the progress achieved in the last two years is built upon.  There is a continuing need for consensus by the social partners.  The Government will continue to do their part as indicated in the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i> debated in the House last week.  We have reaffirmed our commitment to the maintenance of a fiscal exchange rate and cost climate conducive to sustained economic growth.  We intend to pursue a further reduction in Exchequer borrowing over the medium term.  Fiscal policy will be conducted with a view to securing an Exchequer borrowing requirement of the order of 3 per cent of GNP in 1993.  This will represent close to a halving of the overall rate of borrowing compared with the budget target for this year.</P>
    <P>One of the Government's objectives is to reform taxation, especially personal taxation and to make it more equitable. Reform measures featured in the 1987 and 1988 Finance Acts, and further measures are included in the Bill before the House.  There is general agreement both within the House and outside it that the level of income tax is acting as a major disincentive to initiative and hindering the objective of increasing employment. Some commentators claim that it contributes to some of the emigration of our <Col N="2231" /> young well educated people who, if they did not choose to go abroad, might act as a driving force to the creation of jobs in this country.  The Government would like to move faster on giving greater relief to personal income tax payers but we must be realistic.  We cannot undo overnight the gross mismanagement of the public finances by the Coalition Government. The Government improved the position in 1987 and in 1988 and for this year the Finance Bill, when enacted, will give legislative effect to the budgetary announcements, which people are now enjoying in their pay packets since the beginning of this month.  The main improvements are raising of the general exemption limits for single and widowed persons, for people over certain ages, for married persons and for qualifying children and restructuring of income tax rate bands providing for reductions in the 35 per cent and 58 per cent rates to 32 per cent and 56 per cent respectively.</P>
    <P>These changes benefit all income tax payers.  The reduction in the standard income rate is the first in more than 20 years.  The Government will continue to reform the personal income rates as circumstances permit to make the amounts payable by the majority of taxpayers more equitable.</P>
    <P>In addition to improving the position of income tax payers, the Government are also committed to ending inequities in the system.  Further measures are included in the Finance Bill to counteract certain transactions which have little or no commercial reality but are carried out primarily to create an artificial tax deduction or to avoid or reduce a tax charge. These anti-avoidance measures are contained in Part VI of the Bill &mdash; sections 76 to 79.  It is important that people, whether wealthy or otherwise, should pay their fair share of taxation.  The Government are committed to reforming the tax system so that the burden of meeting the cost of Government and the debt repayments is spread in an equitable manner.  We saw last year that the tax amnesty brought in some £500 million in additional revenue.  The effects of this <Col N="2232" /> additional revenue on the Exchequer borrowing requirement was clear. Improvements in the EBR help everybody as they reduce the overall revenue requirement and provide scope for reducing income taxes.  It is important, therefore, that loopholes identified should be rectified as early as possible.</P>
    <P>Another area which was giving cause for concern in recent months has been the use of the business expansion scheme for investments which run counter to the risk capital nature of the scheme.  The Bill addresses the problem of a number of investments which conflict with the thrust of the business expansion scheme as an incentive to invest in high risk start-up firms.</P>
    <P>Section 7 contains the proposed amendments to the existing scheme of relief for investment in corporate trades and the amendments will take effect as respects eligible shares issued on or after 12 April 1989.  BES relief amendments are where BES funds are used to purchase a ship, the ship concerned must be an addition to the Irish register; the introduction of an upper limit of £2.5 million on the amount of shares issued by a qualifying company in respect of which relief can be claimed; certain leasing, etc. activities will no longer be qualifying trading operations; relief will no longer be available where certain options are held over BES shares; and holiday houses and apartments in certain urban areas are being excluded from the BES relief.</P>
    <P>The latter amendment does not have any major implications for housing policy.  The urban areas affected are the county boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and the administrative county of Dublin.  The use of BES schemes for investment in holiday houses and apartments was a misuse of the scheme as such investment is effectively risk free.  The location of these houses and apartments in the major urban areas virtually guarantees that the investments would maintain their value and, indeed, would appreciate substantially in the five years for which BES shares must be held.  There would be little difficulty in selling the properties after <Col N="2233" /> five years, which would give the investors a substantial benefit at the expense of taxpayers, while the accommodation would no longer be available for tourists. Availability of the BES relief in such circumstances is clearly not justified and section 7 of the Bill closes off this possibility.</P>
    <P>Nowhere is the success of the Government's policy of financial retrenchment, allied to highly targeted and selective incentives, more apparent than in the construction industry.  Since taking office we have aimed at generating the right climate to stimulate activity and investment in all sectors of the economy.  Our efforts have been directed towards reducing foreign borrowing, stabilising the national debt and reducing inflation and interest rates.  This involved hard and unpopular decisions affecting the construction industry, including the abolition of some grants schemes and reductions in allocations.</P>
    <P>The result is a noticeable increase in new housing output, in commercial development and in major refurbishment work &mdash; much of it on sites that have lain dormant for many years.  Cement sales increased in 1988 &mdash; up by over 4 per cent &mdash; and there was a 17 per cent rise in registrations under the national house building guarantee scheme.  These trends look set to accelerate with cement sales up by over 30 per cent and guarantee scheme registrations up 25 per cent for the first two months of this year.  The resumption of activity in Ireland by major building concerns which had been concentrating their efforts abroad in recent times is a further indicator of the new confidence abounding in the industry.</P>
    <P>As a result of measures announced in the budget, public investment affecting the industry will amount to £826 million this year.  Private investment in the industry will increase significantly in 1989, particularly in the industrial, commercial and retail sectors and about 3,000 extra jobs will be provided in the construction industry.  For the first time since 1981, overall output for the industry is forecast to increase.  Commentators are putting that increase at about 4 per cent, present <Col N="2234" /> indications are that it will be higher than that.</P>
    <P>The industry will also benefit from the increased investment set out in the <i>National Development Plan</i>.  I gave details of the roads and sanitary services expenditure under the plan in my contribution to last week's debate.  I would like, however, to take this opportunity to refer to private investment in toll roads as section 15 of the Bill provides substantial incentives for private or corporate investments in toll roads.  The section provides that capital expenditure incurred on the provision of a toll road, including all interest on moneys borrowed to finance construction, can be written off in full against toll income from the project over a period of six years, that is 50 per cent in year one and 10 per cent in each of the succeeding five years.  This is a significant improvement on the existing legislation which provides for a capital allowance of 50 per cent only.</P>
    <P>This provision will benefit the toll bridge under construction by West Link Toll Bridge Limited and the relief will be available for all similar toll projects, including any toll franchises for other sections of the Dublin Ring Road which result from my Department's recent public invitations to the private sector to submit suitable proposals.  The increase in the tax reliefs for toll roads will help to attract the private sector investment of £50-£100 million referred to in the <i>National Development Plan</i>&mdash; this would of course be additional to the Government's own investment programme for national roads in the period up to 1993. Apart from the Dublin Ring Road, I have identified three other projects which have potential for private toll based investment. These are the Newbridge-Kilcullen By-Pass, the Lucan-Kilcock Road and the Cork Downstream Crossing.  The Government have provided the incentive and now it is time for the private sector to respond positively.  I am looking forward to a satisfactory response.</P>
    <P>Another section of the Bill provides for the introduction of a ten year driving licence.  In tandem with the introduction <Col N="2235" /> of the new European model driving licence later this year, I have agreed to introduce a ten year licence for persons under 60 in order to bring Ireland more into line with practice in Europe.  The ten year licence will cost £20, that is the equivalent of £2 per year.  The new arrangement will facilitate the public and reduce administrative costs.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that a three year licence will continue to be available at the present rate of £12 or £4 per year. Furthermore, this change in the law will not affect the position of persons over 70 years, who can still obtain a one year licence for £4 if they cannot get a certificate of fitness to drive for a period greater than one year.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the construction industry, I would like to refer to mortgage interest relief.  This Government's firm resolve to break the cycle of increased Government borrowing and increased taxation showed results earlier than many economic commentators would have thought possible.  As we reduce Government borrowing and the size of the tax take from the economy we leave room for real economic growth.  For many years the burden of income tax increased year in year our and for ordinary households the most effective way of reducing this burden was through tax relief on mortgage interest.  The mortgage interest relief is by far the biggest element of Government support for the private housing sector.  It costs over £165 million a year in revenue foregone and has become a significant factor in the income tax structure.</P>
    <P>Now that the Government are reducing income tax we can also move to reduce the reliefs which people previously had to avail of in order to manage their income tax affairs to their own best advantage.  Obviously the complete elimination of mortgage interest relief would represent a serious blow to many households. However, the combination of low mortgage interest rates, the lowest in fact for 20 years, and the income tax reliefs announced in the budget provide scope <Col N="2236" /> for a further reduction in mortage interest relief.</P>
    <P>The reduction from 90 per cent to 80 per cent in section 5 of the Bill of the proportion of interest on which tax relief is allowed will help to counteract inflationary pressures on house prices which, if unchecked, could have implications for the wider economy and ultimately push up interest rates.  I am satisfied that this change will not have an adverse effect on the recovery in the overall private housing market and, indeed, that it could have beneficial results.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my contribution to the budget debate last January, I have been concerned about trends in house prices in certain areas which manifested themselves towards the end of last year and appear to have accelerated since then.  I am not talking here about the housing market in general and, indeed, there is still a plentiful supply of suitable starter type houses available at very reasonable prices.  My concern primarily relates to much publicised developments in certain segments of the market in the larger urban areas, such as Dublin, Galway and Cork.  Some of the prices recently reported for houses in these areas are startling and whether such price rises will be sustained is highly debatable.</P>
    <P>The reports of prices being paid for sites in some of these areas are even more startling and one would have to question whether indeed these prices would be viable by the time the houses are built. Both builders and their financiers would be well advised to bear this in mind.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the current house price inflation is to a very large extent being driven by trading up.  We must not forget that the underlying demographic picture does not lead one to believe that this can be sustained in the long term and in the overall there is no evidence that the supply of housing is or will be, in the foreseeable future, seriously out of line with demand.  However, my fear at this stage is that these trends would spread throughout the housing market with serious consequences for families looking for first time houses or that they would <Col N="2237" /> promote an inflationary psychology in the economy at large.</P>
    <P>The mortgage market as it has developed over the past two years has many welcome features: it has provided an adequate supply of mortgage funds at reasonable cost and has featured for the first time a healthy degree of competition between different lenders.  However, there is danger that this competition can be carried to extremes and there is some evidence that it is a major factor in the bidding up of the price of certain types of existing property.  Such cutthroat competition may well in the long term be to the detriment of lenders and borrowers alike and could undermine the development of an orderly mortgage market in the future.  A noticeable feature of the present situation is the &ldquo;hard selling&rdquo; of endowment type mortgages.  Indiscriminate selling of this type of mortgage product frequently involves overstating the potential benefits and does not have sufficient regard to the suitability of these products for individual house purchasers.</P>
    <P>I also have to say that certain vested interests have been engaged in what looks like deliberate hyping of the housing market and up beat reports of individual house sales have added a dimension of unreality in the whole area.</P>
    <P>Certain of the tax changes announced in the budget and now included in this Bill, for example, the curtailment of mortgage interest relief and the reduction in the relief on insurance premiums and endowment mortgages, were aimed in part at dampening down inflationary trends in the housing area.  It is to be hoped that these changes which are now coming into effect, will act as a moderating influence.  I am continuing to keep the overall position under active review. However, I would take this opportunity to ask all lending agencies to adopt a more restrained approach with a view to ensuring the long term stability of the mortgage and housing markets.</P>
    <P>Section 58 of the Bill grants stamp duty exemption on property being acquired by the Custom House Docks Development Authority.  The Authority already enjoy exemption from stamp duty where it <Col N="2238" /> acquires land from another statutory body by transfer order under the Urban Renewal Act, 1987.  This exemption did not, however, apply where the land to be acquired was not owned by a statutory body.</P>
    <P>The Authority are now acting as development agent on behalf of the Minister for Education for the National Sports Centre which involves acquiring land, some of it from non-statutory bodies.  As the Authority are acting for the Minister for Education, it is appropriate that they should be exempt from stamp duty. However, the present amendment does not extend stamp duty exemptions to the disposal of land by the Authority.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in section 16 and 23 of the Bill which will assist in the development of the International Financial Services Centre at the Custom House Docks site.  Section 16 introduces a new basis for taxing collective investment undertakings such as unit trusts and any other such undertaking which may be set up in the State.  It will bring the Irish taxation treatment of collective investment undertakings into line with that prevailing in the majority of the member states of the Community.  Non-resident investors will be free from the withholding tax provisions.  Section 23 benefits a company in the International Financial Services Centre holding shares on behalf of non-resident investors.</P>
    <P>The urban renewal scheme, apart from the Custom House Docks Development, which is designed to encourage private investment in selected locations, continues to gather momentum and has proved a marked success in many of the centres designated under the scheme. The scheme has prompted developments which would not otherwise take place in particular areas.  In Dublin, for example, there were no new developments along the quays between 1975 and 1986.  Since the introduction of the scheme development of the order of £30 million to £40 million is now nearing completion, in progress or about to start along the quays. Considerable progress has also been made of the designated areas in provincial towns and cities. <Col N="2239" /> Section 59 of the Bill provides stamp duty exemption for instruments which secure the advancement of moneys by the Housing Finance Agency to local authorities.  Since late 1986 the Housing Finance agency have advanced funds to housing authorities to enable them to make house purchase loans.  These funds are advanced on foot of agreements between the agency and individual local authorities.  Section 59 exempts these agreements from stamp duty.</P>
    <P>A clean, unpolluted environment is vital for our future economic development. Care for the environment is an insurance policy which will underwrite our economic development as well as providing a pay-off in terms of a greatly improved quality of life.</P>
    <P>The powers of local authorities in the area of environmental control have been or are being strengthened in recent years. Comprehensive legislation is in place for the effective control of air pollution and waste disposal.  There are proposals before the Oireachtas to amend and improve the legislation relating to water pollution, dereliction an restrictions on the payment of compensation under the planning and development code.  We have participated in many international agreements designed to protect the ozone layer and to control emissions which give rise to transboundary pollution of the atmosphere and the marine environment.</P>
    <P>The importance of a quality environment for sustained economic growth, particularly in the tourism, agricultural, horticultural, acquaculture and recreational sectors, is fully recognised in the <i>National Development Plan</i> prepared recently in the context of the European Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>The January budget provided additional resources for expenditure on environmental projects such as environmental works at selective beaches, urban improvement works in designated areas, waste recycling grants and an excise concession for use of unleaded petrol.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2240" /> My Department are conducting a campaign to promote the wider use and availability of unleaded petrol in the interests of public health and a cleaner environment. The oil companies and the motor trade are playing their part in expanding the network of outlets retailing unleaded.  We must get the lead out of petrol because it is poisonous and, at certain concentrations in the blood, has been found to be injurious to health, especially the health of young children. Up to 90 per cent of atmospheric lead pollution in areas of heavy traffic is attributable to vehicle exhausts emissions. But despite the health effects and the publicity campaigns, sales of unleaded are still less than 1 per cent of total petrol sales.</P>
    <P>Section 36 of the Bill provides for the further excise duty concession announced in the 1989 budget &mdash; this will enable unleaded to retail at five pence less per gallon than the top grades of leaded petrol.  This favourable price differential, combined with the availability of unleaded petrol at more than 200 outlets, should greatly assist the promotional efforts of my Department and encourage more motorists to change over to unleaded. Remember, unleaded is not only environmentally-friendly, it is good economic sense.</P>
    <P>Apart from the normal annual budgetary process of which this Finance Bill is an important part, there are other developments taking place which are of major significance to the economy's performance. I refer in particular to the national development plan submitted to the European Commission in March with the objectives of remedying the severe structural deficiencies in the Irish economy. These deficiencies restrict our economic efficiency and competitiveness and hinder the process of achieving our full potential for faster economic growth and social progress.  We must develop the skills of our people, our natural resources, our capacity to master the technologies of modern industry and, most importantly, improve marketing abilities to sell our products and services in world markets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2241" /> The plan is not just a set of spending programmes.  It is a comprehensive, integrated national plan covering every region and into which each economic sector is linked.  It sets the agenda for economic and social activity over the next five years.  It provides opportunities for individuals, local communities, co-operatives and corporations to promote worthwhile, viable projects at local and regional level.  At national level it will involve all the State agencies, the EC Commission and the private sector nationally and internationally.  All in all it should usher in a period of major economic expansion in our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister for the Environment.  Let me say while he is in the House that there is a major problem in his Department in that we are not building too many local authority houses these days.  I have seen and heard him say on many occasions that we have these empty houses in Dublin and so on for which there are no tenants.  I assure him that in County Wexford anyway we have over 900 applicants for rehousing.  I hope that, while he is attending to so many different matters in relation to his responsibilities as Minister for the Environment as he has outlined in his speech, he will attend to that area and particularly the needs of Enniscorthy.</P>
      <P>I wish to plead especially on behalf of the disabled.  We pay much lip service to those who are not in their full health and those who have not the ability to get around like the rest of us.  Therefore, I would like to single out three areas in relation to this Finance Bill which need special attention.  The first is an area in which the Minister has promised a Committee Stage amendment, and I would like to put forward what my party's amendment will be, why and the detailed wording involved.  That relates to disabled drivers and car tax relief for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I would like to deal with the appalling situation whereby lifesaving hospital equipment is subject to VAT. The third area in relation to the health field I would like to deal with is the way <Col N="2242" /> we give no proper consideration or regard to the 70,000 carers who are minding chronically infirm or ill people who happen to be their relatives in the home setting at far less cost than the State would incur in any residential setting.</P>
    <P>The area of disabled drivers has been one of some controversy in recent years. In last year's budget the Minister for Finance promised to abolish disabled drivers car tax relief and replace it by a scheme the health boards would operate. Between the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance and the publication of the Finance Bill it was found, in conjunction with the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disabled Drivers' Association, that it was not possible to reach agreement and the present scheme stayed in operation.  The present legislation relating to this car tax relief dates back to 1968 when the present Taoiseach was Minister for Finance.  It is important that we try to ensure that people with disabilities are given every opportunity to overcome their handicap so they can live full lives in terms of employment and mobility and the resultant independence that gives them.  For them to achieve those goals &mdash; fairly standard, normal goals that able people take for granted &mdash; they have a certain cost problem.  It can cost up to £7,000 or £8,000 to convert a car to be driven by a disabled driver. Therefore, the way we treat this issue is an indication of our respect for the disabled.  We must have real action instead of mere lip service in dealing with the cost impediments in this regard.  My party will be proposing that section 43 of the 1968 Finance Act should be amended by the deletion of subsection (1) and the substitution of the following words for that section:</P>
    <P>Where a person shows to the satisfaction of the licensing authority that he is unable or virtually unable to walk due to permanent impairment of one or both of the lower limbs in consequence of injury, disease or defect, the duty imposed by section 1 of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act, 1952 shall not be levied in respect <Col N="2243" /> of a vehicle specially constructed or adapted for use by the person or used by him either as a driver or passenger.</P>
    <P>That involves two very significant changes. We have the appalling position that the existing 1968 Finance Act states that in order to qualify for the car tax relief the disabled driver has to be &ldquo;without the use of each of his legs&rdquo;.  That means that if he has one normal leg and one prosthesis or no second leg he is considered to be able.  That is patently unjust.  It was most unfortunate that it took the highlighting of an individual case through the media to bring this home to the public and to the Government.  Mr. Gerry O'Brien, whose case is now well publicised, was being refused car tax relief by the former Minister for Finance, Mr. MacSharry, and by the present Minister for Finance.  Not only has he just one normal leg but he has no upper limbs &mdash; no upper arms whatsoever.  It is a congenital deformity from birth.  I have received many letters from people in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Brien is a secondary school teacher and in 1988 he purchased a car at a cost of £13,500.  It cost a further £7,000 sterling to convert the car for his use.  Disabled people must have automatic cars because in some cases they have no hands to change the gears.  Secondly they have to work the ignition and so on with their one good foot.  Gerry O'Brien has to steer the car with a shoulder pad with special electronic controls. Having been a passenger with him I am amazed at his ability.  It is something we should all admire greatly.  He had to borrow £21,000 in total to get his car on the road, in the expectation that he would get a VAT and excise duty refund.  Further to the highlighting of the case the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance were involved and Mr. Gerry O'Brien was very pleased, further to phone calls from the Taoiseach and so on, that he was to get his just deserts and would be able to repay the bank.  Yesterday I had a Dáil question down about his case inquiring if the money would be paid and <Col N="2244" /> unfortunately it still transpires, despite all the publicity, the good will and the sentimentality, that this man will not be able to put his car back on the road due to the heartlessness of the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It was stated yesterday that the question of a refund of excise duty in the case in question will be sympathetically reviewed in the context of any resulting amendment to the disabled drivers' scheme.  I have no doubt that there is no intention in the legislation to make it retrospective as regards disabled drivers. I have yet to hear from the Minister that it will be retrospective.  By any definition this man is disabled and should be paid his money.  The way this case has been conducted is disgraceful.  People are congratulating him in the street on having got his money but he still cannot drive the car.  He told me this morning on the telephone that he has been advised by a solicitor that under a particular statutory instrument the Minister has the power to grant relief.  There have been complaints from the Disabled Drivers' Association regarding abuses of the car tax relief scheme that in some cases it was the decisions of the Minister for Finance of the day overturning decisions of the Revenue Commissioners which allowed such abuse to take place.  I would appeal to the mandarins in the Department of Finance and to all concerned to issue a refund to Mr. O'Brien.  It is a disgraceful situation.</P>
    <P>The first amendment we will be proposing is the deletion of the reference to each of the legs and the substitution of the term &ldquo;unable to walk or virtually unable to walk&rdquo;.  This whole area is difficult. It is not a simple matter of drawing up a form of words which will deal with every situation.  I have put forward this choice of words because they are taken directly from the scheme which operates in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland and I should like to put on record what the term &ldquo;unable to walk or virtually unable to walk&rdquo; means in Northern Ireland.  First, a person must be likely to continue to meet the medical conditions <Col N="2245" /> for at least one year.  In other words, that person would not be likely to improve within a year and annual certification would be required.  Secondly, the person must be able to make use of the benefit of going out from time to time.  A person can be treated as virtually unable to walk if the effort needed to walk would endanger life or would be likely to lead to a serious deterioration of health.  The following factors are taken into account in dealing with whether a person is accounted virtually unable to walk &mdash; either the distance, the speed, the length of time or the manner in which a person can walk without severe discomfort. They have no difficulties in the the United Kingdom or Northern Ireland in determining what is severe discomfort.  It would include pain and breathlessness. There are special difficulties for mentally handicapped people in deciding what is meant by severe discomfort so there is a further definition under that heading in terms of the operating guidelines.  What is an artificial aid?  It would, for example, be a caliper, orthopaedic shoes or an artifical limb such as prosthesis.  Ability to walk would take into account those walking aids.  If somebody was able to walk only when the prosthesis was fitted he would still qualify.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy kindly elaborate on the source of the document from which he is quoting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  These are the regulations in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland covering their interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;unable to walk or virtually unable to walk&rdquo;.  It is an extract from the terms of the mobility allowance scheme of Northern Ireland administered by the Department of Health and Social Security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second amendment I am proposing relates to a person who is so severely disabled that he cannot drive at all and has to be a passenger.  I have seen a particular car, a Datsun Patrol, where the whole back opens up and the person gets in by electronic wheelchair.  It is like <Col N="2246" /> a livestock vehicle and it is then closed up at the back.  That requires quite extensive conversion.  In some areas there has been a lack of uniformity in terms of the interpretation by the licensing authority as to whether such people qualify.  We are proposing to delete the words &ldquo;as driver&rdquo; in the last part of section 43 of the 1968 Finance Act to ensure that there is no ambiguity in that area.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said he will consider looking at other amendments from Opposition parties in relation to disabled drivers.  As it is likely that this area will not be reviewed again for some time once this year's Finance Bill is enacted, perhaps the Minister would also take this opportunity to look at the position of people who are clearly disabled in relation to their upper limbs, for example, amputees who cannot steer properly or change gear.  There should be some mention in the Minister's amendment of the permanent impairment of the upper limbs.</P>
    <P>Similarly there is the case of an individual who is a dwarf and who has been in touch with me.  Having applied for exemption from VAT and excise duty he was refused because he had all his limbs even though they are only a fraction of the size of what we would consider a normal limb for an adult.  This person's limbs were so small that he was unable to drive.</P>
    <P>I would hope for a reasonable, humane, Christian interpretation of these regulations because I have come across the most appalling cases.  Yet again the Minister for Finance pushed the whole question out into the future instead of saying that it is clearly unfair that a man with no arms and only one leg should be considered as anything but disabled. We are not just talking about car tax reliefs but about the whole question of facilities for disabled drivers, such as special parking berths, special concessions from B &amp; I, Sea Link and other travel arrangements.  All these things are related to the definition of disabled drivers as laid down under the Finance Act. There is a lot more at issue than the pure <Col N="2247" /> tax case.  It is a question of allowing these people to have full independence.</P>
    <P>In relation to abuses the whole difficulty so far as the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners are concerned is that people are driving huge Mercedes, Jaguars and Rolls Royces under this scheme, and it is an abuse.  If the Department feel there is an abuse they should limit the scheme to cars up to 2000 cc.  That would cut out any nonsense.  Disabled people need a car of a certain size because of the need for automatic drive.  We are only talking about 450 people here so far.  We are not talking about thousands of people or opening flood gates.  We are talking about a little bit of compassion, a little bit of respect for the disabled to allow them the same opportunity to compete with able bodied people.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister's sentiment and goodwill will be turned into action to the extent that this week his Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, will ask him to consider issuing to the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners this excise duty refund so that Mr. O'Brien can get his car back on the road in line with the commitment publicly given &mdash; he had people ringing him up from the <i>Evening Herald</i> and <i>The Evening Press</i> congratulating him on having been awarded this money.  Yesterday after Dáil questions he still will not be paid this excise duty refund at this stage and this is very unfair.</P>
    <P>In recent months I have visited a large number of acute general hospitals.  I have, for some time, been aware of the costly nature of equipment for hospitals. In some cases we are talking about very important equipment that is vital in terms of diagnostics and treatment and, in relation to many illnesses, the earlier the diagnosis the better the chance of a full recovery.  I have in mind diagnostic equipment such as CAT scanners which are very expensive, and mammography equipment for the scrutiny and treatment of breast cancer.  It has come to my attention that a significant proportion of the equipment in our general hospitals was <Col N="2248" /> provided as a result of voluntary fund raising activity on the part of, for example, the Lions Club, the Rotary Club, the Chamber of Commerce and other voluntary organisations.  I have met other people who are in the process of fund raising for such important equipment. There are also national organisations providing national facilities in the area of AIDS and so on.  Different funding has been set up to provide specialised equipment.  It is a real kick in the teeth to these people, to put it at its mildest, that the heartless people in the Department of Finance see fit to profit from the virtue of this voluntary work by charging 25 per cent VAT on this life saving equipment. It is disgraceful to profiteer in this way.  It is unbelievable.  We must remember, given that there is a public demand for this equipment and that everyone here wants the optimum level of health care, that this equipment would, sooner or later, have to be provided by the Health from their capital funding each year. What people are trying to do is expedite the process and provide services in their regions.  Invariably, indeed exclusively, these are for public patients.  They are not for the Mater Private Clinic or the Blackrock Clinic.  This fund raising is for public patients in public facilities and therefore is of benefit to all taxpayers in the wider community.  The piece of equipment that brought it to my mind in the first instance was mammography equipment in Ennis General Hospital which was brought as a result of local fund raising, and on which 25 per cent VAT had to be paid.  I am aware of another case in relation to Galway Regional Hospital where some years ago there was a difficulty in relation to a CAT scanner and the subsequent difficulty of there not being adequate staff available to man the equipment.  I understand the need to control staffing and operational levels in hospitals.  Therefore I would propose to the Minister for Finance that he would give a discretionary VAT exemption for equipment provided it had the prior approval of the health board so that there would be no duplicating of facilities which <Col N="2249" /> are available in a hospital five or ten miles away.  That compromise would ensure that the present stifling of initiative on the part of voluntary organisations would cease and there would also be an incentive to people to get more involved in their health services and form a closer relationship with their hospitals.</P>
    <P>The third area I would like to deal with has a wider application than the two areas I have dealt with already and is at the core of something we will have to plan for here.  It relates primarily to the elderly. There are about 330,000 people here over the age of 65, about 11 per cent of our population.  With increasing life expectancy, which is a good thing, there will be more such elderly people.  With our high levels of emigration a higher proportion of our population will be in the elderly category.  Between now and the turn of the century there will be an increase of at least 7 per cent in our elderly population. It is important that we get our priorities right and have a clear policy for the care of the aged.  Hopefully we will all live long lives and be able to enjoy in the future the benefits of such a progressive policy.</P>
    <P>There are three categories of elderly persons: those who live alone in the community, those who require residential care and those who are minded in the family environment at home by relatives or friends.  Interestingly enough, of the elderly category only 4 per cent or 5 per cent are in residential care, long-stay geriatric care, psycho-geriatric care or private nursing homes.  Three and a half times that number are minded in the family setting, invariably by women, either daughters or daughters-in-law.</P>
    <P>The National Council for the Aged have carried out very extensive surveys into the needs of carers.  I will give a brief summary of some of the figures.  We are talking about 70,000 such carers in this country.  Fifty per cent of carers devote four to seven hours a day caring for the elderly person; 35 per cent spend more than seven hours a day; 53 per cent require to be on call 24 hours a day, always or almost always.  Over 50 per cent of carers help the elderly person in and <Col N="2250" /> out of bed.  Eighty-one per cent have responsibility for the administration and supervision of the elderly person's medication. Over 90 per cent prepare meals for the elderly person.  Sixty-five per cent of carers give some help in washing and bathing the elderly persons daily and tasks relating to toileting are carried out by 22 per cent of carers.</P>
    <P>Carers are very busy people.  If persons are incontinent and bed ridden it is a very large task for carers to mind them.  It must be pointed out that they do so at less than 10 per cent of the cost of residential care, which at minimum is about £250 a week.  That is good value and it is a good investment by the State to make sure that more people are minded in the family home.  Not only is it more cost effective to ensure that the elderly are minded at home but it is also much better for the elderly person because what they want is to live out their lives with dignity and independence.</P>
    <P>When we look at the problems of carers we see, from studies carried out by the National Council for the Aged, that 35 per cent of carers experience financial strain all or some of the time as a result of loss of income in giving up work and the extra cost incurred through caring; 71 per cent of carers feel confined all or some of the time; 58 per cent believe caring places constraints on their social lives and 57 per cent feel overwhelmed by caring some or all of the time.  Carers cannot get unemployment benefit because they are not available for work and they cannot get disability benefit because they have to be in the full of their health and they cannot be incapacitated.</P>
    <P>What is to be done with these 70,000 persons?  They are to be left languishing with the prescribed relative's allowance. That allowance is the most rigid and mean scheme operated by any State Department in this country.  It gives about £27 or £28 to carers provided they do not claim any social welfare, provided they have no outside income, provided they have no employment and, believe it or not, given that most of them are women, provided they are not adult dependants. <Col N="2251" /> In other words, if you happen to be married and are providing this care, if you are typically a daughter-in-law, you will get nothing from the State in recognition of the hours, days and nights of valuable service you provide in minding elderly persons.</P>
    <P>When reflecting on this matter and developing a policy on care of the aged one of the things we have to recognise is that there has been and still is a tax free allowance for persons who mind dependent relatives who require constant care and attention and who are incapacitated. I remember when we were in Government, over four long years on those benches&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not long enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;every year we had the ritual of Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, the present beleagured Minister for Agriculture, coming into this House and proposing Committee Stage amendments to the Finance Bill to increase the allowance for the minding of such incapacitated persons and such old folk as I am referring to.  Yet since this Government have taken up office they have done absolutely nothing in this area to assist these people.</P>
      <P>I would call on the Minister for Finance seriously to consider putting in place some meaningful tax credit or tax allowance to ensure that more elderly persons are not pushed into nursing homes, seeking long-stay geriatric beds.  What is most important is that within a fortnight of their being in a geriatric institution they become totally dependent and want to know what time their meals will arrive on a tray.  The secret to longer life expectancy is to ensure proper rehabilitation and that elderly persons live out their lives to the full level of activity.  I do not believe that the excellent budgetary submission made by the National Council for the Aged has been given adequate hearing.  I very much regret that because it advocates an investment in the real community and a structure that we need, namely, the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise there is a limited time for this <Col N="2252" /> debate and I do not wish to delay the House but, in conclusion, I wish to repeat my three appeals to the Minister for Finance. First, in relation to disabled drivers, I would ask him to accept the Fine Gael amendment to change the farcical position whereby someone has to have both legs abnormal in order to get the concession and also that &ldquo;unable to walk&rdquo; or &ldquo;virtually unable to walk&rdquo; would be taken as a definition.  I would ask him to consider some amendment to cover the upper limbs, where people have no arms, where they are hand amputees or where they are dwarfs.</P>
    <P>The second area of concern is where a health board or the Department of Health give prior approval for voluntary fund raising for vital medical equipment in hospitals, life-saving equipment and vital diagnostic equipment, the people concerned should not be penalised and given a kick in the teeth with 25 per cent VAT on the money they raise.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I would ask the Minister to provide a realistic tax free allowance for taxpayers, not to speak of a change in terms of a proper social welfare allowance for carers, that would ensure that there is no financial disincentive to minding elderly relatives at home.  It must be remembered in the latter context that a good deal of medical expenditure in relation to bills from nursing homes is tax allowable and therefore the tax system gives an incentive to push elderly relatives into institutional care rather than to mind them in the home.</P>
    <P>I hope the sentimentality and the lip service of the Minister for Finance towards the disabled will be put into concrete action and that there will be some proper results from the enactment of this Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I want to take this opportunity on Second Stage of the Finance Bill, 1989, to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, on his promotion to the position of Minister for Finance. Deputy Reynolds served with distinction in a number of ministries and his promotion to what is generally recognised as the senior ministry in Government was <Col N="2253" /> well merited.  My view is that, because of the economic circumstances prevailing at present, the Department of Finance will present Deputy Reynolds with his greatest challenge to date.  Personally I have no doubt about his capacity and ability to fulfil that role with his usual distinction and effectively to deal with the challenges with which he will be presented.  It is in the interests of all of us and of the country as a whole that he should succeed.</P>
      <P>I want to comment very briefly on the last point made by Deputy Yates.  The arguments he made are familiar to me because, as well as Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, on several occasions during Committee Stage debates on various Finance Bills between 1982 and 1987, I looked for the particular relief for dependent relatives that Deputy Yates has just adverted to.  What Deputy Yates did not give us was the response we got from the then Minister for Finance.  I recall addressing my plea to Deputy Dukes when he was Minister for Finance. Deputy Bruton was appointed to that position later and he did not have an opportunity of presenting a budget. Deputy Yates did not advert to the fact that Deputy Dukes greeted our pleas with derision and contempt.  We made those pleas at a time when taxation was higher than it is now and rising.  Taxation now is lower than it was then and is falling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Minister for Social Welfare during the debate on Committee Stage of the Social Welfare Bill provided a mechanism whereby the prescribed relative's allowance could be paid directly to the person looking after the prescribed relative rather than paying that allowance to the elderly relative.  The carer up to now had to depend on the elderly relative paying over the allowance. I agree with Deputy Yates that institutional care for elderly relatives has proved very expensive.  There are many social reasons why people should be encouraged to look after their elderly relatives at home.  The vast majority of elderly persons who are in institutions would prefer to live out their last years in the comfort and security of their own <Col N="2254" /> home or the home of a son or daughter. That is a major social problem to which the Government will give attention in the years ahead as the economy improves. Any politician who is active in constituency work will be conscious of that problem.  Those who have any type of interest in humanity will be aware of it.</P>
    <P>If elderly relatives were being cared for at home rather than in institutions there would be a great saving to the Exchequer. However, during the transition period economic difficulties could arise.  There could be an increase in the net cost to the State during that period and that would present difficulties.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some of the sections of the Bill because of a tendency that has developed in the House since I was first elected.  Debate on Committee Stage is limited and Deputies from all sides tend to give all the available time to the first ten or 11 sections.  They repeat the same arguments over and over again on those sections while the important sections tucked away at the back of the Finance Bill are not debated.</P>

      <P>Some of those sections have a profound impact on the lives of ordinary citizens but they go through on the nod.  We never get an opportunity to tease out the details of them.  The Revenue Commissioners can draft them as they wish in the hope, or in the knowledge, that they will be at the back of the Bill and are unlikely to be debated.  I deplore that tendency and I hope to get round it this year by referring in detail to some of the later sections in the course of my Second Stage speech.  I hope the Minister will reply to the points I will raise on those sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is strange that the debate on the budget is allowed to drag on for weeks when the provisions in it have taken effect.  There is little that can be done about them after budget day but some of the technical sections in Finance Bills, which get down to the nitty gritty of how revenue laws will operate, are never debated at any length.  Section 1, which <Col N="2255" /> has been welcomed by all sides of the House, deals with the general exemption and age exemption limits.  Under it the general exemption limits are being increased by a little more than 9 per cent. We may have arguments across the floor of the House about what the rate of inflation for the full tax year will be but I think all sides will agree that 9 per cent is more than three times what the rate of inflation was when the Minister introduced his budget.  In my view it will be far off what the rate of inflation will be for the income tax year 1989-90.</P>
    <P>The exemption limits for those between the ages of 65 to 75 and for those of 75 years and over have been increased by more than 5 per cent.  That will prove to be an increase in real terms because it will not be caught up by inflation.  It is in the interests of us all that that should be the case.  I welcome the provision which allows an exemption of £200 for each dependent child.  The argument has been advanced by another Deputy that marginal relief will not apply in those cases. It is clear from the wording of the section that such relief will apply.  In the basic legislation marginal relief applies above the specified income and it is clear that the specified income in the case of a person claiming the exemption limit, plus £200 for each child, will be his income plus £200 for each child.  It is crystal clear from this section that marginal relief will continue to operate.</P>
    <P>I welcome a practice adopted by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to marginal relief.  They are now inclined to adopt the practice of giving a general exemption certificate of tax free allowances at the beginning of the tax year, provided they receive a return of income. They will make any adjustments that need to be made in the last month or two of the tax year.  Marginal relief is applied throughout the tax year rather than being given as a refund at the end of the tax year.  That is a favourable development and I congratulate the Revenue Commissioners on it.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with the tax bands and the rates of tax.  I welcome the reduction <Col N="2256" /> in the standard rate of income tax from 35 per cent to 32 per cent.  This is the first time in many years that the standard rate of tax has been reduced by a Minister for Finance.  The tax bands have been widened for those paying the standard rate and at the rate of 48 per cent, according to my calculations, by more than 7 per cent which is well ahead of the rate of inflation.  The net result is that the Government have now virtually achieved their target of bringing two-thirds of taxpayers on to the standard rate of income tax.  It should be remembered that we are now talking about a lower standard rate of tax.  Therefore, the target set by the Government for themselves two years ago, which we were told at the time could not be achieved, has been achieved in that short time and on a lower standard rate of taxation.</P>

      <P>In my contribution last evening I dealt with specific points, in the main, with shortcomings arising from Deputy John Bruton's Bill.  I made the general point that the Bill had set itself a very ambitious objective, being designed as an integrated set of legislative measures to prepare our economy for the Single European Market and that it had failed, in a spectacular fashion, to fulfil any of those objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said last evening, it strikes me that the Bill, rather than being an integrated, well thought-out or workable set of proposals, is rather a mish mash of proposals. I described it last evening as the product <Col N="2257" /> of a very fertile brain &mdash; I give Deputy Bruton credit for that &mdash; who found himself with an idle moment and a dictaphone in his possession.  I made the point that progress has been recorded in areas touched on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad.  Then the Deputy may address himself to some of the points I raised.  I made the point that progress has been recorded in areas touched on in the proposals, that the proposals in this Bill on education, so far as they go, have either been addressed or are being addressed.  This was more than amply illustrated last evening by the Minister for Education in her very thorough contribution.  No doubt the Deputy has also read that and will address the points she made then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested that the proposals in section 2 relating to the Central Bank, to say the least, were very questionable.  In his contribution on this Bill, the Minister for Finance questioned the wisdom of isolating a single objective in particular for the Central Bank.  I wholeheartedly endorse his questioning of that.  As the Central Bank is already charged with the control of credit to secure the general welfare of people as a whole, I wonder whether Deputy Bruton's proposals to not illustrate a blind spot in his perception <Col N="2258" /> of the appropriate role of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The provisions on physical planning would seem, on the surface, to have at least some superficial attractiveness.  I indicated last evening that I too feel a certain degree of frustration at the delays that can inevitably occur in the planning process.  I see some merit in speeding up the planning process, in particular when industrial development or job creation is involved.  However, as the Minister for the Environment pointed out in the course of his contribution, there is a balance to be struck here.  This balance seems to me to be missing from these proposals.  Nonetheless the proposals, in that they do engender discussions on this point, are welcome.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 7 seem entirely wrong-headed.  As we have already an Oireachtas Joint Committee on EC Legislation preparing further endless reports which will inevitably gather dust on the Library shelves, this does not seem to me to be a proposal with merit in it.  We are a great nation for producing reports.  Our biggest problem is that, while we generate endless reports, very seldom do we generate sufficient action on them.</P>
    <P>The consultation procedure, in the context of the plan which has just been submitted to the EC and under which senior Ministers and Secretaries have been put in direct contact with the Commissioners and Directors General in Brussels, seems to be a more valuable manner of expending time and energy than any of the proposals put forward in this regard by Deputy Bruton.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most wrong-headed aspect of the Bill is the set of provisions extending on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis the range of taxation incentives.  I know Deputy Bruton appreciates as well as the rest of us in this House that as hoc-ery has been the curse of our taxation system.  We have extended tax incentives over the years willy nilly, both at central and local government levels, when we operated the rates.  This has been the downfall of any national effort to broaden the tax base or create a reasonable tax base.  As I have said, these proposals seem to me to be <Col N="2259" /> wrong-headed and to constitute an additional degree of ad hoc-ery.  I do not believe that Deputy Bruton seriously believes they will solve any of the problems we face with regard to taxation.</P>
    <P>Had Deputy Bruton produced a realistic set of proposals he would have had a much greater measure of support from this side of the House.  The proposals in this Bill are not realistic.  They simply do not ring true.  Realistic policies have been proposed and are being implemented by the Government since assuming office in 1987.  There is a degree of recognition of the fact right across the nation.  There is even a degree of recognition and realisation that that is the case on the benches opposite.</P>
    <P>The economic recovery policy put in place by the Taoiseach and his Ministers has put this nation not alone on the road to recovery but has laid for us the real, sound foundations on which we can accelerate the national effort up to 1992.  The annual report of the European Commission recognises this realism and stresses the continuing importance of the process of budgetary adjustment which the Government have operated since assuming office.  It stresses the importance of the stabilisation of the debt/GDP ratio and the continuation of the stabilisation efforts.  It stresses the need for a continuing reduction in the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  Through these policies this Government have achieved a remarkable improvement in the public finances.  The debt/GDP ratio has been stabilised and borrowing much reduced. The fruits of these achievements are there to be seen.</P>
    <P>For example, we have now lower interest rates than our neighbours.  As I said in this House on a previous occasion, had anybody written in any examination, in any economics examination, in any institution in this country five years ago that we could have interest rates five or six percentage points below those in Britain, undoubtedly the student in question would have failed that examination because that would have been contrary to conventional wisdom.  Yet that has <Col N="2260" /> been achieved, the benefits are there and are very real.  We have lower levels of inflation and the Government are making very real efforts to battle with the external factors which would tend to raise the level of inflation.  In that the Government can demand and expect the support of all Members of this House.</P>
    <P>More importantly than those two features, there is a marked resurgence of national confidence.  The word &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; is much used to describe our economy at present; there is a real buzz there.  It is obvious a feeling of national self-confidence is being regenerated.  That is a far more realistic basis on which to face the rigours of 1992 than anything contained in this Bill.  An improvement in the rate of growth in our economy is there and is visible.</P>
    <P>Other issues remain to be addressed, for example, the plight of the unemployed and the dreadful haemorrhage of emigration.  In a nutshell, this Government have already achieved what previous Governments failed in a spectacular fashion to achieve.</P>
    <P>If we are to prepare ourselves for 1992 we can do so effectively only on the basis of realistic policies.  Those policies are in place.  The next step is the implementation of the proposals contained in the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i> recently published by the Government, which has been submitted to Brussels and which we have every indication has been accepted by Brussels; certainly it has been accepted with much more enthusiasm there than by the benches opposite.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton's proposals, by and large, are interesting debating points and that only; they go no further than being interesting debating points.  They are not in any sense imbued with the realism this nation needs at present.  For that reason it is my contention that they must fail.</P>
    <P>I see nothing in these proposals to commend them.  On that basis alone the discussion on them probably has gone far enough.  I have nothing further to say on them; they have little to commend them. I have no doubt that the House will not be supporting them.</P>

      <P>It gives me great pleasure to participate in this debate.  Deputy John Bruton deserves the congratulations of all of us in this House for raising a series of very important matters which need to be confronted in the context of providing an integrated set of legislative measures to prepare the economy for the Single European Act.  Indeed Deputy Bruton had remarkable foresight in that this Bill was brought before the House prior to the Government's so-called <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i>, being published. This Bill anticipated to a remarkable degree the omissions from that plan by the Government and their total failure to confront many issues of vital importance in the context of the Single European Market of which we will form a part after 1992.  It is my intention in addressing the Bill to deal specifically with some of the aspects which fall within the environmental area and in doing so to address some of the major difficulties we have with the plan.</P>
      <P>Section 12 of the Bill before the House provides for the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, to make a report to both Houses of the Oireachtas on or before 30 June next on the feasibility of establishing a number of regional development authorities covering the entire country to prepare, implement and monitor development plans for each region in the context of assistance being received for plans from the Structural Funds of the European Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>National Development Plan</i> as published does not contain any indication as to what mechanisms are going to be put in place within the seven designated regions to monitor the use of EC Structural Funds or to ensure that there is any democratic accountability for the manner in which funds are used and to assess during the lifetime of the plan whether specific economic or environmental objectives are being achieved.  The need to provide within each of the seven regions for an authority who can keep a watchdog brief over what is being done in this area, who can participate in democratic decision making and provide a forum for ongoing regional input over the <Col N="2262" /> four or five years of the plan is of vital necessity.  Fine Gael in their document on an economic accord for 1992 propose the establishment of seven regional development authorities and also seek to confer on local authorities an annual role in monitoring the effective implementation of EC structural programmes within their own areas.</P>
    <P>It appears from the plan that the Government do not intend to allow a regional monitoring system to come into place.  They established seven working and advisory groups to prepare operational programmes for the seven designated regions and indeed the plan purports, at the back of it, to set out plans for each of the seven regions.  What we discovered from other sources during the course of last week's debate in this House on the EC structural programme is that the seven designated regional programmes contained in the <i>National Development Plan</i> do not reflect final reports and recommendations made by the seven regional working or advisory groups.  It has become quite clear that the Government have, in the way they have dealt with the <i>National Development Plan</i> which they have submitted to Brussels, made a mockery of local democracy. Having set up seven regional working parties and advisory groups it emerged last week that not a single one of those working groups had submitted a final report to Government before the <i>National Development Plan</i> was sent to Brussels.  Five working groups submitted final reports a week or two after the Government sent the plan to Brussels. We were told in a written reply from the Minister for Finance in the Dáil last Wednesday that two working groups had still not submitted a final report.</P>
    <P>In the context of what is happening in the Dublin region there is even more extraordinary confusion.  Last August the Government appointed consultants to prepare a report on the Dublin region. This report was commissioned at an expense of £300,000 to the taxpayer and was to be completed by 31 December 1988.  At the end of January the Minister for Finance advised the Dáil that the <Col N="2263" /> Dublin report would be completed in early March.  Last Wednesday the Minister for Finance stated that the Dublin report would not be completed until later this month.  On Thursday in this House the Taoiseach seriously misled the Dáil by stating that the Dublin consultants had not yet reported, that their report had not been commissioned by the Government but by the Dublin local authorities and implied that the Dublin local authorities were at fault for the delay in the completion of the report.  On Tuesday this week I invited the Taoiseach to correct the record of the House on the basis that he was mistaken when he made that statement on the Order of Business in the Dáil last Thursday.  The Taoiseach declined to respond.  On Friday of last week, the last day of the debate in this House on the Structural Fund, proposals the Government have submitted to Brussels, <i>The Irish Times</i> published what it stated to be the final version of the Dublin consultants' report.  <i>The Irish Times</i> stated that that report had now gone to Brussels. The Department of Finance issued a statement last Friday evening saying that the Dublin consultants' report was not finalised and had not gone to Brussels.</P>
    <P>I do not think, in the context of the speakers who have spoken in this debate on Deputy Bruton's Economic Development Bill both yesterday and this evening, that Government Deputies should be patting themselves on the back for the manner in which the Government are dealing with the whole question of 1992 and their submissions on the <i>National Development Plan</i>.  In the context of each of the seven regions, I call on the Government to publish the final reports submitted by the regional and advisory groups so that in the next few weeks we can truly have a very real assessment and considered and informed debate as to what should form part and parcel of the regional programmes.</P>
    <P>I call on the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to clarify the position with regard to the Dublin plan.  Does the publication in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Friday accurately reflect the final report of what <Col N="2264" /> is proposed for the Dublin region?  If it does reflect what is finally proposed for the Dublin region why is it that in a whole series of areas it seriously digresses from what is purported to be the plan for the Dublin region as contained in the <i>National Development Plan?</i>.  Has the consultants' report not been published because the Taoiseach's Department have put the consultants for the Dublin region under pressure to amend their draft of the final plan which was published in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Friday so that their recommendations will now coincide with what is in the <i>National Development Plan?</i>?  Are these consultants being forced to reassess their independent view of what is required to ensure that regional funds are used to the maximum possible benefit for the Dublin region?  Are they being required to change their plan to conform to the Department of Finance view as to what is required?</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment in his contribution this evening on a matter which is of relevance to the development of Dublin, the budget debate, made reference in that debate to the Custom House Docks Development Authority. He referred to the fact that the Authority are now acting as development agent on behalf of the Minister for Education for the national sports centre which involves acquiring land, some of it from non-statutory bodies, on the Customs House Docks site.  It appears that as we stand today in this House the Government are still proceeding with plans to provide a national sports centre on the Customs House Docks site despite the fact that the Dublin consultants' final report, as published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 14 April 1989, said that the proposed national indoor sports stadium for Dublin's dockland was economically unviable and should not be included in the plan submitted to Brussels.</P>
    <P>Are the Government proceeding with this national sports centre?  Are the consultants' views being taken seriously or not?  Will the consultants' report be published? Will the Dublin local authorities, democratically elected to represent the people of Dublin, have sight of that <Col N="2265" /> report?  Will Members of this House have sight of that report and sub-regional group reports, to assess whether the plan that has gone to Brussels meets the needs of the individual regions, as they are viewed by the people who live within those regions, and as they have been prepared in consultation with local communities in those regions?</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that this Government do not wish their plans to be under scrutiny, that they have ignored a great deal of work being done by many individuals with great expertise in the seven designated regions.  They appear to be intent on wasting the taxpayers' money on a Dublin consultants' report which they are now choosing either to ignore or to force the consultants to reconstruct.  If at this stage this Government have made a proposal to Brussels in this way, I do not believe they can be trusted over the next four years to apply EC Regional Funds. That is why we need the type of regional development authorities that are provided for in section 12 of Deputy Bruton's Bill.</P>
    <P>If the Government vote against that proposal they are voting against democracy, they are voting against accountability and they are voting against placing themselves under the glare of public monitoring to ensure that the plan and the objectives as set out are properly operating.  If the Government truly believe that the plan as submitted to Brussels is going to work, if they truly believe that the objectives as laid out in that plan &mdash; limited as they are &mdash; can be achieved, they should not be afraid of the spotlight of accountability.  They should welcome it because, if they get it right, it would enable them to look for whatever limited applause should be offered by the general public for the fairly limited objectives they have set themselves and, at least, they would be able to say they have achieved those objectives.</P>
    <P>This plan envisages covering up what the Government are at and is designed to undermine what is left of local democracy within the various regions throughout the country.  I have talked to many of those who have been involved in some of the <Col N="2266" /> regional groupings and I know how frustrated and annoyed they feel at the manner in which they have been treated. It is appalling that the Government should apparently intend to deal with this plan as if it is some secret service document that endangers the security of the State.  There is a need for regional accountability and there is a need for accountability to the Oireachtas.  That is why there is a need to establish the type of special committee that this Bill envisages as an ongoing committee, to involve itself in assessing progress being made on a national level with structural funds.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the fact that we already have a Oireachtas Joint Committee on EC legislation, but it has a formal role simply to look at EC regulations and directives sent out from Brussels and to assess their general implications. The committee have no major role in the area of the economy; they have no major role to assess whether EC funding is being properly spent; they have no major role to determine whether the use of EC funds is contributing to the creation of new jobs; and they have no role to perform to ascertain whether major new infrastructural developments will improve overall the state of our economy and reduce, for example, transport costs.  They have no function in any of those areas.</P>
    <P>We should have in this House the type of committee this Bill provides for.  We should be able to approach 1992 not in the context of the old party political rows where one side of the House deliberately throws up some vague allegations against the other side in the hope of getting a headline in the following morning's newspapers. We should be able in a committee form to sit down and look at the economic impact of the proposals we are implementing under the Structural Fund, to assess whether objectives are being achieved and to agree, across tables, the changes that are necessary as we go through the four years to ensure that our economy benefits to the maximum possible extent from the Single European Market.</P>
    <P>The Government should not run scared <Col N="2267" /> of that exercise.  They should welcome that exercise.  They should welcome it in the context of ensuring that this Parliament are working together to get the bases right for this country benefiting to the maximum possible extent from the Single European Market, but the Government do not want to deal with matters that way.  They want to keep their cards close to their chest.  They do not want to disclose to Members of this House, or to the general public, their intentions and they want to try to place themselves in a position where they can hype up their achievements and give them a credibility they may not deserve.</P>
    <P>We are told there is no need for a committee of this nature.  One of the functions such a committee could perform is to look at whether the manner in which the Government have allocated domestic capital expenditure, in the context of the <i>National Development Plan,</i> will ensure that we gain to maximum possible extent from the moneys available under EC Structural Funding.  The sectoral analysis of the plan acknowledges that the most significant reason for high Irish transport costs is the deficient state of national roads and access roads to the principal ports and airports.  If we had a proper road system it has been estimated by the Confederation of Irish Industry that in the region of £300 million a year could be lopped off the transport bill Irish industrialists currently have to pay.</P>
    <P>We heard the Minister for the Environment constantly talking about the need for additional funding for road infrastructure. It is my contention that a Dáil committee, as proposed in this Bill, could get the figures right and correct the mistakes the Government have made.  In the plan the Government state that in order to bring our national road network up to European standards an investment of £3.27 billion is required.  Over the five year period 1989 to 1993 the plan provides for an expenditure of only £755 million for the national road network, that is, only 23 per cent of the needs will be met by the end of the Government's <Col N="2268" /> projected programme.  It is clear that on the basis of the Government's own figures, major road infrastructural improvements required to enable us to compete on equal terms in the Single European Market, will not be completed this side of the year 2000 and, indeed, may not be completed this side of the year 2020.</P>
    <P>An essential prerequisite to obtaining Community funding is the principle of additionality, that is, that funds coming from Europe cannot be used as a substitute for domestic capital expenditure. It appears from the detail of the roads programme that the Government may have considerable difficulties with the European Commission in the context of the inadequate provision made for roads. Whereas the State's own contribution to national roads from capital expenditure will be £76.2 million in 1989, under the terms of the plan, in the year 1990 it reduces to £39.4 million, in 1991 it will be £40 million, in 1992 it will be £43.9 million and in 1993 it will be £49.2 million. In other words, in each of the years it is projected that increased sums for road building will come from the European Regional Development Fund. Having regard to the reduced national contribution for national roads for the years 1990 and onwards, considerable doubts must arise as to whether the level of funding the Government are seeking for road building from the European Community will be made available to us.</P>
    <P>The plan states that one of its objectives is to stimulate the growth needed to reduce unemployment, but it contains no specific details of any Government provision to tackle the problems of youth unemployment or long-term unemployment. That was referred to last week. Where a Dáil committee of the nature that Deputy Bruton proposes could play a role, is in comparing the effects on employment of different economic activity which may result from different types of investment options.  We do not know why the Government have opted for one type of investment option with regard to capital expenditure rather than another or why particular sums have been allocated in particular areas. <Col N="2269" /> I have already referred to the inadequacies of the roads programme.  Even if we were to stay within the parameters of the Government's projected financial contribution to the structural programme, it is possible, by a rearrangement of allocations to increase the potential funds from Europe and by doing so contribute to tackling our major unemployment problem.  For example, if one third of State money allocated in each of the years 1989 to 1993 for FÁS temporary employment schemes were taken out of that sub-head and put into the national roads programme, the resultant addition of £80 million to the roads programme would create potential of an additional £240 million being made available from Brussels for national roads.  This would only result in a reduction of the European Community Social Fund contribution by some £13 million.  Not only would this make a further contribution towards bringing our road infrastructure up to standard but it would be an investment in the creation of real jobs as opposed to temporary employment schemes.  Of course there is no Dáil committee to consider that type of option.  The Government simply sent the plan off.  We in this House should be able to look at this type of option and at how the priorities or the capital allocation could be rearranged to maximise the benefit not only in tackling our infrastructure problems but in providing real jobs to overcome the major problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The roads proposals cannot be left without commenting on the extraordinary refusal of the Government to publish their blueprint for road development. Deputy Bruton in his Bill makes provision for a statutory roads authority. The Roads Authority has been in existence as a non-statutory body for some time now.  We hear the Minister for the Environment regularly saying that a Bill is about to be published to give that Authority a statutory basis.  Such a Bill should be brought forward.  The failure of the Minister to do so has motivated provisions regarding the Roads Authority to <Col N="2270" /> be contained in the Economic Development Bill.  It appears to be the case that the Government are now going to oppose provisions to give a statutory basis to the establishment of the Roads Authority. It suits the Government that the Roads Authority are not statutory because this means that the Authority are kept under the thumb of the Government and are not free to publish reports.  They cannot act independently or consult independently with local authorities.  If the Roads Authority are critical of the Government at the moment with regard to financial allocation or capital allocation for the roads programme, or if they are critical of the roads priorities that the Government identify, they have no means of making known their criticism. They can only currently communicate with the Government.  It suits the Minister for the Environment, in the context of the obsessive secrecy shown by him in refusing to publish the blueprint for road development, to keep the Roads Authority as a non-statutory body under the thumb of the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>There is an extraordinary obsessive secrecy about the roads programme.  The Minister said that he has had the blueprint sitting in his Department since October 1988.  We are told indeed that the submissions under the <i>National Development Plan</i> for roads are based on what is contained in that blueprint yet the blueprint cannot be published.  Does the Minister believe that the security of the State might be endangered if the roads plans are revealed?  Does he think that there is some foreign enemy waiting to find out what we are going to do with our roads programme so that they can determine on which particular major new national road they should land their planes when invading this country?  Does the Minister believe there is an enemy outside who wants to discover which potholes are going to be filled on which county roads at which time of the day in the context of how their armies may march in?  It is a total nonsense that a blueprint has been sitting in the Department of the Environment for a new roads <Col N="2271" /> programme to cover a projected period of 20 years and that it is a national secret. In what country in Europe would a Government regard a blueprint for national primary roads, for secondary and tertiary roads, for filling the potholes in county roads, as a matter of such grave national importance as to be covered by the Official Secrets Act and not published? Is the blueprint to be leaked to <i>The Irish Times?</i>?  Are we to read the road priorities in <i>The Irish Times</i>?  Are local authorities not entitled to know where their road needs rank in the priority of Government thinking in the context of funds that are being sought from Brussels? It is an extraordinary approach on a matter about which there should not be any major concern.  This blueprint should be published.  The Roads Authority should be given a statutory basis.  Let the Minister publish the roads blueprint and stop coming into this House and saying on a general basis that he is a grand fellow with a secret blueprint that he is sending over to Brussels for a roads programme. It is an extraordinary nonsense typical of the excessive secrecy surrounding the manner in which this plan has been dealt with.</P>
    <P>In the context of the contribution made by the Minister for the Environment in the Dáil on this Bill on 8 March 1989, the Minister told us it was his concern to plan and co-ordinate the provision of physical infrastructure to prepare our economy for 1992.  The Minister is the co-ordinator, God bless us, of physical infrastructure. Will the Minister for co-ordinating the roads please tell us what plans he has with regard to roads?</P>
    <P>In the context of the proposals to change the planning Acts, the Minister gave very short shrift to the provisions contained in this Bill.  The Bill is designed to ensure that where a planning application is made the people who should know that an application is being made that may impinge on them, are given proper notice that such an application is being made.  One of the great difficulties in the area of planning is that someone making a major planning application for <Col N="2272" /> a major industrial proposal or a pharmaceutical or chemical plant, or someone making a minor planning application to build an extra room onto a house is required to advertise in an appropriate local or national newspaper.  Few people scan their papers on a daily basis to find out if there is a planning application being made that could affect their wellbeing and the enjoyment of their amenities or their property or affect the health and welfare of themselves, their children or neighbours.  That has long been a matter of some concern.  The mere obligation to publish in a paper an advertisement that a planning application is being made does not operate as an adequate communication to people who may need to know about that application.  This Bill contains a provision to require those people who are applying for planning permission to advertise not only by way of a newspaper the intention to make application to a local authority but also to erect on the site to which the planning application is applicable a suitable notice informing any person or persons interested of the location, nature and extent of the proposed development to take place on such a site.</P>

      <P>That is a very welcome proposal which I expect the Minister for the Environment to accept.  If this Bill is not successful tonight I hope this is a proposal that could be incorporated in the Planning Bill.  Currently there is a problem with An Bord Pleanála. Whereas the local authorities have a limited time span of two months to determine a planning application, there is no such time limit imposed on An Bord Pleanála. It is not unknown for An Bord Pleanála to take from 12 to 18 months in the context of major planning applications to reach a decision.  There is a need to put a time limit on An Bord <Col N="2273" /> Pleanála that enables them to properly assess&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This Bill prescribes a time frame that properly balances an opportunity for oral hearings, for an assessment of the viability and appropriateness of the planning application while also constraining An Bord Pleanála to make decisions within a reasonable time.  I would have expected that to be a proposal that the Minister could support.</P>
      <P>There was a number of other matters in relation to the Bill that deserve support. I regret that I do not have time to address them.  Deputy Bruton deserves full support from all sides of this House on this Bill.  If the Government disagree with some aspect of it, it can be amended on Committee Stage.  The fact that the Government intend to vote against this Bill is simply an additional proof that, in the context of the European enterprise as we head into 1992, they are intent on seeking to ensure that the democratic processes of this House are delimited to the maximum possible extent and that what they are at is covered in a veil of unnecessary and obsessive secrecy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Single Market is perhaps the single most important development for the economy since we joined the European Community in 1973.  It is of critical importance that we prepare adequately for the inevitable changes it will entail and that we generate a national awareness of the significance of these changes.  The common perception is, I think, that frontier controls within Europe will be removed and that otherwise life will go on as usual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is far more at stake than the physical removal of barriers.  What is in question is a truly integrated market for all goods and services with obviously much greater emphasis than before on <Col N="2274" /> competitive pricing.  While many of the changes will be of a technical nature, there will be measures which could result in quite fundamental shifts in existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>For instance, there will be entirely free movement of capital between the different member states of the Community. This means that a resident of this country or any other member state will be perfectly entitled to lodge his savings in any part of the Community.  The choice will be his alone based on his judgment of where he can get the best service and, of course the best return.  This new freedom of movement calls into question the differing tax arrangements for savings and investment in the different member states and the Community is at present considering proposals for harmonisation in this area.  The removal of controls will probably result in much greater volatility of capital and we will stand to gain or lose on this depending on the attractiveness of our capital markets relative to other markets within the Community.</P>
    <P>The integrated market will open the way for the tender of public contracts right across the Community.  This is a huge area.  Public procurement represents up to 15 per cent of Community output but, right now, only about 1 per cent of public contracts are awarded to residents of other Community countries. A revised public services directive was adopted last year, discussion is continuing on a new directive on public works contracts and the Commission has drawn up proposals to open up contracts in the areas of energy, transport and telecommunications. We already operate open tendering to a greater extent than other member states and, of course, because we are a small open economy, the import content of our purchases is high.  These new developments, therefore, should afford us some great opportunities provided our firms, especially those which have traditionally focussed their attention on public contracts, are ready for the new situation.  Let me sound a note of warning at the same time to those firms which have relied on contracts here and which are not ready to adjust. <Col N="2275" /> Not alone will these firms lose opportunities abroad, but they will experience the winds of keener competition at home. If they do not shape up, the outlook is not good for them.  So the clear message on public contracts is that the old order is changing rapidly and that there will be no room for those who do not change.</P>
    <P>Frontier controls for goods and passengers will be reduced and there will be consequential savings as goods and people move about much more freely. Many barriers to exports which result from differing national standards will be swept away and road haulage will be liberalised. Agreement has now been reached on a new system for mutual recognition of national professional qualifications which will open up the way for much greater movement of persons with such qualifications.  There should be new opportunities for our food industry, with direct access to a market of 320 million people.  In short, there is a whole new world of opportunity, if we can be positive about this.  Opportunities do not come without attendant risks.  Let us be in no doubt about the scale of competition. We have to face up to comparative disadvantages because of our isolation and our relatively low level of development by European standards.</P>
    <P>The Community has recognised the problems of unequal development in a unified or single market and it has taken steps to correct this imbalance.  It is a fact of life that, in a large market, business will drift more an more towards the central and more prosperous areas unless this is counterbalanced by other measures.  In other situations, this problem has sometimes been tackled by measures such as subsidies, taxation incentives, quotas and various special schemes.  In the European Single Market, the aim is to achieve the greatest possible harmonisation of rules and regulations right across the Community. The preferred method of channelling special help to the less developed and peripheral regions is the extended use of the Structural Funds to remedy structural deficiencies, both economic and social.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2276" /> The Structural Funds embrace a number of different funds designed to minimise regional imbalances, namely, the Regional Fund, the Social Fund and the Guidance Section of the Agricultural Fund.  The Community has agreed to a very considerable enlargement of these funds in the context of the Single Market. Two crucially important objectives have been set &mdash; the Structural Funds for the least developed regions, among which all of Ireland is included, will be doubled by 1992 and there will be an increase in the rates of contribution from the funds to a maximum of 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>The <i>National Development Plan</i> which the Government submitted to the European Commission last month sets out the structural measures we propose to implement over the next five years, in conjunction with the Structural Funds, in order to remedy the severe structural deficiencies in our economy and to achieve our potential for faster economic growth and more social progress.  It involves measures directed at modernising and improving our roads, transport, telecommunications, postal and energy networks and ensuring adequate environmental and waste disposal services to meet development needs and protect the environment.  In addition, it involves measures designed to enhance our productive capacity in industry, tourism, services, agriculture, forestry and fishery, together with rural development measures aimed at increasing employment and income levels in rural areas. The expansion of our educational and training resources is another key element.  Together these measures in the plan constitute a comprehensive and integrated approach to achieving economic and social progress over the next five years.  It builds on and will accelerate the progress already made over the last two years.</P>
    <P>The preparation of this plan involved the most extensive process of consultation ever carried out in the context of preparing a national development plan. Reports were received from each of the regional working groups in advance of finalisation of the plan.  While some work <Col N="2277" /> is continuing in finalising the Dublin consultants' report, the reports received prior to finalisation of the plan contained all the essential comprehensive assessments of the needs and priorities of each of the seven regions.  The reports were fully taken into account in the formalisation of the plan and the operational programmes.</P>
    <P>I regret that Deputy Shatter is not in the House because I hope that what emanated from him this evening is not typical of the views of the people who elected him.  His contribution was terribly negative and nonsensical.  I detected an attitude that you could not trust the Government to execute a national development plan in the overall interests of the people.  That type of negativity is totally ridiculous, as we have tried to get a consensus as to what is best and what this House should be contributing to the development of our country.</P>
    <P>It is not the case that consultants in the Dublin region were instructed to amend or devise their report in any way or to comply with any pre-requirements.  I want to state clearly that the proposals contained in the <i>National Development Plan</i> fully meet the requirements of the European Communities regulations as well as the additionality requirements.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the <i>National Development Plan</i>&mdash; and the total investment by the State, private sector and Structural Funds which it entails &mdash; will place us on a strong competitive footing to face the challenges of the Single Market.  It will not, however, solve all our problems and there are other steps that must also be taken.  Above all, we ourselves will have to be well prepared both psychologically and practically for the Single Market.  There is no time to be lost in making the necessary preparations.</P>
    <P>To many, the single market is seen as some event that will take place in 1992, as though this fundamental change could be introduced overnight.  The reality is quite different.  Of its very nature it has to be a gradual or phased process but the most significant point for us to note here is that it is already happening.  The year 1992 is intended to be the end result <Col N="2278" /> rather than the starting date for the new order of things.  The Government have long since recognised this.  Last July the Taoiseach launched a national campaign to create an active awareness of what is at stake and to generate among the business community in general the proper sense of urgency in meeting the new challenge. This campaign is being given top priority and no time is being lost in creating the right conditions so far as the Government are concerned.  There must be an equal response from the business community and I think it is fair to say that business is becoming increasingly conscious of its obligations in this regard.</P>
    <P>For us the ultimate priority is greatly increased opportunities for employment. We are by no means unique in our concern about employment.  It is an issue of concern throughout Europe and one that must be tackled and resolved at Community level.  There are, however, different views on the potential for new jobs in the Single Market.  The Cecchini studies, which were sponsored by the European Commission, have estimated that the completion of the Single Market, combined with appropriate economic policies, could lead to a net increase of five million jobs in the Community.  This would be a welcome achievement and let us hope that it will be realised.  Some critics would argue that this target is unrealistic. What is not in question, however, is that with a marketplace, riddled as before with barriers to trade and differing standards, there would be a distinct risk that the Community would go into decline in international trading terms to the detriment of its employment and living standards.  Against that, a Single Market, guided by the right policies, has enormous potential to provide a new dynamism in Europe and to provide the many new job opportunities that not just Ireland but the whole Community needs so urgently.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Bruton who has introduced this Bill before us &mdash; the Economic Development Bill, 1989 &mdash; to focus attention on the changes that are upon us and to highlight what he sees as deficiencies in our system as we prepare <Col N="2279" /> for the new Europe.  I can only commend him for his intention but I must be critical of the manner in which he seeks to bring about improvements.  I am not going to analyse the Bill line by line.  Other Ministers have already spoken at length on aspects of the Bill of immediate concern to their areas of responsibility and the Minister for Finance in his reply to the Deputy's opening statement has also dealt with the individual items.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton described his Bill as comprehensive.  Despite the claim made in the Explanatory Memorandum that the Bill is designed as an integrated set of measures to prepare the economy for the Single European Act, it is not comprehensive and it is not by any stretch of the imagination a text that embraces all aspects of European integration.  On the contrary, it is no more than a list of individual proposals, with no obvious interconnection.  The Deputy himself acknowledged in the course of his opening statement that some of the items are of a very minor nature indeed.  Frankly, the links between several of these items and the advent of the Single Market is by no means obvious.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree that we must give a greater sense of urgency to the preparations for the Single Market.  There is no room for complacency and the Government, and indeed the whole Oireachtas, have a duty to guarantee a continuing awareness of the implications of the changes that are upon us.  We are not going to achieve this effect, however, by wandering in all directions at once and debating a Bill that has no proper shape or purpose to it.</P>
    <P>The thinking behind the Deputy's approach seems to be that, if there is a problem or a deficiency, legislate for it. This is an approach which cannot be commended. For instance, the Deputy wants to legislate in a hurry for the new National Roads Authority.  Indeed, Deputy Shatter would love to see such legislation immediately.  The House will be asked to legislate for this in due course.  As my <Col N="2280" /> colleague the Minister for the Environment has already indicated in his contribution to this debate, there will be a comprehensive Bill that will deal with this issue.  I expect that there will be a lengthy and measured debate on the subject.  There is no merit in rushing such an important matter.  Moreover, there is no good reason why the Authority should not be established on a temporary basis pending legislation, so no time will be lost and it can make an overall contribution to the improvement of our entire road structure.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that the Central Bank should assume specific roles in relation to employment and industrial development.  The Central Bank, as Deputy Bruton would know, have very clear cut responsibilities in relation to the currency and the regulation of banking activities.  While I have no doubt that the bank are conscious of the importance of employment and industrial development in carrying out their responsibilities, it would be quite wrong to assign a statutory responsibility to them in this respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton has failed to demonstrate that the enhancement of tax reliefs which he proposes could have any appreciable impact in speeding up economic activity.  The incentives of concern to him are already very generous &mdash; indeed the business expansion scheme has proved too generous in certain respects and the Government have, as Deputies are aware, already introduced measures in the Finance Bill to redirect it to more productive purposes.  Deputy Bruton himself called for action on these lines and it is somewhat inconsistent of him to call at the same time for changes which would make it even more attractive to investors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of interest shown in the scheme in recent times surely confirms that investors already find it a very generous relief.  The Deputy expressed disappointment at the response so far to the tax incentive for research and development which, I <Col N="2281" /> believe, he himself sponsored in the first instance.  It is true that the incentive has not had a significant impact but this may be due more to the lack of suitable projects than to the generosity of the incentive. This incentive, like the business expansion scheme, allows taxpayers to obtain tax relief on investments of up to £25,000 a year and I would have to point out that abolishing the restriction on connected persons investing in a research and development company, which of its nature is a transient entity, would leave the way open to abuse.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes the targets to be set for industrial performance in the year 2000.  We all want to make every effort to stimulate employment in every possible way.  We must plan for the maximum and be ambitious.  It is no solution, however, to pluck figures out of the air and plant them as targets in legislation.  The Deputy well knows from his own experience that planning and preparation of targets is inevitably a complex business and even the best-laid plans sometimes go astray. The inclusion of target figures in legislation with no real basis for them would at best be a meaningless exercise and could leave us open to the accusation of incompetence.</P>
      <P>The single market is a development of great opportunity for this country.  As a small economy, already open to competition and dependent upon exports of goods and services for our survival, the opening up of a huge market of 320 million persons should be of great benefit. This is not a David and Goliath affair as some commentators would imply whereby we will be overrun by competition from abroad once barriers are removed.  On the contrary, we should be excited at the prospect of these barriers coming down.  Let us give ourselves some credit for what we have already achieved. In some areas we have demonstrated great enterprise; what we need now is more of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the capacity to turn this new development to our great advantage and the bottom line is that we must learn to be still more competitive.  In turn the EC has recognised the needs of the peripheral <Col N="2282" /> and less developed regions.  In a big market there is a natural tendency for the more prosperous areas to develop faster.  I have said there could be a natural drift towards the centre and towards areas of great wealth, and to counteract this assistance in the form of Structural Funds is being made available.  We stand to benefit greatly from this.  We must be alert to take full advantage of the situation.  We must be ready to introduce legislative changes where these are deemed to be necessary.</P>
    <P>Some of the changes proposed by Deputy Bruton may have considerable merit and I am not rejecting his proposals out of hand. However, the enactment of a Bill on the lines before us now is not the way forward.  I believe that putting this varied collection of items into legislation would achieve no useful purpose and some of the items could have decidedly negative effects.  I would prefer that we proceed in an ordered fashion in preparing for the Single Market and where legislative changes are necessary let us debate these in the appropriate context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question I would like to answer is, why have an Economic Development Bill of this kind at all which brings together, as has been acknowledged on all sides of the House, a range of measures from education through the planning laws to industrial development legislation, finance legislation and so on?  Why have one Bill bringing all those apparently diverse subjects together?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially the reason this is proposed is that the 1992 challenge to this economy is so serious and immediate that we cannot afford to wait for individual bits of legislation on each of those subjects to find their way slowly through the departmental queue of legislation to the parliamentary draftsman's office and eventually, perhaps two or three years from now, on to the Floor of this House. Anything that relates to the challenge of 1992 must be dealt with definitively in this House in 1989 and no later.  We cannot <Col N="2283" /> afford the traditional method where Ministers get up and say they will introduce legislation &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; or &ldquo;in due course&rdquo;, the well established pattern of replies we have from that side of the House whenever people ask about forthcoming legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole purpose of this Bill is to bring together an omnibus piece of legislation which can deal across the range of all the issues that impact on 1992.  I know Deputies opposite will make the criticism, as they have done, that individual measures are not included in this Bill which ought to be included, that there is some sense of a subjective decision as to what has gone into the Bill and what has been excluded.  Of course that is so but the great merit of legislation such as this is that when it comes to Committee Stage the Long Title of the Bill is so broadly drawn that any matter the Government felt related to 1992 could be dealt with by means of amendment to the Bill in Committee.  The Government have an opportunity in a Bill of this kind to deal with a whole range of matters they might otherwise have to leave languishing somewhere in a long queue of legislation.  Any of us who has been in Government knows how long is the queue of matters awaiting legislative action in any Government at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My view and the view advocated by the Fine Gael Party is that we must take anything that deals with 1992 out of the queue and put it up at the top.  This Bill provides an instrument which, if the Government had a little magnanimity and vision, could have been used by the Government to get measures of their own through this House in 1989 that would otherwise end up waiting in a long line in the Government's own queue of legislation. I made it quite clear in discussions I had with the Minister for Finance before the introduction of the Bill that I was not particularly concerned about defending <Col N="2284" /> any section in this Bill; it was open to the Government to amend it in any way they wished with our co-operation on this side of the House, and to use this Bill to achieve a consensus and bring together and do things that need urgent attention in regard to 1992.  Unfortunately the Government had not the wit to see they were being offered something they could have used for their own purposes and, to some extent, even for their own advantage, politically and otherwise.  Instead, no, they could not possibly do that.  This was something coming from the Opposition and because it was an idea coming from somebody else, that in itself was an implied criticism of the Government, that the Government had not thought of such an approach first and, because the Government had not thought of it first the Government had to oppose it.  That is the sort of superficial, kneejerk, narrowminded politics that, unfortunately, have kept this country in Europe's slow lane since we gained independence in 1921.  The attitude that if somebody else puts forward something you must oppose it rather than adopt and use it has bedevilled this House in dealing with the nation's problems.  It is a legacy of the Civil War certainly, but the Civil War was over a long time ago and surely it is about time proposals coming from the other side could be accepted if they were worth accepting, regardless of who made them.  That is the sort of climate of opinion that exists politically in all other continental European countries but for some peculiar reason does not exist here.</P>
    <P>However, it is interesting that Ministers, including the Minister currently in the House, could find little or nothing to quarrel with in this Bill.  Indeed, the Minister for Education, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, went as far as to say, and I quote directly: &ldquo;I would find very little to quarrel with in what Deputy John Bruton has put forward in his Bill&rdquo;.  Yet, having said there was nothing to quarrel with in it, in a few minutes' time the Minister for Education, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, if she is here, will come in to vote against something in which she herself said she finds nothing to quarrel with.  What sort <Col N="2285" /> of mindless attitude is that?  You are not against it but you are going to vote against it because it is somebody else's idea.  That is typical of an attitude of mind that, unfortunately is displayed with undue frequency by the party opposite.</P>
    <P>We have a great deal to our name in this country as a result of a consensus approach to politics in the last few years. This Government would not be in office today if the parties in Opposition had decided early in the Government's life to bring them down.  Because the parties in Opposition decided the problems of our country, particularly in regard to the public finances, were extremely urgent they decided they would not bring this Government down unnecessarily on a public finance issue.  That is a consensus approach in regard to a narrow agenda, that of bringing the debt under control. What has that consensus approach achieved?  It has brought down interest rates by six percentage points.  When I hear people asking what the country has gained from the Tallaght strategy my answer is simple, the country has gained this from the Tallaght strategy: if you have a mortgage you are paying hundreds of pounds a year less this year than you were paying in 1986 simply because an Opposition party have allowed the Government to put through measures to put our finances back in order.</P>

      <P>A farmer may owe a substantial amount of money.  As a direct result of the Opposition's unprecedented decision to allow the Government of the day to implement measures to get our finances under control, interest rates have been brought down.  Farmers are paying somewhere in the region of £130 million less interest payments as a direct result of the strategy of the Opposition which allowed the Government to bring our finances under control rather than precipitate a succession of elections of the kind Fianna Fáil precipitated when first the Coalition Government <Col N="2286" /> attempted to do something similar in 1981-82.</P>

      <P>This Bill reveals a fundamental cleavage in economic thinking between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  In the Fianna Fáil view what counts is big projects, big capital spending programmes and, above all, ministerial announcements, Ministers cutting tapes on bridges, Ministers cutting tapes at schools, Ministers associating their names with building things and, above all, when they pass on to the never-never land of former Ministers, having RTCs called after them.  That is the sort of ambition, the fixation with building, the Fianna Fáil party have, as if building things in itself had some inherent merit.</P>
      <P>What will make a difference to the economy is not what we build but what we do inside the buildings.  What matters is whether people have an incentive to work, whether people on social welfare feel they should remain unemployed because if they take a job they will lose money, whether our educational system turns out people who have the view that they should try to set up a business of their own because that is the value the educational system has put into their minds, or whether they have the idea that the ideal is to get a safe job in the Civil Service or the bank, to be employed by somebody else &mdash; the ideal which the educational system at present tends to promote.  It is all to do with perception. Our perception on this side of the House is that attitudes of mind, work and incentives rather than buildings, projects and announcements make the difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why I am so critical of <i>The National Development Programme</i> announced during the past few weeks.  It is an affront to describe it as such when it is simply a list of capital projects, as if capital projects on their own will make any difference.  They will make no difference unless people have the ability and the incentive to work harder.  It is to improve that ability and incentive that <Col N="2287" /> this Economic Development Bill is put forward.  It is in that context its measures have been framed.  There are a number of issues we must tackle if we are to overcome our problems.  We must reform our income tax system, which means perhaps reducing the rates of tax and getting rid of some of the tax allowances which exist.  The reality is that if any party in Government make a suggestion to reduce somebody's allowances, all the other parties will vote against them.  This applies no matter who is in Government.</P>
    <P>Likewise, we need to establish a proper system of local government, financed by its own system of taxation which it can raise and control.  If any Deputy or Minister suggests a particular method of raising funds for local authorities or a new tax to fund local authorities, all the other people in the House will jump on him and make as much political capital as they possibly can about his unwisdom in making any such suggestion.</P>
    <P>The result of this mutual veto which we exercise on new ideas coming from the other side is that we have made virtually no progress in tax reform, no progress in dealing with issues such as local government reform, no progress in dealing with the huge monopoly costs imposed on our economy by the fact that our electricity system is run by a statutory monopoly which nobody dares challenge because of the political implications.  We have huge extra telephone costs because our telecommunications systems is run by a Government monopoly, Telecom, which again nobody dares challenge even though there are lots of private options which could be considered.  We have also major costs imposed on our economy because of artificial restrictions on who may land airplanes in various parts of the country.  I know from bitter experience that anybody in Government attempting to put forward proposals to deal with those issues will meet with a howl of criticism from whomever happens to be sitting on these benches.  That applies whether it is the Minister's party or mine.</P>
    <P>That is why we propose in this Bill, given that a consensus has worked in <Col N="2288" /> regard to getting the debt under control, to extend the possible area wherein consensus could apply to all areas related to 1992.  That is why we propose a joint committee to look at a whole range of areas, tax reform, Telecom, State monopolies and their effect on the economy and business costs, a system of local government taxation which is genuinely autonomous.  These issues cannot be tackled by a party on their own but could be tackled within a structure such as a committee to prepare this country for 1992 on an all-party basis.  If there were to be a political downside, all the parties in the House would suffer some of the consequences rather than whoever happened to be in Government and made the proposal.  Of course, Fianna Fáil could not see any merit in that.  Their idea of consensus is that they propose something and everybody else agrees. There is no question in their mind of consensus involving discussing matters with people and actually reaching agreement but that consensus is the laying down of the law by Fianna Fáil and everybody else giving them a round of applause.  Anybody who dares to criticise anything they suggest is immediately branded as lacking in patriotism or some other much desired quality.</P>
    <P>This is an historic opportunity.  We have seen how consensus worked to get the debt under control.  Any thinking Fianna Fáil Deputy must recognise that it could not have happened without the co-operation of the Opposition parties. It has yielded tremendous results for which we can all take credit, including &mdash; perhaps particularly &mdash; the Government party.  We have lower interest rates, more investment and growing employment which we did not have two years ago.  It is true and we are all entitled to the credit for it.  Why cannot we do the same in regard to preparations for 1992?  Why are the Government rejecting this Bill in the light of these facts?</P>
    <P>A vital issue if we are to benefit from the market of 1992 is that we be able to speak to the people in Europe in their own languages.  There is not much point in building high speed roads to Germany <Col N="2289" /> if Irish people cannot speak to the Germans at the far end of those roads and have to say &ldquo;Mein Gott, why will you not buy what we have to sell?&rdquo; What will happen is that the high speed roads will be carrying German goods here.  Germans who come here selling their goods are certainly able to speak English but Irish people producing goods at this end of the air corridors do not speak German.  Only 4 per cent of Irish students doing the leaving certificate examination take German as a subject.  Even then they take it as a written subject and do not have any proficiency in speaking the language.</P>

      <P>Purely grammar and literature &mdash; reading extracts from Goethe or something like that as if that will help them to sell Irish clothing and beef in Baden-Württemberg.  That is why this Bill proposes specific action to improve language teaching.  We are proposing a target of at least two continental languages, French and German, Spanish and German or some other combination, to be taken by all children when they are finishing post-primary education.</P>
      <P>We also want the EC to give money towards the training and re-training of our teachers in continental languages. We have an entirely artificial situation at present where the European structural funds will be used for something called &ldquo;training&rdquo;.  If people dig holes and fill them up again under the supervision of somebody who is supposed to be a skilled craftsman, that is called training and EC money will be available for it.  If we want to put money into training our teachers to teach students German or French, that is education and the EC will not help. This Bill proposes that the Government should have a mandate by law to seek to change that foolish EC rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also want the Government to be given a mandate to bring the teaching of continental languages into primary schools.  It is well known that the younger children are the more adaptable they are and the more open their minds are to new ideas.  The older they get the more rigid <Col N="2290" /> they become.  Obviously, if we want to introduce a whole new concept of language and expression, the earlier the better.  It makes eminent sense that we should teach French and German in our national schools as well as teaching Irish. I have no doubt that teaching Irish is a good thing.  It actually helps people to get the idea of learning a second language and it is in no way a hindrance to learning German or French.  There is not much point in saying it is good to have Irish in the national schools because it opens people's minds to the possibility of learning a third language if we do not actually teach them the third language in the primary schools.  This Bill proposes that there should be a certificate of competence in foreign languages recognised by the State.  At the moment if people take the trouble privately to do a course in German or French, there is no body to recognise what they have achieved. There is no public examination to recognise what they have achieved in acquiring a particular level of competence.  There should be such and this Bill proposes that.</P>
    <P>This Bill also proposes a major speeding up of the planning law in order to have decisions by planning authorities and other projects taken quickly.  I would remind the Minister of State that in the last election his party promised that An Bord Pleanála would be required to decide appeals within four months.  That promise has not been kept despite the fact that there is a planning Bill before this House which could have contained this proposal.  Our Bill requires Fianna Fáil to keep their own election promises in regard to speeding up planning legislation. I do not see why they are not prepared to accept a Fine Gael Bill that helps them to keep their own promises.</P>
    <P>In section 6 we propose an overhaul of higher education.  The Higher Education Authority should not be the preserve of academics.  At present the Authority is run exclusively by academics.  I have no animosity towards, nor do I deprecate in any way, people who have degrees; but I do not believe that they should have a monopoly in running higher education. <Col N="2291" /> We need more people on the Higher Education Authority who would be actually employing the graduates who come out from our colleges.  It is simply a question of consumer power.  If we want higher education to work it should be related to the needs of the people who will actually employ the graduates rather than solely to the needs of the colleges and to individual professors who want to build up their own departments.  At the moment the Higher Education Authority spend most of their time deciding whether Professor A will do better than Professor B in the battle for funds.  It is not a question of higher education being geared to the needs of 1992 but of which professor does best in the rat race.  The Higher Education Authority should be radically overhauled by increasing dramatically the number of non-academic members so that it will have a consumer oriented perspective which it does not have at the moment.</P>
    <P>This Bill also proposes that the Higher Education Authority be reoriented towards giving more opportunities at second chance education.  At present higher education is exclusively the preserve of those who happen to have parents who are well off enough to send them to college in the first few years after they leave school.  The 109,000 pupils who have been out of work for more than a year have no chance of going to higher education institutions here even though it is well known that most of those people will never get another job in their lives unless they have a radically improved educational standard.  That is why this Bill proposes that the Higher Education Authority be mandated by law to spend more of their money on second chance education.  Unless this is done the Higher Education Authority will do nothing because speeches are ignored.  I particularly hope that a second chance will be given to the long term unemployed and other vulnerable groups in society who should get more of the higher education funds than is the case at the moment.  Let me draw the attention of the House, as if I needed to do that, to the fact that the <Col N="2292" /> overwhelming majority of those coming from some of the most expensive faculties in our universities are going straight out of the country.  Irish educational investment is being handed over to other countries to exploit for their economic development.</P>
    <P>Higher education should be reoriented towards second chance education for those who are living here, many of whom are long term unemployed.  It is a radical proposal which I hope will have the support particularly of the parties of the Left who make this their own particular issue. This Bill will redistribute favourably the resources that go into higher education. I hope it will have the support of Deputies Higgins, De Rossa and others of their parties.</P>
    <P>I want to move on to the proposal to establish by law a national roads authority. There has been a lot of talk from the Government about this.  The party opposite are now over two years in office. It is about time they introduced this legislation. Whatever it is that is holding it up, let them forget it.  This Bill provides the Minister with the means to immediately take the first step to establish by law a national roads authority.  I invite the party opposite to take this opportunity to get on with the job rather than wasting time as they are doing at the moment.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is particularly important.  It proposes that mortgage relief be extended to people who take out loans to invest in shares in a small company creating jobs here.  At present people with savings are pouring them into bidding up the prices of houses on the south side of this city.  We have speculation in houses.  This means that people are putting their money into house property. I am in favour of houses, but they do not produce a new continuing stream of wealth; they are a consumer good.  Yet, because our tax incentives are confined solely to housing, the savings of people are being poured into housing, into bidding up the price of housing and building up a speculative bubble in houses on the south side of Dublin city.  The proposal in this Bill would divert some of the money that is being poured into the <Col N="2293" /> creation of this speculative bubble into companies that would create jobs under the Business Expansion Scheme.  I welcome the tightening up of that scheme by the Minister for Finance.  The money should go into the Business Expansion Scheme under the present Finance Bill and people should be able to use mortgage interest relief to invest in companies rather than being able to get tax relief solely through trading up in housing.</P>
    <P>I also want to refer to the need to have regional development authorities to implement at local level the proposals that are before us at the moment to build up the capital strength of our economy through EC Structural Funds.  It is essential that people be involved at local and regional levels in these decisions.  The spending of this money should not be a matter handed down from on high by the Government like manna from Heaven. Unless people feel they have some part in this they will not make sure that it works properly.  I would remind the Government that in their election manifesto they promised that Fianna Fáil would introduce procedures whereby local authorities can make direct application for regional funding and receive such funding directly from the EC.  They have done the opposite.  They have said they will not even forward to Brussels the proposals prepared in the individual regions.  The proposals into which so much work has gone are now, I suggest, going to end up in the very ample shredder that exists in the Department of Finance. That piece of equipment will be overheated and may blow its fuse in the next few weeks with all of these local authority and other proposals that are going to be fed into it, despite the fact that they promised that local authorities <Col N="2294" /> would be able to apply directly to Brussels. If ever there was a U-turn this is it. This must qualify as a double S-turn in political terms, but then Fianna Fáil are used to that; they have quite an expertise in that field.</P>
    <P>There is a number of other proposals I would like to refer to.  Deputy Treacy criticised the proposal that we should set ourselves a target of 100,000 extra people at work here by the end of the century, and a doubling of Ireland's share of the world markets.  He asked: &ldquo;Where was this proposal plucked from?  Was it plucked from the air?  Surely there is not much point having proposals like this.&rdquo; I would like to tell the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and the Government that no less a body than the OECD which investigated this economy said that if we were to harness our national endeavour and our spirit in an innovative process and if we were to get everybody working towards making this country a more innovative society, we would have to set ourselves an ambitious target for the end of the century.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the Fine Gael Bill is exactly the target that was proposed for the Irish economy by the OECD.  It was not plucked from the air but was taken from a report on the Irish economy by the most prestigious and most independent of all the economic commentating bodies. It is something that we want to write into law in this Bill as a target for our nation and a target which could be supported, and I hope will be supported in the lobbies tonight by all the main parties in the House.</P>

      <P>Over the past number of months, certainly since Christmas, there have been so many attacks, and threats of attacks, on the railway line that it has been closed for 50 days at an estimated cost of £800,000. The whole question of the attacks on this railway line raises a number of important issues, the most important of which is the threat to the lives of passengers and staff. In the case of the attack on 2 March, the bomb which damaged Craigmore viaduct went off just four minutes before a passenger train from Dublin was due to leave the nearby Newry station.  There were more than 70 people on the train, and had the bomb gone off as it was passing over the bridge, or when it was too late to stop the train, the consequences would have been appalling.  There is no reason to believe that that would have upset the Provisional IRA.  Indeed, we would, more than likely, have been treated to one of Mr. Adams' more nauseating excuses for an apology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of jobs. Trade union leaders have estimated that up to 400 workers, North and South, could lose their jobs if the Provos get their way and are allowed to close the line.  Apart from the railway workers directly affected there are many more employed in firms which depend on the railway line for freight services between the two parts of Ireland.  Some major firms use the line: industries like CementRoadstone, Guinness, NET/Richardsons Fertilisers and Bell Lines.  If they cannot get their products through, or if they have to incur additional costs by transferring to roads, it will clearly threaten the jobs of their employees.  I should like to appeal to those companies not to transfer from the railway line to roads because that, in effect, would be a major psychological boost for the Provisional IRA.  I should like to make the point that such a move would in no way protect those industries from the attention of that organisation because the logic of the Provo position is that they will pursue those companies <Col N="2298" /> whether they use the railway line or the roads, whether they are transporting in buses, trucks or cars.</P>
    <P>There is also a basic civil liberties issue involved here.  Between 2,000 and 3,000 passengers travel on the line each week, for business, work, education or family reasons.  In many cases people have no alternative means of transport.  The efforts by the Provisional IRA to close the line is a challenge to the very right of Irish people to move freely about the island.  Imagine the outcry there would be if the authorities in the North decided to close the line on security grounds.  No doubt Provo spokesmen like Adams and Morrison would be among the most vocal on the matter.  The continuing attacks simply illustrate once again the appalling arrogance and hypocrisy of the Provisionals and the fundamental contradiction in their position.  On the one hand they claim to want to eliminate the Border while at the same time they are doing all in their power to make travel and trade between the two parts of Ireland more difficult and dangerous. Their whole strategy is to create divisions between people, between communities, and within communities.  Their very survival is based on feeding sectarian bigotry and racism.</P>
    <P>I might refer here also to the myth that there are doves and hawks within the Provisional IRA.  It is claimed that Adams is leading the dove wing of the Provisional IRA.  I should remind this House and the people outside it that some of the most appalling atrocities perpetrated in Northern Ireland &mdash; Le Mans, Bloody Friday, the Kingsmills' massacre and, of course, the more recent ones in Enniskillen and so on &mdash; have been perpetrated under the tutelage of the Adams faction when they came to prominence in Northern Ireland in the early seventies.</P>
    <P>The rail line is used entirely by civilians. This raises the question why in recent months it has become a focal point for attacks by the Provos.  The fact that it offers an opportunity to destroy and endanger lives, and is a soft target, may well be enough for their perverse logic. <Col N="2299" /> It has certainly been the case in relation to other attacks by the Provos, such as Enniskillen, Warrenpoint, or the murder of Harry Keyes or Gillian Johnstone.</P>
    <P>However, it is important that the authorities on both sides of the Border should investigate reports of money being paid to the Provos to have the line closed for commercial reasons.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions in a statement last month referred to the possible involvement of illegal hauliers.  Following an earlier public statement I made on the matter, I received a telephone call to my office suggesting that money was being paid to the Provos to keep the line closed, that the real target of the attacks were the consignments of cement which go North from the Irish cement plant at Drogheda.  The Provos themselves, of course, have suggested that their motive is the ghoulish one of forcing the security forces out into the open, presumably so that they can more easily murder them.</P>
    <P>Whatever the motives for their life threatening and destructive attacks on the line, it is important that the Provisionals are not allowed to succeed.  In the early seventies the Provisionals destroyed the electricity interconnector and frustrated the possibility of cheaper electricity in both parts of Ireland.  They also frustrated the possibility of this State selling gas to Northern Ireland.  They must not be allowed do the same with the rail line.  The two Governments must co-operate on whatever security and other measures are necessary to keep the line open.  Workers, passengers, companies and ordinary citizens should make their views on these attacks known publicly to the Provisionals at every opportunity. They should be told in no uncertain terms what the ordinary public think of their vicious campaign.</P>
    <P>As a means of providing the public and representative organisations with an opportunity to demonstrate their abhorrence of the Provo campaign, I have established a small committee to organise a &ldquo;peace train&rdquo; from Dublin to Belfast.  I am also inviting a wide range of commercial, trade union and cultural groups <Col N="2300" /> to a private meeting to discuss this proposal to ascertain how the greatest possible participation of people can be ensured.</P>
    <P>In the longer term, these attacks on the line and other murderous attacks by the Provos simply emphasise the need for political action to isolate and defeat the gunmen.  This can best be done through dialogue between the democratic political parties in Northern Ireland, leading to the establishment of devolved government there, guaranteed by a Bill of Rights and a job creation programme.</P>

      <P>The House will appreciate that we lost a considerable amount of time from this debate by reason of the vote which has just concluded. Therefore, I want to inform Deputies De Rossa and McGahon that I will be obliged to call on the Minister of State at 8.56 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will give me a minute of her time.</P>
      <P>I join with Deputy De Rossa in condemning the IRA for yet another mindless act of aggression against the Irish nation.  The current campaign directed against the ordinary people of Ireland travelling North and South is further proof, if such were needed, that this ragbag organisation of gangsters and bandits will stop at nothing in their crazed efforts to destabilise Irish society and injure the Irish nation one way or another.  There are over 400 workers whose jobs and livelihood are at risk and over 500,000 passengers from the North visit the South annually.</P>
      <P>My town of Dundalk is one that bears living testimony to crimes committed against it by the IRA in the huge unemployment figures.  They now want to turn the town into a railway cul-de-sac as if the mass emigration from Dundalk had not been a sufficient blow to inflict on that town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already these gangsters have cost CIE and Northern Ireland Railways over £1 million revenue in lost freight.  More and more people are coming to the belief that road hauliers are paying money to the <Col N="2301" /> IRA to carry out their dastardly work.  In the racketeer system that has turned the Six Counties into a racketeering paradise, this possibility must be strongly considered.</P>
    <P>I am a regular traveller on CIE and have seen the disturbance and disruption the IRA have caused hundreds of passengers, their mercy plea being that no bomb has yet gone off on the line which could cause death on a massive scale.  It should be remembered that if such were to happen we would then have the spectacle of Mr. Adams, the Irish Dr. Mengele, the angel of death, apologising to victims' families, promising to be more careful about his kind of &ldquo;injustice&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I commend the courage and forbearance of the travelling public, the joint staffs of Northern Ireland Railways and Iarnród Éireann on their determination to carry on against this partitionist attack on Irish people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin, A Ceann Comhairle, by assuring Deputies that the Department of Foreign Affairs have been in close contact with the British authorities on the matter of the bombing campaign on the Dublin to Belfast railway line.  Delays in re-opening the line have been due to the suspected presence of secondary devices.  One such device in fact exploded, causing injury to a British Army explosives officer on 17 February. I can assure the House that the British authorities are fully aware of the importance of keeping the line open and safe for travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that all Members of the House will join me in condemning in <Col N="2302" /> the strongest possible terms the series of explosions on the Dublin to Belfast railway which have occurred recently. Those who carry out such attacks would seem to have little or no concern for the appalling loss of life which could so easily result from their activities.  I particularly condemn the statement issued by the IRA on 16 April &ldquo;advising&rdquo; employees and officials of Northern Ireland Railways to stay away from the railway line in order to avoid death or injury in an IRA attack.</P>
    <P>The recent campaign began on 16 December last when a device was detonated on the railway line 150 metres south of Kilnasaggart Bridge.  Fortunately, no injury was caused and the clearance operation began.  On 28 December, a 400 lb radio-controlled bomb containing home-made explosives was found hidden in a stone wall some 25 to 30 metres from the line.  It was defused. The clearance operation ended on 29 December and the line was opened the following day.</P>
    <P>On 3 February, Northern Ireland Railways reported that two bombs were hidden on the line at Kilnasaggart Bridge. These bombs exploded the following day and damaged the bridge.  The clearance operation began on 5 February and on 17 February a secondary device exploded causing injury to an explosives officer. On 18 February another bomb containing between two and five kilos of semtex was found and defused.  On 19 February yet another bomb, this time containing 100 kilos of a home-made explosive, was found and defused.  The clearance operation was concluded on 21 February and the line reopened.</P>
    <P>On 23 February, a bomb exploded at Silverwood Bridge.  It contained five kilos of semtex.  A clearance operation was mounted which concluded on 27 February. The following day there were two telephone calls saying that there were two devices on the Portadown/Newry stretch of the line.  A clearance operation was mounted.  No bomb was found.  The line was reopened on 1 March.</P>
    <P>On 2 March, a bomb exploded at the Craigmore viaduct.  Again, fortunately, <Col N="2303" /> there were no injuries.  A clearance operation had to be mounted and the line was closed yet again.  It was reopened on 8 March.  On 12/13 March, there was a bomb scare and the line was closed for 22 hours.</P>
    <P>On 1 April, there was another bomb scare and the line was closed for 3 hours. On 5 April, there was a further hoax call and the line was closed for four hours. On 10 April, there was a telephone call saying that a bomb on the line was timed to explode within 20 minutes.  An explosion was heard and it was subsequently found to have occurred south of Newry Station.  On 11 April, two devices were discovered at Meigh, south of Newry.  On the same say, a further device was found south of Newry Station. That device was defused on 17 April.  The devices at Meigh remain to be dealt with and, as Deputies will be aware, that line to Newry and from Dundalk is open. In the meantime, passengers are being taken by bus between Newry and Dundalk.</P>
    <P>In all, the line has been closed for some 45 days since 16 December 1988.  As I said in my opening comments, the British authorities are aware of the importance of keeping the line open and safe for travel.  Deputies will appreciate that due regard must be had to the necessity to ensure that lives will not be put at risk by a hurried reopening.</P>
    <P>It is hard to understand what those who endanger the lives of civilian train passengers expect to gain from a bombing campaign against a railway line which brings passengers and freight to and from both parts of our island.  The objective of this campaign appears to be to close down this link.  How can action which divides be <Col N="2304" /> reconciled with the objective of unifying and bringing together?</P>
    <P>The disregard for human life by those responsible for this campaign was chillingly demonstrated yet again by the appalling killing of Miss Joanne Reilly in Warrenpoint, County Down.  I am sure that all Deputies will want to join me in condemning this killing of an innocent young girl.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that, as we approach 1992 and the progressive elimination of barriers between North and South, the continuing campaign of violence &mdash; as reflected in the attacks on the North/South rail links &mdash; are deepening the division between the two parts of the island and seriously damaging ongoing business, Trade and personal links between North and South, and their further development.</P>
    <P>The damaging effects of partition on the economies of both parts of the island are well known.  As the Tánaiste said in a public statement he issued on 13 March last, union representatives have estimated that the jobs of some 400 persons working either with Iarnród Éireann or the Northern Ireland Railways are in jeopardy.  Those responsible for the bombing campaign and anyone who has influence upon them should think about the effect of these actions in placing the livelihood of these workers in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, a Cheann Comhairle, I would appeal again to all engaged in violence to consider the appalling effect of their campaign and to desist from activities which can have no place in the Ireland we are trying to build.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 20 April 1989.</P>

      <P>Hedco received an administration grant of £117,000 in 1986, £100,000 in 1987, £55,000 in 1988 and £27,500 in 1989.  There will be no administration grant in 1990.  A management fee structure for projects has been replacing the administration grant since 1986. Management fees paid by the Department of Foreign Affairs to Hedco have increased from £18,000 in 1986 to £42,000 in 1987 to £89,000 in 1988 and an estimated £90,000 in 1989.  In the Department's view this change is a valuable one <Col N="2158" /> in that it reflects more accurately the independent status of Hedco.</P>
      <P>The total allocation to Hedco in administration grants and fees in the period 1986-89 is as follows: £135,000 in 1986, £142,000 in 1987, £144,000 in 1988 and an estimated £118,000 in 1989.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the foregoing that Hedco received increases up to the current year, as the Department made a special effort to assist Hedco in the transition to the management fee system.  The percentage reduction in Hedco's income from the Department in 1989 over 1986 is less than the reduction in the bilateral aid programme in the same period.</P>
      <P>An allocation of £100,000 was made to the small projects scheme in 1986 and £70,000 in 1987.  Owing to budgetary constraints, the scheme was suspended in 1988.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs will continue to pay Hedco management fees for the projects it manages on the Department's behalf.  In addition to such management fees, Hedco is well placed to continue to win international development contracts.</P>

      <P>The courts here have determined that passport facilities may only be granted to children under 18 with the consent of the child's natural parents or legal guardians.  As the Deputy will be aware in the absence of alternate arrangements under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, the natural parents of a foster child retain guardianship of the child.  Thus in the case of passport applications for foster children the Passport Office is obliged to seek the written witnessed consent of both parents before issuing a passport.</P>
      <P>If one or both natural parents cannot be contacted or if their whereabouts are unknown, the Passport Office endeavours to deal as sympathetically as possible with the application.  In these circumstances the office asks for a sworn affidavit from the responsible social worker regarding the whereabouts of the natural parents and indicating, if appropriate, that the relevant health board has no objection to the issue of passport facilities.</P>

      <P>As we have previously done in this area, Ireland will participate in co-ordination among the member states of the European Community in all relevant areas covered by European Political Co-operation (EPC) or under Community competence.

      <P>The Government are not preparing any new initiative in this area at present but our concern about it and our strong support for international action in relation to it are clearly on record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final document of the international conference on the relationship between disarmament and development, which met in New York in August-September 1987, sets out an agreed action programme in the area of disarmament and development.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, I addressed the conference and set out in a full way the Government's views and priorities in this important and complex area.  The Government fully subscribe to the action programme of the international conference which represents the current extent of international consensus in this field.  The Government attach particular importance to the reaffirmation in the final document of the international commitment to allocate a <Col N="2168" /> portion of the resources released through disarmament for the purposes of social and economic development with a view to bridging the economic gap between developed and developing countries.  The Government will avail of all appropriate opportunities to restate their commitment to this goal and welcome the fact that the question of disarmament and development, in the light of the agreed action programme, will be kept under periodic review by the General Assembly of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>On a more general level, the Government's views in the area of disarmament and the priorities that Ireland would wish to see adopted by the international community, were set out in the address which the Taoiseach made to the UN Third Special Session on Disarmament in June 1988.  This address lays the basis of the approach which Ireland will adopt in its involvement in the area of arms control and disarmament at the international level.  The Taoiseach also discussed disarmament issues with Mr. Gorbachev during his recent stopover at Shannon.</P>

      <P>The Irish delegation has consistently voted in favour of resolutions of the General Assembly and of the Commission on Human Rights criticising aspects of the human rights situation in Chile.  In our view a resolution adopted by the General Assembly last December was not sufficiently explicit in its condemnation of torture and the other infringements of human rights in Chile referred to in the last report of the special rapporteur.  The Irish delegate made a statement to that effect.</P>

      <P>An Irish passport is a valuable document of identity which can only be issued following careful checks on identity. It would not, I believe, be in the interest of the Irish public to sacrifice security for speed nor would it serve to maintain the integrity of the Irish passport. For this reason a passport cannot simply be available on demand &mdash; except in the case of a genuine emergency which will always be dealt with quickly and sympathetically.</P>
      <P>Having said this, I would make the point that normal applications for passports received by post are processed and a passport is issued in five working days if the application is in order.  Personal callers to the Passport Office are normally dealt with within 30 to 40 minutes but this can increase during times of increased demand.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated to the Dáil I am satisfied that the Passport Office provides a good standard of service to the Irish public.  The office is computerised and it has a good telephone system recently updated.  All aspects of the office are constantly monitored and where a need for change is identified changes are made.  At the moment, in anticipation of the summer rush, 65 temporary staff have been taken on in addition to the 23 permanent staff.  Should the need arise I will arrange that extra temporary staff be employed.  I would appeal to all those who intend holidaying abroad this year to check that they have an up-to-date passport and, if not, to apply in good time by post.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the specific programmes affecting women, either at work, on the farm, in the social welfare system or at home which will form part of the Government's programme of preparation for 1992 and the implementation of the Single European Act; and the financial input to these programmes which is envisaged both from the Irish Exchequer and from EC funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The major programmes affecting women at work and on the farm are in large measure those which will also affect men. Combating unemployment will be the major objective of Government policy in relation to the completion of the internal market.  Of considerable importance in this connection will be programmes designed to meet skill and technological requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will continue to promote the participation of women at all levels in the labour force particularly in growth areas and sectors of the economy and to promote access by women by women to courses and <Col N="2181" /> programmes in which female participation is traditionally low.</P>
    <P>In relation to positive measures in favour of women and the improvement of the mechanisms designed to eliminate gender discrimination at work, the development of our policy and programmes between now and 1992 will be influenced by considerations of both natural and Community origin.  I have already indicated that I will amend the law to make the appeals machinery more effective.  Among the main Community considerations which will impact on the size and nature of Government programmes will be the Commission assessment on the 1986-1990 programme for equality of opportunity for women following which proposals will be drafted for future action.  Other proposals in the pipeline include an examination of Community rules generally on equal treatment, a proposed Directive on the burden of proof and the preparation of a code of conduct regarding pregnancy and maternity.</P>
    <P>There are no implications for the Irish social welfare system, either generally or as it applies to women, arising out of the Government's programme of preparation for 1992 and implementation of the Single European Act.  The EC has, however, adopted a number of Directives in recent years which have implications for Irish social welfare, particularly as it relates to women.  The terms of these Directives have been or are in the process of being provided for in legislation by this country.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to isolate the exact financial inputs involved.</P>

      <P>The North West Community Development Institute is managed by a sub-committee of County Donegal VEC. It is responsible for a community development project designed to test the effectiveness of approaches to community development in rural areas.  Its <Col N="2184" /> director is a member of the VEC's staff on secondment from Letterkenny RTC. The institute is responsible for meeting the costs of the project which provides training for 100 people under the age of 25.  An application for assistance from the European Social Fund was made through my Department.  The European Commission agreed to meet 55 per cent of an agreed level of expenditure for a period of two years up to 30 June 1989.  The balance of the expenditure will be met by the institute from it's own resources.</P>
      <P>At the end of the experimental period an evaluation of the project will be carried out.  In the meantime any further approaches to the EC for assistance for projects of this nature would not be entertained by the Commission due to the fact that support for this project was granted on a pilot basis pending evaluation of its outcome.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92, 93 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>While I endorse the aspirations expressed in the report of the School Guidance Committee I would not necessarily accept all of the views and recommendations contained in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2185" /> When the overall financial position improves I hope to be in a position to respond to them.</P>
    <P>In the interim I have arranged to have copies of the report issued to the authorities of post-primary schools as I believe that it should prove very useful to guidance teachers and to school authorities.</P>
    <P>The Government commitment to the guidance service is indicated by the fact that it rescinded the decision of the previous administration to bring all guidance posts within the school quota.  The authorities of secondary, community and comprehensive schools of fewer than 500 pupils are free to appoint guidance teachers from within the staffing quotas of their respective schools but I am not in a position to allow them to appoint such teachers ex-quota.  However, in the case of such schools with more than 500 pupils guidance teachers may now be appointed ex-quota.  In the case of vocational schools it is the responsibility of each vocational education committee to apportion the services of guidance teachers to the schools as appropriate.</P>
