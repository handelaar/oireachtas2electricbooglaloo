      <P>Thank you.  I thought for a while I was invisible.  I have on a number of occasions raised the question of the Child Care Bill and when it will be processed in this House.  I understand from press reports that there is a problem with regard to establishing a committee to deal with it.  Could the Tánaiste indicate to the House what precisely is going on in relation to this Bill, if a committee is being established and, if so, can he ensure that all parties in this House, including The Workers' Party, are represented on it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 2, subsection (1), line 12, to delete &ldquo;,whether or not in conjunction <Col N="248" /> with any other means,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;or by any other means or by wireless telegraphy in conjunction with any other means&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; in the Bill as it stands covers the transmission, relaying or distribution of sounds or visual images by wireless telegraphy on its own or in conjunction with any other means.  In other words, the definition includes the emitting of electro-magnetic energy over paths which are not provided by any material substance by a process which is literally &ldquo;wire-less&rdquo;, as well as a combination of &ldquo;wire-less&rdquo; and &ldquo;wire&rdquo;, &ldquo;cable&rdquo; or any other substance.  Most people receive their television reception by means of wire and wire-less technology.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Bill in the other House it was argued that the definition of &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; did not include transmission of visual images or sounds by cable or wire systems on their own.  I undertook to consult the draftsman to see if it would be possible to tighten up the definition of &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; so as to obviate the possibility of a loophole emerging in the light of advancing technology.  The amendment I am now proposing is the outcome of those consultations.</P>
    <P>The effect of the amendment is probably best illustrated by an example.  If a cable operator was to insert a recorded item directly into the system, that item would be covered by the Bill as it stands. However, if he inserted a live studio discussion, advertisement or whatever, it would not be covered.  The effect of this amendment would be to bring under the provisions of the Bill any such transmission by means of any material such as cable or wire on its own.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a number of amendments which are either related or alternatives.  They are amendments Nos. 2, 8, 9, 10, 13, 17, 18, 19, 24, 25, 26, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39.  I am suggesting therefore that we discuss these <Col N="249" /> amendments together, by agreement.  Is that satisfactory?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `ethnic origins' includes references to the group of persons within the State known as the Travelling Community, which community traditionally pursue, or whose forebears traditionally pursued, a nomadic way of life;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage of this Bill there was a lot of discussion about the inclusion of the travelling community within the terms of the Bill.  I think it would be fair to say that there was consensus on the need for relevance of this Bill to the Irish position, despite the reason for introducing the Bill being an attempt to comply with a United Nations convention.  I certainly made the point on Second Stage that we should take the opportunity to ensure that our legislation is relevant to the home situation and that the kind of problems we have in relation to racism or prejudice relate to a very large extent to the problems which the travelling community experience.</P>
      <P>I seek in amendment No. 2 to include within the definition or interpretation section references to the travelling community. There is a number of aspects of the method I have chosen that I would like to explain to the House.  Later I will seek to amend the Title of the Bill to include the word &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo;.  That was referred to on Second Stage also.  The interpretation of &ldquo;ethnic origins&rdquo; should be spelled out as it is a phrase not in common usage and not readily discernible from references to racial origins. It is worth while differentiating between the two.  It would also serve the purposes of the Bill &mdash; to stamp out incitement to racial or ethnic hatred &mdash; to make specific reference to who would be included among ethnic groups.  One of these should be the travelling community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much support within the community at large for the inclusion of the <Col N="250" /> travelling community among ethnic groups.  For the sake of clarity it would be very useful to state definitely that we wish to include the travelling community under that heading rather than leave it up to the court to decide at a later stage. Given that we do not have any legislation of this on the Statute Book, cases dealing with this matter have not come before the courts.  The courts should be given guidance; certainly, the courts should be aware of what was in our minds when we were passing this legislation.  There is no doubt that it was in our minds on Second Stage to ensure that the travelling community do not suffer from the kind of offence covered in this Bill that is, the incitement to hatred.  I put down this amendment to ensure that there is no doubt nor is there doubt what the travelling community consist of.</P>
    <P>I see a difficulty with some of the related amendments because they do not include any definition of what the travelling community consists of.  For the sake of clarity in the Bill and to ensure that the courts are given proper guidance on how to interpret it, it is worth incorporating a reference to what the travelling community consists of.  To a large extent I use as an example section 13 of the Housing Act, 1988, which deals with the provision of halting sites for travellers. Subsection (1) of that section states that the section applies to persons belonging to the class of persons who traditionally pursue or have pursued a nomadic way of life.  I have converted that for the purposes of this Bill to make it quite clear that &ldquo;ethnic origins&rdquo; should, first, refer to a group known as the travelling community and, secondly, that that community is explained for legal purposes, as a community which traditionally pursue or whose forebears traditionally pursued a nomadic way of life.</P>
    <P>The travelling community are not, as the term indicates, a community constantly on the move.  Some of that community move around regularly but others of that community, as an ethnic group, have settled and taken up residence in houses.  Some live permanently, to all <Col N="251" /> intents and purposes, in halting sites but not in traditional housing as we know it. Others move about some months of the year while others still move about constantly.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we incorporate all parts of the travelling community within the terminology of this Bill.  It would be unfortunate if we were to pass the Bill, and an amendment to it which was so loose as not to allow any real definition of the kind of people we are trying to cater for, or is so tight that it excludes those who legitimately could see themselves as being very much part of that ethnic group, of the travelling community.</P>
    <P>I believe quite strongly that the travelling community are an ethnic group for the following reasons.  Any ethnic group is one which can point to a long shared history, and there is no doubt that in Ireland it is recognised that the travelling community fall into that category.  They have a separate culture, a separate way of life and a separate language which albeit is not used, but then neither is the Irish language used every day by everybody who lives in Ireland.  That does not mean we do not see it as part of our heritage.  For those reasons I believe the travelling community fit into the normal, accepted interpretation of an ethnic group.</P>
    <P>First, it is worth stressing that in the Bill.  Second, it would be unfortunate if, by our terminology in the Bill, as some of the other amendments put down state, we sought to exclude the travelling community from being incorporated in the term &ldquo;ethnic group&rdquo;.  There is no doubt that if we were to do that, following the passage of this legislation, it would be referred to as the <i>status quo.</i>  To a certain extent, that would defeat the purpose of what we are trying to achieve here, which is to recognise that the travelling community are a separate group within our society.  That was recognised on Second Stage.  If this is so, why not include them in one of the categories in the Bill, that is, an ethnic group, a group of people who have a separate ethnic origin?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> Some of the amendments seek to create separate groups not already covered in the Bill.  The Bill outlaws incitement to racial hatred against groups on grounds of race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins.  I cannot understand why we should seek to add further groups.  I note that the Minister on Second Stage, both in this House and in the other House, was at pains to say that he did not want to specify particular groups in the Bill, in other words, he did not want to single groups out because he felt that if we were to go down that road we would run into a minefield with other groups wishing to be included.  I can appreciate why he does not wish to go down that road.  That is why I believe, that for the sake of clarity and of adhering to the Bill as drafted, we should keep within the wording we already have but to indicate that &ldquo;ethnic origins&rdquo; should include references to the travelling community.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to seriously consider the fact that we may not foresee the difficulties which may follow if an amendment is passed which seeks to add the travelling community to the definition.  I have no doubt it will cause the travelling community to be seen as separate, apart from any categories mentioned in the Bill, which would be unfortunate and not in keeping with the spirit which was evident in this House on Second Stage.  It is unnecessary and I appeal to the Minister and other parties to accept the premise that the travelling community should be included within one of the groups already catered for in the Bill.  My amendment covers the basic idea that they should be covered in the group and the definition, however loose, but still faithful to what the travelling community is, should be included for the guidance of the courts.</P>

      <P>There is agreement between all parties in the House that there is a need to recognise that the largest ethnic minority group, consisting of about 20,000 members, is the travelling community.  I dislike having to argue the point as to which is the best amendment to accept when we are all talking about the same thing.  However, as Deputy Colley made her case, I feel obliged to make mine.  It is unfortunate that there has been a great deal of lobbying over the past week or so by some people who are concerned about the plight of the travelling community.  We are all concerned about the plight of the travelling community and in a civilised society nobody could tolerate any from of incitement to hatred or discrimination against any particular group.</P>
      <P>I have read the various documentation to justify the argument that the travelling community are an ethnic group.  If they are an ethnic group there is no need to table an amendment to this Bill because ethnic groups are automatically included. However, I fear &mdash; it may sound ridiculous &mdash; that someone who feels aggrieved by something published about them would have to go to court to prove membership of the travelling community as we know it.  Everybody knows what is meant by the travelling community but the reality is that some of its members now live in ordinary housing estates and have integrated with normal society.  I do not mean to be disrespectful to the travelling community but that is the reality.  People may marry into the travelling community because the more integration there is with the settled community &mdash; which we are all trying to achieve &mdash; the more likely it is that people will marry into those families.  In five or ten years time will someone who marries into one of those families have to go to court to prove that he or she is part of an ethnic group going back to the 12th century?  That would be wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having thought about this and studied the matter, I came to the conclusion that <Col N="254" /> if the travelling community are an ethnic group they are automatically covered in the Bill and there is no need for an amendment.  However, in recognition of their special position in the community it is worth while adding &ldquo;or membership of the travelling community&rdquo; because in that way people within the community who can prove that their origins go back to the 12th century are automatically included.  Even if such wording is superfluous it will not damage the legislation. My amendments do not damage the case of those who want it generally accepted that the travelling community are an ethnic group.  As I said, there is evidence to show that that is the case but there are difficulties.</P>
    <P>Some members of the travelling community are now settled in ordinary local authority housing estates and they are part of a group comprising 300 or 400 houses.  Thankfully, their sons and daughters are attending the local primary and secondary schools, they are part of the community and they do not stick out like a sore thumb.  There is the possibility of the children marrying into the settled community in future.  It would be an unfortunate situation if those people had to go to court to prove they were covered under this Bill because they are part of an ethnic group.  If we include &ldquo;or membership of the travelling community&rdquo; we cover both sides.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept my amendment and the arguments I put forward.  I also ask the Opposition parties to accept that the wording tabled as an amendment is probably the safest one.  It will not damage the case made by those who want to prove &mdash; rightly &mdash; that the travelling community are an ethnic group.  I am sure the Minister will be arguing that ethnic groups are mentioned.  We should demonstrate that the Houses of the Oireachtas want to pay particular attention to a group in society who have suffered and are likely to suffer in the future. We should pay particular attention to the plight of those people and refer to them in legislation.  I do not want to get into political argument about this; maybe I am wrong and if people can convince me <Col N="255" /> I am wrong I will accept it.  I do not think that is the right way to go about this. All parties have been concerned, as is evidenced from the debates in the Dáil and Seanad, about the need to include a reference to the travelling community in the Bill.  If there is a need to make specific reference to them in the Bill we must find another form of words and I have suggested such a form in my amendment. If we say that they are an ethnic group they are automatically covered.  The Minister has argued that there is no need to specify any group if they are an ethnic group but we want specific reference to the travelling community in the Bill.  I suggest that the wording in my amendment is the most suitable for inclusion.</P>

      <P>At the conclusion of the debate on Second Stage, and when the provisions of the Bill were being reviewed in the media, I thought a suggestion had come from the Minister that he would take on board our point about the travelling community.  I had expected to see an amendment today in the Minister's name dealing with the issue of the travelling community.  I am disappointed that the Minister left it to the Opposition parties to table amendments to include the travelling community.  It may be that the Minister has in mind to accept the amendment he regards as the most suitable or most appropriate and for that reason I will be interested in hearing his response this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Broadly speaking, I agree with the comments made by Deputies Colley and Seán Barrett.  Deputy Barrett made a point that it would be unfair to expect a member of the travelling community to prove in court that he or she was part of an ethnic group.  However, that is not quite the way it will work out because it will not be the responsibility of a member of the travelling community to prove that.  In my view it will be the responsibility of the prosecution to prove that the travelling community are an ethnic group within the meaning of the terms of the Bill.  That might present a problem for the prosecution and I do not think that <Col N="256" /> in preparing legislation we should put difficulties in the way of the prosecution. Those who prosecute in our courts have difficulties enough in the present climate of rising crime, escalating vandalism and with the resources of the enforcement agencies such as the Garda Síochána being stretched beyond all recognition, without more problems being put in their way.  The Minister will be aware of the most recent crime statistics.</P>
    <P>When introducing legislation to protect certain categories of people we should make it as simple as possible.  In the course of the debate here, and in the Seanad, the Minister argued that it was not necessary to mention the travelling community.  That may be so but I wonder why we should leave any doubt when we do not need to?  Let us simplify the matter and put it beyond yea or nay by mentioning the travelling community as a category we seek to protect.  In my view it is necessary to include such a provision but even if that is not necessary I wonder why the Minister does not include them so as to put the matter beyond any doubt. He may be saving the prosecution from having to call expert evidence in court to establish whether that group come within the definition of the provision.  The travelling community are seeking this additional protection and a specific mention in the Bill.  We should accord that to them.  It may be said that it is unusual, unnecessary or not the practice to mention specific groups in legislation but that is not so.  In point of fact our Constitution makes specific mention of some groups; they are given specific recognition as an entity.  If that is acceptable in the Constitution it should be acceptable in a Bill.</P>
    <P>The Opposition parties are agreed that the travelling community should have the protection they seek and it is my hope that the Minister will reconsider his position during the course of the debate and agree to our amendments.  The argument has been put forward that if one group are included we will be widening the scope of the legislation with the result that there will be no end to the list of groups one might seek to include.  One could mention many groups that come in for abuse or <Col N="257" /> denigration from time to time.  One could mention politicians, for example, who very often are abused and so on, but we are not suggesting that they should be included in the Bill.  Solicitors may be considered as another group but I am not suggesting that they should be included.</P>

      <P>One has to be practical and sensible about this.  We all recognise that there is a number of groups who should be catered for in new legislation. One such group is the travelling community. I do not think we need open up a broad principle to the effect that if one or two groups are mentioned we should include many others.  The first point is that we have not heard of pressure from other groups to be included, other than the travelling community and the gay community who are mentioned in my amendment.  They feel the need for mention in the Bill and for protection.</P>
      <P>The difference between my amendment and those proposed by Deputies Colley and Barrett is that mine includes protection against hatred being caused to people on account of their sexual orientation. I understand that The Workers' Party have tabled an amendment along similar lines.  It is a fact that in this State people of a certain sexual orientation, in particular the gay community, have been and continue to be in certain circumstances subjected to vilification. They are held up to contempt and ridicule and if we do not include them in the Bill they will not be covered by its provisions. Why should we not cover them in the Bill?  They are human beings and citizens of the State who are entitled to the protection of the law and the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are introducing legislation to prohibit incitement to hatred against certain groups what reason can we have for excluding the people I have mentioned? What benefit can it be to anybody to exclude them from the protection they seek?  Perhaps it is not necessary to comply with the convention that they should be specifically included.  I have not studied in detail the exact wording but <Col N="258" /> the Minister has said it is not necessary to include them in order to comply with the convention.  All right; so it is not, but, just the same, let us include it.  We know that incitement to hatred does go on where the gay community are concerned, that they are fair game, that they are held up and pilloried on occasion, not in any widespread or great way, but even to a small extent it can be extremely hurtful to those people.  Why do we not do the right thing?</P>
    <P>I am sure we all know in our hearts that it is the right thing to do.  Why do we not give them the protection they seek seeing we are today about the business of bringing in legislation on the basis of protection of people from being held up to hatred and incitement against them for no good reason?  I urge Members here to take that on board now that we are given the opportunity and this is the time to do so.  It has been done in many other countries, notably the Scandinavian ones who have written into their legislation the protection I seek in my amendment for the members of the gay community.  It is generally recognised that in social and liberal thinking the Scandinavian countries are advanced.  I applaud the liberal attitude they take on these matters.  We should and could learn from them.  Why not?  They have done it.  It is done in other forward-looking countries who take an advanced notion, who adopt advanced ideas on this subject.  I believe we should do so.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point in respect of which my amendment differs somewhat from others along those lines and I ask the Minister and my colleagues here to consider it.  It is this, that throughout the Bill there is reference to the word &ldquo;hatred&rdquo;; &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; is the word that is used.  That is all right as far as it goes but there can be, and often are, circumstances in which the material published or distributed might be construed as bringing the group concerned into circumstances leaving them susceptible to contempt or ridicule which is different from the notion of hatred.  For example, a group can be held up to ridicule, to look stupid, held up to be an object of <Col N="259" /> contempt in the eyes of the public.  I do not want to see circumstance evolve in which nice, fine axes are being debated and discussed in court as to whether circumstances in which a group is held up to ridicule or contempt excludes them under the provisions of this Bill because it does not hold them up to hatred.  The definition should be widened so that as well as &ldquo;hatred&rdquo;&ldquo;ridicule&rdquo; and &ldquo;contempt&rdquo; are included.  I have incorporated that concept in my amendment which I would ask the House to consider favourably.</P>

      <P>I want to address myself to the amendments in my name and those of other members of The Workers' party, No. 9, and related amendments Nos. 18, 25, 36 and 39. What these amendments seek to do is change the Title of the Bill to include ethnic as well as national hatred.  Our amendment No. 9 seeks to include &ldquo;members of the travelling community&rdquo; and &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo;.  To a large extent the case has been made by other Deputies in relation to these two groups. However, I want to make a number of points.  The point made by Deputy Barrett that one is either of an ethnic group or one is not is not as simple as that. Unfortunately, it is not so clear-cut that people can be designated one or the other by looking into their eyes or so ascertaining in any other way; it is very difficult to define a person as being a member of an ethnic group.  That is why to some extent, like Deputy Barrett, we have included specifically the travelling community in our amendment.  The case has been made and I hope the Minister will be able to respond positively.  It is important to include them specifically, indeed to include the outlawing of incitement to hatred arising from sexual orientation also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are two specific areas with which Ireland has a problem.  For example, we <Col N="260" /> do not have a large coloured population in this State although, at the same time, there is a degree of latent racism in Irish society which was highlighted by the Micheál Mac Gréil report in 1977 &mdash; on Prejudice and Tolerance in Ireland &mdash; when he undertook a survey in the Dublin area which makes interesting reading with regard to attitudes to coloureds, the English, Scots and Welsh, the handicapped, Jews and a whole range of people, including drug addicts, itinerants and criminals.  For instance, it is interesting to note that when people were asked whether they would like particular categories to come into their families, the responses were that 51 per cent only would welcome Russians into their families through marriage.  On the other hand, the average percentage who would welcome other European categories were 80 per cent in the case of attitudes towards &ldquo;British&rdquo;, &ldquo;English&rdquo;, &ldquo;Scottish&rdquo; and &ldquo;Welsh&rdquo;, despite the common belief that there is a lot of anti-British or anti-European feeling in this country.</P>
    <P>That report went on to point out that responses to specific social categories were positive in respect of some disadvantaged groups.  For instance, widows would be welcomed into the family by 89 per cent; handicapped by 77 per cent; unmarried mothers by 79 per cent &mdash; despite views expressed on the Gay Byrne Show.  Deserted wives would be welcomed by 77 per cent; the unemployed by 69 per cent; heavy drinkers by 36 per cent; unfortunately, alcoholics by 22 per cent only; drug addicts by 20 per cent and itinerants and criminals by less than 30 per cent.  Clearly there is a problem <i>via-á-vis</i> people's understanding of a whole range of social problems people face.  Itinerants, or travellers as they are now called, are a very distinctive group in Irish society.  We do not have another large distinctive group of that kind.  For that reason it would be important for us to refer to them specifically in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I referred to the question of sexual orientation.  These are people who, while they do not constitute an ethnic or racial group nevertheless should be included in this Bill.  This group is comprised of men <Col N="261" /> and women who, by and large, feel oppressed.  Whatever the growing liberalisation of Irish society may hold for them very many of them feel they cannot declare their sexual orientation.  They fear that, if they did so, they would be discriminated against in various ways. Unfortunately the provisions of this Bill do not deal with discrimination <i>per se;</i> they deal with incitement to hatred.  It would constitute a step in the right direction if we could ensure that publications and the broadcasting media could not be used to incite hatred against this section of our population.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to refer to the International Bill of Human Rights Articles to which we are seeking to make our laws amenable.  For example, Article 3 reads:</P>
    <P>The State's parties to the present Covenant undertake to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all civil and political rights set forth in the present Covenant.</P>
    <P>That places an obligation on us to ensure that those areas in which there is obvious discrimination and the possibility of incitement to hatred in Irish society be dealt with specifically under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Article 26 of the same Bill states:</P>
    <P>All persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law.  In this respect, the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case to be made for including the categories I have referred to in amendment No. 9 and in related amendments Nos. 18, 25, 36 and 39.</P>
    <P>I do not particularly want to get into a debate on ethnicism.  The question as to whether travellers are an ethnic group is one which I am sure will be debated for <Col N="262" /> a very long time.  There are sections of the travelling community who argue very strongly that they are an ethnic group and if they feel, as they obviously do, that in defining themselves in that way they will have a better chance of achieving equality of treatment before the law and equality of treatment in Irish society then I have no objections to this.  I see problems down the road, so to speak, in that approach.  Nevertheless the travellers' group are not of such huge proportions as to create major problems for Irish society if they are defined as an ethnic group.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to take on board the arguments which have been made by all the deputies on this side of the House with regard to the travelling community and also the arguments made by Deputy Taylor and I in relation to sexual orientation. I would point out to the Minister that I put an amendment down to the Video Recording Bill on incitement to hatred with regard to sexual orientation and so forth.  The Minister pointed out that the matter would be dealt with under this Bill and, therefore, did not take on board the amendment at that stage but I would ask him to take it on board now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three separate elements in this group of amendments&mdash; the travelling community, sexual orientation and ridicule or contempt.  I will deal with these three elements separately in my reply.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I said that I would be favourably disposed towards amendments which would explicitly include the travelling community and I now have before me for consideration several amendments proposing different solutions to how the travelling community should be so included.  Having examined these amendments I have come to the conclusion that the simple approach is the best one and accordingly I propose to accept amendments Nos. 8, 17 and 24 and I will now give my reasons for so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The term &ldquo;the travelling community&rdquo; is now a well known and much used expression.  As Deputy Colley said on <Col N="263" /> Second Stage, everyone knows who is being referred to when the term is used and there is no confusion.  If I was to define the term I would immediately come up against two difficulties.  The first is finding a definition which excludes persons who travel around a lot either as a way of life or as part of a job but are not members of the travelling community as commonly understood.  If I came up with such a definition I would then come up against a second difficulty, that is, how to include travellers who have settled either completely or for part of the year.  There would always be a danger when attempting a definition that some person would be inadvertently included or excluded. That is a risk that would have to be considered if &ldquo;the travelling community&rdquo; was not such an accepted and well understood expression.  I have had discussions on this point with the Parliamentary Draftsman and the Attorney General and the consensus of opinion is that, as with the other terms such as race, ethnic origins and national origins, no definition is necessary.</P>
    <P>The other approach I would have difficulty with would be to define &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; as including the travelling community, regardless of whether it was confined to the purpose of this Bill.  For a start it would not give travellers one with of protection more than they will get anyway. Indeed it is ironic that some of the people who would most like to see this approach are the most constant proponents of the theory that travellers are an ethnic minority. If I was sure of this I would be saying that as the travellers are already covered by the Bill there is no need to mention them by name.  To do so would be tautological and that would be bad drafting.  However, I am not so sure, and on the basis of present knowledge about the history of the travellers there may be certain indications but little proof of their origins.  I could not agree to a definition now that would tie the hands of the courts and could one day turn out to be factually wrong.</P>
    <P>One day the courts may be asked to decide on whether the travellers are a <Col N="264" /> distinct ethnic group.  If that happens, which in the context of this legislation it cannot if the amendments I am accepting are made, the courts will make their decision in the light of prevailing knowledge of the history and background of the travellers.  That knowledge may well be at a far more advanced stage than it is today.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I am happy to accept amendments Nos. 8, 17 and 24.  I am satisfied that these will give the travelling community the maximum protection afforded by the Bill with no qualifications brought about by definitions or other extraneous matters.  This is one of those all too rare occasions when there is unanimity as to what we are trying to achieve and I might add that, any disagreement there may be is on matters of detail.  I hope that I have managed to convince Deputies that the amendments in the name of Deputy Barrett which I am accepting are the correct ones, both in drafting and policy, and fully meet the intentions of the other amendments I do not propose to accept.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of including &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo; in the definition of hatred.  I am not accepting the amendments that include this proposal.  In my Second Stage speech I referred to the various international human rights instruments which provide the background to the Bill now before this House.  This Bill was prepared in the light of the recommendations of an interdepartmental committee which was established to identify the legislative changes necessary to enable this country to ratify the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. What we have before us today is a Bill which gives effect to one of the recommendations of that committee.  In other words, and I would like to stress this point, this Bill is aimed at removing one of the obstacles in the way of ratifying the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  The Covenant provision in question refers only to &ldquo;national, racial or religious hatred&rdquo;.  In the Bill this has been broadened to cover also the expression used in the corresponding provision in the UN Convention on Racial Discrimination, <Col N="265" /> which refers to &ldquo;race, colour, or ethnic origin&rdquo;.  The category of person now covered by the definition of &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; in sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill is accordingly very wide &mdash; it covers &ldquo;race, colour, nationality, religion or ethnic or national origins&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This legislation breaks new ground. The ambit of this legislation is very wide as can be seen from the very broad categories covered by the definition of &ldquo;hatred&rdquo;&mdash; a definition that is now being extended by the inclusion of &ldquo;members of the travelling community&rdquo;.  If I appeared to hesitate over the inclusion of the travellers in the definition of hatred, it was to some extent in the knowledge that specifically mentioning them would be seen by some almost as an invitation to redouble their efforts for the inclusion of other categories.  It may be one particular group that is pressing now &mdash; next month or next year it could be another group and so on.  The case for inclusion of the travellers has been made, and accepted, the case for sexual orientation has not.</P>
    <P>I want to make it very clear that I do not condone the use of abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or the incitement of hatred, directed against any particular section of the community. However, as with all legislation, this Bill has certain objectives and I am satisfied that they have been met.  A point is invariably reached beyond which it would not be reasonable to go and it is my contention that that point has been reached and any further additions to the definition of &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; would be to the detriment of the Bill as a whole.</P>
    <P>The third element in this group of amendments is the question of ridicule and contempt.  I appreciate the Deputy's intentions with this proposal but I have to say that it is neither practical nor desirable and I am opposing it.</P>
    <P>Under sections 2, 3 and 4 it will be an offence for a person to act or speak, as set out in the sections, in such a way as to be threatening, abusive or insulting with the intent or likelihood of hatred being stirred up.  These words, &ldquo;threatening&rdquo;. &ldquo;abusive&rdquo; and &ldquo;insulting&rdquo;, are <Col N="266" /> well known and have been included in legislation both here and abroad for a long time.  They appear in the Dublin Police Act of 1842, section 14, where there is an offence of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, with intent to provoke a breach of the peace, or whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned.</P>
    <P>They are strong words, as indeed is hatred.  They mean more than &ldquo;annoying&rdquo; or, &ldquo;ridicule&rdquo; or treating somebody with contempt.  They are undefined &mdash; but are clear in their meaning, a meaning which any ordinary citizen can understand. I think our ordinary citizen would, for example, know an insult when he or she saw one.  However, it would not be appropriate to penalise those who say or publish something in bad taste.</P>
    <P>To ridicule a group of persons may not be ideal human behaviour but it is certainly not a crime and I do not intend to make it one.  In its ordinary meaning, to ridicule is to mock or to laugh at and to have contempt for someone is to be scornful.  To accept the Deputy's amendment would leave the legislation so lacking in the type of respect and sense of fairness that all legislation needs in order to be acceptable that it would be worthless. Also, as I have said on more than one occasion when explaining this Bill, we have had to be very careful not to include anything that might infringe the constitutional rights of free speech.  I submit that the amendment we are now discussing could well upset the balance we have achieved in the Bill in this respect.</P>

      <P>Overall, therefore, I am accepting amendments Nos. 8, 17 and 24, and opposing Nos. 2, 9, 10, 13, 18, 19, 25 and 26.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the undertaking I gave during the Second Stage debate, I consulted the draftsman on whether the title of the Bill should be amended to include the word &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo;.  He advised that such an amendment was unnecessary. The absence of &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; from the <Col N="267" /> titles &mdash; long or short &mdash; in no way circumscribes its meaning or effectiveness within the Bill.  In the same way, the meaning of the terms &ldquo;colour&rdquo; and &ldquo;national origins&rdquo; are not diminished by their absence from the title and indeed, the same goes for the travelling community. Whether words or phrases are part of the titles will not affect their meaning within an Act but if the titles appeared too precise, the absence of a particular category from them might seem to take on a significance of its own which was not intended.</P>
    <P>The addition of the word &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; to the titles would, in fact, in itself make no difference to the meaning or the scope of the Bill.  I would not regard a negative reason such as that as being good enough for accepting the amendments and, as I pointed out, including the word &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; in the titles now could unnecessarily call into question the absence of other terms such as &ldquo;colour&rdquo; and &ldquo;travelling community&rdquo; from them.  A fairly typical dictionary definition of &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; is that it pertains to race or that it relates to the classification of groups on a cultural, social or some other basis.  Its meaning is very close to &ldquo;race&rdquo;.  Similarly, &ldquo;national origins&rdquo; has a meaning different but nonetheless related to &ldquo;national&rdquo;. &ldquo;Colour&rdquo; in the context of this Bill means something different than &ldquo;race&rdquo; but again it does not appear in the titles.  The fact that &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; is not in the title did not prevent the amendments on the travelling community being accepted and that community are probably closer in meaning to &ldquo;ethnic origins&rdquo; than any of the categories actually included in the titles.</P>
    <P>Members of the House recognise that drafting is a very exact art.  Putting in words or phrases that are unnecessary may not appear at the time to cause any harm, but at some future date the courts may draw some inferences that were unforeseen.  As I said, the absence of other terms from the titles might be questioned if &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; is included but the others are not.</P>
    <P>To sum up very briefly, whether <Col N="268" />&ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; is in the titles makes no difference to its meaning, scope or potential within the Bill, and makes no difference to any other aspect of the Bill.  It is unnecessary.  Imagine somebody being prosecuted for, say, stirring up hatred against a group on account of their &ldquo;ethnic origin&rdquo; and arguing that he is not guilty because the word &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; is not in the Long Title of the Act.  To include it would not be good drafting and it could have unforeseeable repercussions. Therefore, everything considered and in the context of the expert advice available to me, I am unable to accept these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <P>The Minister said that the aim of this Bill is to remove an obstacle to the ratification of the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  I wish he had not put it that way.  I do not think that is quite the right way to put it. I would have preferred if the Minister had said that the object of this Bill is to prohibit the incitement to hatred of various groups who live in this country. Is that not something we ought to be doing and would want to do whether we needed or wanted to ratify an instrument of the United Nations?  We want to do it for its own sake because it is the right and proper thing to do, not because of some technicality regarding the ratification of a United Nations covenant. That may be an incidental point in the matter, but we want to do these things because they need to be done and because it is right that they should be done and because it is appropriate for us as a democratic civilised society, when certain groups may be held up to hatred, to protect them.  That is the object of what we are doing here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he did not condone incitement to hatred for any group.  I accept that but it is not enough just to say it.  If it is proved that there is incitement against any group, one must do something about it when there is an opportunity to do something about it and that opportunity arises here today.  The group known as the gay community are singled out for incitement to hatred from time to <Col N="269" /> time.  The Minister may say he does not condone it but that will not help them very much or stop people from holding them up to ridicule, contempt and hatred. What would help them would be if the Minister wrote into this Bill that it would be an offence to do that.  That is the object of the Labour Party and The Workers' Party amendments and it is right that that should be done regardless of whether it is required by the UN. These people have asked for that protection and they should be given it.</P>
    <P>I accept that the words &ldquo;abuse, and the use of insulting words and behaviour&rdquo; and so on are in the Dublin Police Act, but so is the expression &ldquo;hatred, ridicule and contempt&rdquo;.  I do not understand the Minister's reluctance to accept the broadening of that definition if it is felt that it is right to do that.  Are we saying that it should only be an offence to bring a group into a situation of hatred, if they are pilloried or ridiculed by sketches, insulting drawings and so on?  Is that something that ought not be an offence under this Act?</P>
    <P>Section 3 brings in the words &ldquo;threatening, abusive or insulting&rdquo;.  That is confined to broadcasts.  I do not see that it includes the dissemination of written material which is dealt with in section 2, so my amendment on section 10 is appropriate.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's proposal to accept Deputy Barret's amendments.  Deputy Barret's amendment is perhaps slightly better than mine in relation to including the travelling community, for the reasons he stated.  I have no particular problem with the Minister's case with regard to not including &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; in the title of the Bill. I am not an expert in drafting Bills and I acknowledge the point the Minister has made with regard to the possibility of creating problems in the future.  I welcome the Minister's agreement to include the travelling community specifically in the Bill but I am disappointed at his failure to accept the case for the inclusion of incitement to hatred against people because of their sexual orientation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> Amendment No. 9 in my name and the names of The Workers' Party Deputies is directed at including in section 2 (3) the definition of hatred so as to include people with a different sexual orientation. As the Minister says, the primary purpose of the Bill is to enable us to ratify a UN covention and as Deputy Taylor says there is obviously also the intention to provide protection for groups specifically within the State although I have difficulties with that as well, as another amendment of mine indicates.  Nevertheless the law will protect people on the basis of their colour, nationality, religion, race, ethnic or national origins.  The inclusion of sexual orientation there would bridge a gap in our law.  I will give an example in relation to the neo-Nazi group who operate in the State and who frequently produce publications attacking people because of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic and national origin and their sexual orientation.  When this Bill is passed that group will be prevented from publishing such material in relation to race, colour and so on but they can still produce it in relation to people because of sexual orientation. This omission will be a grave error on the part of this House.  During World War Two there was an appalling slaughter of people by the Nazis.  The vast majority of them, something like six million, were Jews, but it is often forgotten that many more people were slaughtered because of their sexual orientation.  It is part and parcel of the Nazi philosophy to discriminate against and to revile people who do not fit their concept of what a human being ought to represent and people with a different sexual orientation is one of those categories which they have traditionally pursued.  I feel strongly that the Minister should take on board the suggestion to include &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo; in this Bill.  There are very real human problems for people who find themselves, not by choice, in this situation. They do not choose their sexual orientation.  This House has a responsibility to protect them.  We can take a small step, and it would only be a small step to protect them by including in this <Col N="271" /> Bill a reference to sexual orientation. Ideally I would argue that the House must go further and introduce an anti-discrimination Bill, because this Bill does not deal with discrimination <i>per se.</i>  I strongly urge the Minister to reconsider his position.  I am not anxious to press votes on this Bill.  The Minister has been very forthcoming on the cases made by Opposition Deputies so far so it would be unfortunate if Committee Stage were to break down into one or other group challenging votes on particular issues. That is not my purpose, I would rather convince the Minister that sexual orientation should be included and I hope that other Deputies besides myself and Deputy Taylor will support that case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister has taken on board some amendments relating to the inclusion of travellers in the Bill, despite the fact that they are not my own and that I have quite serious reservations about the wording of the amendments he has accepted.</P>
      <P>I will refer to some of the remarks made both by the Minister and Deputy Barrett in their contributions.  It seems that there is a difficulty perceived by the Minister and Deputy Barrett about the definition of travellers.  An example of those difficulties is how one would define travellers who have moved into the settled community and are now living in permanent houses: should they be regarded as members of the travelling community or members of the settled community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those travellers who have moved into settled accommodation and are to all intents and purposes integrated still on occasions suffer from verbal and sometimes physical abuse for the very reason that they are recognised to be apart, to be different, to be of a group called the travelling community, or travellers. Therefore, it is quite important that they be protected and not just those who are travelling on the roads or in halting sites.  It is important that those who have decided to become integrated <Col N="272" /> into the settled population also be given the protection of this Bill.  We all know of cases in recent years where hordes of local residents marched on certain individuals who had moved into a settled community. We all know of slogans seen and abuse that we do not condone.  If this Bill can eradicate that behaviour, that opportunity should be taken.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett also referred to the fact that if the travellers are an ethnic group, an ethnic minority, then they are covered in the Bill anyway.  I agree with him.  They are an ethnic group and will be covered in the Bill.  However, given that the case law in Ireland up to now has not been presented with the opportunity to define an ethnic group, given that we want the travellers to be included in the terms of this Bill, we should make it easy for the courts, and, as Deputy Taylor has said, for the prosecution in any of these cases. If a member of the travelling community makes a complaint under this Bill when enacted that there has been incitement to hatred against him as a member of the travelling community, it will make the case far easier for the prosecution to take up if this individual can simply point to the fact that he is a member of the travelling community, and, as such, is included in an ethnic group.</P>
    <P>The Minister today referred again to his unwillingness to extend the remit of the Bill, or cause unnecessary inclusions of other or separate groups.  In accepting those amendments he is extending the remit of the Bill; he is creating further groups and possibly will cause confusion in the future.  I will not make this a sticking point because it is to be welcomed that travellers are at least mentioned in the Bill.  That was initially the aim of all Deputies.  However, we must have regard to the effect the words we use will have on future court cases.</P>
    <P>One very important aspect that occurred to me during this debate is that, given that the Minister has accepted those amendments there is a question as to whether it will be possible for the courts to find that travellers are an ethnic group after they have been excluded from it in this Bill.  I would ask the Minister to <Col N="273" /> investigate that matter.  He says that in the future the courts may be faced with applications to declare whether the travelling community is an ethnic group.  If at that stage the courts have regard to this legislation they will find that the Act will refer to ethnic or national origins, or membership of the travelling community. They are separate and different.  The courts will then be faced with the problem as to whether they can disregard that completely in their deliberations.  We must be extremely careful about what we do with regard to any amendment that we put forward.  The Minister is right in saying that we should not tie the hands of the courts in making future decisions. Each one of us has said in his or her own way that he or she believes that the travellers are almost definitely an ethnic group, that they have various characteristics. That is what I understand most, if not all, Deputies to be saying here.  If that is the case, why is that not simply included in the Bill as drafted, without extending the scope of the Bill?</P>
    <P>The Minister has accepted these amendments on the basis &mdash; and I think I am right in quoting him on this &mdash; that they are the simplest solution, but it is worth noting that the simplest solution is not always the right one.  The simplest solution may disregard the complexities of the matter and there are undoubted complexities here.  It is not black and white, it is not an easy thing to make such a provision, as any Deputy knows who has sat down to draft amendments.  There are other circumstances to which one must have regard.  I am not saying I have the final answer, but I believe that the safeguards required are better contained in my amendment.  I am not going to push the amendment to the nth degree.  I am asking the Minister between now and Report Stage to consider all the points I am making.  I would be concerned that the net result of accepting these amendments would be that the travelling community would then be excluded from being regarded as an ethnic group in the future.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect which is not <Col N="274" /> included in Deputy Barrett's amendments and which I feel is worth addressing. What constitutes the travelling community?  The Minister quoted me on second Stage as saying that everybody knows who is being referred to when we speak of the travelling community.  I certainly made that point, but it was made for a very different purpose from making a point in courts of law.  The point I made on Second Stage acknowledged that we see the travelling community as a group.  It would not be good enough to go into a court of law and simply say that everybody knows what we mean by the travelling community, therefore they are protected, that a given person looks as if he is a member of the travelling community. Obviously, it was not good enough for the Housing Act of 1988 because it gave a definition that these persons belonged to the class of persons who traditionally pursue or have pursued a nomadic way of life.  It is important to build into any reference to the travelling community what exactly we mean.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of those travellers who have settled.  Should they or can they be included in the definition of travellers?  In my amendment the reference to people &ldquo;whose forebears traditionally pursued...&rdquo; will enable those who are looked upon by the rest of the community as being different, as being travellers, also to claim that they have that heritage and are part of that group. In the accepted amendment, there is no definition, no clarity.  It goes to a court of law with no guidance from this House, which is unfortunate.  Nevertheless, I welcome that the Minister has taken on board a reference to the travellers.  I would ask him if he would be willing between now and Report Stage to look further into tightening up that amendment.</P>

      <P>As one who has had a particular interest in this aspect of the Bill with reference to the travelling community, I very much welcome the Minister's acceptance of Deputy Barrett's amendment.  It is good that the Bill gives special recognition to that community.  I <Col N="275" /> welcome the unanimity of the House today as expressed by various speakers, including the last speaker, Deputy Colley.  I hope that following this Bill and the public debate on it we will also have unanimity on the same issue at local level. That is important in relation to the travelling community.  Let me refer to the plan as adopted by Dublin County Council to try to accommodate 151 families who are at present on the roads, which plan is meeting much resistance, as many councillors including people like Deputy Shatter and others would bear out.  I ask Deputy Colley and others to add their support at local level for this plan.  I know that her colleague, Deputy Harney, to her credit has come out in support of this difficult plan, which puts added responsibility on the travelling community. However, I am convinced that this phased plan can work if it gets the support of all parties at local level.  Deputy Colley has shown in her contribution that there is unanimity on the Bill in this House but I would like to see the same support and unanimity for Dublin County Council's plan, which is attempting to address a very real problem on the ground.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his generosity in accepting this amendment.  When I presented the amendment to the House I said it was the simplest and best way of dealing with what we are setting out to achieve.  I was disappointed with the comments of the Progressive Democrats spokesperson, who obviously did not listen when I was speaking about the reality of what is happening to some members of the travelling community.  Of course, it is quite understandable because most of the Progressive Democrats have never stood in a local authority to know what the real problem is, so they would not know what is happening in local authority housing estates.  However, there has been a great deal of success in Dublin County Council in getting travelling people into local authority housing estates, and thankfully their children are attending local primary <Col N="276" /> schools and are part of the community. There is a continuous attempt on the part of the local authorities to integrate these people into the settled community and to give them a decent standard of living. What I said, as Deputy Colley would know if she had bothered to listen, was that it would cause difficulty if we did not specify the travelling community but left it that they would be regarded as an ethnic group.  It is traditional now for the Progressive Democrats to get at the Fine Gael Party, as we saw last night when Deputy Molloy attacked the Fine Gael spokesperson on Fisheries in regard to the rod licence and ignored the real defaulters, the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government.  The party who were set up &ldquo;to break the mould of Irish politics&rdquo; and &ldquo;to act responsibly&rdquo; have shed that beautiful mantle they had at the last election and are behaving in the old traditions of an ordinary opposition party.

I thought we came into the House this morning to try to do something for the travelling community but now we find we are back to the old &ldquo;stroke&rdquo; politics.  The Progressive Democrats want to abolish the law on the rod licence just the same as they want to pull a stroke on the backs of the unfortunate travelling community and they are misquoting what I said.  I sincerely hope that Deputy Colley will read what I said when the Official Report is published.  I ask her not to misquote me for political purposes in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister has accepted this amendment.  I am sure that those of us who are concerned about the plight of the travelling community see this as an attempt by the Oireachtas to express our concern and to show, by making a special provision for this large <Col N="277" /> group of people who, traditionally, have suffered in our community, that we as a society will not tolerate incitement to hatred.  We are satisfied that ethnic groups are covered under the Bill but as an indication of our concern for the travelling community and in the eventuality of difficulties arising in the future where, as Deputy Taylor outlined, the prosecution might have difficulty in proving a case, we are making an exception by specifying the travelling community. The travellers are an ethnic group and are covered under the Bill, but to avoid any possible difficulty we are making specific mention of that group.</P>
    <P>This is a step forward in Irish society and if the same level of tolerance were accepted throughout our society, including Northern Ireland, this would be a better island to live on.  Today is an historic occasion in that we are expressing our tolerance for human beings in our society.</P>

      <P>First, I wish to express my appreciation that the Minister has accepted the amendment.  However, I am far from happy about the point on sexual orientation and I am really concerned about it.  If there is one thing that can be said for certain about the gay community it is that they are not an ethnic group &mdash; there is no doubt about that but nonetheless they are a very recognisable group.</P>
      <P>When the matter was under discussion on Second Stage in the other House on 30 November 1988 Senator Norris referred to a piece of literature which had been circulated to him and no doubt to others as well.  This was from the so called National Socialist Party and dealt with the gay community.  I want to read some brief extracts from that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="278" /> In Ireland, AIDS is being spread amongst all normal people by the Gay AIDS spreaders ... Thanks to Queers, ... all of your are now at risk from the AIDS Black Death, right down to the pregnant women.... and a baby can be born with AIDS!!!</P>
    <P>I wish to pose the question to the Minister and to every Member of the House: having brought in and passed a Bill which seeks to control incitement to hatred will we say that that kind of material is to be considered all right, and is not to be an offence under the Prohibition of Incitement to Racial, Religious or National Hatred Bill?  Are we really prepared to leave Leinster House validating that type of material being circulated?  It is quite clear that if we do not include the provision I seek in my amendment, that material will be perfectly in order and will not be subject to prosecution under the terms of the Bill and that in effect we are giving a licence to extreme Right wing Fascist groups to circulate that type of material.  Is that really what we want to do?  Are we saying that this is all right? Is it in order that a leaflet saying that &ldquo;in Ireland, AIDS is being spread among all normal people by the Gay AIDS spreaders&rdquo; and that, &ldquo;Thanks to Queers, all of you are now at risk from the AIDS Black Death ....&rdquo;  That surely is stirring up hatred against a group of people in the State.  We are going to deliberately exclude material of this nature from this legislation here today.  If we are happy with that it is a sad reflection on this House and on all of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe we are right to include the travellers within the terms of the Bill and I am glad the Minister has seen fit to do so.  I am not going to sink to the depths Deputy Barrett did in introducing extraneous matter.  I want simply to refer to the points I made earlier and ask the Minister to have regard to further thinking on these amendments between now and Report Stage.  I think that is a reasonable request.  Certain items have been brought up here today which are <Col N="279" /> worth considering further, particularly the long-term effect of classifying the travelling community as an ethnic group and whether it will be possible if this amendment, as it is worded, is included.  That must be looked at as must a definition of what constitutes the travelling community.  I am withdrawing my amendment in order that concensus should prevail here but with the request that the Minister have regard to it again.</P>

      <P>In page 3, subsection (1) (a), line 6, after &ldquo;publish&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, print, or keep in their possession, control or custoday&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This speaks for itself.  The section now provides that it shall be an offence for a person to publish or distribute written material.  The amendment would extend that by providing that it would be an offence for a person to publish, print or keep in his or her possession, control or custody written material of the type sought to be prohibited under the terms of this Bill.  I think that is necessary because the word &ldquo;publish&rdquo; does not go far enough.  The printing of the material as distinct from publishing and retaining it in a person's control or possession should be an offence under the terms of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Section 2 (1) (a) makes it an offence to publish or distribute written material that is threatening, abusive or insulting and is intended or, having regard to all the circumstances, is likely to stir up hatred.  It does not deal with, nor was it intended that it should, mere possession or preparation, such as printing, of this material.  Preparation or possession with a view to distribution etc. is dealt with in section 4.  Accordingly, the <Col N="280" /> substance of the amendment is already catered for in the Bill.  In other words, if the Director of Public Prosecutions wishes to prosecute a person for printing or being in possession of racist material with a view to distribution, he can do so under section 4.  I think the inclusion of the words of the amendment into section 2 would be duplication and, therefore, unnecessary and as such would be both bad drafting and confusing.</P>
      <P>Section 2 is specifically intended as a provision aimed at preventing actions that are intended or are likely to stir up hatred.  It would be used where the offending material or words are seen or heard by the public.  On the other hand, section 4 is aimed at persons who are preparing or are in possession of such material with a view to distribution, etc. and gives the Garda an opportunity to take action before the material ever reaches the public.</P>
      <P>As I said, the amendment is unnecessary. Its substance is already covered in the Bill and, I am sure the Deputy will understand, in the interests of good drafting I have to oppose it.</P>

      <P> (i)  in any place other than inside a private residence, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  inside a private residence so that the words, behaviour or <Col N="281" /> material are heard or seen by persons outside the residence,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>During the Second Stage debate several Deputies expressed concern about the definitions of &ldquo;public meeting&rdquo; and &ldquo;public place&rdquo; in section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The first thing I would say is that those definitions were more comprehensive than some Deputies seem to think.  For example, if someone or an organisation hired out a hall for the purposes of holding a meeting and put an advertisement in the newspapers inviting members of the public, it would be covered by this section if hatred was incited at the meeting. That would be the case even where the organisers of the meeting made it clear that they reserved the right of admission.  In those circumstances, there would still have been an express or implied permission to attend the meeting.</P>
    <P>However, if the meeting was held in, say, a town hall or an hotel room or other conference facility for the same purpose, and, for example, only members of a particular club were invited, that situation might not have been covered by the Bill.  The reason is that such members of a club might not be considered to be members of the public.  I think Deputies were right to be critical of what could have been a loophole of which unscrupulous persons could have taken advantage. Accordingly, I am putting forward these amendments as a solution to the reservations which have been expressed.  In doing so, I have decided that it would have been unsatisfactory to attempt to redefine &ldquo;public meeting&rdquo; and &ldquo;public place&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Instead, I propose to delete the existing definitions of &ldquo;public meeting&rdquo; and &ldquo;public place&rdquo; and replace them with a definition of &ldquo;private residence&rdquo;.  This will make it an offence to incite to hatred, in the circumstances covered by section 2 (1) (b) and where the other conditions of the section are met, anywhere outside a private residence or even in a private residence if the words, behaviour or material concerned are heard or seen by any person outside that particular private residence.  The defence provided in <Col N="282" /> section 2 (2) (b) (i) will then be available when the person concerned can prove that he was in a private residence and that he had no reason to believe that the words could be heard, or the conduct observed, by a person outside the residence. The defence could not be used when the offending words or conduct were used or occurred in any other place, for example, at a factory club, town hall or any private meeting held outside the used part of a private residence.</P>
    <P>That is as far as I can go to meet the reservations expressed on Second Stage and I am sure and hope Deputies will accept it as a genuine and acceptable measure which will meet those reservations. All the time with this Bill, when considering amendments or other provisions, a point is invariably reached where the constitutional right of freedom of expression forms a barrier beyond which one cannot go.  For that and other reasons private conversations within the four walls of a private residence could not be included in this amendment nor do I think Deputies would consider that they should be so covered.  In any case, it is difficult to prove that such private conversations would be intended or likely to stir up hatred of the kind in question.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;private residence&rdquo; will ensure that it is only genuine and lived in dwellings and other structures such as mobile homes which will be excluded from the terms of this section. Therefore, derelict buildings or the unused parts of houses are not considered to be private residences for the purposes of the section.</P>

      <P>What the Minister is attempting to do certainly is an improvement on what was there already and I have no difficulty in accepting it.  I get the point the Minister is making about the normal things that happen inside a private residence where people have conversations and so on, but there is still the possibility of holding meetings in a private residence.  Can the Minister build in something such as, &ldquo;provided the residence is being used for its normal purposes&rdquo; or something of that nature so <Col N="283" /> that it would exclude the holding of meetings in private residences?</P>

      <P>I will try.  I am satisfied that I have gone as far as I can.  One has to consider at all times the constitutional right of freedom of expression and one cannot infringe upon that right.  In normal circumstances private residences would not be able to facilitate groups for meetings, but I take the point that the bigger type of residence would accommodate a sizeable group of people.  It might not be a public meeting; people might come by invitation from the owner of the residence. There are difficulties there.  We have had consultations with the Attorney General and with the draftsman and I am advised that we have gone as far as we can.  We have come up with these amendments as a result of discussion on Second Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister is coming up with now actually makes matters worse and I would prefer the original wording of the Bill.  If we were to accept the Minister's amendment we could have a public meeting in a private residence attended by 50 or 200 people.  Most average private residences can accommodate 100 people at a public meeting.  Meetings of this nature could as conveniently be called in a private residence as anywhere else.  We are giving a licence where, if the meeting is held in a private residence, there is no problem.  I am really concerned about that.  We are going backwards instead of forwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At least the Bill as originally worded prohibited the use of certain words, behaviour and so on in a public place or at a public meeting.  I have difficulties with the definition of a public meeting <Col N="284" /> and I have put down certain amendments in that regard.  At least the Bill in its unamended form prohibited this kind of carry on at a public meeting, but under this amendment there would be no problem if the meeting took place in a private residence.  Some private residences could accommodate several hundred people but even small meetings are objectionable. I have no objection to meetings of private family groups or friends.  I do not like it but it is fair enough.  However, a meeting called for a specific purpose in a private residence is totally unacceptable. I cannot imagine why we should amend the Bill to allow that.</P>

      <P>I have a lot of sympathy with what Deputy Taylor is saying.  I can see the Minister's difficulties in further defining a public meeting.  There would be a loophole in the proposed amendment. I suggest that some definition of a meeting which would include the wording Deputy Taylor has proposed in amendment No. 12 would cover any meeting or group of people meeting in a private residence if that meeting was called by the publication of advertisements in the press, by posters displayed in public places or by the issue of leaflets or otherwise. In order to call any public meeting notice of some kind must be given, whether the meeting is to be in a private residence or elsewhere.  It could be that we could combine the two and achieve the result we want.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 14, to delete &ldquo;and are intended&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This will go a very long way to ascertaining whether this Bill will be effective at the level of court prosecutions.  The section in its present form provides that proof would be necessary that the written material, words, behaviour, visual images or sounds, as the case may be, are threatening, abusive or insulting and are intended or, having regard to all the circumstances, are likely to stir up hatred. If it is necessary for the prosecution to prove that the person or persons concerned intended in their minds to stir up hatred by this material, we are giving a very substantial &ldquo;out&rdquo; to people who would be charged under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of intent, as any lawyer will agree, is virtually impossible to prove.  What a person intends to do is in that person's mind.  There have been attempts to prove it in court in various <Col N="286" /> contexts in connection with the issue of cheques which bounced, and other matters, but it always falls down.  It is extremely difficult.  It should not be necessary for the prosecution to have to prove that the person intended to stir up hatred.  If the material was in fact threatening, abusive and insulting or, having regard to all the circumstances, was likely to stir up hatred, that should be sufficient to set up the case.  If the prosecution produced the material and showed that it was threatening, abusive and insulting or, having regard to all the circumstances, that it was likely to stir up hatred, the intent ought to be presumed. It may be that the person charged is in a position to satisfy the court that he did not intend it.  Let him satisfy the court if that be the case.  The whole legislation will founder badly if we put in that proviso.</P>
    <P>That proviso is in the English legislation and many prosecutions there have failed because of failure to prove that element of intent.  It ought to be sufficient for the prosecution to go into court, present the material and ask the court to hold that in the circumstance it would be likely to stir up hatred.  People know what they are about; the material speaks for itself.  To have to prove what was in a person's mind is too much to expect.  It should be up to the accused to satisfy the court that he did not intend it if that is the position.  This amendment is crucial and the experience of the English legislation certainly shows it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>When preparing this Bill I gave much thought as to what should be the basis for the taking of prosecutions for offences committed under sections 2, 3 and 4.  I consulted many reference books, publications and legislation elsewhere and I also noted what the Deputy's own Private Members' Incitement to Hatred Bill, 1986 contained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could learn a salutary lesson from the experience of our neighbours in trying to come up with the right answer in their legislation in this area.  When incitement to racial hatred was first criminalised in Britain in 1965, the legislation made it a <Col N="287" /> requirement that an intention to incite racial hatred be proved.  The Act had the effect of penalising crude forms of racial hatred where such an intention could easily be inferred because of the overtness of the language or conduct in question. Apparently, more subtle forms of propaganda then began to appear.  Thus it became difficult to prove intent and the law was changed so that the subjective criterion of intent was repealed and in its place was put the objective criterion of likelihood.  This gave rise to other problems. For example, where the recipients of racist material were already racist it was difficult to prove that the material was likely to influence them.  Therefore, the British Public Order Act, 1986, reintroduced the subjective criterion of intent to stir up racial hatred while retaining as an alternative the objective criterion that hatred would be likely to be stirred up.  I agree with that approach which is why I have included in the Bill the alternatives of intent and likelihood.</P>
    <P>These criteria are not complementary, they are alternatives, and where the DPP is deciding whether or not to prosecute, his task will be made easier in many cases by having these alternatives; he can frame the charge in such a way that the accused can be convicted whether the evidence proves that he intended to stir up hatred or only that the words etc. were likely to do so.  Accordingly, I feel it would greatly diminish the effectiveness of the Bill to remove the intent requirement and that is not, I am sure, what Deputy Taylor's intentions are.  Therefore, I am opposing amendments Nos. 5 and 20.</P>
    <P>Further, the effect of amendments Nos. 5 and 20 would be to widen sections 2 and 4 so that they would apply to conduct having nothing to do with racial, religious or national hatred or any other kind of hatred at all.  Amendment No. 5 would make section 2 (1) read &mdash; I leave out some words &mdash;&ldquo;It shall be an offence for a person to ... use words ... if the ... words ... are threatening or insulting ... or ... are likely to stir up hatred&rdquo;. Therefore, it would be an offence to use <Col N="288" /> any threatening, abusive or insulting words at all.  This would take sections 2 and 4 right outside the Long Title and the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am also opposing amendment No. 21. In opposing amendments Nos. 5 and 20. amendment No. 21 must also be opposed as it could not stand on its own.  It would not make sense to say that a person who intended to stir up hatred should have a defence if he proved that he did not suspect that the material or recording was threatening, abusive or insulting.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I find it difficult to understand why Deputy Taylor does not propose to remove the references to intent in section 3 also or why he does not propose to amend section 2 (2) (b) (ii) in the same way as amendment No. 21 proposes to amend section 4 (2).  I hope the Deputy will see why I cannot accept his amendments and will consider my argument sufficiently good for him to have another look at it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that I am happy with the Minister's response on this issue.  I cannot see that the deletion of the necessity to prove intent on the publication of this material would make it more difficult for the prosecution.  It seems quite clear that the reverse is the case.  If we leave the section as it is, the prosecution would have to prove that the material was threatening, abusive and insulting and was intended or, having regard to all the circumstances, was likely to stir up hatred.  It ought to be sufficient to ground a prosecution under this Act on the person publishing material which was threatening, abusive or insulting or, having regard to all the circumstances, was likely to stir up hatred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it stands there is an additional burden on the prosecution to prove intent.  That has gone wrong in the adjoining jurisdiction with many cases foundering because of having to prove the element of intent.  There was a case in the court of appeal, the Race Relations Board <i>v.</i>  Associated Newspapers Group under the English Race Relations Act. That was a case where an advertisement was placed in a newspaper advertising <Col N="289" /> nursing and medical staff appointments in a hospital in South Africa which contained the words &ldquo;all white patients&rdquo;. The Race Relations Board took the view that the advertisement was discriminatory in that those words indicated that only white nurses would be employed.  They, therefore, sought a declaration that the newspaper had acted contrary to the Race Relations Act by publishing an advertisement that could be reasonably understood as indicating an intention to do an act of discrimination. The County Court Judge on appeal said that in determining whether an advertisement contravened section 6 (1) of the 1968 Race Relations Act the test to be applied was what was the natural and ordinary meaning of the words as they would be understood by reasonable persons.  They held that the intent element there had not been proved and that this statement, &ldquo;all white patients&rdquo;, was in order under the Race Relations Act.  That is the kind of difficulty we would leave ourselves open to here.  This amendment is of crucial importance and I have to press it.</P>

      <P>In page 3, subsection (3), line 35, to delete &ldquo;in the State&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 seeks to delete &ldquo;in the State&rdquo; from section 2 and amendment No. 16 seeks to delete &ldquo;in the State&rdquo; from section 3.  I find it difficult to understand why actions which might lead to incitement to hatred, on the various grounds specified in the Bill, and broadcasts which might lead to hatred will only be prosecuted if they are confined to the possibility of inciting hatred within the State. At the same time section 4 prevents the <Col N="290" /> possession or printing of material which would incite to hatred in the State or elsewhere.  As I have said, I find it difficult to understand why the distinction is made.</P>
    <P>We all know that neo-Nazi groups have been operating in this State and have produced material which has been sent abroad to Britain, for instance, where it has been used to incite hatred against various categories of people there. Section 4 effectively deals with that, but I do not see why we should not extend the restriction on incitement to hatred to actions specified under section 2 and broadcasts specified under section 3.</P>
    <P>The neo-Nazis, as defined, are not the only people who incite to hatred in this State.  The Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin actively incite hatred against the British in this State.  They actively engage in a campaign of genocidal slaughter against Protestants in Northern Ireland and use the print and the broadcast media to justify their actions.  It seems that we would be doing a service to the people of this island, North and South, and to the people of Britain if we were to extend the remit of sections 2 and 3 to incitement to hatred outside this State.  This is a matter about which I feel fairly strongly and I would appeal to the Minister to take on board if not the deletion of &ldquo;in the State&rdquo; as I have proposed in the amendment at least the addition of &ldquo;or elsewhere&rdquo; as has been done under section 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; is defined in sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill. The definition in sections 2 and 3 includes the words &ldquo;in the State&rdquo; while the definition in section 4 does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a good practical reason for omitting the words &ldquo;in the State&rdquo; from section 4.  That section creates an offence of preparing or possessing material likely to stir up hatred.  As several Deputies pointed out during Second Stage debate, some highly inflammatory material has been prepared in this country, with a view to distribution not only here but also abroad.  The hatred propagated in this <Col N="291" /> material can be aimed at groups outside the State.</P>
    <P>Section 4 will put a stop to that, and in legislating for hatred being stirred up in this fashion against groups outside the State, we have gone further than is required by the UN Covenant and, indeed, further than many other states. However, I have no trouble justifying the provisions of section 4; none of us wants this country to be used as a base for the preparation of inflammatory material, no matter what racial groups or religions are the subject of the incitement and no matter that other countries have not gone so far with their legislation.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I think the Minister may have misunderstood the case I was making.  I am not opposing section 4; I am proposing that incitement to hatred under sections 2 and 3 should be extended to cover places other than the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically what I am trying to do is to tell Deputy De Rossa why these words are included in section 4 before I come to the other two sections. He has heard my argument as to why they are included in section 4 and I know full well he is not objecting to that because we are all <i>ad idem</i> on that point. The considerations I have mentioned for the inclusion of the words in section 4 do not apply to sections 2 and 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These sections, especially section 2, have a public order context.  Indeed, the Garda will have power under section 10 (1) to arrest without warrant anybody reasonably suspected of having committed an offence under section 2 (1) (b).  To remove the words &ldquo;in the State&rdquo; would make the offence inordinately wide in scope and as such could cause confusion as well as lack of respect for the law.  To say that it would be an offence to incite to hatred against an obsure tribe on the other side of the world would be bordering on the ridiculous, especially when one considers that it would be the same offence, subject to the same penalties, to incite to hatred against black <Col N="292" /> persons or travellers in this jurisdiction. The two just are not comparable. However, an offence would be committed by a person who incited hatred against say a racial or religious group in another country if the effects of the person's conduct were felt by persons of such a racial or religious group in this country.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the Minister's argument in relation to sections 2 and 3.  He said that section 2 in particular relates to public order and gives the Garda the right to arrest without warrant on the basis that the offence would incite to hatred within the State. The examples I gave were not of tribes on the far side of the world.  I do not accept the view that because people are on the far side of the world and are obscure, people in this State should be enabled to incite hatred against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very specific and concrete examples I gave were of people in this State who incite to hatred against other people on this island, in Northern Ireland for instance and, specifically in their propaganda, against the people of Britain.  As I have said, the Provisionals are quite blatant in their propaganda which is highly racist in relation to British people.  Their slogan in Ireland is &ldquo;Brits <Col N="293" /> Out&rdquo; which is extremely racist.  Their definition of &ldquo;Brits&rdquo; is demonstrated by their so-called legitimate targets.  We now have an opportunity to strengthen the law in relation to incitement to hatred which has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people in Northern Ireland, and indeed in the deaths of people in Britain. I urge the Minister to rethink the points he has made on this section and on section 3.</P>
    <P>This Bill outlaws the printing and possession of written material which could incite hatred outside of the State.  The Minister has said that the definition of &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; does not include any reference to the State.  That is true but section 4 (1) (a) states that it shall be an offence for a person to prepare or be in possession of any written material with a view to its being distributed, displayed, broadcast or otherwise published, in the State or elsewhere, whether by himself or another.  Quite clearly, this indicates that we are concerned about the incitement to hatred by way of written material but, apparently, we are not prepared to make it an offence to incite hatred elsewhere by way of actions or broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The point I am trying to make is that we face a serious problem in this State with very concrete examples of incitement to hatred in Northern Ireland and Britain.  At present we have no legal way of dealing with this.  We do have what I regard as a very clumsy section 31 which has had all sorts of side effects on broadcasting which are not in the interests of the freedom or liberty of the people of this State.  If we were to strengthen the Bill in the way I propose the need for section 31 would be radically undermined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa has raised the question why the definition of &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; should not be extended in a more confined manner, for example, to cover groups in Northern Ireland or in the United Kingdom.  Generally, the same considerations apply.  I cannot see how such an extension could have any significant effect, apart altogether from other considerations.  The scope of the <Col N="294" /> definition as it stands is that it would be an offence to incite hatred against any group represented in this State on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins or membership of the travelling community. Most of the persons in Northern Ireland who come under those headings would be represented in this jurisdiction and would feel the effects of hatred being stirred up against the group to which they belong in Northern Ireland.  Therefore, I consider the case for extending the scope of the definition in a confined rather than a general manner of little, if any, practical application.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy De Rossa.  I do not see any need to restrict the offences in sections 2 and 3 to offences with the State.  I do not follow the point the Minister made.  Even though a group may be represented in the State this would not make it an offence as the section now stands.  There may be other people who are part of the same broad group, and that would not make it an offence under the Bill as it now stands. For example, we have now decided that the travelling community will be a protected group under the Bill.  Let us say for argument's sake that a leaflet is published or a meeting is held in this State on the travelling community in Britain at which it is stated what a terrible crowd of people the travelling community in Britain are, how they are doing this, that and the other and, at this meeting there is incitement to hatred against the travelling community in Britain, It seems the Bill as it stands does not cover this.

      <P>How does it cover it?  The Bill refers to a group of persons within the State, the travelling community in Britain are not a group of people within this State.  The travelling community in Britain are the travelling community in <Col N="295" /> Britain; they are not the travelling community of this State.  Quite clearly, the section refers to incitement to hatred against a group of persons within the State.  How could it be argued that the travelling community in Britain are a group of persons within the State?  They are not.  I could not see the courts convicting a person charged with publishing an article or holding a meeting on the travelling community in Britain if the section stands as it is.  The Minister has referred to those groups being represented here but there is no such reference in the Bill, or perhaps I have missed it.  If a subsection included a reference to an equivalent grouping here I would count it, but I see nothing to that effect in the Bill I support.</P>

      <P>The arguments being made by Deputy De Rossa may have the opposite effect.  For instance, if some group here were strenuously opposing and inciting hatred against the regime in South Africa or the regime in some other part of the world who were doing terrible things to the people they were supposed to be governing, they could be brought before the courts here.  If we were to take the words &ldquo;in the State&rdquo; out, would that not be the case?  Does the Deputy see what I am getting at?  It would have the opposite effect to what he is trying to achieve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. The question the Deputy has raised is whether one can oppose politically a regime or a group.  We are not and I am sure no one else in the House is trying to restrict the right of people to make political comment on any individual or group.  What we are talking about here is incitement to hatred.  It is one thing for <Col N="296" /> Deputies to argue that the British Army should not be in Northern Ireland but it is another entirely to say that the British Army have no right to be there, that we have a right to kill then and, therefore, we are going to kill them.  It is not the same thing at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the definition of &ldquo;hatred&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to get involved in a debate on Northern Ireland but what I am trying to say is that there is a distinct difference between political opposition to a particular regime or situation and incitement to hatred against particular categories of people.  In 1976 this House took the step of banning interviews on television and radio with people who promote certain kinds of action and activity in Northern Ireland. It would be far better if we were, in law, to outlaw incitement to hatred against groups outside this State in this Bill.  This would enable the television service to be freed from this restriction and those interviewed would then be liable to prosecution if they promoted incitement to hatred.  There would be a far better and more civil libertarian way of approaching that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to confine the argument solely to the question of the Provisional IRA in Northern Ireland.  Under section 4 the Bill proposes to make it an offence to have in your possession, to print or broadcast material which would be an incitement to hatred in the State or elsewhere. Under section 2, if a person was engaged in activity or broadcasting in the State and could show that their incitement to hatred was directed to Northern Ireland, Britain or South Africa, they would be acquitted.  I have an example of material from the neo-facist group which operated &mdash; and may still be operating&mdash; in Cork city.  It is called <i>Ar Agaidh</i> dated March 1987.  In relation to drug addicts and homosexuals it states that the need is not clean needles but either a new life purged of past weaknesses and vulgarity or immediate recycling in a convenient waste receptacle.  That is incitement to <Col N="297" /> hatred against two categories of people. If that material is found in my possession and I can argue that it is intended to refer to homosexuals and drug addicts in Britain, presumably I would be found not guilty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important issue and I welcome the Minister's agreement to look at the matter again on Report Stage.  This is criminal legislation in essence and it must be swiftly interpreted by any court which seeks to operate it.  That, in practice, means that the courts will tend to be restrictive in their interpretation rather than expansive.  I cannot see in this context the words &ldquo;in the State&rdquo; giving rise to an interpretation which says that the literature, statement or other document or communication is only evidence where it refers to people or groups in the State.  Consequently, the points made by Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Taylor are correct &mdash; if the documentation is selective in targeting people outside the State it will not be an offence here.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember that when the Minister announced this legislation he specifically drew attention to the reprehensible fact that we are being used as a base by groups abroad exploiting our lack of legislation to print material for use by them elsewhere.  We are not addressing this problem because of these words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other problem is that this legislation seeks to bring in an element of an international agreement, a declaration of the United Nations, and we should not be restrictive in bringing our law into line with international principles.  It would draw a certain amount of comment on what we are trying to do here if, in seeking to enter into the spirit of active participation in an international agreement, we did not act against people found within our jurisdiction seeking to drum up hatred for certain groups.  The Minister almost made our case when he suggested that the words really would not have an effect one way or the other and that our amendment is superfluous.  That <Col N="298" /> being so and wishing to err on the side of safety, I suggest we take out the words.</P>

      <P>I propose to get into legal argument so far as amendment No. 10 is concerned.  There is a clear distinction between amendments Nos.9 and 10.  I take the point that when amendment No. 8 was adopted it settled the position of <Col N="299" /> that subsection.  Amendment No. 9 would have deleted &ldquo;or ethnic or national origins&rdquo; and substituted &ldquo;sexual orientation, ethnic or national origins, or as members of the travelling community&rdquo;, but amendment No. 10 is different because it proposes to add to the end of sub-section (3) &ldquo;or their status as members of the travelling community or sexual orientation ...&rdquo; That is in addition to the amended section and is in no way contradictory of amendment No. 8 which has been accepted.  I ask the Chair to again consult the officials in regard to this matter.  I am quite satisfied that amendment No. 10 is perfectly in order because it is by way of addendum to the subsection, not by way of amendment. With the addendum the section would read perfectly logically and would be in order.</P>

I am satisfied that the Chair's ruling is not correct.  For the information of the Chair I should like to indicate how the section would stand if my addendum to the subsection was accepted.  It would read:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Hatred&rdquo; means hatred against a group of persons in the State on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins or their status as members of the travelling community or sexual orientation and shall include conduct likely to hold up any such group to ridicule or contempt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 19, 88, 89 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>From the legal advice available to me, the main implications of the High Court judgment delivered on 14 April would appear to be that we are entitled to have an off-farm income clause in our disadvantaged areas schemes; that combining the off-farm incomes of applicants and their spouses does not deny applicants equality under the Constitution; but that combining their incomes while failing to combine the incomes of unmarried couples living together constitutes a failure to comply with the constitutional requirement to safeguard the institution of marriage.  I am also advised that no retrospective payments are involved for 1988 or earlier years.</P>
      <P>The present position is that my Department are awaiting receipt of an approved copy of the detailed judgment.  Until this documentation is available and studied carefully by my Department in consultation with the Attorney General's office, I am not in a position to indicate whether the decision should be appealed to the Supreme Court or whether the off-farm income clause of our disadvantaged areas schemes should be amended to comply with the High Court judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>If I interpret the Minister correctly, the question is perhaps premature and he has not had time to respond to the judgement and analyse the implications of it.  May I ask the Minister to perhaps consider, in relation to the off-farm income of both farmers and their spouses, looking to some of the other European countries and to proceed as they are proceeding now?  Would the Minister, for example, consider the situation which exists in Italy, Belgium, Greece, France and Luxembourg where a spouse's income is not taken into account?  I ask the Minister to seriously consider this because as we all know at present if a farmer in a disadvantaged area is married to a teacher he loses all headage payments, but if he is living with a teacher he can continue getting the <Col N="308" /> headage payments.  On the other hand if a small farmer is working&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister in his response to consider the scenario where a small farmer in a disadvantaged area is working for a large farmer in a disadvantaged area and his off-farm income also denies him any headage payment whereas the large farmer for whom he works gets his headage payments?  Will the Minister respond to those two aspects?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not that I have not had time, although I have been away all last week, to consider the implications of the judgment, but, as I said in my reply, there is a standard procedure in all such major legal issues that any final decision awaits the copy of the certified judgment &mdash; certified by the judge and counsel on both sides &mdash; and then the legal implications are very seriously considered. As I indicated in reply to the question whether an appeal would arise and one would then take action in respect of implementing the decision of the High Court, this can only be fully considered by the Minister &mdash; me in this case &mdash; after full legal advice and consideration by the legal authorities.</P>
      <P>The other issues to which the Deputy referred may or may not arise depending on the conclusion we reach after that detailed legal consideration, which I think the Deputy would agree must be undertaken in view of the importance of this issue.  The Deputy mentioned examples where people might be living together in rural Ireland.  I am not aware of how many people are living together in any one parish in rural Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if his officials will be sufficiently flexible in the analysis of the surplus relating to the extension of the disadvantaged areas schemes to ensure that in townlands subject to ribbon housing development in towns or villages, such developments will not be included in arriving at figures on population density; and if, in relation to livestock units per hectare, there will be any flexibility in relation to average livestock units between land holdings in adjacent townlands within similar district electoral divisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 2, 39, 43, 53, 91 and 92 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The areas being surveyed by my Department are the townlands which local groups, the farming organisations and individual farmers have submitted <Col N="312" /> for survey.  The first, third, fifth, seventh and so on farms shown in my Department's list of registered herdowners for each townland are being visited so that some 50 per cent of all farms selected in this completely random way will be surveyed.  About 35,000 farms in all will be surveyed.</P>
    <P>The survey should be completed by next October and the results analysed immediately it is completed so that the areas found suitable for reclassification or inclusion in the disadvantaged areas can be submitted to the EC Commission before the end of 1989.  At an appropriate time following that submission the general findings of the survey in the form of the list of areas to be reclassified or designated as disadvantaged for the first time will be made public.</P>
    <P>Turning next to the question of flexibility, I will say simply that the criteria for classification are set out clearly by the EC in relation to both population density and stocking rates and that they do not permit flexibility along the lines suggested.</P>
    <P>As for an appeal system and disclosure of survey results let me say that this survey is being carried out fairly and impartially by the staff of my Department without any discrimination for or against any particular areas or farmers.  A huge area of the country representing one-quarter of our total utilised agricultural area is being surveyed &mdash; 1.7 million hectares in all or over four million acres.  We can do the survey swiftly, cleanly and efficiently, therefore, and submit the results to the Government and the EC Commission before the end of the year by following the pattern set during previous surveys or we can follow a new scenario of disclosures and appeals and have the present survey slowed down considerably. All Deputies will accept that I should not go down that road in the interests of getting this survey completed and put into effect as soon as is humanly possible.</P>
    <P>Finally, as regards the specific areas mentioned, agricultural officers of my Department have completed the first part of the survey of Touraneena-Ballinamult <Col N="313" /> in County Waterford and the Slieve Bloom in Counties Offaly and Laois and Land Commission inspectors will complete the second part of the survey of those areas in July to October 1989 as planned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinPGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister include cereal farmers in the disadvantaged areas scheme?  I believe that the outcome of this latest review will decide the future of thousands of farmers and whether or not they will remain in agriculture.  I want to ask the Minister if he could facilitate people who might have a grievance after the review is completed and accommodate people who may find fault with the review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy, like all other Deputies, is anxious to ensure that this matter is completed quickly.  If, as I indicated, one introduces now what I might call a review procedure in respect of each case, I would have to say honestly that such a review would not be completed for years and the whole scheme would be held up.  Subject to that, I can only assure the Deputy and everybody else concerned, that in view of the nature of the sampling survey which, as I indicated, is very comprehensive and extends throughout the country, all of these matters will be taken fully into account.  As the Deputy is aware, already over the course of the last two years I have met so many different groups, deputations and farmers from all these areas that I think it is unlikely any individual will be disadvantaged, certainly not deliberately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food his views on the prospect of greatly reduced prices for our major agricultural commodities following the Geneva Resolution of GATT to establish a fair and market oriented agricultural trading system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement <Col N="314" /> reached at the Trade Negotiating Committee meeting on 5 to 8 April last includes commitments for the short term and a framework for negotiations for the long term in relation to agricultural support and protection.  For the short term, contracting parties undertook to ensure that, within the framework of their existing legislation and their GATT rights and obligations, current domestic and export support and protection levels in the agricultural sector will not be exceeded up to December 1990 and to reduce support and protection in 1990.  For the long term, participants agreed to undertake negotiations on all aspects of support and protection to ensure that agricultural policies will be more responsive to international market signals and that support and protection will be provided in a less trade-distorting manner.  Participants also agreed that credit will be given for measures implemented since 1986 which contribute positively to the reform process and that commitments may be made by reference to an aggregate measure of support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have previously indicated that I am prepared to participate in negotiations leading to a mutually advantageous basis to greater freedom of trade.  This would imply that all the major contracting parties participate in the process, that the fundamental principles of the CAP are safeguarded, that the reform process is gradual and that credit is secured for past reform measures.  The agreement reached earlier this month provides reasonable assurances on these aspects. In particular, in view of the actions taken in recent years, the Community does not anticipate that it will be required to adopt further restrictive measures to meet commitments to freeze and/or reduce support in the short term.  In the longer term, however, it is likely that the capacity of all contracting parties to support and protect their agricultural sectors will be constrained.  In that event producers' incomes will be influenced to a greater extent than heretofore by market returns.  I am hopeful that the final agreement will ensure greater price and supply stability on international markets and I <Col N="315" /> am confident that our producers, processors and traders have the ability to exploit the opportunities which will be available in a more liberalised and stable international trading system.  I will of course ensure that all those involved are kept fully informed of developments in the negotiations through the special group I established last year for this purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a national interest involved here and I am conscious that we do not do justice to such an important topic with a few supplementaries.  May I ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food if he accepts that Irish farmers will clearly lose out from any move to reduce agricultural support and if he could indicate to the House what compensatory spending from EC level there will be to offset the adverse effect of the lower agricultural price support that will result?</P>

      <P>I have insisted, particularly with my French colleague at the Council of Ministers, that we would take a common position for the first time at the Council of Agriculture Ministers. That has been done and has been very successful.  There is now a solidarity within the European Community which would not have been there if that meeting did not take place.  Secondly, I want to indicate that both Commissioner MacSharry and Vice President Andriessen, who is responsible for external trade, are fully aware of the priorities I have indicated. I am satisfied, in view of the satisfactory result of the discussions which have recently taken place, that they will protect those interests.  As to Ireland's position let me assure the Deputy that in view of the capacity which we have been demonstrating over the last two years in the international markets I am not only satisfied but confident that when we get into a liberalised trade environment throughout the world we will be out there beating the best of them.  Subject to that I will be looking for the appropriate guarantees I have indicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the fact that when we have priority questions we should be allowed to deal with them in full.  I have indicated that I am taking a number of questions together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent weeks my Department have, in co-operation with the Customs, been removing samples of beef from traders around the country for inspection at a Dublin cold store.  The meat concerned is from stocks held under the 1988 Aids <Col N="320" /> for Private Storage Scheme.  The inspections are part of the programme of monitoring engaged in by the Department in their day-to-day implementation of the CAP which I outlined in reply to a number of parliamentary questions on 12 April 1989.  The European Community services were not involved but they were informed of the nature and extent of the operation.  They were afforded the opportunity of observing the Department's examination of the samples.  They did not participate in the examination of the samples but expressed their satisfaction with the Department's arrangements.</P>
    <P>Under the 1988 APS scheme some 133,000 tonnes of beef were placed under contract.  Given the scarce staff resources and the large tonnage of beef involved it was decided that the necessarily detailed examination of the samples could be most effectively carried out at one central location.  This ensures a standard approach to the examination procedure, protects the confidentiality of the results and enables the operation to be carried out with the beef in the secure custody of the Department.  A programme was drawn up under which it was decided in advance which firms and individual contracts would be sampled.  This programme was strictly adhered to even where the beef had been removed from store for export.  In total seven firms, including all of the APS participants with large stocks, had samples removed from pre-selected contracts.  The seven companies from which samples were taken account for 95 per cent of the beef stored under the 1988 APS scheme.</P>
    <P>Because samples were being removed from stores to a secure central location for examination, the co-operation of the firms concerned was sought without any prior indication being given as to the stores, contracts, or samples involved or indeed to the scale of the sampling to be carried out.  Local Department and customs officers were not given details of the contracts or samples selected.  The samples were removed from 11 stores around the country and, in the case of one firm, samples were also taken from <Col N="321" /> an export consignment.  A total of 75 tonnes was taken and is now being thawed out and examined.  Because of the very substantial quantity of material involved, examination of the samples is not yet completed but preliminary indications are that all of the relevant regulations have not been complied with in every case.</P>
    <P>The complete results of the examination will be communicated to the EC Commission and where appropriate follow-up action as necessary will be taken strictly in accordance with the practices I outlined in my reply on 12 April.</P>
    <P>I should again emphasise that these actions are part of my Department's ongoing control measures to ensure that the provisions of the CAP are implemented in an even-handed manner which safeguards European Community funds.  In addition to the permanent presence of Department officials at all meat export plants appropriate checks are of course also carried out in respect of all European Community measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the inspectors have the full co-operation of the seven firms involved?  When will there be a full report in relation to the outcome of these checks, and will that report be available to us in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The co-operation sought was necessary because of the major effect of this examination programme. It was the first time meat was removed from stores to a central location, for the reasons I have given in my reply.  The store owners required the authorisation of the owners of the meat to enable the Department to get clearance to take it from the stores.  That was the only reason for the prior notification by telephone just 24 hours before in each case, without signalling which stores, which contracts or anything.  This will emerge when the final result is out.  By and large, we got good co-operation but in any case where we did not we took very effective action to ensure that our <Col N="322" /> sampling programme was complete and comprehensive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>From what the Minister said, it sounds as if in the operation in relation to the 11 stores and the seven firms 95 per cent of all the APS consignment samples were taken at a certain time.  Why was it found necessary to take samples from the harbour side of an export consignment in addition to the comprehensive sampling that had taken place some days previously?  Will the Minister confirm now that almost all the samples taken in Foynes had trimmings in them or were otherwise suspicious?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>To reply to the Deputy's first question: from the time the sampling operation started, the Department became aware that some consignments were being moved or were about to be moved and some were actually on their way, and the inspectors made arrangements to take samples from the containers at Foynes.  In that instance they took many more samples than they did in the other case to which I referred to ensure that there was a very comprehensive inspection.  I am not in a position to, nor would I if I had the information, disclose anything in respect of any particular firm as to the consequences of what happened.  I am just assuring the Deputy and the House that it is a very comprehensive programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the consignment to be shipped from Foynes that weekend.  Would the Minister clarify if samples had already been taken from the <Col N="323" /> stores prior to the consignment going to Foynes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that some samples had been taken but the nature and size of the consignment was such that it was not a complete sample as far as the inspectors were concerned. Hence the decision to complete the examination in the manner in which I have indicated at Foynes.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister confirm that in normal circumstances, that consignment of meat should not leave the country until the sampling has been completed and the results known?  As the Minister has explained, the thawing and the analysis take a considerable amount of time.  Would it not be reasonable to expect that the owners of the meat in question in situations like this do not attempt to get the meat out of the country until the Department have finished their analysis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the nature and extent of the sanctions available to the Department are such that any penalties that may arise in any case will be such as to be a very effective deterrent or sanction as the case might be.  The question of holding up all of the consignment for different contracts to different locations, even for one company, would obviously raise very major problems.  The Deputy can be assured that if there are any irregularities eventually found in respect of any one case, the group in respect of which irregularities are found will not gain from the irregularities but will be the subject of a very effective penalty.</P>

      <P>The food industry is subject to the same legislation as industry in general.  I have no indication that the existing legislation is in any way inadequate and I have no plans to introduce legislation which would apply exclusively to the food sector either to regulate rationalisation or otherwise.  The question of rationalisation is, or course, primarily one for the industry itself to address in the first instance.</P>
      <P>The general legislation governing mergers/takeovers and other matters referred to by the Deputy is the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Government's proposals for the development of the food industry are set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the Strategy for the Food Industry 1989-1992, prepared by the IDA in consultation with my Department and the recently published <i>National Development Plan, 1989-1993.</i></P>

I have asked the State agencies involved, the IDA, CTT, SFADCo and so on, to make all their resources, advice and direction, available to the food industry along the lines of the strategy for the development of the food industry for 1989-1992, so that we will have an internationally competitive industry here.</P>

This work is not done by workers but by a type of contractor, and without all the protections required.

      <P>I do not agree with the thesis of Deputy Stagg in relation to the <Col N="326" /> development of the food industry, particularly the co-operatives.  We have here some of the most progressive co-operatives in Europe.  For example, Kerry Co-op are not alone active in Ireland but in Europe and in the United States as well.  So are a number of the other co-operatives.  At no time in the history of the State have we had such a progressive and aggressive co-operative industry.

      <P>There is considerable over capacity in the baking industry, giving rise to intense competition and narrow margins.  The Department of Agriculture are studying the problems of the industry in consultation with the relevant State agencies with a view to identifying ways of safeguarding employment to the greatest extent possible in the industry as a whole.

      <P>With regard to my question, No. 99, unfortunately events have again caught up and this is now history. In view of the recent closure of another bakery in my constitutency which was giving a considerable amount of employment, would the Minister not accept that there is now an urgent need to lay down some kind of ground rules or markers within which the industry can operate without allowing some operators to proceed on what appears to be a predatory pricing system, the consequences of which will be the elimination of much of the competition?</P>

      <P>I will let the Deputy have those figures later.  In relation to Deputy Durkan's question, the present rationalisation taking place in the bakery industry has been considered inevitable for some time.  There is about 50 per cent over capacity in that industry now.  The industry have been advised of this.  I have spoken to a number of individual firms in the industry and, together with the IDA and Coras Tráchtála, have made it absolutely clear to them that in the general sliced pan section of the industry there is 50 per cent over capacity.  If they want to survive and improve their position in the future, they will have to look at speciality products and meat products.  I have pointed out in this House and in the Seanad that you have only to stroll through any supermarket, either here in Dublin or throughout the country, to see the Mr. Kiplings and various other imported confectionery and flour and rape products to see that there are opportunities there for the individual firms. The resources of the State agencies are available to them to make the most of those opportunities.</P>

      <P>Particularly with regard to Question No. 55 and in the light of recent events culminating in the loss of 485 jobs in Johnston, Mooney &amp; O'Brien Limited and since there are many small bakeries around the country whose management and employees are very worried about the situation, would the Minister agree that it is important that the Government should have a policy and would he state what that policy is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise again that the Government have a very <Col N="329" /> clear policy laid out in the documents to which I referred and the industry are well aware of this.</P>
      <P>With regard to Johnston, Mooney &amp; O'Brien Limited, I met with the principals of that firm on two occasions to try to solve their problem, on 2 March and 22 March last.  Together with the IDA and some financial institutions, they sought a management buy-out arrangement but were unable to come up with a satisfactory package to implement this arrangement and could not proceed with it.  With regard to the industry in general, its future development is laid out in &ldquo;A Future in Food&rdquo;.  Additionally, in the document &ldquo;Supplying the Supermarket&rdquo;, 26 individual products are earmarked for the industry to go after and treat commercially. If they do not do that, I am afraid that there will be additional job losses facing the industry.  That has been made absolutely clear to them.  The only way of avoiding job losses is for consumers to subsidise inefficiencies within the structure of the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The real crux of the matter arises from below-cost selling.  Would the Minister, rather than rationalising, address the problem of below-cost selling to see if his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, would take action to prevent such practice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding what the Minister has said regarding competition and rationalisation, may I put it to him that the firm of Bradbury of Athy, County Kildare had undergone quite an amount of rationalisation and in the ordinary sense should have been well able to compete with any kind of competition? <Col N="330" /> In view of that, how does he see the industry developing, considering that the competition may be fair, or may not be fair?  If the competition is not fair, would he then be prepared to take any action? I qualify that by saying that the competition could be healthy and open, or could be specifically geared towards eliminating another enterprise from the market-place, with the consequence of opening up the business or monopolising it.  In the event of a monopoly resulting in an increase in price to the consumer at a later stage, would the Minister then see his role as intervening to introduce some type of regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, I am in continuous contact with the bakery and flour milling industry.  Unless the whole integrated industry rationalise and become competitive there is a serious risk of loss of even more jobs.  It is not so much a question of scale.  There is a number of industries and firms in this area who are doing quite well on a relatively small scale of production.  For example, Braycot Biscuits, Seery's Biscuits and Kelly's Biscuits. These firms have been established only relatively recently, have identified a market niche and are doing quite well. They are improving and expanding their position.  That is the advice I am giving and the direction in which I am pointing the industry.  I have no doubt that, together with the floor milling interests, the bakery industry will put their house in order and be able to face the competition between now and 1992.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinPGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that news. The farmer is being ripped off, not only by the co-operatives but by the private compounders.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are stepping up the nature and extent of the checks being undertaken, but I want to remind the Deputy that to achieve what he and I would wish, namely the adherence to standards, there are certain legal constraints with regard to the publication of results from individual firms and I would not like the Deputy to misunderstand what I said about publication in that case. It is important to protect the legal possibility because that route can then be taken and has in fact been implemented a number of times recently.  However the law officers have advised me that there may be problems if matters are published in advance in respect of individual firms as distinct from general publication of the nature and extent of the results of the survey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the samples are taken by officers from my Department but they are analysed at the State laboratory to see if the guaranteed analysis <Col N="332" /> as shown by the manufacturer on the label of the ration is correct.  I think that is how it should be done.  It is very effective and, as I have indicated to the Deputy, certain legal proceedings have already been launched and I am quite satisfied that other proceedings will be taken where appropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if he has any proposals to set up a rural development division within his Department to take account of current trends in EC thinking, as exemplified by the fact that the Commissioner for Agriculture also has the additional responsibility for rural development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Adequate administrative arrangements are in place for the operation of the pilot programme for integrated rural development which was launched in October 1988 and which is designed to provide the knowledge and experience that will be necessary for a full nationwide scheme at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EC Commission's thinking on policies and on implementing proposals for <Col N="335" /> development of rural areas is still at the formative stage.  However, it is likely that the Commission will be presenting its proposals on the subject later this year. Meanwhile, the structural policy division of my Department under an assistant secretary have the responsibility for monitoring the pilot programme and liaising with the E. C. Commission on Structural Policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give the House a commitment that when the Commission fomulates detailed proposals in the area of rural development he will reciprocate those detailed and important proposals by establishing the rural development committee within his Department?  May I suggest that it is only in that way we will be able to take full advantage of the significant changes taken in the Commission in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, it is important that the House would know that in this instance we are ahead, so to speak, of the Commission.  I got permission, and I am the only member of the Council of Ministers who got such permission to launch a pilot programme in advance of the proposals from the Commission. These will not be ready until late this year.  This is just not for our own benefit but indeed for the benefit and information of the Commission and to inform them of the consequences of our experience. That is a major break through on our part.  Second, I agree that when the total programme is put in place, we will obviously review our structures, but at this point, as the Deputy will appreciate, I am not in a position to say when that will be but I assure him that there is a separate structural policy division in my Department under an assistant secretary, who has recently been recruited, and how has responsibility for monitoring the pilot programme.  However, I assure the Deputy that it is a major priority in the Department.</P>

It comes strange from that side of the House who did nothing about this to tell me, who is doing something about it, that I have no care for it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food, in relation to the £300 million of securities held by his Department in relation to beef export refund operations as mentioned in his reply to parliamentary questions on 12 April 1989, the proportion of those securities which has been held for longer than one year; the proportion held for longer than two years; and the proportion held for longer than three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the total securities at present held by my Department in relation to beef export refund operations 12 per cent are held between one and two years, 9 per cent between two and three years and 6 per cent for longer than three years.</P>
      <P>Where exports take place within a reasonable time of bonding and where documentation is lodged promptly and found to be in order, securities would normally be held for about 12 to 15 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that in respect of one company, arising from an investigation carried out by the relevant authorities, bank guarantees to the order of approximately £18 million are being withheld by his Department for whom he is responsible since the end of the 1986 season, and that in the case of another company, again because of suspected irregularities, close on £40 million in bank guarantees have been withheld since the end of last season? What are the requirements that must be fulfilled before the guarantees withheld for more than two years are discharged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is well aware from his period in Government that it has been long established practice under successive Governments not to discuss the individual affairs of any company in this House.  I propose to adhere to that long established practice which I assume the Deputy in his time in Government was aware of and may even have practised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> As regards the procedures in relation to how the securities are held, of the total of £84 million being held at the moment, approximately £4 million is held arising from investigations into irregularities, and that will be declared forfeit if the Department should decide to take the effective action.  The balance of £80 million is held for a variety of reasons &mdash; mainly documentation, including a series of technical requirements, lodging of effective information at the appropriate date, technical theories raised by the Department in relation to the particulars on the import proof submitted and on the export documentation, spot checks by the Department on the authenticity of the import proof submitted, requests by the Department for additional proofs in certain cases &mdash; which are standard practice here and in other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that on the basis of the figures he has given, namely that 15 per cent of guarantees are being held for more than two years and the figure is around £50 million now, it is quite extraordinary that a sum of £50 million in guarantees should be mandatorily withheld by his Department and that that withholding could be only on foot of a quite exceptional reason, namely fraudulent irregularities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to tell the Deputy that this is his latest attempt to imply publicly a degree of extraordinary irregularity in Ireland as distinct from other countries.  What he says is not true. As is normal, the Department are holding in excess of £300 million in securities against beef export refund operations at present in any event, and the bulk of that amount is held in respect of advance payments made since October 1988 for which neither the full export documentation nor proof of import into third countries has yet been submitted.  The figure I gave was in respect of securities held for longer than one year.  I have given the total breakdown to the Deputy and I think it demonstrates that if £4 million of that total amount is held arising from an investigation into irregularities, <Col N="341" /> it does not demonstrate the result the Deputy would suggest and which could, if it were true, do major damage to a very major industry.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to tell the House that when the EC conducted their regular audit as part of their regular exercise in every country, they invited members of my Department to join them on audit surveys they were conducting in other countries before they came here.  Incidentally, I might tell Deputy Desmond that, contrary to the implication he was trying to convey, the auditors came here only as a consequence of matters he raised publicly in the House.  The arrangement was made in accordance with standard provision long before his first public statement making the kind of implications he made here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister expecting us to believe that it is merely a matter of correcting documentation, rectifying little errors or requiring further information to deal with some £18 million which has been withheld by the Department for over three years, the sum of £27 million which has been withheld for between two and three years and the remainder for over one year?  Is the Minister saying that neither he nor the people involved in this industry have the competence to get these documents sorted out so that the money can be paid out? Is it merely a matter of documentation being rectified or is there, as is the suspicion, serious fraud involved in most of these matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying what Deputy Spring says I am saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is implying it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not implying it. The Deputy can put his own words on anything he wishes but that does not make them fact, as has been demonstrated very clearly recently.  Some of the bonds are held in respect of a period when Deputy Spring had responsibility in <Col N="344" /> Government.  I will repeat the information so that Deputy Spring and Deputy Desmond cannot distort the reality.  They are held for a variety of reasons mainly involving documentation, including non-receipt to date in the Department of the prescribed import proofs and/or other documentation; technical queries raised by the Department in relation to the particulars in the import proofs submitted and/or the export documentation; spot checks by the Department on the authenticity of the import proofs submitted; and requests by the Department for additional proofs and documents in certain cases in relation to exports to certain countries.  While it is possible that documentation reconciliation may lead to forfeiture in some of these cases, it is not possible to quantify the level, if any, of such forfeiture in the absence of finalisation of all the documents.  I am referring, of course, to import proofs from other countries in respect of which export refunds cannot become fully payable until all the necessary documentation has been certified from the other countries. Some other countries may not always have immediate and effective ways of dealing with that.  The indications and the figures I have mentioned are not such as are capable of the interpretation that Deputy Spring and Deputy Desmond would like to put on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to money withheld, how many companies are involved?  In view of the fact that one particular company's name was mentioned here repeatedly, does the Minister not feel it fair to mention the names of the other companies involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will know my position in respect of naming any companies.  I do not propose to name any further companies now.  I do not know whether there is an overlap in this instance.  In respect of securities held for between one and two years, 15 traders are involved, while in respect of securities held for two and three years 13 traders are involved.  Eleven traders are involved in respect of securities held for longer <Col N="345" /> than three years.  I believe there is an overlap in those figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister ensure, without taking from the seriousness of this matter or the seriousness of the allegations that have been made, that any information released is released on a general basis in respect of all firms under investigation and that there should be no question of selective information being released to individuals in respect of individual firms?  If any information is to be released, his Department should have a practice of releasing uniform information in respect of all firms under investigation and of all spot checks so that there would be no discrimination in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can willingly have that assurance.  It has been long established practice under successive Governments not to release details of individual firms and such information as I will release will be in accordance with that long established practice. Because of the very close liaison we have with the Commission of the European Communities in respect of this area, recommendations which the Department of Agriculture and Food recently made to the Commission in respect of monitoring, control and regulation have been greatly welcomed by the Commission, not in respect of Ireland but in respect of putting an overall comprehensive control in place.  The controls and checks here are as good as the best in Europe.  To ensure that the industry which is vital to this country will advance further we guarantee that such level of irregularity as does emerge will be dealt with severely.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply indicated the success of the Department's sheep development programme.  Would the Minister not agree that apart from dairying the only other viable enterprise for small farmers is sheep production? Given the increasing numbers of sheep, which generally results in the depressing of prices in the market, can the Minister tell us if there are any steps his Department can take to protect the sheep industry with a view to protecting the incomes of small farmers?  I ask this question because of the continuing importation of New Zealand lamb into the Community.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware from the figures I have given that the sheep industry is in a vigorous and vibrant state, which is very different from the position of a few years ago.  Secondly, the level of income for sheep farmers is much better than it has ever been.  Let me also assure the Deputy that I will continue to take whatever action I can in respect of ewe premium and headage payments in disadvantaged areas and elsewhere.  In relation to the importation of New Zealand lamb, I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to adopt a strong and vigorous position, with some of my colleagues on the Council of Ministers, in resisting the applications which have been made.  We have been successful so far, but in the final analysis these are matters for international negotiation. I am confident that the Deputy's concerns will be fully met.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for giving a very comprehensive reply to my question.  I have long felt that we are doing very nicely in this very important sector <i>vis-à-vis</i> other member states which is of vital importance to my own <Col N="349" /> constituency of Wicklow, and it is great to get confirmation of this now.  If I am in order I would like to ask the Minister if he has the projected figures for the next couple of years and if we will continue to move in that progressive direction in that sector?</P>

      <P>I am very happy to give the Deputy that assurance.  The present indications are that the graph will continue upwards.  Such has been our success I had to seek special permission from the Commission to revise the basis on which sheep numbers in Ireland are calculated. They agreed to do this.  I hope I will have to go back to them next year and the following year to ask for a further revision upwards.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the number of people who have failed to qualify for ewe premium payments as a result of their not having enough sheep on the farm on the arrival of the Department's inspector?  Many people view this as a very stupid rule.  Many farmers, particularly smaller farmers, do not qualify for a grant even though they may be only one or two short of the required number.  Has the Minister any proposal to change the regulation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are fortunate enough to have the European Community pay 100 per cent, not 70 per cent or 75 per cent, of the cost of ewe premium grants and because of this it is they who lay down the conditions for the payment of the premium.  They insist that the number of sheep as stated on the application must be exactly the same as the number of sheep on the farm on the date of inspection.  There would have to be exceptional circumstances before they would be prepared to depart from this condition.  Obviously if there are exceptional circumstances we would be glad to examine the case but it is in the interests of the owners themselves to ensure that they adhere to the regulations as set down by the European Community.</P>

I might say that it surprised me that such a letter was issued in view of the fact that arrangements had already been made for an officer of my Department to visit Cork.  It was arranged for that officer to go to Cork this afternoon to meet officials of the Southern Health Board tomorrow.  It is understood from the finance officer that salaries due to be paid at the end of April will not be deferred.  An officer of the Department's finance unit, as I said, will be in Cork for discussions with management tomorrow, Thursday, 27 April, on the overall financial position of the board.  The Department will consider the appropriate funding arrangements consistent with the approved allocation for the board in the light of the officer's report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the increase in the allocation to the Southern Health Board this year is barely in line with the rate of inflation? The level of service which was below an acceptable level in 1988 is disastrous this year.  Would he also agree that, whereas the chief executive of the health board is obliged under the Act to operate within the budget that has been allocated, the Minister has a statutory obligation to increase the allocation so that the services he has a duty to provide under the Act must be provided within the Southern Health Board area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, the original allocation in 1988 was £127,320,000 and the allocation for 1989 is £132,600,000.  I accept that in real terms it is not the same as last year.  The Southern Health Board were treated with equity in line with every other health board but there were some significant differences, one of which is that the members of the health board &mdash; and Deputy Sherlock is a member &mdash; not alone refused to pass the budget but also refused to put up alternatives to management.  Every other health board who were in the same position as the Southern Health Board were able to come up with alternatives so that they could operate within their allocation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Even the health board in Deputy Farrelly's area were able to pass their budget.  In the letter of allocation that was issued to the health boards it was stated quite clearly &mdash; and the Government were insistent on this &mdash; that most of the savings this year should come from savings on supplies, which cost the State £125 million, and also on contracting out work.  They were not to come particularly from the pay side.  The Southern Health Board members &mdash; not <Col N="355" /> the Fianna Fáil members but those on the Opposition side &mdash; walked away from their responsibility to come up with alternatives which would enable them, like every other health board, to operate within their allocation.</P>

      <P>The Minister said he did not have prior notice regarding the non-payment of salaries.  Was he informed about the 200 temporary staff who were to be laid off and the consequences of these job losses?  It will not now be possible to deliver the service to the health board area by virtue of the fact that these 200 people were to be taken from right across the board.  I would look in particular at the area of community care.  If the proper back-up staff is not available the service cannot be delivered. I would like to know if the Minister received prior notice that there was to be a loss of 200 jobs in the health board.</P>

      <P>I have been aware only in the last day or two that the health board were considering laying off 200 persons. As I have said, one of our difficulties with the Southern Health Board is that they were asked to provide a cash profile to the Department so that the Department could finance them within their approved allocation but that cash profile has not been forthcoming.  On the question of <Col N="356" /> savings being made right across the board, this comes back to the fact that the Southern Health Board members refused to do what the other seven health boards did, that was to plan their programme and their services within their approved allocation.</P>

Deputy Yates was not here last night when we dealt very effectively with Tralee hospital and compared what was happening there with Castlebar.  A sum of £8.5 million has gone to Tralee while Castlebar only obtained £6.6 million. Castlebar hospital had 12,000 admissions last year, the same figure as Tralee. There are 19 maintenance people in Tralee and two n Castlebar.  Who is looking into those matters?  I do not accept that there has been neglect of the health services over the last two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (3), lines 31 to 35, to delete from &ldquo;and the court&rdquo; down to and including &rdquo;subsection (1)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;it shall be presumed until the contrary is proved that the accused person was in possession of the material or recording in contravention of subsection (1)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the most tortuous subsections in the Bill and I felt it was in need of some appreciable amendment. Apparently, the Minister came to the same conclusion because he also proposed an amendment which would improve it but not sufficiently.  Under this section where it is proved that the accused person was in possession of material referred to in subsection (1) &mdash; unacceptable material &mdash; and the court is satisfied that it is reasonable to assume that the material or recording was not intended for the personal use of the person, he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have been in possession of the material or recording in contravention of subsection (1).  How can the court possibly assume the intent of the person?  This is a very badly drafted subsection and certainly the Minister's amendment will help.  However, my main objection is that it talks about a reasonable assumption by the court that the material was not intended for the personal use of the person in whose possession this objectionable material was found.  A court will have great difficulty in trying to make assumptions about the person's intent regarding his personal use.  My amendment simply deletes that aspect in effect and provides that it is <Col N="427" /> presumed, until the contrary is proved, that the accused person was in possession of the material in contravention of subsection (1).  In other words, if the material is in contravention of the section it is fair that the accused should satisfy the court that it was for his own personal use.  He should establish and satisfy the court that it was for his personal use.  He may be able to do that and, if so, fair enough. The alternative is to ask the court to try to make an assumption about his intention and that is asking a bit too much of the court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 are grouped together but there is quite a difference between them.  I regard Deputy Taylor's amendment, No. 22, as a substantive one while my amendment No. 23, is a technical one.  In my view to accept Deputy Taylor's amendment would impose what would be a wholly unjustifiable burden on the accused of proving his innocence.</P>
      <P>Take the case where somebody has in his house a book, perhaps an old book, containing passages which are abusive of a racial or religious group and which, if published, might well stir up hatred against the group.  The book may be a classic work and the owner may be a bibliophile; or it may be a scientific work and the owner may have it for the purpose of study or research.  In either event, he has no intention whatever of using it to stir up hatred.  The effect of subsection (3) as it stands is that, in order to raise a presumption against the accused, the prosecution must first prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that &ldquo;it is reasonable to assume&rdquo; that the book &ldquo;was not intended for the personal use&rdquo; of the accused.  Only if the prosecution discharge this burden will the accused have the burden of proving that his possession of the book was not in contravention of subsection (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the prosecution possibly prove that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the imaginary case I <Col N="428" /> have suggested, the prosecution would never discharge this burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case a prosecution should never be brought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If amendment No. 2 were accepted, and the poor bibliophile or scholar were to be prosecuted because the book was in his possession, he would have the burden of proving his innocence when he should never have been prosecuted at all or the case should have been dismissed because the prosecution would have failed to prove an essential part of their case.  I could not accept the injustice of the situation that the amendment would bring about.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 23, my legal advisers tell me that the words &ldquo;the court&rdquo; in subsection (3) mean, in a case tried with a jury, the trial judge, and, in a case tried in the District Court, the district justice.  Accordingly, under subsection (3) as it appears in the Bill, in a case tried with a jury it would be a function of the trial judge to decide whether or not it is right to be satisfied that it was reasonable to assume that the material or recording was not intended for the personal use of the defendant.  The effect of my amendment will, where a jury is sitting, make that a function of the jury. Where there is no jury, it will be a function of the district justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not responding to this important point.  The example he has given of a bibliophile or a person having a book is not covered by the section.  Subsection (1) states that it shall be an offence for a person to prepare or be in possession of any written material with a view to its being distributed, displayed or broadcast or otherwise published in the State or elsewhere.  The example of the bibliophile would not be an offence and there would not be a prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A different category of offensive material would have to be involved before a prosecution could be brought. There are plenty of books around the place with offensive material in them, <Col N="429" /> and they are not all old books, and, obviously, the owners are not in possession of them with a view to distributing, displaying, broadcasting or otherwise publishing them.</P>
    <P>With respect, the Minister has not given a fair example.  We are talking about different types and categories of material.  We are talking about material in respect of which the Director of Public Prosecutions, or whoever else it may be, had decided was in the possession of the person with a view to its being distributed. If the Director of Public Prosecutions came to the conclusion that the person did not have it with a view to distributing it, or that there was not evidence of that, he would not, and could not, authorise a prosecution because an offence would not have been committed under section 4.</P>
    <P>We then move to the position where the Director of Public Prosecutions comes to the conclusion that there is evidence that a person has material with a view to its being distributed.  There are two important elements now, the objectionable material being found in the possession of the person and the evidence that the person had it with a view to its being distributed.  We now come to the question of assumptions as to the person's intent.  As I said earlier, to start making assumptions about a person's intent is getting into a very grey area.  Where the objectionable material is of a kind that clearly lent itself to being distributed, and there is a strong possibility of that taking place, the impossible burden should not be placed on the prosecution to say what that person's intent was.  If that is said the prosecution will be a non-starter from the word go because it will not be possible to prove intent.</P>
    <P>A substantial case has been set up by the facts that the objectionable material is found in the possession of a person and, secondly, that there is evidence that a person had it with a view to its being distributed.  It is fair, and reasonable, if the section is to have any meaning or if there is to be any type of control, to shift the burden of proof on that point on to the accused, to get the accused to explain <Col N="430" /> to the satisfaction of the court that he or she did not intend to distribute the material and that it was intended for their own use.  Ideally, the prosecution should have to prove every element but the prosecution is not going to be able to prove intent.  A court will have great difficulty, or find it well nigh impossible, in making assumptions as to a person's intent.  A person who has such material must explain and satisfy the court that he or she did not intend to distribute that objectionable material but wanted it for his or her own use.  It is a perfectly reasonable point and it is essential if the legislation is to work.  There is little point introducing legislation that cannot be enforced.  If we do that we will be a laughing stock and the provisions of the Bill will be meaningless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some difficulty with the amendment proposed by Deputy Taylor and I should like to articulate my views and hope for a response from him. The first principle is that the onus should always rest on the prosecution to prove their case.  The prosecution should be in a position to establish their proof in the first presentation of the prosecution.  The general principle coupled with that is that possession by itself is not an offence.</P>
      <P>There are exceptions to that rule for example, in regard to the possession of an illegal substance under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  It can be argued that that exception is tolerable because, unless there is a medical prescription allowing for it, the possession of a prescribed substance under that Act is illegal and can allow of no innocent explanation unless a defendant can make a case to the satisfaction of a court that he or she did not know that the substance was in their pocket.  In that case the person is not strictly in possession of the substance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in all other instances in the criminal code an object is capable of innocent explanation.  We have to concede that there are instances in which a document contemplated under subsection (1) can give of innocent explanation.  I am thinking of instances of research, of innocent possession, or non-hatred use or intent.  In instances where the use of the <Col N="431" /> object in question is capable of innocent interpretation, possession of the object must be accounted for or some other set of circumstances must qualify that possession.  The section as drafted allows the court to look at the wider context in which possession is established.  For example, if somebody is found with 100 copies of a leaflet the suggestion that those leaflets are for immediate or personal use will not stand up to scrutiny. I think there have been a number of instances of this recently where in the context of seditious documentation in a number of prosecutions in the courts persons accused of membership of an unlawful organisation were found with posters. The significant element of proof in those case was that despite the fact that the defendant made a claim of innocent possession &mdash; in one instance posters had been found in a bedroom and in another instance they had been found in a livingroom &mdash; the quantity of posters was such as to allow the court in part to infer that they were not simply for private personal use and that there was a wider intent attached to them.</P>
    <P>I would be worried that the amendment proposed by Deputy Taylor would seek to throw on to the shoulders of the defendant an obligation to prove his or her innocence.  That should rarely if ever be the rule in criminal prosecutions.  It is the rare exception that allows for presumptions, although I will concede that presumptions are becoming all the more frequent in more modern criminal legislation which we draft.  I believe that possession <i>per se</i> should not be an offence &mdash; I think that is the direction in which Deputy Taylor's amendment is taking us &mdash; and there should be an onus on the prosecution to prove something broader than mere possession.  I do not think the court would have difficulty with this.  For example, in terms of the possession of an offensive weapon such as a knife or any other implement of offence, under the law the court requires the prosecution to prove that the person was carrying the implement with an intent to commit some felonious act and must specify what that <Col N="432" /> act was.  With regard to similar offences such as the possession of pick locks or other items listed in section 4 of the Vagrants Act, again the prosecution is required to prove that mere possession is not the offence and that the person carrying the implement had a specific reason for carrying it &mdash; the principle being that possession of a knife has innocent explanations but a knife carried in a sheath hidden in a belt by somebody who is drinking after hours or by a person lurking in an alleyway waiting for somebody else is capable of far greater sinister connotations.  Perhaps this is difficult to prove but in the context of a balance between civil liberty, the rights of individuals on the one hand and the common good on the other, the section as it stands measures that balance better than perhaps what Deputy Taylor is suggesting. Those are some of the views I have on the amendment.  I am open to conviction or suggestions about it but I would like to hear Deputy Taylor's response before I make up my mind on it.</P>

Surely they should be caught under this section also?  Maybe this aspect is covered <Col N="434" /> and I have not copped it but that is another point I want to check.</P>
      <P>The two points I wanted to make is that it could be difficult to prove that these documents were going to be distributed and &mdash; perhaps the Minister will answer this &mdash; whether people who assist in the distribution of documents in, for example, an estate but who when they are caught are not actually in possession of them can be prosecuted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been comparing the amendment and the subsection and it seems that perhaps the subsection as drafted in the Bill is going over the top in a way in having so many safeguards, for example, &ldquo;to be satisfied&rdquo;, &ldquo;that the intention was not&rdquo; and so on.  As Deputy Barrett said, and it was agreed to on this side of the House, it may be very difficult to prove that there has been a view to distribution as well as possession.  Deputy McCartan spoke about not assuming that simply because somebody has something in their possession he is going to distribute it, has a view to distributing it or a view to using it in a way that is not permitted.  The Bill requires two things to be produced in evidence before one gets to any other assumptions: one is possession and the other is that that possession is with a view to distribution, broadcasting or whatever.  I believe that section 4 (3) as it is drafted at present is somewhat cumbersome.  If we are to get down to what we intend, I would have assumed that we intend that anybody who has, say, 250 leaflets in their possession which are contrary to this Bill, and the court are satisfied that it is with a view to distribution, realistically the whole ethos of this Bill should require that to be explained and the onus should be put on that person to say &ldquo;I was using them as notepads&rdquo; or give some such excuse.  As the section is drafted &mdash; and I know this is being amended by the Minister &mdash; the court has to be satisfied that it is reasonable to assume that the material was not intended for personal use.  I think that is irrelevant if the previous requirements have been satisfied in the court, that is, <Col N="435" /> possession with a view to distribution, broadcasting or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the House and Deputy McCartan that I am every bit as concerned about civil liberties as he is.  The Minister correctly made the point earlier this morning that one should not duplicate provisions in a section on a particular matter and that it is unnecessary to do that.  I would like to turn that argument to him on this issue and to put it to him this way.  Under section 4 (1) this offence has two initial elements and without both elements no offence is committed. Element number one is that the person is found in possession of the objectionable material and element number two is that the person has that material with a view to its being distributed.</P>
      <P>If those two elements are essential to constitute the offence how then does the assumption arise that it was not intended for personal use?  In other words, if it has to be proved that the material is being distributed, then it cannot be for personal use.  At best that is a duplication.  If the prosecution goes into court and can only prove possession <i>per se</i>&mdash; a point made by Deputy McCartan &mdash; the case falls immediately because possession <i>per se</i> is not sufficient; it must be possession with a view to distribution.  That is contained in section 4 (1).  These two elements are essential to constitute the offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get beyond the direction stage the prosecution have to prove &mdash; according to Deputy Colley even that burden may be too difficult and too high, but so be it; I accept it is a heavy burden &mdash; that the person had the material with a view to distributing it.  The prosecution get beyond that hurdle and they establish, with evidence, that this person is in possession of the objectionable material with a view to it being distributed, then the question of the court having a reasonable assumption that the person had it for their own use does not follow and makes no sense.  In all sense, it must be the person who has to establish that they did not have this material with a view to its being distributed.  That is perfectly <Col N="436" /> reasonable and perfectly logical.  To leave the two sections there is doing the very thing the Minister told me this morning, in another context, could not and should not be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly, this is a very technical legal point which is at issue between us and has primarily to do with the burden of proof.  I am satisfied that acceptance of Deputy Taylor's amendment would impose an unjustifiable burden on the accused of proving his innocence.  I believe that to be so.  I feel this is unnecessary.  Section 4 creates a new offence of preparing or possessing written material or making or possessing a recording&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where these are threatening, abusive or insulting with a view to distribution, display or broadcasting, showing, playing or any other publication where the material or recording is intended or is likely to stir up hatred.  This offence will make it possible to prosecute those who prepare racist material for distribution here or abroad where the material is likely to stir up hatred against groups of persons or any other country.  In reply to Deputy Barrett, a person who insists on the distribution or the preparation of inflammatory material is equally guilty of the distribution, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) establishes the offence. A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if he prepares or possesses inflammatory written matter or makes or possesses inflammatory recordings with a view to distribution, etc.  The offence is committed whether the material is published by the person himself or by another.  The written material or recording concerned must be threatening, insulting or abusive.  An offence will only be committed if the material or recording is intended to stir up hatred or if because of publication, or other circumstances, it is likely to stir up hatred.  The provision of this subsection are expressed in a way <Col N="437" /> that the purpose of the defendant's intentions can be ascertained and for deciding whether, in all the circumstances, hatred is likely to be stirred up.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides a defence in cases where the defendant is not shown to have intended to stir up hatred.  This defence is available where the defendant can prove that he was not aware of the content of the material or recording.  For example, it might have been innocently packaged or in a language that the defendant did not understand or where he can show that he did not suspect and he had no reason to suspect that the material or recording was threatening, abusive or insulting.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) is concerned with the case where the court is satisfied that the offending material was not for the defendant's personal use.  In such cases the court will be entitled to presume, until the contrary is proved, that the material or recording was in the defendant's possession in contravention of subsection (1) with a view to publication.</P>
    <P>The quality of material is one of the factors which the court can bear in mind in assessing the defendant's intention. Large quantities of the same pamphlet might suggest that his purposes were not wholly innocent and by contrast a person who has been handed a single leaflet in the streets is clearly outside the ambit of the section.</P>
    <P>The effect of Deputy Taylor's amendment and the mere fact that the document is in the possession of the accused raises a presumption against him.  It does not require the prosecution to prove that there is any reason to suppose that he has the material for the purposes of distribution. That is why I am having difficulty with Deputy Taylor's amendment. I believe that what we have in the section is right and proper.</P>

      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), line 12, after &ldquo;secretary&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or any employee or agent&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the section that deals with offences by bodies corporate.  It refers to the connivance of either the director, the manager, secretary or other similar officer of a body corporate.  I propose to amend that to put in &ldquo;or any employee or agent&rdquo; of the company.  An agent of a company would not be the director, the manager, the secretary nor a similar officer and the intent ought to be that he should be equally responsible if he is committing an offence within the terms of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was in preparation I very deliberately saw to it that the words &ldquo;or other similar officer of the body corporate&rdquo; were inserted after the word &ldquo;secretary&rdquo;.  I wanted to ensure that persons in a position of responsibility such as managers, secretaries or other similar officers could not escape prosecution by attempting to put all the blame on an employee who may have only been following orders.  The amendment seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the purpose of directors' clauses of this kind which are common in legislation.  The point of these clauses is that by common law a body corporate can commit an offence only if the persons who do the act are in such high positions in the body corporate that, in the words of Lord Denning, they represent the directing mind of the company and control what it does. If this is the case, the company is regarded by law as having acted through them and therefore as having committed the offence.  These clauses, then, ensure that the directors and so on should in addition be personally liable for the acts <Col N="441" /> which the law has attributed to the company if they have connived at the offence such as mentioned in the section.  If the offence in question was committed by somebody no higher than an employee or agent the offence would not be attributed to the body corporate at all and therefore there would be no offence committed by the body corporate and section 7 would have no application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that.  The section provides for a director, a manager, a secretary or similar officer.  I do not know what is meant by &ldquo;or other similar officer&rdquo;.  What I am trying to avoid is that some device should be used here to escape responsibilities under the Act. A person can set up a company and have this material produced under the name of the company and say they are just the agent of the company.  He would not be shown on the company's records as a director or as a registered secretary of the company's office.  He would be just the agent and would thereby escape prosecution. That is not what we want.  There are unscrupulous people who use companies to escape their responsibilities. We have to be careful not to open up a new door of escape here.  &ldquo;Other similar officer&rdquo; would not include an employee or an agent.  There is no doubt about that. We are leaving open the situation so that some unscrupulous smart person can evade the whole Act and set up some nominee company but he will not be down as a director in the company's office or as a secretary in a company's office. He will be doing its work but will not be responsible.  If the Director of Public Prosecutions tries to prosecute he will find that the company is a shell and there will be nobody to make amenable.  This agent can escape liability because the Minister will not agree to putting him in as amenable to prosecution, as I am asking in this amendment.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Taylor that the role of an agent should be included.  From my reading of section 7 (1) it is very much based on the managerial structure of a company and the role <Col N="442" /> of an agent is parallel rather than similar to that.  The role of an agent could not be described as being similar to that of a manager, director or secretary.  There could be something in what Deputy Taylor is saying, that people would recognise this as a loophole.  There is no doubt that companies are set up in order to escape prosecution or responsibilities.  I would like to see the word &ldquo;agent&rdquo; in there whatever about the word &ldquo;employee&rdquo; because if an employee is to be prosecuted where the company is committing the offence, in company law one has to prove that the employee had some responsibility or was acting with those others who are managers or directors. However, the agent is somebody who could well be parallel and escape from prosecution under this section.</P>

      <P>I agree that there is no great difference between what we want to do.  We want to ensure that everybody involved will be prosecuted.  I want to find the best way to come to grips with this and that is why I believe the section as it stands is as strong as it was, bearing in mind the situation I have outlined.  We very deliberately put in the words &ldquo;or other similar officer&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;secretary&rdquo; to ensure that persons in positions of responsibility like managers and so on could not escape by attempting to put the blame on somebody lower down the line who may have been only following orders.  I am advised that there is a possibility of a misunderstanding of the purpose of directors' clauses of this kind which are common in legislation.  The point of these clauses is that by common law a body corporate can commit an offence only if the persons who do the act in question hold such high positions in the body corporate that they represent the directing mind of the company and control what it does.  If this is the case the company is regarded by law as having acted through them and therefore as having committed the offence.  This secures that the directors should, in <Col N="443" /> addition, be personally liable for the act which the law is attributing to the company if they have connived at the offence.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to agree to the insertion of the word &ldquo;agent&rdquo; at this point.  I can see the argument regarding the word &ldquo;employee&rdquo;, but I do not think that it applies to an agent.  To save having a vote on this issue, I suggest that we insert the word &ldquo;agent&rdquo;. It will strengthen the section.  There could be a loophole otherwise.  One could see a situation in which a &ldquo;shell&rdquo; company might employ a person as their publishing agent and when they come to prosecution that person would say that he was acting only as the agent, so he could not be prosecuted because the Act does not say &ldquo;agent&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>At the other end of the scale it would be grossly unfair to a company if somebody did something and the directors genuinely did not realise that this was being done and the company were found responsible even though they were not aware.  I can understand what Deputy Taylor is getting at in relation to bogus-type companies, for want of a better word.  However, in the case of a genuine company, if somebody printed material in the name of company ABC Limited and the directors or managers were unaware of this, although the person was an agent of that company it would be unfair to hold that company liable.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to voice a few opinions on this section for consideration. We are agreeable that we will have another look at the matter on Report Stage.  On the general provisions, I could be concerned about the inclusion of an employee for the following reason. The section imposes a regime that is certainly appropriate to the officials or the officers, namely the director, manager and secretary or similar officer, because there is a provision suggesting that if it can be proved that the act was committed with the consent or connivance of or to be attributable to neglect on the part of the person and if that person is an employee that person would be liable. The problem is, how does an employee <Col N="445" /> assert his diligence or authority to ensure that he does not leave himself open to accusations of neglect or connivance?  For that reason I would be concerned. Deputy Taylor, however, is correct, in that if an employee engages in an activity that would amount to an offence under the Act he can be prosecuted in his own name.  It is correct that that should be so. He is personally liable.  Even taking into account some of the considerations that Deputy Barrett has, it is right to leave it at that.  This section, as I understand it, is trying to ensure that when a company act then the officers of the company cannot simply walk away saying that it has nothing to do with them.  In leaving open prosecutions against companies, it is right that senior management &mdash; directors, secretaries and officials &mdash; should be put in the first firing line.  We should protect that course of action.</P>
      <P>In trying to bring in people who act as agents there is a real problem.  The Minister should look very carefully at it. There is the whole question of delegation and officers of the company attempting to delegate guilt by delegating responsibility for acts to be done.  The case where a person is appointed as an agent as opposed to a person who is an employee must be looked at.  All the onus cast on an official or officer of the company should also rest on the shoulders of the agent.  Agents should be susceptible.  If they are guilty of connivance, they should be drawn into the net and prosecuted along with the company and the officials. I urge the Minister to include &ldquo;agent&rdquo; but not &ldquo;employee&rdquo;.  Employees are better attacked in their own name.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 22, to delete &ldquo;such&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;any&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of section 8 is that proceedings for an offence under section 2, 3, or 4 may be instituted only with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Since in a case where the accused is arrested, proceedings actually commence with the arrest, section 8 is designed to secure that the arrest and any remand in custody or on bail following such an arrest may take place in advance of obtaining the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  However, since section 8 as it stands refers to such demands as the court may think necessary, a district justice acting outside the court or a peace commissioner could not remand a person without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The amendment to section 8 will ensure that such consent will not be required whether the remand is by the court or by a justice outside the court or a peace commissioner. This would be important when an arrest is made at a time, for example a weekend, when the court is not sitting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some worries about section 8 generally.  I would like to voice them at this stage.  Why does the Minister consider it necessary to have the prior consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions in most instances for prosecutions to be brought?  The office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has a very heavy workload.  It would have to be conceded that it often takes months to get a response from that office.  I am sure that many of the senior gardaí who submit files will confirm this and those who practise and correspond with the <Col N="447" /> Director of Public Prosecutions appreciate the difficulties that the office is subjected to.  I think the important feature of all criminal prosecutions is speed, speed must be of the essence.  In such situations it is essential that proceedings move with speed.  In that way the problem is nipped in the bud and the prosecution relates closely in time to when the material is produced and is current and relevant.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 25, after &ldquo;Prosecutions&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment largely on the grounds that Deputy McCartan had begun to enunciate a few minutes ago.  I have very serious concerns about limiting the right to institute a prosecution to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Obviously the Director of Public Prosecutions should have that right, there is no doubt about that, but I do not believe by any stretch of the imagination that that right should be limited to the Director of Public Prosecutions alone.  As we know, there is provision in our legal system from time immemorial for private prosecution under which a private person can initiate a prosecution.  Having regard to the type of material involved, a strong case could be made for allowing private citizens to <Col N="448" /> initiate a prosecution under the terms of the Bill.  However, my amendment does not seek to go that far, but in effect seeks a compromise between the two positions. It provides that proceedings for prosecution under the Bill may be initiated either by the Director of Public Prosecutions or by any member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector. That gives the offences a special status that would not normally apply.  As Deputy McCartan has said, and he is right, the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is heavily overburdened and there are long delays before a decision is given.  In many of these cases it is very important that there should not only be a prosecution but that it should be speedy and that the matter should be dealt with shortly, sharply and quickly, because if it is not the material may be disseminated and the damage done before any serious action could be got underway.  I know that the Garda Síochána have powers of seizure and all the rest, and that is quite right, but even so it is particularly important that there should be as speedy a process as possible.</P>
    <P>To be put in the position where you have to prepare statements, books of evidence and all the rest and send it to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and then wait for a decision to be made in the Director of Public Prosecution's office would not be tenable in the circumstances and in an attempt to get around that I think we would all agree that the Garda Síochána of the rank of inspector have more than a sufficient degree of responsibility to ensure that a proper prosecution would be brought and that frivolous or unnecessary prosecutions would not be authorised by them.  I think it is a fair compromise and I ask the Minister to consider seriously accepting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The effects of section 8 is that proceedings for an offence committed under sections 2, 3 and 4 may not be instituted except where the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions has been obtained or proceedings have been instituted by him.  The purpose of this <Col N="449" /> provision is to ensure that trivial or mischievous proceedings which might bring the law into disrepute are not brought, thus ensuring that prosecutions are brought only if the evidence appears to be sufficient to justify the proceedings.</P>
      <P>I also want to ensure a policy of uniformity in prosecutions brought before the courts.  The nature of the offences are such that if there were no violence, threats of violence, damage to property or threats of such and if there were no restrictions on the rights to start a prosecution, all sorts of minor insults, real or imagined could end up in court cases, not only cluttering up the courts and wasting their time but eventually bringing the law into disrepute.  In those circumstances the provisions could turn out to be counterproductive with the type of serious incitement of which we are all aware either being lost sight of among the trivia or very real disrespect for the new laws being engendered.  It is true that the proposal in the amendment to allow an inspector of the Garda Síochána to institute proceedings would lessen or remove the dangers I have mentioned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>But it would not have the advantages I have mentioned of securing a policy of uniformity in bringing prosecutions. Moreover the practice of the Legislature, where it is desired to restrict the rights of prosecution for a widely defined offence, is to require the authority of the Director of Public Prosecutions and occasionally the Attorney General.  It would be quite inappropriate in my view, and I think unprecedented, to confer such a discretion on a member of the Garda Síochána.  For that reason I am opposing the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to be able to deal with this matter in the context of the section.  With the greatest of respect, may I say to the Minister that the two reasons he advances for not accepting the amendment in the name of Deputy Taylor are matters that are not primarily <Col N="450" /> and should not be his responsibility and concern.  The question of bringing prosecutions, whether they be trivial, mischievous or otherwise is a matter primarily, and I suggest exclusively, for the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The question of uniformity of prosecution is again a matter for the Garda Síochána.  Our job is to legislate and to lay down the legislative directions and sanctions of the criminal code.  That is what we are seeking to do here.  The practice and the degree to which those laws are implemented are a matter for the law enforcement agency, the Garda Síochána.  We cannot seek in rules and regulations to try to lay down parameters in which the Garda Síochána can operate. If anything that is a matter for consultation between the Minister and the Garda Commissioner or indeed with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions if that is conceivable.  I do not believe that these are concerns for the Minister or indeed for any legislator. Neither do I believe that the transfer of these functions to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions will in any way achieve what the Minister desires, but perhaps it will in some respects.</P>
      <P>However, I suggest that they would be achievable, as they are in the vast majority of crimes, through the discretion of the officers enforcing the law, the Garda Síochána.  I do not think it can be suggested that the Garda Síochána bring trivial or mischievous prosecutions in the area of larceny, or in all the range of offences where they have absolute discretion. I do not believe they are given to producing disunity in terms of the pattern of prosecutions.  They are eminently sensible and levelheaded people in the first line of our defence of the community and I think they are the people who should have the authority to make decisions in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For technical reasons I think I might have been happier if the amendment had allowed the proceedings to be instituted by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent because I understand that in the ordinary run of <Col N="451" /> authority within the Garda Síochána the inspector has more to do with administrative day-to-day management of the Garda station, deployment of staff and the like but that when it comes to decisions on prosecutions it is the superintendent who takes decisions.  However, I think what is being sought by the amendment is eminently sensible and I do not understand what the Minister sees as so important about this type of prosecution. The offences we are legislating for are damnable acts as damnable as any other area of the law we have to deal with.  They are particularly odious acts. Incitement to hatred is a problem we are troubled with in Ireland today.  I do not think we should attach this status to them, that only the Director of Public Prosecutions can say whether a prosecution be initiated.</P>
    <P>Under section 10, the scope for prosecutions by arrest without warrant is extremely limited.  I suggest that perhaps 90 per cent, if not more, of all prosecutions that will ever be brought under the Bill, if it passes into law in this form, will come by way of summons after the director of Public Prosecutors has looked at them, and that will be after an inordinate lapse of time.  In Dublin the summons procedure is now a computer system, and a summons sought to be issued by the Garda, the Director of Public Prosecutions or anyone else, must take its place in the queue and lodged. One day it will see the light in terms of being issued for service in three, four or six months' time with the return date for court invariably anything from nine to 12 months from the date and complaint is lodged.</P>
    <P>Prosecutions under this Bill, having gone through the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and having taken a number of months to get there, will then be issued by way of summons.  I take it the Director of Public Prosecutions will issue the directive to the Garda to proceed, then they will draw up their complaint and lodge it with the computer office.  I suggest we are talking about 12 to 16 months before a prosecution will <Col N="452" /> make its way back to court.  Such is the reality of the workload of the courts at the moment through the computer system.</P>
    <P>Under section 10 only in a very rare instance has a Garda officer the right to arrest and proceed without warrant to court.  Section 10 (2) provides:</P>
    <P>If a member of the Garda Síochána reasonably suspects that a person has committed an offence under this Act (other than an offence under section 2 (1) (b) or 9 (2) (b)), he may require him to give him his name and address and, if the person fails or refuses to do so or gives a name or address that the member reasonably suspects to be false or misleading, the member may arrest him without warrant.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, suggest that only very rarely would the arrest without warrant procedure be embarked upon.  We will find 90 per cent of these procecutions coming by way of consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions only.</P>
    <P>This is much too cumbersome.  It will render the legislation very much less effective.  I urge the Minister to look at what Deputy Taylor is advocating and I suggest that the status of the superintendent should be brought into play here, if not that of the inspector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand this fully, because I am puzzled by the middle of the section, whether it is necessary and how it will work.  It provides:</P>
      <P>Proceedings in respect of an offence under sections 2, 3 or 4, other than an arrest pursuant to section 10 or such remand in custody or on bail following such an arrest as the court may think necessary, may be instituted only by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>How would there be remand either on bail or in custody before the Director of Public Prosecutions, superintendent or whoever it was had instituted the proceedings? A person can be arrested and so on, but before he gets into the area of remand as I understand it, he has to be charged.  As he cannot be charged without the prior consent, I am puzzled about that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of section 8 is that proceedings for an offence committed under sections 2, 3 and 4 may not be instituted except where the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions has been obtained or the proceedings have been instituted by him.  The purpose of this provision is to ensure that trivial or mischievous proceedings which might bring the law into disrepute are not brought and to ensure that where proceedings are brought the evidence is sufficient to justify the proceedings.</P>
      <P>The power of arrest given to the Garda Síochána in section 10 is specifically excluded from the proceedings referred to in this section as are such remand in custody or on bail following such an arrest as the courts may think necessary.  This means that the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions will not be necessary for such arrest.  The arrest is part of the proceedings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

      <P>If that is the sequence, the accused person when he has been charged by the garda and comes up for remand will say that the charge is invalid because it has been instituted without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions, while the Act clearly states that it can only be instituted with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  At that point the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions has not been obtained.</P>

      <P>Would it be possible for the Minister to confirm whether the actual charge is the point at which the proceedings are instituted or is it pursuant to the charge that the proceedings are instituted?  Deputy Taylor says that section 8 requires that the proceedings can only be instituted by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I believe there is a gap in the sequence as between the laying of the charge and the proceedings continuing. Whether they are instituted by the Director of Public Prosecutions following the charge is not absolutely clear. There is another unclear point.  What is the status of the accused person as <Col N="457" /> between the time he is charged and the proceedings are instituted or continued by the Director of Public Prosecutions? If, as is likely to be the case, the Director of Public Prosecutions will take some length of time to institute proceedings, what is the status of this accused person in the meantime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the only exception in section 8 relates to an arrest pursuant to section 10. Section 10 is quite specific as to the conditions under which an arrest can take place.  Would it not be fair to say that if an arrest takes place under the provisions of section 10 the Director of Public Prosecutions need not necessarily be involved in instituting proceedings?  Section 8 states that proceedings in respect of an offence under section 2, 3 or 4 may be instituted only by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In the case of section 10, proceedings could be instituted other than by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 gives the Garda Síochána powers of arrest for specified offences committed under the Act.  These powers are necessary to make the Act enforceable.  Other proceedings under the Act would be initiated by way of summons.  Section 10 also gives the Garda the power of arrest without warrant where they suspect that a person has committed an offence under section 2 (1) (b), that is the offence of using offending words or behaviour or displaying offensive written material heard or seen by persons in a public place or at a public meeting.  This type of offence has significance for public order and it is important that the Garda be in a position to act immediately, without the necessity of having to obtain a warrant, by arresting any person suspected of committing such an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of that section is concerned with all the other offences under the Act, apart from the offences under section 9 (2) (b).  In the case of offences <Col N="458" /> covered by this subsection a garda may require the person concerned to furnish name and address and the failure or refusal to do so or giving a name and address which are suspected of being false or misleading will give the Garda the power to arrest the person concerned without warrant.</P>
    <P>The final part of the subsection gives a garda acting under the authority of a warrant under section 9 power to arrest without a warrant a person he reasonably suspects has committed an offence under section 9 (2) (b).  For example, in the course of a search of a premises under warrant a person found on the premises may refuse to give a proper name and address to the garda concerned.</P>
    <P>The powers of arrest given to the Garda Síochána in section 10 are specifically excluded from the proceedings referred to in section 8 as &ldquo;such remand in custody or on bail following such an arrest as the court may think necessary&rdquo;. This means that the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions would not be necessary for such arrests or remands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct but there is a difficulty.  If it were not for that provision in the section, a garda could not even arrest somebody without the prior consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. There is a clear fault in this draftsmanship which will have to be looked at.  The person will be arrested but he cannot be remanded if he has not been charged.  He must be either charged or let go.  It is quite clearly stated that he cannot be charged without the prior consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Minister's officials know a lot and they are very clever people, but they can get these things wrong in the same way as anybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I misconstrued section 10.  I indicated previously that upwards of 90 per cent of all prosecutions would be brought with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I understood that section 10, giving the power of arrest to the Garda must, by definition, also give them power to lay charge and institute proceedings.  The principle of Dunne and Clinton is that an arrest is for the purpose of bringing the person before the court, and that can only be done on foot of a charge sheet.  The Garda cannot just take somebody into custody, wait for the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute and, in the meantime, just get his consent for the purpose of a remand.  Therefore under section 8 all offences must be prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I took section 10 to mean that where an arrest was effected under the section, it would automatically follow that the Garda would have the power to lay the charge without reference to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  There is a major problem here.  How does one get around it?  If we allow section 8 to be passed now, is it the suggestion that we cannot delete it or substantially amend it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1) (b), to delete lines 49 to 52, and in page 8, to delete lines 1 to 5 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)  that a requirement specified in subparagraph (I) of section 3 (8) (a) was made in relation to it and was not complied with,</P>
      <P>(ii)  that the requirement specified in subparagraph (II) of section 3 (8) (a) was made in relation to it and was not complied with, or</P>
      <P>(iii)  that, in all the circumstances, it is necessary to issue the warrant notwithstanding that a requirement specified in the said subparagraph (I) or that specified in the said subparagraph (II) was not made in relation to it.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 9 (1) (b) (i) a district justice or peace commissioner will not be able to issue a warrant to the Garda to enter and search a premises unless satisfied that a requirement was made pursuant to section 3 for the production to the member of the Garda of the script or recording, and that the relevant item was <Col N="461" /> not produced to the member.  This is subject to the provision in subparagraph 9 (1) (b) (ii) empowering the justice or commissioner to issue a warrant where he is satisfied that this is necessary in all the circumstances notwithstanding that the requirement was not made.</P>
    <P>However, there is no provision for the situation where a script or a recording was produced to the member but he was not afforded an opportunity of making a copy of the relevant item.  This amendment mainly seeks to remedy that omission by the inclusion of the new subparagraph (ii).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment highlights the point I was making earlier in connection with the requirement notice the Garda superintendent would issue under clause 3 (8) (a).  The Minister will remember my making the point that a time limit ought to be provided there for the requirement by the Garda superintendent. The district justice may say that the requirement was made but he cannot say at that point whether it has or has not been complied with and that maybe it is too soon to say that it has not been complied with.  In the meantime the material could be dispersed so that by the time the search warrant came to be executed the material would not be there at all.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to consider in general terms the restricted powers of arrest given to the Garda under the Bill by virtue of section 10.  Legislation, if it is to be effective, must be coupled with effective powers of arrest.  This conviction comes out of bitter experience of watching the Garda having difficulty dealing with particular offences that do not carry with them the power of arrest and detention.  It can be very difficult, particularly when dealing with a sector of the community well versed in what their rights are, where they stand and where they can go.</P>
      <P>This legislation will be dealing primarily with people who are well versed in its intricacies and know how to play it.  The powers of arrest under section 2(1)(b) cover one aspect of a very large range of offences.  The Garda have power to deal with someone acting in public or in the open street.  Where a garda is dealing with a perceived offence, challenges the alleged offender and asks for detail and the person fails or refuses to give a name or address, I have to suggest, and experience will show, that a garda in that situation is dealing with someone who is clever, devious and well able to lead him a merry dance.  It is an extremely difficult area to operate.  On being confronted by a member of the Garda who suspects he is breaking the law and asks for his name and address, he may give a false name and address and on parting company with the Garda, he has, for all practical purposes, got off scot free.  If the officer suspects that what he is being told is not correct, he has to weigh that and try to investigate further, because he has to be able to satisfy a court subsequently that he had reason to believe what was being said was not correct. There are all sorts of difficulties and nuances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the gravity of the offences we are dealing with and the difficulties of enforcing this legislation, I would ask the Minister to consider extending the Garda's powers of arrest when trying to enforce this legislation.  I would go so far as to say that an officer dealing with these offences should have the discretion to <Col N="463" /> deal with all offences under sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill in its entirety.  It is a matter for the officer to decide whether he will make an arrest or whether he will simply let the matter go on the basis that he knows the offender well, knows where he or she lives and will have no difficulty serving a summons.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That it is expedient to make provision for the fixing by the Minister for Finance and the charging by the Valuation Tribunal of a fee in respect of an appeal to the tribunal under any Act of the present session to make provision with respect to land to prevent it being or becoming a derelict site, to enable local authorities to require the taking of measures on derelict sites by the owners or occupiers and, in certain circumstances, to acquire derelict sites compulsorily, to establish registers of derelict sites, to enable the Minister to give directions in relation to derelict sites, to provide for a derelict sites levy and to provide for other matters connected with the aforesaid and to repeal the Derelict Sites Act, 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This financial resolution is needed because section 23(10) of the Bill applies sections 5 and 7 of the Valuation Act, 1988, to the determination of an appeal under the section.  Section 7 of the Valuation Act enables the Minister for Finance, by regulation, to prescribe the fee to be charged in respect of an appeal to the Valuation Tribunal.  Under Dáil Standing Order 122(2), the Committee Stage of a Bill, which incidentally involves a charge on the people, shall not be taken unless a motion approved of the charge has been passed by the Dáil.  As section 23(10) of the present Bill involves such a charge, a financial resolution must <Col N="465" /> be moved by a member of the Government and passed by the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash; This Act shall come into operation from the day that is three months after the date of the passing of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I propose an amendment to section 2 which would replace the existing section in the Bill to read: &ldquo;This Act shall come into operation from the day that is three months after the date of the passing of this Act.&rdquo;  It is acknowledged that there is an urgent need to provide legislation for derelict sites.  It is hoped that this Bill, when it is passed through this House, will solve the current problems in this area. The current section 2, in effect, leaves it to the Minister to determine when the Bill or part of the Bill will come into operation.  It is not known whether this Bill itself will come into operation in six months, a year or two years or how long it may take regulations, that may be intended by the Minister to be published, to be brought into being to give effect to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On our side we take the view that this legislation should become effective as soon as possible.  Indeed the Fine Gael Party published a Private Members' Bill some months ago under the the name of my colleague, Deputy John Boland, due to our concern about this issue.  We do not believe it is good for this House to pass an entire Statute through the House and then leave the Act passed in abeyance, in a sort of legislative limbo, until the Minister or his Department decide to <Col N="466" /> bring different parts of it into force.  It is our view that this Act should come into force as early as possible.  We accept it may take some weeks for local authorities to make whatever arrangements are necessary to carry out some of their functions under the Act and the Minister may require some time to deal with any regulations or statutory instruments he intends to make.  We would also assume that as the form of the Bill is known in his Department &mdash; the Bill has come through his Department &mdash; the Minister and his officials have particular regulations in mind to be brought into force by way of statutory instrument.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, we think it is reasonable that section 2 be amended so as to provide that this Act should come into effect within three months after the date of its passing.  It is not unusual that such a provision is contained in a Bill. Unfortunately, over the years there has been a precedent whereby this type of provision that the Minister has included in this Bill ultimately has had the effect that some legislation has never been brought into force.  There is the notorious example &mdash; not from the Minister's Department and it is no fault of this Minister &mdash; of the new Mental Treatment Act that was passed in 1980 but was never brought into force.  There is still the extraordinary anomaly under the Civil Liability Act, 1961, in which there is a provision whereby local authorities can be sued in certain circumstances in the context of someone suffering an injury as a result of the authority being negligent in their maintenance of pavements but that has never been brought into force. We are not happy with this provision which lays down no maximum period by which the Bill must become operative. We hope the Minister may be able to indicate his support for the amendment we have proposed here.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might take the advantage of the empty Press Gallery to indicate how I think this House might wish to proceed on Committee Stage. There are certain amendments which no doubt the Minister is in a position to <Col N="467" /> either oppose or accept.  With all due respect to my learned colleague, which I think is the legal phrase, we should try to make as much progress as is possible on Committee Stage today.  The four of us, with one other person, made outrageously slow progress when dealing with similar legislation recently.  We were all to blame for that.  While I will oppose the Minister on a number of fronts, this is not a front on which I wish to oppose him.  The absence of any amendments from the Labour Party may be interpreted as general support on our part for the Bill.  Any criticisms we have to make will be made on Report Stage.  By way of an introductory remark, I ask Deputies to try to be as concise as possible on Committee Stage.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept the Fine Gael amendment, would he be prepared to insert the words &ldquo;not later than 12 months&rdquo; or within some other fixed period of time which would meet the objective I think Deputy Shatter has in mind?</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Quinn for his opening remarks.  We made tortuously slow progress on what I regard as very important legislation.  I am not referring to the legislation by name.  Perhaps it had some warts but it was infinitely better to have the legislation on the Statute Book rather than not.  As a result, it will not be on the Statute Book for some time.  I am pleased that this legislation is getting priority.  This is necessary.  I made this point before: this legislation should receive the support of everyone in the House.  I would like to get the feeling that this is so across the floor of the House at an early stage.  If an amendment will improve the Bill, and my advice is that the possibility is that it would, I will concede. If my advice is to the contrary I will oppose, but I will not be opposing for the sake of opposing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate what Deputy Shatter is trying to achieve with his amendment. He wants to ensure the speedy implementation of this legislation.  I agree with him that there is an urgent need to proceed <Col N="468" /> with this very necessary legislation.  Obviously, I would be reluctant to apply the timescale suggested by Deputy Shatter of three months to all local authorities.  To do so could lead to difficulties.  I am happy to concede that we should enforce this legislation as quickly as possible.  In normal circumstances it is the function of the Minister to enforce the legislation as quickly as possible but, as the Deputy rightly said, this does not always happen. As far as this legislation is concerned, I would say that this will happen as I have an interest in it.</P>
    <P>Can Deputy Shatter concede that or does he want to press it further?  I want to have this legislation implemented as quickly as possible.  If I thought difficulties would arise in expediting the legislation I would be a bit more reluctant. I would be happy to agree to a timescale of either six months or 12 months but let me also say that, unless the Deputy is anxious to insert some particular date, I would prefer him to leave it and let me implement it as quickly as possible.  If he wishes to press it further, I will have to concede something to him. That is as fair as I can be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are all in agreement that this is not what one might describe as a party political measure.  We all want the best legislation we can get in this area.  I take Deputy Quinn's point that there may be some matters he wants to raise on Report Stage.  It would be more usual, however, to raise them on Committee Stage.  If one wants to give the Minister an opportunity to consider points, one raises them on Committee Stage and not on Report Stage where they cannot be teased out.  I have no doubt about the intentions of the Minister in relation to this Bill and I have no doubt that he would not be bringing it before the House unless his intentions were serious. However, I am concerned about the way section 2 is currently phrased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to deal with some of the later sections some of us may want to advert to the appalling records of one or two local authorities, in particular Dublin Corporation.  In the context of contacts <Col N="469" /> between the Department and certain local authorities, there may be much special pleading that, because of their short staffing arrangements and because of the particular problems they face, this Bill should not be brought into force in their areas for some time.  It would be of assistance to the Department if a particular date, regardless of the special pleading, on which this Bill will come into force was inserted.  I am quite happy to concede that the Minister may need more than three months.  That is not a point of principle.  I merely wanted to raise this point at this stage.  If the Minisiter is prepared to indicate to the House that he will bring in an amendment on Report Stage to amend the section to ensure that the Bill will come into general operation within six months or 12 months after its passage through the House with the Minister retaining the power to bring it into force at an earlier date in particular areas where he deems it appropriate to do so, I will be quite happy not to press the amendment today and to give him time to consider such an approach before Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I did not insert a particular date is that I feel that a period of 12 months would be too long.  I am not happy about a period of three months either as there may be certain local authorities who may not be able to comply with the deadline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be happy to consider that.  I will bring in an amendment on Report Stage.  I would be rather reluctant to include &ldquo;not later than 12 months&rdquo; because, if I were to do so, some would take full advantage of this and I do not want that to happen.  I would like the legislation to be implemented as quickly as possible without tying my hands.  We are all agreed that there is urgency attaching to this matter and I agree to bring in an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In using the &ldquo;not later <Col N="470" /> than&rdquo; formula it would be open to the Minister to implement the legislation earlier than the particular date specified.  As we all know, there is also the possibility which arises in political life that in six or seven months time there may be a reshuffle, a change of Government, and the Minister may have moved to another Department and a colleague of his may have taken over in the Department who may not be as well acquainted with this area as he is.  This House needs some assurance that, having done the work and passed this Bill, it will come into operation within a reasonable space of time. On the basis that the Minister will consider this suggestion before Report Stage, I am quite happy not to press this amendment at this stage.</P>

      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), to delete lines 6 to 9, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `structure' includes any building, dwelling, erection, excavation, or other thing, constructed, erected, or made on, in or under any land, or any part of a structure so defined, and where the context so admits, includes the land on, in, or under which the structure is situate;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be relatively brief.  On Second Stage a number of Deputies were anxious to ensure that the definition of &ldquo;structure&rdquo;<Col N="471" /> would make reference to dwellings.  It was pointed out by my colleague, the former Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, that the definition of &ldquo;structure&rdquo; when linked in with some of the other provisions in the Bill seemed somewhat tautological.  It is important that we ensure that the definition contains references to dwellings.  The definition in the Bill reads rather peculiarly in that it states that &ldquo;structure&rdquo; means any building, erection, structure, excavation or other thing, constructed, erected and so on.  I take it that we would all assume that &ldquo;structure&rdquo; means structure.  It could also mean anything other than structure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something on which the Progressive Democrats may have a particular view.  I would hope it is not derelict.  In the amendment I propose, I deleted the reference to &ldquo;structure&rdquo; as meaning structure as it seems that it is a meaningless concept.  I simply state that &ldquo;structure&rdquo; includes any building, dwelling, erection, excavation and so on.  In other words, the word &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; is specifically included.  I also agree that a dwelling, by definition, is also a building.  If the Department thought it was necessary to say that &ldquo;structure&rdquo; means structure it would seem that we should also ensure that no contested legal issue could arise as to whether a reference to a dwelling is included within the definition of a building.  We might as well be as explicit as we can and have the definition clear.  This amendment does not make any dramatic change.  It will clarify for anyone who is interested and concerned what we mean by &ldquo;structure&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Deputy is trying to improve on the drafting of the definition of the word &ldquo;structure&rdquo;. While the revised proposed draft appears to be adequate, I am somewhat reluctant about departing from the original definition in the Bill.  This is <Col N="472" /> expressed in identical terms with the definition of &ldquo;structure&rdquo; which is set out in section 2 (1) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, and which has been established in law and in judicial interpretation of land use and issues for some 25 years.  It has stood the test of time and has not fallen.  If it had obviously the question of it being interpreted in any other way to weaken it would arise.  &ldquo;Dwelling&rdquo; must be included in normal understanding as being so ascertained over the years.  For that reason, I invite the Deputy to allow something that has withstood the test of time to remain a little longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition in the 1963 Act is equally defective and it has stood the test of time because although judges have looked at it and thought it was rather odd that &ldquo;structure&rdquo; meant a structure, they applied a degree of common sense in interpretation.  If the 1963 Act got something wrong there is no reason to regard it as laid down in tablets of stone and continue to get it wrong for decades thereafter.</P>
      <P>We all know that there are oddities in the planning Bill with which we will be dealing another day.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment in the spirit in which it is intended because, as it is phrased, it will ensure that structures remain structures as they have been defined in the planning Act, but will make it quite explicit that dwellings are included.  In a sense this is a definition in a new Bill and there is no absolute certainty that the Judiciary will necessarily apply it in the same way.  I hope the Minister will accept that my definition is all inclusive and that it gets over the oddity of simply saying that &ldquo;structure&rdquo; means a structure.  We might as well get it right instead of repeating the oddities of the past.</P>

      <P>I understand Deputy Shatter's desire to get things right, but I cannot understand how a phrase that says <Col N="473" />&ldquo;any building, any erection or any structure&rdquo; could somehow be deemed to exclude the concept of a dwelling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>They are all covered under &ldquo;structure&rdquo; and have been interpreted by the courts on many occasions.  It is quite clearly understood that &ldquo;structure&rdquo; includes dwelling.  Why alter something that has been effective and efficient over the years?  I appreciate that Deputy Shatter would like to improve the definition, but the advice is that this has stood for over 25 years.  Some of the definitions have been very keenly judged over the last 25 years but they have stood up to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that my amendment in which I sought to delete the words &ldquo;by a State authority&rdquo; is out of order because it would indirectly result in a charge on the State.  I am concerned that the definition of &ldquo;urban land&rdquo;, the way it is interlinked with later sections of the Bill means in effect that if the local authority have within their area a piece of land or a building owned by a State body or Government Department, that has become derelict, they may not levy any charge or take any action under the Bill.  They cannot require such bodies to put their house in order.  That is a questionable approach and there is no reason for a Government Department, State authority or body being exempt from application of the provisions of the Bill in this context.  They should not be given a free ride to behave as they wish <Col N="474" /> with their property in a way that might be to the detriment of those who have property or to the detriment of the use of neighbouring lands.</P>
      <P>The Bill allows the Minister to consult colleagues who have responsibility in Government and State authorities.  The point was made on Second Stage that if the Minister for the Environment had to continuously engage in discussions with his ministerial colleagues whose Government Department came under their aegis and had derelict lands, the Bill would never operate.  I do not see why this exemption should be in the section.</P>
      <P>Another concern which will arise for a more detailed discussion in a later amendment is in the context of the definition of &ldquo;urban land&rdquo;.  Subsection (b) gives rise to considerable concern because it exempts from the definition of &ldquo;urban land&rdquo;&mdash; the basis on which a levy will be charged &mdash; lands that have become derelict as a result of the development objectives in a local government development. In particular, it refers to the practice of reserving the land for roads or parking places.  A blight has been imposed on the city of Dublin by Dublin Corporation for decades due to the long-term road widening objectives that successive corporation officials have imposed on the city.  They are very often long-term road objectives that will never result in road building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Corporation are the body singly responsible for the majority of the dereliction in the city.  By their long-term road widening plan, they have created a situation in parts of Dublin where properties in poor condition have been allowed to become derelict by owners because they know that those properties have fallen within the framework of long-term road widening objectives.  They have a residual hope that there might be a compulsory purchase order and the moneys they would have to raise to make good those properties make it an uneconomic proposition for them to do so while under the threat of a road widening proposal.  Dublin Corporation have been responsible in this area for continuing a practice which is still seen in the current <Col N="475" /> draft development plan that the corporation are dealing with.  Some of the less realistic long-term road widening and roads proposals have been removed from that draft plan but we could take up a great deal of the time of the House producing maps from the current draft plan which the corporation are looking at listing areas in the city where the road objectives have no reality at all.</P>
    <P>This provision is seriously defective in that it appears in a sense to leave it to the corporation to continue to create dereliction within the city.  It would be unjust, where that dereliction has been caused by the corporation, to impose a penalty on the people who own the land. I will be proposing an amendment which will enable the Minister to take steps with a local authority who have unrealistic road widening proposals so as to tackle the problem of dereliction.  I invite the Minister, in the context of Report Stage, to look not just at the problem of exempting State authorities but at what is in effect the blanket exemption given to local authorities, in particular Dublin Corporation, to continue to include long-term road widening objectives in development plans from decade to decade that have no reality in being built.</P>
    <P>There should be a limit imposed on the extent to which the planners can designate parts of a city or a county in the context of a long-term roads proposal.  It is unfair to people who live in the city, to those who own the properties, and it is the cause of planning blight and of dereliction. There are a lot of good things in the Bill which, in many ways, reflect many of the ideas contained in the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill.  There is no doubt that the two Bills together reflect work that was being done during the lifetime of the last Government and which is being continued during the lifetime of this Government.  Unfortunately the problems in this area are not being tackled.  I have no doubt that this problem will continue after the Bill is passed.  I can see major disputes arising.  In some instances disputes may arise when a local authority try to levy moneys, as provided <Col N="476" /> for in the Bill, on buildings they allege to be derelict.  Those against whom they try to levy the moneys will resist payment if they do not fall directly within the areas of the long-term road widening objective on the basis that that objective indirectly impinges on the value of their property to either make it uneconomic to keep it in good repair or prevent a new development taking place to end the problem of dereliction.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to highlight that problem in relation to the definition of urban land.  Other Members of the House are concerned about it and it was referred to on Second Stage.  I cannot table amendments on this issue because I cannot seek to impose a charge on the State in the context of State authorities, and there may be difficulties in regard to local authorities. It is because of that that I invite the Minister to have another look at the definition and at how we are dealing with local authorities that are causing dereliction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make two brief points on the section.  In principle it is wrong that the State should regularly seek to exempt itself from Bills of this nature.  It appears to me to make one law for the private citizen and to seek to apply other standards to the area of responsibility within the general jurisdiction of the State.  By the &ldquo;State&rdquo; in this case I mean Government Departments, local authorities, health boards, vocational education committees and semi-State bodies.  In cases like this they are a serious contributory part of the problem and I should like to ask the Minister to consider the wisdom of incorporating, as he is proposing to do, this easy option for areas under the jurisdiction of the State.  It is wrong in principle, possibly is wrong constitutionally, and certainly wrong socially, that a citizen who owns a piece of land should have to operate within a set of more rigorous parameters than the State which is designed to be the servant of the same citizenry.  It is wrong and I take issue with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter has correctly pointed <Col N="477" /> to the difficulty of the long-term reservation of land for roads.  It is proposed to continue to facilitate local authorities in this respect.  I would not be as harsh as Deputy Shatter with regard to local authorities.  There are clear reasons why this problem arises and the Minister might usefully invite in three or four of the senior managers of local authorities to discuss the reason why it can take 20 to 25 years to put together a piece of ground for necessary road development or housing development.  It is wrong to have a clause in a Bill which exempts pieces of property which are, apparently, designed for the purpose of reserving the land for roads when there is no definition of &ldquo;reserving&rdquo;.  In this case, as I am aware from my experience on my local authority, &ldquo;reserving&rdquo; can be purely notional. It can have no support from Government or Government Departments.</P>
    <P>In drawing the Minister's attention to those two points I should like to ask him to clear them up.  If they are not, and the Bill is passed as it is, I have no doubt that the contribution of local authorities &mdash; they are not the biggest offenders although they are significant contributors to the problem &mdash; to dereliction, blight and urban decay will continue.  The facility exists for them and, apparently, is being continued in the Bill.  I hope the Minister addresses those serious issues now or before Report Stage.  If I had my way the same law would apply to a local authority as applies to the people who pay the bills for the local authority, the taxpayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to the drafters of the provision one must read the definition in the context of section 24.  It could be construed that it is nonsense to have a local authority levy itself.  If we accept that local authorities are from time to time going to be the owners of derelict land, as is the case, we have to decide if we are going to ignore that altogether or if we are going to give them some type of incentive to use that land as quickly as possible.  By the same definition property developers, private developers, State and other authorities such as semi-State <Col N="478" /> bodies and local authorities, will from time to time be the possessors or acquirers of derelict land.  However, we are building into the Bill some degree of carrot and stick to ensure that the period of dereliction is as short as possible.  I am sure all Members agree with that objective.</P>
      <P>I am not a lawyer but in my view this definition could be construed in some respects to be unconstitutional because it is discriminatory.  It makes a clear discrimination in regard to a levy between one kind of landowner and another by virtue of the nature of the owner.  The principle of equality before the law, referred to by Deputies Shatter and Keating, is, as I understand it as a legislator, being violated in this instance.  It may be that it is being violated because the drafters of the Bill want to avoid the implicit circular transfer.  Section 24 gives details of how the levy on urban land will operate.  It states that a local authority can levy land in different ways.  Subsection (2) states that a derelict sites levy shall be paid by the owner of urban land to the local authority in whose functional area the said land is situated.  I concur substantially with Deputy Shatter's analysis that the biggest culprit for the state of land dereliction in Dublin city is the local authority.  It makes, to a certain extent, legal and administrative nonsense for the finance department or the property development department of Dublin Corporation to be imposing a levy on the roads section or some other division of the corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On reflection it may not make such a nonsense.  If a local authority had to pay a levy on land it was keeping derelict and if that levy was paid to central Government there would be an internal system of pricing and monitoring that would ensure that parcels of land would not be forgotten. That is what is happening at present.  The Workers' Party, in the course of their amendment, which was not moved, proposed to delete all State and local authority owned land from the <Col N="479" /> condition.  If that occurred the entire purpose of the exercise would be set at nought.</P>
    <P>We might as well tear up the rest of the legislation if we are going to exclude public authorities as landowners from the levy.  However, there should be some way around this system.  I can see from an administrative point of view the kind of nonsense of a local authority levy in itself but perhaps there could be some form of internal pricing &mdash; and that is what we are talking about &mdash; in real terms that would require a local authority, if they acquired land or went for a CPO, to take on board only that amount of a CPO which they knew they were capable of putting to good use by way of reconstruction and redevelopment.  Because there has been no form of pricing, so to speak, or prioritisation in effective terms, what has happened in the past is that local authorities at one section &mdash; I am talking about the larger ones &mdash; have taken large chunks of land much in advance of their ability to transform that land into the redevelopment structure, road widening or whatever, they wanted to carry out.  Whatever other benefits may have accrued in the process of that particular transaction such as making it easier for the administrators, having only one public hearing and so on, people in urban areas have had to suffer the consequences of dereliction and planning blight, of which the local authorities have been a primary cause.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to look at how he proposes to lean on local authorities to ensure that they do not continue to hold on to derelict land.  I know the Minister has that power but I am not necessarily happy that his successor may be as strident in exercising it because it is a very discretionary power and provides that &ldquo;the Minister may ...&rdquo;.  That is totally different from ensuring that once a levy is set on derelict land there is an automatic pricing system.  That is really my point.  This is a complex legislative matter and I invite the Minister to respond to it now and perhaps he can <Col N="480" /> look at it more substantially between now and Report Stage.  If we exclude State-owned and local authority-owned land from this definition, we will have to have much stronger coercive measures in the area of public-owned land which is derelict so that there is not a discretion on the one hand for public-owned land and a mandatory requirement on the other for privately-owned land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to apologise for not being here to move my amendment.  It is nobody's fault but my own.  I should have been here but I was not.</P>
      <P>The amendment I proposed to move would have ensured that local authorities would not be excluded from this provision. Under section 4 both local authority and State authority dwellings or land are excluded from the provision. The purpose of the amendment I intended moving was to allow State authority dwellings or land to be excluded but not those of the local authorities.  The amendment proposed excluding all words after &ldquo;the local authority and its functional area&rdquo; down to line 24 in section 4. I agree with Deputy Quinn that it may seem strange for a local authority to levy themselves but I see no reason for their not doing so.  Of course, it would be different for the State authority to do this and it would be rather foolish.  There is ample precedent for excluding the State from such provisions, for example, the Planning Acts, on the old ground that, presumably, the king can do no wrong. Nevertheless, the king does terrible wrong, as all kings did, and as the State still does in the planning area.  The State does not have to seek planning permission and it can carry out terrible acts in the planning area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am saying is that while there is precedent for the State authority to be excluded from such legislative provisions there is no reason the local authorities should be excluded.  Local authorities have to seek planning permission from each other and in the Dublin area Dublin City Council, when they were building <Col N="481" /> houses three years ago, had to seek planning permission from Dublin County Council.  There is no reason local authorities should not be included in this provision and levied in whatever way those in the private sector are levied.</P>
    <P>In Dublin city, in particular in the inner city areas &mdash; the area between the canals &mdash; the greatest level of dereliction has been caused by the inner tangent ring road which was planned 30 years ago and which has over the long period consistently created decay, moved forward bits and pieces and caused buildings to be knocked down.  Only last year a lovely old pub at the corner of Kevin Street or Cuffe Street was knocked down to make way for the inner tangent ring road and only last autumn one side of Parnell Street was knocked down after years of dereliction.  We can see dreadful derelection in King Street where there are railings and weeds where once there were houses and people full of life.  There is a huge amount of dereliction in the inner city area, the part of the city people constantly travel through and visit and which is visible at all times to tourists.  This area of the city suffers most from dereliction and much of this is due to the inner tangent ring road.  When dereliction reaches a certain stage &mdash; and, of course, this is part of the plan &mdash; all those who have been opposed to the building of roads in that area suddenly agree to the building of a road because they believe anything is better than the dreadful dereliction there.  That is exactly what happened in Clanbrassil Street where after years of dereliction in the area people said the road should be built because the area was in such a bad state.</P>
    <P>The local authority have a responsibility in this area.  I am not saying that local authorities should not build roads, carry out repairs or widen roads, but the decision to build an inner tangent ring road which no matter what resolution was passed by the local authority councillors, could not be changed once it was set down 30 years ago, is an example of the managerial and dictatorial system which exists in local authorities who do not have powers.  They simply have power to create <Col N="482" /> public opinion and if we allow them to escape from the provisions in this Bill it will not make any sense to the public.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of levies there are also other provisions in the Bill from which local authorities will be excluded if we exclude them from the provision in this section, so it is important that they should be included in this provision.  I ask the Minister to look again at why local authorities should not be included in the Bill.  I can understand why a State authority should not be included in this provision. However, some time ago a house in Merrion Square which is in the ownership of the Office of Public Works had weeds growing out of it.  If there are problems in that area surely the Minister should deal with them.  I agree that the State should not be included in this section but I do not agree that the local authorities should be excluded and I ask the Minister to look again at including the local authorities in the provisions here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of the arguments are not really appropriate to this section.  I take it that they will come up again on a subsequent section.  What we are talking about here are definitions.  To answer some of the points made, the first thing that has to be said is that the local authorities are not exempt from the provisions of this Bill.  There is a general duty on local authorities under section 11 to see to it that any land they have does not fall into dereliction.  The one exception is that they will not have to pay the levy.  That is the only exemption that exists so far as local authorities are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that that is the only language they would understand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait a moment now.  The provisions of this Bill will apply to semi-State and to other statutory bodies.  There is no exemption there so far as the levy is concerned &mdash; and that should be understood &mdash; other than for the Minister, and that means Ministers of the Government. Of course, the Minister has a very particular power which was referred to by <Col N="483" /> Deputy Quinn to direct the disposal by local authorities or statutory bodies of their land if they are not keeping it in a non-derelict condition.  That is a very exceptional power which is embodied in this legislation.  So far as the local authorities are concerned, everything that applies to everybody else is included except the question of paying the levy to themselves.  The only reason for that is that it would involve the question of transfers because of the considerable sums of money the State and the Exchequer give to the local authorities in support of their total funding.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that if we were to apply a levy to local authorities which they were to levy against themselves and they were winding it up, and because of that they were getting an enormous sum of money into their coffers, it would immediately be understood by Finance and a clawback would be involved.  It would not serve any useful purpose.  We are not facilitating local authorities so far as the reservation of land for roads or anything else is concerned.  We are only exempting the unfortunate land owner &mdash; and that is important &mdash; from paying the levy because of reservations which are put in by the local authority.  It is not that we are accommodating the local authorities in that regard.  Of course, we all appreciate the fact that the precedent is there in these matters so far as the levying of local authorities is concerned and the State is not subject to rating.  It never has been and the same would apply so far as the principle of the State paying money to itself is concerned.</P>
      <P>It is well to remember &mdash; and this is, perhaps, something that has been overlooked in the definitions &mdash; so far as derelict land is concerned and, perhaps, this will answer Deputy Mac Giolla, that derelict land owned by one local authority in the administrative area of another local authority is not exempt from the levy.  It is only non-leviable if a local authority own land in their own administrative area.  That is an important aspect which might be overlooked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Accepting what the Minister says, it is right that the definition of land should not result in the local authority levying the owner of land which has become derelict due to the action of the local authority.  The point I was trying to make is that we start off with that definition and then go through a plan of the Act.  The Bill does not prescribe how to cope with the problem of the local authority who take actions which result in land in private ownership becoming derelict.  That might define the problem to a greater extent.  I fully accept that section 11 is there.  It states:</P>
      <P>It is the duty of a local authority to take all reasonable steps .... to ensure any land situate .... does not become or .... continue to become a derelict site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a duty but when land is in private ownership how do you get the local authority to comply with that duty?  At a later stage &mdash; and it might have been of assistance to the House if we had taken it at this stage and in conjunction with this section &mdash; we will come to an amendment which I have proposed to section 13 which is of relevance in this context.  If a local authority have long term road widening <Col N="485" /> proposals which will not produce a road in the next ten or 20 years and their long term declared objective is causing dereliction, how do you get the local authority to take a different approach so as not to cause dereliction?  It is one thing to say that the landowner will not be levied but the landowner finds there is a blight on his property.  He cannot sell it, he cannot develop it and he is tied into it by virtue of the actions of the local authority.  I am not sure what this Bill does in the context of section 11 to enable the enforcement of the duty.  It is not a question of the Minister requiring the local authority to sell the land because it is not owned by the local authority.  It is still in private ownership so that issue does not arise.</P>
    <P>The Bill should contain a provision requiring local authorities, once they declare such objectives, to buy the land automatically rather than leaving it as a long term objective to wait until the day dawns when five, ten, 15 or 20 years later either a compulsory notice is served to purchase or the local authority change their mind and remove the long term objective.  I do not know if either of these objectives is envisaged.  There is certainly nothing in this Bill that would require purchase.</P>
    <P>If local authorities were required, within a specified time, to purchase lands for which road objectives were designated it would very rapidly result in local authorities, such as Dublin Corporation, taking a more realistic view as to what lands they so designate.  Perhaps we will come back to this matter at a later stage.  We are talking about local authorities creating dereliction on lands in private ownership and this Bill contains no teeth to require the local authorities to take a different approach.  I am not saying the local authorities should not have long term road widening objectives &mdash; they must have for a normal planning system &mdash; but those objectives should be based on reality and should not be based on a fantasy as some of them are, certainly within the city of Dublin.</P>

      <Col N="486" /> NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;In this section `derelict site' means any land (in this section referred to as `the land in question') which detracts or is likely to detract to a material degree from the amenity, character or appearance of land, buildings or a dwelling or dwellings in the neighbourhood in question because of&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  the existence on the land in question of a structure or structures which are in a dilapidated, ruinous or derelict condition, or</P>
      <P>(b)  the neglected, unsightly or objectionable condition of the land, buildings or dwellings or any other structure or structures on the land in question, or</P>
      <P>(c)  the presence, deposit or collection on the land in question of any litter, rubbish, debris or waste, except where the presence, deposit or collection of such litter, rubbish, debris or waste results from the exercise of a right conferred by statute or by common law.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the concept of derelict sites.  There are a number of differences between this section and the original section contained in the Bill.  In the context of talking about a derelict site meaning any land which detracts, or is likely to detract, to a material degree from the amenity, character or appearance of land, buildings, or a dwelling or dwellings in the neighbourhood, the specific reference here is to the words &ldquo;land&rdquo;, &ldquo;buildings&rdquo;, &ldquo;a dwelling&rdquo; or &ldquo;dwellings&rdquo;.  The intent is to ensure that if a property is derelict and that dereliction only impinges on one neighbouring dwelling or a neighbouring building, the concept of derelict site will be said to apply to it.  It is also designed to ensure <Col N="487" /> that where a property becomes dilapidated as opposed to being in a ruinous, derelict or dangerous condition, action can be taken in the context of it being regarded as a derelict site.  One could persuasively argue that something reaches a dilapidated condition before it reaches a ruinous condition or a dangerous condition.  It is proposed accordingly that the word &ldquo;dilapidate&rdquo; will add something to the Bill.  Reference to a dilapidation was contained in the Private Members' Bill being circulated.  I would ask the Minister to give favourable consideration to this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 reads:</P>
      <P>In this section &ldquo;derelict site&rdquo; means any land ... which detracts, or is likely to detract, to a material degree....</P>
      <P>It occurs to me that in that context it might be argued that derelict land might only mean land which detracts or can be said to detract from the value of land in the neighbourhood.  What I am trying to achieve is that where, for example, there is a broad stretch of street or a widespread area of dereliction, and one has a piece of property or a site at the centre of it, one could not argue that it did not detract from the value of land, because the rest of the place is run-down and derelict.</P>
      <P>The thrust of section 4 seems to refer only to the impact of the derelict site on the neighbourhood, the implication being that it is unique in terms of the neighbourhood. In a wide area of dereliction each individual site is objectionable, so I simply want to include a reference which would say that the site if it is neglected, unsightly or in an objectionable condition, regardless of its impact on the area, would be covered by this Bill.  At present it appears to suggest that a derelict site is derelict only if it is likely to detract to a material degree from the neighbourhood.  Surely it is more than that.  There are parts of my own constituency where derelict sites do not detract from the neighbourhood because the whole area is derelict.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The way in which the amendments are framed suggests that the proposers are largely satisfied with the definition proposed in the Bill but see the possibility of improving on it in a certain marginal way.</P>
      <P>One of the concerns in amendment No. 6 is to make it clearer that the reference to structures comprehends the singular as well as the plural.  My preliminary reaction is that this is adequately covered by the Interpretation Act.  I will see that the parliamentary draftsman is consulted and if necessary I will have an amendment drafted on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the rest of the changes suggested by amendment No. 6 is less obvious.  The proposers add buildings and dwellings to land, apparently in an attempt to amplify the meaning of the latter, but under section 3 &ldquo;land&rdquo; is defined to include any structure.  We have already discussed the question of structures, and structure is defined comprehensively to include every conceivable building and without doubt to include dwellings.  I do not see how the second set of drafting changes can be necessary. It might only serve to cast doubt on the existing definitions of land and structure.</P>
      <P>I am having second thoughts about dilapidation, and I will consider that.  It is necessary to refer that back.  I support the point of view expressed in relation to dilapidation, and if there is something that has to be adjusted subsequently, I will do so.  I will apply the same kind of logic to amendment No. 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 would posit the neglected, unsightly or objectionable condition of land as a criterion for dereliction on its own, and not necessarily as connected with the neighbourhood and surroundings.  I am somewhat reluctant to take this proposal on board. <Col N="489" /> Neglected, unsightly or objectionable are all somewhat subjective concepts and interpreting them in isolation might lead to argument or to litigation.  I am very conscious of that in all matters connected with this legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn referred to it in another context but at the basis of all my discussions with my advisers, we were very conscious of that possibility running right throughout this legislation.  That is why I have to be careful about accepting some of the amendments, even though I like the tone in which they are proposed and the ideas behind them.  Unfortunately, it is not always possible to take them on board.</P>
    <P>The definition as drafted embodies these concepts but subordinated to the more basic criterion of whether a site detracts or is likely to detract to a material degree from the amenity and character of the neighbourhood, my advice is that classification of derelict land based on this more general and flexible criterion is more likely to stand up to a challenge.  For that reason I would ask Deputies to appreciate the points made.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="490" /> In page 7, lines 4 to 10, to delete subsection (2), and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  Where it is proposed to make regulations under this Act, a draft of the regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and they shall not come into effect until a motion approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A similar section to this appears in many Bills.  I have moved similar amendments to other Bills in the past but they have never been accepted by any Minister. The purpose of the amendment is to do away with the procedure used in the Bill which means that regulations are slipped through if people are not very alert so that they can put in a motion of annulment. My alternative wording would mean that the Minister would have to bring the regulation before the House with a motion approving the draft.  In that way the House would be aware that a regulation was being issued and the draft would be before them for approval and when approved by each House would become law.  The current procedure is that the Minister can make a regulation and if nobody spots it within 21 sitting days of the House, even though it might have been opposed, and nobody has put down a resolution annulling the regulation within 21 sitting days, it goes through automatically.  Many regulations go through in this way without the knowledge of many Deputies.  It would be far more democratic if a Minister were to bring his regulation before the House in the form of a draft motion for approval. That is what I am proposing.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 10 reads:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (2), line 4, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert&rdquo;, other than a regulation referred to in section 24 (4),&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> This amendment is consequential on amendment No. 34.  Under amendment No. 34, regulations under section 24 prescribing an increase in derelict sites levy greater than 2 percentage points will have to be approved by affirmative resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is an exception to the general provision under section 5 whereby regulations will be subject only to the annulling resolution within 21 days.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 states that this exception is in relation to regulations arising under section 24.  In Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment No. 9 he wants to be able to apply the exceptional procedure of affirmative confirmation by the Oireachtas to all regulations made under it.  I know of no precedent in any legislation for invoking this procedure across the length and breadth of legislation.  The procedure of presenting regulations subject to annulment only is the standard one for regulations of the routine kind. It is only where policy issues of particular importance are concerned, or matters which are tantamount to elaborating on legislation, that the procedure of affirmative confirmation is normally used.  I know that Deputy Mac Giolla and his people have been making this connection in all legislation before the House for some considerable time.  It has nothing to do with this legislation in isolation from the other legislation before the House.  It is the policy of The Workers' Party to pursue this point in all legislation.  To date it has been rejected and when you consider what my amendment No. 10 proposes, that is adequate to deal with what we want.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the sentiment of the amendment in the name of The Workers' Party Deputies.  However, given the appalling record of legislation achievement in enacting the main body of legislation, the idea that we would subject ourselves also to having to bring in every regulation would bring this House to a close.  We are still in the Stone Age of taking 20 to 25 minutes to conduct a vote in this House at present.  With a <Col N="492" /> more streamlined and modernised Dáil procedure I would support this section in terms of how we would introduce regulations for all types of legislation.  Deputy Mac Giolla indicated that this is a standard type of section for which The Workers' Party have consistently proposed an affirmative type of order rather than an annulling order.  I recognise that what the Minister is doing in his amendment which we are taking together with Deputy Mac Giolla's is something quite different.  He is actually enabling the House to second guess in a sense, or turn down the amount of a levy above 2 per cent which the House may feel is excessive or not sufficient, relative to the circumstances. The House will recall that on Second Stage when we talked about this section in general terms it was a question of how to make an efficiency tax efficient &mdash; if I can paraphrase my own phrase.  You can get collective opinion but that, conducted behind closed doors, may be deemed to be excessive, arbitary or inadequate.  I welcome the Minister's provision.  It opens up a debate in which the House can have a full chance to decide whether the amount of money proposed to be levied on whomever is adequate or inadequate.  I compliment the Minister and those who drafted the provision.  It has got over a certain degree of rigidity in the way in which some people felt that this system might be operated. Time will tell as to how effective it is when it is in operation.  I think that it is the right kind of thinking and would encourage it.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Quinn.  It is a start down the road of getting greater involvement by the Chamber in dealing with these matters.  This is a good place to start in so far as levies are concerned.  It applies to increases from previous years' levies also, which gives the double safeguard to the House if they wish to pursue it.  I have my doubts whether it will be as effective in practice as in the preaching of it here in the legislation.</P>

      <P>In page 7, subsection (1) (b), line 25, after &ldquo;it&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;with some person over sixteen years of age&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to seek to be fair in relation to the delivery of the fairly important service of notice which is dealt with in this section.  In subsection (b) line 25, it is stated that notice can be served on the person under this Act by &ldquo;leaving it at the address at which he ordinarily resides or, in a case in which an address for service has been furnished, at that address.&rdquo;  In the case of derelict sites, we may very well be talking about an empty building or a shell, or structure, or dwelling, which may very well be boarded up, vacated and so on.  To be fair about it, the notice should be left with some person.  That is not unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to inhibit in any way the <Col N="494" /> Bill from succeeding but for somebody in a local authority, say, perhaps working from an out of date register or list of names and addressed to post a notice perhaps into a boarded up window and say that this has therefore been served is irrational and does not conform to any reasonable requirements, in terms of giving a person a chance to enter any kind of defence.  It could be tested and challenged and would ultimately not result in what we want done.  I suggest that we should insert a phrase that it should be left with some person over 16 years of age, not necessarily related to or part of a family, but that it should be handed to a person.  At least that is some indication that the alleged owner of the dwelling or site will actually hear about it.  The idea of leaving a notice on the window sill, as you might leave a parking ticket, is less than reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>If they know it is your letterbox, they proceed in the usual way but if they do not they have to find some other method.  While I appreciated what you are trying to get at, Deputy, I think the amendment may make it considerably more difficult for the local authority to use section 7 (1) (b), paragraph (b) as it stands contains no requirement to leave a notice with any person but only envisages a notice being left at the ordinary address of the person to whom it is directed.  Paragraph (b) assumes that this ordinary address is known to the local authority but if it is not then paragraph (d) must be used instead.  By introducing a requirement of first, leaving the notice with the person at that address and second that the person be over 16 years, the amendment introduces considerable scope for counter-claims and argument and that is the one thing that you, Deputy, have rightly said you do not want to come about because of your action. The section as it stands has numerous precedents in environment law and I would prefer not to change it.  We are taking our advice from the 1963 Planning Act and others and for that reason I ask you to accept that as being the best way <Col N="495" /> to achieve what you want to achieve.  We would minimise the effect if we proceed with what you are asking.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - HIV-Infected Haemophiliacs: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Howlin on Tuesday, 25 April 1989:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann recognises the particular position of haemophilia sufferers who are HIV positive and who have contracted AIDS.  Dáil Éireann considers that the State has a particular responsibility to all AIDS sufferers and that the State must take into account that many haemophiliacs were infected <Col N="496" /> with the HIV virus through blood products supplied, albeit unwittingly, by State agencies.  Dáil Éireann therefore, calls on the Government to establish a trust fund of £400,000 per annum for HIV infected haemophiliacs.  Dáil Éireann also calls on the Government, and particularly the Minister for Health, to ensure that every public health facility is made available to all AIDS sufferers.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and insert:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;rejects any proposals which would inherently result in discrimination between individuals suffering from AIDS or the AIDS virus; Dáil Éireann further considers that all such persons should be treated with sensitivity and understanding and notes in this respect that a Working Group under the Chairmanship of the Minister of State at the Department of Health is to report to the Minister for Health next week on any difficulties which persons suffering from AIDS or HIV may have in gaining access to health services appropriate to their condition; Dáil Éireann notes also the offer of the Minister for Health made to the Irish Haemophilia Society to provide £50,000 for counselling services and his willingness to make a contribution towards a Trust Fund which may be established by or on behalf of AIDS sufferers.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>As I said last night before I moved the Adjournment, it can be seen that the Department and the Blood Transfusion Service Board acted to protect the blood as the first priority in relation to AIDS and acted at all times to introduce newly <Col N="497" /> discovered protective measures, as soon as it was possible to do so towards achieving this end.</P>
      <P>The State, and its agencies, have a statutory involvement in relation to the medical treatment received, but the determination of that liability, if any &mdash; which is a cricial issue in this case and indeed of others who were involved &mdash; is a legal issue, and one which is a matter for the legal process to adjudicate upon and one which would have to take cognisance of the roles, responsibilities, rights and inter-relationships of and between others involved.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party motion calls on Dáil Éireann to recognise the special position of haemophilia sufferers who are also AIDS victims and to agree that the State has a particular responsibility to all AIDS sufferers.  Similarly, it calls upon the Minister for Health to ensure that every public health facility is made available to all AIDS victims, irrespective of income. On this theme also, it has been represented to me, and argued in the Seanad, that the State, and in particular the Minister for Health, has an obligation to provide especially for the haemophiliac group of AIDS sufferers on the basis that they are a finite group and that they contracted the infection through no fault of their own.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Health, I have a statutory responsibility to provide health services for all persons who require them. My responsibility and that of the State in fulfilling the statutory duty of care towards treating all persons equitably and uniformly should not, and cannot, involve considerations of differentiation between one group over another, on the basis of the nature of their illness, the finiteness of their numbers, the possible source of their infection or their lifestyle.</P>
      <P>Many families are and will continue to be affected by the AIDS virus, the effects of which are direct and immediate not only for haemophiliacs but for intravenous drug abusers, homosexuals, and bisexuals.</P>
      <P>To date, a total of 88 cases of full-blown AIDS have been reported to the Department of Health, as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Over 20,000 persons have been tested for HIV and, of these, over 800 have tested positive.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that over half of the intravenous drug abusers who have tested positive for the virus have families and 53 of their babies have tested positive. In this context, I am happy to be associated with the research project on paediatric AIDS launched yesterday by my colleague, Mr. Terry Leyden TD, Minister of State, which is being undertaken by the AIDS Fund and funded to the extent of £30,000 by the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Dealing with one group in a special way, for what is an extremely sensitive condition, would have the effect of setting apart other groups of sufferers from the same illness and of attributing guilt and thus discrimination against these groups.  It was with interest, therefore, that I noted the recent comment made on radio and television by the chairman of the AIDS Action Alliance highlighting the plight of other groups, if special arrangements were made for one particular group of AIDS sufferers.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties have made a similar statement.</P>
    <P>The complexities involved in this issue are shown by the conflicting positions <Col N="499" /> which are being taken.  These show the difficulties involved and the consideration that arises from a fragmented approach which was correctly described as a &ldquo;nightmare&rdquo; by my predecessor Deputy Desmond, as quoted in an article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> on 12 February 1989.  It is interesting that in the same story he stated that no decision had been taken by the previous Government to do anything for AIDS sufferers or for haemophiliacs specifically.  It has also been put to me by some of those particularly concerned with the rights of those suffering from AIDS that:</P>
    <P>The claim by haemophiliacs will impose a considerable strain on the co-operation between different groups &mdash; some will feel that they are now about to be left out in the cold as &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; victims while the &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; victims attract support.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board having considered all the issues voted recently against introducing special measures for haemophiliacs and Dr. David Nowlan former medical correspondent in <i>The Irish Times,</i> in an article in the <i>Irish Medical News</i> on 30 January 1989 spoke of the implications involved in making distinctions of any kind between particular groups in society on the basis of the source of their illness or condition.  He referred, in particular, to the submission of the Irish Haemophilia Society to the Government, as follows:</P>
    <P>The sweet reasonableness of the document and the extent and depth of the anxiety and misery that it reveals in the most temperate of tones make it very difficult to resist its conclusions and recommendations.  Why should not these innocent victims of one of the gravest pandemics the world has met this century not be comforted and cosseted to the limited extent that is possible?  They are, above all, surely not to blame for their condition.  They sought only lifesaving care to protect them against bleeding and yet they were dealt a death-dealing virus.  Surely they deserve recompense.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> Of course they do, and I hope that they will receive at least some of what they seek.  But if they do, then something pretty similar is going to have to be offered to a great many more people who also currently carry the Human Immunodeficiency Virus in their blood, for there is no way that any society can make distinctions between &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; and &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; victims of disease.</P>
    <P>How innocent or how guilty are those infants who contracted AIDS from their infected mothers?  How innocent or guilty is the wife who was unknowingly infected by an errant husband? How guilty, exactly, were the first victims of this previously unknown disease, whether they were homosexuals in America or Ireland, or travellers in Central Africa, or whoever or whatever they were?</P>
    <P>He goes on to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>The whole notion of guilty and innocent in the context of disease or injury is a profoundly dangerous one.  Shall we ask casualty officers to distinguish between the driver whose actions contributed to the road accident and the passenger who was travelling in the car at the same time?  Will we refuse treatment to the emphysematous patient whose life-long smoking habit may have caused the illness?  Have we not only recently heard of an apparently successful liver transplant programme for alcoholics with terminal cirrhosis?</P>
    <P>It requires a greater omniscience than the average human community can provide to make distinctions of any kind between allegedly innocent and allegedly guilty victims of the kind of society we live in.  It is neither humanly nor humanely possible to draw distinctions between those victims who call for succour.  Does someone grappling with heroin addiction need less help than someone coping with haemophilia? Is not the burden of AIDS devastating to both of them?  They all need everybody's help.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> In my view in those passages Dr. Nowlan outlines the dilemma quite accurately.</P>
    <P>The Government strategy on AIDS has been developing since 1982, and all along it has been monitored and adjusted as appropriate in line with current developments in other countries. It compares very well with strategies adopted elsewhere, including the USA.</P>
    <P>Since the commencement of the strategy, care has been taken to ensure that the potential for discrimination or stigmatisation does not arise.  AIDS is a life threatening condition which can be contracted in a variety of ways &mdash; through a sexual and/or drug-taking lifestyle, by foetal transmission to the babies of infected mothers or, in the case of haemophiliacs, by their medical treatment. Other conditions of illhealth are serious and also life threatening, such as cancer, heart disease and some infectious diseases which are also associated with lifestyle. These do not have the same stigma attaching to them as AIDS although each of them requires the same broad preventative and management strategies.  It is important that the AIDS virus is seen, debated and considered in the context of all life threatening conditions and that sufferers are not made to feel as if they were outcasts in our society.</P>
    <P>It has always been the norm in our society that persons who may have contracted an illness continue to work as long as they are able to do so and as long as they are no threat to those working with them.  Against this background it is difficult to understand how a national daily paper could describe as charitable the continuation of this practice as it relates to those with the AIDS virus who work in one of our semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>In relation to treatment I have mentioned the priority which was given to protecting the blood supply and the measures introduced to achieve this.  Prevention, through public information programmes and the AIDS telephone service, is being augmented by public information and education aimed at target groups such as intravenous drug <Col N="502" /> abusers and pupils attending secondary schools.  A feature of this strategy is the Outreach Programme aimed at intravenous drug abusers and currently being developed by the Eastern Health Board. Health professionals continue to be educated and informed about AIDS and in-patient and community based services continue to be developed.  In this regard I was very pleased to note the opening this week by the Eastern Health Board of the new walk-in facility in Baggot Street, Dublin.  It is proposed to open a second such facility in the north side of the city in the near future.</P>
    <P>These are some of the new measures being developed by the Department of Health in conjunction with the statutory and voluntary agencies.  They are supported by finance made available from the Department through special allocations from the national lottery, which are over and above the normal financial allocations.  In 1988, a total of £450,000 was made available from the lottery and a similar amount is being made available in 1989.</P>
    <P>The following grants have been made specifically for haemophiliacs who have contracted the virus; a direct grant of £5,000 to the Irish Haemophilia Society in respect of AIDS services, including provision of support, counselling and services; the EHB grant of £12,000 to the Irish Haemophilia Society was increased to £30,000 in 1989 with my approval; a grant of £15,000 was made available to St. James's Hospital in 1988 for counselling. I have arranged for a grant of £30,000 this year to enable the service to continue in 1989, and I am happy to announce a further grant being made to St. James's Hospital to enable it to recruit a dietitian and a nurse for the haemophiliac unit there, as soon as possible. This funding is in addition to the funding made available to St. James's Hospital to run the national haemophiliac and AIDS unit which is of the order of £700,000 each year.</P>
    <P>At a meeting with representatives of the society on 10 February last, I offered a grant of £50,000 from the Department's <Col N="503" /> allocation towards counselling and support services.  I understand that the society will be submitting proposals as to how this money should be spent.  The offer of this grant is, of course, separate to any consideration of the substantive issues raised by the society with the Government.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, necessary to ensure that the health services available to all AIDS sufferers are appropriate and accessible.  Towards this end, as I already mentioned, I established a working group to review the accessibility to health services of all AIDS suffers.  The working group are chaired by Deputy Terry Leyden, my colleague and Minister of State, and includes representatives of the Irish Haemophilia Society, the Department of Health, the Virus Reference Laboratory, UCD, the Eastern and Southern Health Boards and the Drugs Treatment and advisory Centre.</P>
    <P>The group have already met with a number of relevant persons and organisations including St. James's Hospital, the AIDS Action Alliance and the Haemophilia Society.  The submissions made to the group by the organisations and individuals give, I understand, an extremely useful picture of the appropriateness, adequacy and accessibility to health services for AIDS suffers.  The group are finalising their report and following their consideration I will decide on an appropriate course of action.</P>
    <P>The position taken by Governments abroad has been quoted to support the submission made by the Irish Haemophilia Society and in particular the establishment in the UK of a £10 million trust fund by the Government there.  I understand that, to date, only £700,000 of the £10 million has been disbursed in two years from the fund, due mainly to the unwillingness of infected haemophiliacs to come forward for fear of recognition and stigmatisation.  As I said earlier, legal action is being taken in the UK despite the establishment of the trust fund there.</P>
    <P>Apart from the UK, only Denmark of the 12 EC countries has introduced a <Col N="504" /> special scheme of payments, although France is said to be considering the matter.  West Germany has a general drugs related injury scheme.  The Department of Health are keeping in close touch with the situation in the EC member states. The different approaches being taken throughout the Community reflect the complexity of the issue and demonstrate that there is no simple solution to the problem.  All of the issues need to be explored thoroughly and objectively.  The implications of dealing with haemophiliacs in a special and distinct way, need to be examined and understood.</P>
    <P>The position in the Netherlands is particularly interesting.  There is no official scheme of payments there, one of the reasons being that the standard and essential medical treatment was given in good faith at the time.  However, in the Netherlands a private foundation exists which helps to meet the financial needs of haemophiliacs.</P>
    <P>As I stated on coming into the House last night, the AIDS Fund were prepared to set up a trust.  Since then officials of my Department have met representatives of the AIDS Fund and we have made an offer to the fund recognising their objective role in caring for AIDS sufferers, and the board are going to consider the offer that was made to them.  I believe we have made a reasonable compromise.  The Government are prepared to provide £250,000 in the current year towards such a fund when it is established. As regards future years, there is nothing to stop the trust, like other voluntary bodies, making an application for consideration.  It would be considered in the normal way in the light of the situation as it exists at that time.</P>
    <P>According to their motion the Opposition want us to provide money every year, with no limit on the number of years.  I understand, however, that they are prepared to reduce the number of years from four to three.  I am sure they appreciate that a Minister must behave in a responsible way.  We would look at this trust fund in the light of the prevailing circumstances in other years.  It would be <Col N="505" /> most unreasonable to expect the Government to commit themselves.  I certainly would not commit the Exchequer to funding a trust each successive year. When the trust is established it will attract funding from a lot of other sources including financial institutions, pharmaceutical companies and the general public.  We can look at it in another year.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Opposition to see how reasonable our position is.  We are providing £250,000.  If a trust fund is established I have no doubt that it will rise to over £400,000 in the current year due to subscriptions from others.  The case can be looked at each year.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that it has been found necessary to seek to resolve this issue on the floor of Leinster House. Other Governments across Europe have responded spontaneously with compassion, humanity and understanding to the problem of haemophiliacs infected with HIV.  The Minister for Health, both in Dáil Questions on Thursday, 9 February and in a subsequent Seanad debate on 1 March, has refused to acknowledge the unique circumstances of haemophiliacs with the HIV virus and AIDS and has rejected the establishment of a trust fund.  The campaign of the Irish Haemophiliac Society commenced a year ago in April 1988 without clear success to date.  The facts are unfortunately all too tragic.  Of 300 haemophiliacs in this country, 106 are HIV positive.  Over ten have developed full blown AIDS.  Several have died and more will die.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unique circumstances of haemophiliacs are fourfold.  First, they have to cope with two diseases, each of which <Col N="506" /> involves an enormous strain and adjustment to a normal healthy life.  Second, it was through the medical treatment of haemophilia that they contracted the HIV virus and AIDS.  Third, unlike any other category of AIDS patients, the number infected is finite.  The last diagnosed case relates back to 1986 and further cases will not recur due to pre-heat treatment of blood products.  I was at the AIDS fund launch yesterday and we heard that AIDS numbers in total are doubling every nine or ten months.  The number of haemophiliacs infected in this way will not increase.  They are a defined limited group.  The fourth point is that haemophiliacs with the HIV virus are the only category of such sufferers who have a potential case for litigation against components of the health services.  It has never been argued that drug abusers and the gay community would have any potential case for litigation.  The four points I have made single out the haemophilia group.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it quite clear from legal advice I have obtained and from other precedents established by previous Governments that allocations of State finance can be made on a strictly without prejudice basis to any legal defence that might be submitted in the future relating to a legal claim against the health services for compensation.  In fact, I have been advised by senior counsel that the courts could well dismiss a legal compensation claim in the future if adequate compensation or financial arrangements had already been made available to them.</P>
    <P>On the question of responsibility, I believe serious questions must be asked about the adequacy and timing of steps which were taken by the Blood Transfusion Board and more especially by international drug companies supplying Factor 8 and Factor 9 blood coagulants from potentially infected donors in switching to alternative sources such as an Irish self-sufficiency in these blood products. The first case of AIDS in an Irish haemophiliac became evident in December 1984.  I should like the Minister to clarify at some future date his Department's record of events relating to the <Col N="507" /> introduction of heat treatment in both Irish and foreign Factor 8 and Factor 9 products and the substitution of Irish blood products for foreign products.  I am not saying indisputedly that the chronological list of events provides that earlier action could have been taken, but it has been strongly suggested to me that this is the case.  While I have heard the Minister's defence based on state of the art, I should like to see the chronological list of events to put the matter beyond doubt. The nature of litigation which would ultimately prove these issues is extremely slow and costly.  It is so slow as to be of little use to victims who are HIV positive or diagnosed as having AIDS.  They are unable to keep appointments with solicitors, let alone be alive by the time cases might be listed for hearing.</P>
    <P>Personally I do attach responsibility in the widest sense to international drug companies for obtaining their blood bank from donors at risk.  We know the system in the United States where they have paid donors.  I call on the relevant pharmaceutical enterprises of Baxter Travenol, Cutter, Armour and Imuno &mdash; to name but some &mdash; to consider in a similar, without prejudice, fashion contributing financially to a trust fund for Irish haemophiliacs with HIV positive and AIDS. I firmly believe that responsibility and compassion do not rest solely with the Exchequer in this instance and, therefore, non-Exchequer funding must be the objective of any trust fund.  I understand that in Spain a royal foundation has been established along these lines which has received contributions not only from the Exchequer but from the pharmaceutical sector.  Such an approach should be followed here.</P>
    <P>Some criticisms have been voiced concerning the position of other categories of HIV and AIDS sufferers other than haemophiliacs who are allegedly being neglected and discriminated against because of the demand to set up this trust fund.  I have to reject this on a number of grounds.  However, this criticism would not arise if the Government had a comprehensive health care and welfare <Col N="508" /> plan for all such AIDS patients.  The absence of this should not be used as an argument to dismiss the justifiable claims of haemophiliacs.  These arguments from the Minister are somewhat hollow and futile.  I reject the assertion that, because little is being done for all AIDS victims, nothing extra should be done for haemophiliacs.</P>
    <P>In order to set the record straight I call specifically on the Government to provide a means-tested scheme for all HIV-AIDS patients through the Departments of Health and Social Welfare to provide financial allowances for their special dietary needs, heating and electricity expenses, telephone bills and mobility payments.  Such a scheme should be provided not just for haemophiliacs but for all AIDS patients specifically to deal with their inability to meet the costs of their illness.</P>
    <P>I now call on the Government to act urgently to ensure that discrimination against and the stigmatising of HIV sufferers are redressed.  I am referring to legal measures to ensure equal access to employment, housing, public accommodation, the granting of credit and the delivery of services.  This is an important area where I believe there can be all party support so that in terms of public education, information and attitudes we can reverse the appalling stigmatisation of HIV.</P>
    <P>I publicly commend the work of the AIDS fund and I sincerely hope that National Irish AIDS Day on 20 May will be successful both in terms of fund raising and public awareness.  Specifically, I urge the Government to continue issuing lottery funding towards AIDS research and especially the area of paediatric AIDS, as Ireland has the highest number of babies per head of population with the HIV virus.</P>
    <P>I have never considered and do not consider the care of AIDS patients to depend on their source of infection, be it through blood transfusions, drug abuse or sexual activity.  Therefore, I call on the Minister for Health to ensure that hospital facilities and treatment are the same for all HIV-AIDS patients.  Similarly, the allowances I have referred to <Col N="509" /> should be based purely on financial need relating to a means test.  I deplore any questions being raised in this debate as to innocence or otherwise of AIDS patients, and all of those who are raising those questions do not come from the Opposition side of the House.  These issues of caring services, and hopefully future curing, are entirely separate from the issue of financial resources, a trust fund, compensation and responsibility.</P>
    <P>International Government response to this issue has varied from country to country and has been referred to throughout this debate.  I believe there is a close similarity between the situation in the Republic of Ireland and that in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland. I feel, therefore, that it is relevant to quote from the record of the debate in the British Parliament on 16 November 1987 and specifically the comments made by the Secretary of State for Health, Mr. Tony Newton MP:</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions I have commented on the difficulty of a compensations scheme.  This is not a compensation scheme.  That must be made clear.  It is a recognition of a special and unique combination of circumstances and I am glad to make that recognition.</P>
    <P>This points clearly to the &ldquo;without prejudice basis&rdquo; of Government action, and I see no reason we cannot follow suit.  I believe also that, within the Irish system, we have previously established State schemes whereby payments have been made on a compassionate basis to individuals. I am referring specifically to payments authorised by the present Taoiseach as Minister for Health further to a vaccination programme and the separate instance of the Stardust Tribunal. Both of these events occurred when Fianna Fáil were in office.</P>
    <P>In any context the amounts of money we are talking about are small in comparison to the potential legal costs arising out of High Court and Supreme court litigation.  We have only to look at the recent William Dunne case to see how costs can develop, over a very short <Col N="510" /> period, into figures that look like telephone numbers.  The figures mentioned in this debate pale into insignificance by comparison.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the fact that the campaign by the Irish Haemophilia Society has been continuing for a year. As time elapses this matter is becoming clearly more urgent.  It is vital, therefore, that the Minister should not only act with good grace in establishing a trust fund of substance but should do so immediately. The UK Government in their allocation of £10 million made it available at once, even though disbursement may necessarily take place over a longer period.  The Minister for Health should also ensure through the Council of Health Ministers at EC level that a comprehensive plan for the care of AIDS sufferers as well as research into prevention and cure is effected.  It is interesting to note further to a question in the European Parliament from Mr. Tom Raftery that the EC Commission favours &ldquo;a humanitarian approach&rdquo; towards these patients by national Governments and considers it desirable that compensation funds should be set in place for haemophiliacs.  I believe the EC Commission would be receptive to a political approach for a common Community policy on care and allowances for all Aids suffers.</P>
    <P>The practical problems of coping with haemophilia are often not readily understood. Not only do suffers have to curtail their activities due to their bleeding disorder but often they have severe arthritis at an early age.  This often results in having their income reduced due to disability and illness.  Prior to the outbreak of this HIV virus there were already insufficient benefits for them.  Now they find it impossible to secure mortgages and life assurance.  There is also the tragedy of the hereditary nature of haemophilia which has obvious consequences for their future family planning.  It is interesting to note that the 106 haemophiliacs who are HIV positive reside in 70 families.  From all of these factors it is quite clear that they are a singularly disadvantaged <Col N="511" /> group.  Once HIV virus has been diagnosed there are obvious practical limitations to a normal lifestyle such as coping mentally with a terminal illness and the question of sexual relations with a spouse.</P>
    <P>On the question of who should administer a trust fund, my personal preference is to involve the State as I believe it could exert pressure on external non-Exchequer organisations such as pharmaceutical companies more effectively than private individuals acting as trustees.  However, on this point I understand the Haemophiliac Society are prepared to meet the Government's point of view in establishing their own independent trust fund.  Similarily, they have requested annual funding from the Government and are prepared to be flexible on this point, with an insistence that this funding be maintained for a period of three to five years.  This flexibility should have been matched by Government willingness to respond generously and urgently.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are not interested in playing politics with this issue but we feel that political action has been necessary to get this issue so far to date.  Had the Government put forward what we considered to be the minimum to meet this disadvantaged group's needs we were prepared to avoid an unnecessary Dáil vote. Thus the fate of the Government is entirely in their own hands.</P>
    <P>Finally I call on the Government to follow a compassionate policy in this area and to follow the Governments of Denmark, West Germany, Spain, Britain and Norway.  Regardless of the outcome of the vote tonight, since the die does seem to be cast, I hope that the Minister, subsequent to this vote, will not be in any way churlish in his handling of the Haemophiliac Society and, even if he has not been prepared to meet Opposition demands, deal with them in a compassionate and sincere way.</P>

      <P>This issue is, and should be, above party politics.  It is shameful that the Minister for Health, particularly <Col N="512" /> by his comments today, has now politicised this issue.  The paltry sum of £250,000 now on offer on a take it or leave it basis is exactly the same sum of money as this Fianna Fáil Government gave last year to Dublin Zoo.  I ask where our priorities are.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that all Opposition parties have sought quietly and behind the scenes for a number of months to bring the Minister and Government around on this issue.  A number of weeks ago with other Opposition spokespersons and the former Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, I went on a deputation to the Minister for Health.  We tried on every possible occasion to have this matter sorted out quietly so that we would not have to take it to the floor of the Dáil. Opposition parties, in framing tonight's motion, worked together.  We were conscious that we were dealing with a very sensitive and difficult issue and nobody wanted to score political points.</P>
      <P>I regret very much that the Government, by their attitude to this issue, have sought to set AIDS victim against AIDS victim.  I now understand that even the offer being made at the eleventh hour by the Minister for Health has been rejected by the AIDS fund people who are not prepared to participate in the trust fund as announced by the Minister last night. Last week, in the face of another Government defeat, the Government Chief Whip sought to set an all party committee to deal with this issue.  We all know from our experience with the national lottery what the all party committee did when the Government were faced with defeat. The attitude of the Government has been to avoid political defeat at all costs, to avoid political embarrassment.  They have not taken this issue seriously.  They have not dealt with it as a medical and financial crisis but have tried to avoid political embarrassment at all costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>AIDS represents the single biggest medical threat which this country has had to face and, although the actual number of full-blown AIDS cases, at 90, is relatively small, the disease is now spreading with frightening rapidity.  Three years ago there were just nine AIDS cases in <Col N="513" /> Ireland and all of them had been contracted outside the country.  However, in the past 14 months the number of cases has trebled and one of our leading experts, Dr. Fiona Mulcahy, estimates that she is seeing up to five new cases each week.  Thirty-eight people in Ireland have died from AIDS, including four children and seven haemophiliacs.  It has also been confirmed that over 800 people are carrying the AIDS virus and this figure is doubling every nine months.</P>
    <P>These alarming statistics, however, do not show the true picture.  The national AIDS co-ordinator, Dr. James Walsh, a very courageous and forward-looking public servant, has said that not all AIDS deaths are being reported and he is now going to monitor all death certificates of people in the 20 to 40 age group who have unexplained deaths.  Given that it is estimated internationally that for every one case of AIDS there are between 30 and 50 people with the virus, there are up to 3,000 people with the AIDS virus who remain undiagnosed in this country.</P>
    <P>The latest figures available also suggest that at least 50 per cent and possibly as high as 80 per cent of HIV carriers will go on to develop full-blown AIDS.  With Scotland, we have the highest incidence of AIDS and the AIDS virus among babies found anywhere in the world.  At present we have 54 babies with antibodies to the virus and six of them have developed full-blown AIDS.  Other peculiarities of the disease which have shown up here in Ireland are that in one area, the Mid-Western Health Board area, one-third of those with the virus are women.</P>
    <P>The first geriatric case of AIDS has also turned up in Ireland. a man over the age of 70 who was admitted to a geriatric assessment unit of a Dublin hospital was diagnosed as having the disease.  It was apparently the first such case of AIDS reported to the World Health Organisation.</P>
    <P>One good sign, however, is that among those who develop full blown AIDS, life expectancy is longer in this country than anywhere else &mdash; a tribute perhaps to the standard of nursing care they receive.</P>
    <P>To date the Government's response to <Col N="514" /> this growing problem has been, to put it mildly, unco-ordinated and ineffectual. There is a real danger that this will continue to be the case until we have reached a crisis.</P>
    <P>Anyone who attempts to deal with the AIDS threat must face up to the reality that no cure will be found for the disease in the foreseeable future.  Our efforts must be based therefore on preventing the further spread of the disease by every means at out disposal and making sufficient financial resources available to ensure the highest possible standards of medical care are available for those suffering from the disease.</P>
    <P>It is an appalling reflection that almost half of the staff in the national sexually transmitted diseases centre at St. James's Hospital are paid out of voluntary funds. The voluntary groups who work under the auspices of the national AIDS fund deserve our praise for the courageous way they have filled the vacuum left by the inaction of the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong if tonight's debate did not allow us to focus our attention on the kind of public policy approach which is now urgently required if we are to contain and prevent the further spread of this disease.  There is no point in a public health policy of simply telling people not to engage in casual sex.  We have to face up to the realities of today's world, however unpalatable it may be to do so. The promotion of the use of condoms, if casual sex is to take place, must become a central plank of the public health policy advocated by the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>Given that 60 per cent of those carrying the AIDS virus in Ireland are now intravenous drug users, we must also develop a needle exchange programme for intravenous drug users.  Other countries have long recognised that the AIDS crisis is far more serious than any drug problem they may have and we need to do so too.  The national AIDS co-ordinator has courageously sought for this to be part of our public health policy.  It is a shame that he has not been able to convince the Minister to advocate this.  I understand he does not believe that these measures are necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> It us understandable that proposals like these will be highly unpopular but what we are dealing with here is a matter of life or death.  As an alternative to doing nothing, these measures are very definitely the lesser of two evils.  While every AIDS victim is a particularly tragic story, it is wrong for anyone to seek to talk of guilty and innocent victims.  Nobody sets out to develop AIDS.</P>
    <P>Unlike any other group of AIDS victims, however, the group of 106 haemophiliacs with the disease developed it from the State's health services.  To argue that the State has no legal responsibility to this particularly vulnerable group may or may not be technically correct but it is most definitely morally wrong.  To say that there are other innocent victims of AIDS is true.  It is also true that there are no grounds for finding one AIDS victim more morally guilty than any other.  The issue is not a question of moral guilt on the part of the victim but rather it is the moral responsibility of the State health service which unwittingly gave them the disease.  Already handicapped with one major illness, haemophiliacs suffering from the virus have had to endure the most traumatic experiences trying to cope with this killer disease.</P>
    <P>Deputies who have met the Irish Society for Haemophiliacs have been very impressed at the courageous manner in which they have sought to help the victims of this tragic killer disease.  They have touched everybody who has met them, listening to their heart-rendering stories.  It is a pity that we will tonight divide on this issue because we are going to ensure that for a very long time those 106 people, for as long as they may live, will have to continue to live in the most appalling circumstances.  Their heating, dietary and housing needs will not be looked after unless a special trust fund is established.  I would again call on the Minister for Health not to pursue in dividing this Dáil and not to use as an excuse the fact that other parties have not accepted his very mean offer indeed.  As I said earlier, if Dublin Zoo got £250,000 last year surely haemophiliacs suffering <Col N="516" /> from the AIDS virus deserve to be treated a lot better.  What are our priorities in this country?  Do people with this most dreadful disease come first or do they not?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue in the debate on this motion is the moral responsibility of the Government.  It is a responsibility which, as the Leader of the Government at the time these events occurred, I accept.  The Minister today is trying to slough off the responsibility of this Government as the successor in office of the Government I led and under whose authority the steps were taken at official level which inadvertently led to the infection of those concerned.  Throughout this debate and in all the discussions held previously the Minister has consistently evaded this question.  In his speech today he has once again, as a member of the Government, refused to address this issue.  He has spoken of the moral responsibility of the Minister for Health to provide the best possible health service for all sufferers and nobody is questioning that.  Nobody is raising the question of the role of the Minister as administrator of the health services.  The Minister said he cannot be more accountable for one person than for another and that it is his duty to treat each person on the same basis.  Is he talking as a doctor or as a health service administrator?  He is certainly not talking as a member of the Government.  The motion on this issue of the trust fund is addressed to the Government and not to the Minister who has refused to face the issue and accept his responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that the determination of liability is a legal issue, a matter for the legal process to adjudicate upon.  Is the issue one of determining liability?  Is it the case that the Minister is disputing liability and that on behalf of the Government he is saying there was no responsibility for what was done.  We are not talking about blame, nobody is adducing blame; we are talking about responsibility which is quite a different issue.  Is the Minister disputing liability? Is he going to drag this issue through <Col N="517" /> the courts so that these people, many of whom would be dead by the time the issue was settled, would have to face that ordeal without getting any compensation or any assistance with their problems while they are still alive?</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister must accept the liability.  That is not in dispute.  It is not a case for lawyers.  The money must not be spent on arguing through the courts, right up to the Supreme Court, for years to come as to the exact amounts of money.  We know the liability is there. Let the Government discharge that liability honourably as we would have done if I had still been in office.  When servants of the Government act in a manner which inadvertently and through no blame of theirs causes hurt or damage, each successive Government must take responsibility for the acts of those continuing officers under their control.</P>
    <P>I note that over one third of the Minister's speech is devoted to a totally disingenuous attempt to suggest that the Opposition and the various speakers have sought to discriminate between the innocent and the guilty, as he described them. No one in this debate has raised this issue except the Minister.  He is the only one who has attempted to make this distinction. The whole case rests on the discharge of the moral responsibility of the Government for actions taken inadvertently under their authority.  The Minister should ignore the advice of officials who in this matter must naturally have difficulty in accepting responsibility lest it imply blame though no blame is implied.  He should act as a politician, take his responsibilities as a Minister and not act as a bureaucrat.</P>
    <P>The Minister deserves the ignominy of defeat in this debate tonight for failing to act as a person with the political authority to take decisions rather than as somebody engaged in a bureaucratic exercise.  I would like to add that his threat to ignore the Dáil which, I understand, was stated in the newspapers in any event, if made, was an arrogant one and would demonstrae an unlovely characteristic of the party of which he is a member, the reappearance of which would do no good <Col N="518" /> to that party.  The Minister has done himself and his party no service by succumbing to the advice being pressed upon him to adopt this disingenuous and bureaucratic approach.  I appeal to him even at this late stage to even once face, listen to and answer the arguments being put.  In the private discussions we have had and in this debate he has refused to face the argument and he has never adverted to the question of responsibility. He has changed the subject time and again in a manner that is unworthy of him in matters of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no one in this House who does not have sympathy for those afflicted by AIDS no matter how it was contracted.  AIDS is the new scourge of society.  It is no respecter of persons no matter what their position in society may be.  It afflicts both male and female, old and young.  It has connotations, both social and medical, that touch a chord deep in every human being. It is a blood-borne infection.  The AIDS virus affects a person in such a way as to destroy his or her resistance to infection and leaves a person in such a condition <Col N="519" /> that a common cold can become a major life threatening catastrophe.</P>
      <P>That brings us basically to the problem before us here tonight, which can be settled to the satisfaction of those most in need.  The Labour Party motion basically wants the haemophiliacs who have contracted AIDS through no fault of their own to be compensated for their undoubted suffering in a way different from all other sections of the community but specifically from all those other people who did not contract AIDS from blood transfusions.  Deputy Howlin based his argument on three points, the first of which was the moral and legal responsibility of the Government, the second the special requirements of haemophiliacs, and the third that the Minister for Health should provide services or benefits which do not usually fall within the ambit of the health services.</P>
      <P>On the question of moral and legal responsibility, it must be said that the Minister and everybody practising medicine, be they a doctor, nurse or in the paramedical professions, have both a moral and legal responsibility to treat each and every member of the community in an even-handed manner and always with an eye to see that the patient gets the best possible treatment.  Over and above this, haemophiliacs because of the nature of their affliction have special requirements peculiar to the disease which at present, as we understand the state of the haematological arts are being relatively adequately dealt with.  There is no doubt that haemophiliacs who have contracted the AIDS virus through no fault of their own have had a second and most terrible affliction visited upon them.</P>
      <P>The argument being advanced by the Labour Party and the other Opposition parties is that because people contracted the AIDS virus through no fault of their own they should be treated differently, in other words, they want the Minister and the Department of Health to make moral judgments in regard to the contraction of the disease.</P>

      <P>I beg to differ on this one but this is the nub of the issue. Before we start to provide services we would have to decide whether a patient contracted AIDS in an innocent manner or not.  It would be very unfair to put this burden on anyone engaged in the provision of services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Howlin made the point that those who contracted AIDS as a result of using factor 8 products given to them to help alleviate their haemophilia are innocent sufferers.  I agree with and accept that point but then so is the child born of parents afflicted with AIDS.  Therefore, where do we begin and finish in the provision of services and in deciding who should get services? That is the nub of the dilemma facing the House tonight.  It is a dilemma that will have to be faced up to and a decision taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Disagreement arises when we come to decide on how we should deal with the problem.  I accept that there is no lack of goodwill towards AIDS sufferers but I maintain both as a Deputy and a practising GP that I cannot discriminate between patients on the basis of how they contracted this or any other disease.  All <Col N="521" /> AIDS victims no matter how they contracted the disease require special consideration but we cannot proceed on the basis of this motion.  To do so would be to create further strains and stresses in a society already overburdened with them. This would be to the detriment of all AIDS sufferers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin also made the point that the Minister for Health is under an obligation to provide other services and benefits which do not usually fall within the ambit of the health services.  I would have thought that if they were serious about this the motion would have been put down to the Minister for Finance as it is he who has the statutory responsibility for discharging financial services.</P>

      <P>That is not the way the Labour Party started out.  They gave an open-ended commitment.  The Minister has shown himself to be a caring <Col N="522" /> and concerned Minister.  He has made an offer of £250,000 to the AIDS trust. These are the best people to decide how money allocated for the treatment of AIDS should be spent.  We in this House can and should decide where money should be allocated but in the treatment of AIDS it would be far better to leave it to the professionals working on the ground to decide how the money should be dispensed.  I would hope at this late stage that the members of the Opposition would re-examine the wording and thrust of their motion.  The offer of an all-party committee was not a very bad one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words about the amendment to motion No. 45 on today's Order Paper proposed by my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon.  The amendment is being proposed to highlight the critical issues which arise for the House in considering the question of dealing with haemophiliacs who have contracted AIDS or HIV on a special and distinct basis.  At the outset I would like to put on the record my own personal sympathy for those haemophiliacs who have contracted the virus together with all AIDS sufferers and to reiterate once again the sympathy of the Government for all such persons.  It is within this context of the very spread of AIDS and HIV among the population, however, that the issue of making arrangements specific to one particular group within the so-called AIDS population must be considered and, in particular, the implications for individual members of society and for the State, its agencies and others who were &mdash; and still are &mdash; involved in the treatment and care of haemophiliacs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has dealt at some length <Col N="523" /> with the implications inherent in singling out one group of AIDS sufferers for particular treatment on the basis of the possible source of their infection.  This would go against the thrust of the Government's AIDS strategy which is designed to cater for all AIDS sufferers on a uniform and equitable basis.  AIDS is an extremely sensitive condition and it is crucial, therefore, to adopt an approach which will encourage persons to participate fully in the prevention and control of the disease and will not result in discrimination and stigmatisation.</P>
    <P>Regrettably there is evidence, as the Minister said, of unease among the population in relation to AIDS sufferers. There have been problems in the work-place, for example, and it is incumbent on the Government to lead by example and to facilitate a reasoned and unemotive climate which will be beneficial to society and its individual members.</P>
    <P>As part of his statutory duty of care to all persons who require health services, the Minister for Health has in place a range of health services for persons suffering from AIDS or HIV.  These are monitored and reviewed regularly and, to ensure that there are no difficulties in relation to accessibility to health services for the persons concerned, the Minister established a review group, under my chairmanship on the subject.  The members of the group are Professor Irene Hillary, Margaret King, who represents the Irish Haemophilia Society, Dr. Jimmy Walsh, Mr. Michael Lyons, Department of Health, Mr. Hickey, the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board, Mr. John Hurley and Dr. John O'Connor.  Our first meeting was on 9 March, and we met on 15 March, 6 April and 13 April and we are now finalising our report.  We met all the groups concerned &mdash; as far as we are aware &mdash; in this issue.  I will be submitting the report of this group to the Minister very shortly and it will present a concise overview of the health services as they relate to AIDS patients which, apart from a number of matters, is quite satisfactory. I approached my task with an <Col N="524" /> open mind and we are looking at the situation, not just from a health point of view, but at the impact of the disease in relation to social welfare, environment as far as housing is concerned and other matters.  Indeed, it would have been appropriate if the Opposition parties had given us an opportunity of presenting this report to the Minister and the Government for consideration.  The motion is politically motivated.</P>
    <P>There is always room for improvement and the particular needs of AIDS sufferers are also being met by the Minister through special funding from the national lottery, the details of which were set out earlier by the Minister.  In this context, the Minister has responded to the requests made by St. James's Hospital and by the Irish Haemophilia Society during their submissions to the review group by approving the recruitment of a dietician and a nurse for the haemophilia unit at St. James's Hospital in advance of the receipt of the report of the review group.  Those issues were highlighted in the submission from St. James's Hospital and have been brought to the immediate attention of the Minister who has rightly approved the additional funding for staff.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, has offered £250,000 to the AIDS fund to supplement those raised from industry, banking and insurance companies and which are used to relieve stress and suffering in persons who have contracted AIDS.  The fund will consider the offer at a board meeting soon.  I want to deny the statement made by Deputy Harney that the board have rejected the Minister's offer.  They could not have done so as they have not yet met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister only made the offer an hour ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The board will meet to consider the offer.  I have great confidence in the ability of the group to administer this fund and I hope that the Opposition parties will support them in relation to its distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some weeks ago the Minister made <Col N="525" /> a special grant of £50,000 to the Irish Haemophilia Society to assist in providing counselling services which I am aware are of special concern to the society.  In these circumstances, the Minister has clearly indicated his great and personal concern in relation to this matter.  The motion before the House is divisive and at this stage it would be a responsible approach by Opposition parties to withdraw it and to approve the amendment put forward by the Minister. We should all be mature in relation to this problem instead of trying to score points in the House.  This situation is deeply serious and requires the support of all Members and parties in assisting AIDS sufferers.</P>
    <P>It is our greatest single health problem at present and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future because there is no light at the end of the tunnel as far as a cure is concerned.  Research is being carried out throughout the world but there is no breakthrough in sight.  In the circumstances, I sincerely feel that this debate is not constructive as far as the well being of AIDS sufferers is concerned. The Opposition parties should reconsider the situation in the light of the Minister's concern, his support for the Irish Haemophilia Society, his announcement of the allocation of £250,000 to the AIDS Fund and the report which will be coming to the Minister and the Government very shortly from the committee which I chair.</P>
    <P>I am anxious, as chairman of the committee, to ensure that the recommendations which we will make will be carried out.  Indeed, some have already been carried out in St. James's Hospital.</P>

      <P>Deputy Yates referred to discriminatory measures which denied jobs to AIDS sufferers.  However, everything he said in support of a special deal for haemophiliacs suffering from AIDS is divisive.  I should also like to refer to Deputy FitzGerald's remarks.  He was <Col N="526" /> Taoiseach when this problem arose and, as far as I am aware, he did not indicate any great public concern at that stage. The Minister at the time, Deputy Desmond, did not set up a fund.  However, that is history.  We are now in Government and it is our responsibility to support AIDS sufferers and to have particular concern for those who are also haemophiliacs.</P>
      <P>I appeal to all parties to support us in this field and I assure the House that we will continue our work after the vote, irrespective of the outcome.  We have work to do for AIDS sufferers and it will be carried out.  I wish to compliment the Minister for Health who has been fair and caring in his attitude.  It is because of his deep concern about this problem that he is not prepared to yield to the proposals made.  The usual simple remedy has been put forward, that we should throw money at it in the hope that it will be solved.  We are more concerned about the longer term strategy.  I can assure the House that the Minister is deeply concerned about this problem.  I reject the innuendo that he is not concerned. As a medical practitioner he is aware of the problems involved.  The Labour Party are using this motion for political reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The truest words spoken tonight were those uttered by Deputy Yates who said that the die was cast and that this was simply a numbers game. That is a distressing fact.  This issue should never have come to a vote in the <Col N="527" /> House.  Rather than scoring points and arguing as to each other's bona fides in this matter, we should address the serious issue involved.  There is no question that any one side of the House possesses an absolute monopoly of wisdom.  Wisdom is what is needed in regard to this issue. I should like to quote from an article on this issue that has touched me greatly. The article was published in the <i>Irish Medical News</i> dated 30 January last and was written by David Nowlan.  The heading of the article was &ldquo;Haemophilia and AIDS&rdquo;.  I should like to draw the attention of Members to the final paragraph which states:</P>
      <P>It requires a greater omniscience than the average human community can provide to make distinctions of any kind between allegedly innocent and allegedly guilty victims of the kind of society we live in.  It is neither humanly nor humanely possible to draw distinctions between those victims who call for succour.  Does someone grappling with heroin addiction need less help than someone coping with haemophilia? Is not the burden of AIDS devastating to both of them?  They all need everybody's help.</P>
      <P>No truer words than those have been spoken or written, They all need everybody's help.</P>
      <P>I agree also with the comments made by Deputy Barry Desmond, as reported in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 13 February last.  In the course of an article, written by Gerald Barry, Deputy Desmond suggested that the issue was basically a public health one and the solution lay in specialised services for haemophilia sufferers from AIDS.  He said they should be brought within the categories covered by the long-term illness scheme.  According to the article the former Minister went on to say that the principle of trust funds for specific categories of sufferers could turn into a &ldquo;nightmare&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not meant to be a lecture.  I am stating facts, as reported in <i>The Sunday Tribune.</i>  That remark has not been withdrawn by Deputy Desmond. I do not wish to suggest that the mover of the motion is intentionally engaging in an excercise which is cynical. I do not believe that is the case and if I did believe it I would say so.  However, the approach being adopted is wrong. While the mover of the motion may not accept that, others on the benches opposite &mdash; I specifically cite Deputy Desmond in regard to this &mdash; whose knowledge is based on experience know that the proposals before us are wrong. They are not intended to do any harm but the reality of them is that they draw a distinction between &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; and &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; victims of this pandemic.</P>
      <P>Dr. Nowlan, in the course of the article I quoted, referred to the horrific human tragedy.  He referred to families with infected members being shunned in their neighbourhoods.  He said that people have been dismissed from work or not offered jobs at all when either their anti-body status or the fact that they are haemophiliacs have become known.  He stated that affected patients have been stigmatised in hospitals and some have had to deny their haemophilia publicly and forced to lead a kind of double life to avoid being singled out.  Doctor Nowlan painted a very chilling picture.  He would seem to argue the case in favour of the Labour Party motion but he went on to make the point that the type of action proposed here would inevitably make distinctions between people who contact AIDS in one way and people who contract it in another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The precise problem, and the probable unintentional aim of the motion, is that the motion draws distinctions between the origin of the malady.  The motion is wrong not because the movers want to do something which is not laudable but because it is going the wrong way about achieving their aims.  The Minister for Health said last night that much was being said and much was being written about the moral responsibilities of the <Col N="529" /> Minister and the moral responsibilities of the State.  He said that this issue of moral responsibility was a complex and relatively simple thing.  The role of the Minister, and the State, is to provide the best possible health services for all sufferers regardless of their ailments or how those ailments were acquired.  That is the indisputable fact.  The Minister said that the State cannot, and the Minister must not, be placed in a position where he, and the State, become more accountable for one sufferer as against another sufferer. David Nowlan asks in the article I quoted what of the innocence or guilt of the child of an infected mother; what of the innocence or guilt of the wife of an errant husband.</P>
    <P>The issues raised here cannot be resolved by parliamentary debate and that is what is wrong with what is going on here tonight.  Rather than dividing and scoring ill points against each other we should be combining to seek a solution to this horrific problem.  It will not be resolved tonight and it certainly will not be resolved by the kind of arguments we hear across the floor from people like Deputy Harney.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Howlin for giving me an opportunity to say a few words on this issue.  I welcome the conversion of the Fianna Fáil Party, and the Fianna Fáil Government, to the concept of no fault, to the concept of the absence of guilt in various situations.  I can recall the arguments put forward by the Fianna Fáil Party against the concept of no fault divorce where it was felt that that would be a fundamental move away from the question of justice.  I argue strongly that the motion is not a question of who is to blame in terms of the sufferers, but who is to blame for the injections which the <Col N="530" /> haemophilia sufferers got.  There is a clear analogy between the position of the haemophiliacs and those children who suffered side effects as a result of receiving three-in-one injections.  Those children suffered very serious physical and mental handicaps as a result.  In their case the State acknowledged and accepted its responsibility and provided a special fund for the victims.  That is what we are about here.</P>
      <P>This is not a question of whether AIDS sufferers, or particular categories of sufferers, are guilty or innocent in terms of the disease they have but who was responsible in the first place for them being in that position.  In the case of haemophiliacs the State is indirectly, though perhaps innocently, responsible.  It is on that basis that we are arguing in favour of the motion which represents a compromise. The four parties on the Opposition benches have compromised on a variety of points in order to achieve an acceptable motion.  Indeed, the fact that the Minister sought to compromise yet again on that motion is indirectly an acknowledgement of the case being made by the Opposition.  The fact that he was not able to reach an agreement with the Opposition is another matter, but even the terms of his amendment acknowledge the case which the Opposition are making in relation to haemophilia sufferers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that it is extremely difficult to reach a wise decision on this has been referred to by a number of Fianna Fáil Members.  We have been told that a former Minister for Health found it difficult to come to a conclusion on this. That is no fault of that person but it is an indication that a difficult decision has to be made.  The majority in the House, represented by the Opposition parties, have come to the conclusion that this is the best way forward in these circumstances. If the Minister had come into the House tonight with a package which would deal comprehensively and effectively with the problems of all AIDS sufferers there would be no question of this motion being pressed to a vote, but the Minister has not done that.  All he has done is come in here and promise that a <Col N="531" /> report will be available to the Government next week and, presumably, a decision will be made at some stage. Indeed, if this motion has no other effect than to force an early decision in relation to that report, we will have done a job fairly well.</P>
    <P>I would argue that the Government have up to now failed completely to acknowledge the reality of the major problem which faces this society, as indeed it faces virtually the whole of the world in terms of how AIDS is developing. They have failed to acknowledge the reality of this problem because until now they have failed to put in place any attempt whatsoever to deal with the problems of AIDS sufferers.  To come in here and argue, having failed to reach a compromise with the Opposition, that we are trying to allocate blame or guilt to one sector or another is utter nonsense. To quote statements from various doctors on the basis that there is a very human problem is all well and fine but the reality is that if the Minister's amendment is carried tonight the vast bulk of AIDS sufferers will still not be dealt with by this Government.  The Government's amendment refers to discrimination in this motion.  The reality is that our health services are full of discrimination between public and private health provisions and the Government are failing completely to deal with this problem.</P>

    <P>What divides us now?  Why are we going to have a division?  Why are Deputies going to troop through separate lobbies in ten minutes time?

The Minister said tonight that the fund could apply again next year for further funding from the national lottery or his Department.  So what divides us?  It is a unwillingness by the Minister to give either long-term commitment or alternatively an adequate initial grant to enable this group of people to face a horrific tragedy with some semblance of personal dignity.  Why has the Minister chosen to call a division on this issue when agreement was at hand and within this grasp?</P>
    <P>The amendment the Minister has put forward has been rejected by all the Opposition parties in this House and by each of the Independents.  Are we all out of step and out of touch?  One of the Fianna Fáil backbenchers said that no one party in this House is the repository of all wisdom.  On that basis the motion put on the Order Paper in the names of the Labour Party Deputies was agreed with the other Opposition parties.  It is the consensus view of the majority in this House and it was agreed by the Irish Haemophilia Society who represent those who are the focus of our concern here tonight.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech quoted various people and he brought in an odious concept of innocence and guilt.  Nobody from the Opposition benches mentioned innocence or guilt.  There are no innocent or guilty victims as such &mdash; all who suffer from this horrendous disease are innocent. The Minister said it is important that sufferers are not made to feel as if they were outcasts in our society.  That phrase would stand up to better scrutiny if the situation in St. James's Hospital, as outlined by another Deputy last night, was not as it is.  The Minister tonight announced a grant for an extra dietician and nurse for the haemophilia unit of the hospital.  The Minister is aware that in the unit which treats AIDS victims there is one consultant, one junior hospital doctor, one nurse, one counsellor and one social worker paid by the State. There are other ancillary staff who are funded by private sources.  Our treatment of all AIDS sufferers is inadequate.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that there is an <Col N="533" /> intention to serve legal proceedings against the State by the Irish Haemophilia Society.  It is important to state that no such intention exists.  Individuals have indicated their intention to take legal proceedings, but not the society. The Minister has stated that in the United Kingdom £10 million sterling, roughly IR£12 million, was made available by way of a fund but that only £700,000 has been drawn to date.  There is a reason for this, and the Minister knows it.  The reason is that it took a long time to identify those in the United Kingdom who are haemophiliac and who have contracted the HIV virus.  No such difficulty will exist in this country &mdash; they are already identified &mdash; and the society are willing to give them relief, sustenance and help immediately the Minister provides the resources to do just that.</P>
    <P>In response to my quoting the international precedents the Minister said he is keeping in close touch with EC member states.  Why must we always be the last? Why must we be dragged screaming to do what is morally right instead of leading the van?  An offer was made by the Minister last night to fund £250,000 through the AIDS fund and the Minister for State tonight said that they were considering this.  The offer was freshly made this evening to them and obviously the board have not had time to consider this offer but I understand that the people who met the secretary of the Department are disconcerted, to put it mildly, to be put in this position because the offer made in good faith yesterday was to be, to use their phrase, a conduit whereby funds could be transferred to haemophiliacs. They are disconcerted to find themselves put in an invidious situation whereby they are expected to arbitrate between the conflicting demands of various AIDS sufferers. The reasonable compromise the Minister wants us to accept tonight is £250,000, assuming it does go to the haemophiliacs who are infected in this way. On a once-off basis £250,000, or roughly £2,500 for each individual will be made available to the sufferers, which I suggest <Col N="534" /> is enough to pay their funeral expenses but little else.</P>
    <P>This debate has focused well beyond the limits of haemophiliacs who are HIV positive or who have contracted full blown AIDS, and I welcome that.  This Dáil and nation have now accepted that the Government have a responsibility to haemophiliacs who have become infected with the HIV virus and have suffered doubly from the two crippling diseases of haemophilia and either AIDS or HIV infection.  We have discussed at length during the past two nights the inadequacies of the measures taken to tackle the problem of AIDS which affects this country and all countries in the world. Those methods we have put in place to fight this scourge are inadequate and this debate is important in highlighting that fact.  There is no national strategy, or at least none that I have found, disclosed yet.  I welcome the discussion on that aspect of it and may be we can have a comprehensive answer to all those who are suffering from AIDS and that we can have a campaign that will stop the exponential growth in AIDS victims in this country.  But the issue that we focus in on now at 8.30 p.m. is clear.</P>
    <P>The former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, has put the matter succinctly to the Minister, to this Government and to all the Fianna Fáil Deputies behind him.  The Government of the day, not any individual Minister, not any individual bureaucrat in any Department have an inescapable responsibility to haemophiliacs who were infected by human immuno deficiency virus through their contact with the health services.  That is an inescapable fact and I appeal to the Minister and to the Government assembled here to recognise that fact now.  In no political sense of victory and in no point scoring way I humbly beg the Government to reconsider, to withdraw the amendment, not to put it to a vote and allow this House to act in a moral consensus to treat people who have been so cruelly treated and so cruelly infected.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 8, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>8.&mdash;(1)  The expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Act shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>(2)  Expenses under this Act of a local authority who are the council of a county shall be charged on the county (exclusive of every borough and urban district therein).&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only new provision proposed in this amendment is under subsection (2), and this makes it clear that the expenses of a county council in administering the Bill are to be charged on the county area nett of any borough or urban district.  Borough corporations and urban district councils are together with county councils for the purpose of the Bill.  These urban authorities will be carrying their own administrative expenses under the Bill and it <Col N="541" /> would not be appropriate for the county council to demand any contribution from them to the costs of county council administration in this instance.</P>
    <P>The need for this provision arises from section 10 (1) of the Local Government Act, 1946, and that Act requires:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Expenses of the council of a county shall, save where it is otherwise provided by law, be charged equally and over the whole of the county&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is not appropriate that expenses of a county council under this Bill should be charged on this county at large basis, so the amendment is necessary to make this explicit.</P>

      <P>In page 8, subsection (1) (b), lines 14 and 15, to delete &ldquo;where these can be ascertained by reasonable inquiry,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I suggest the words: &ldquo;where these can be ascertained by reasonable inquiry,&rdquo; be deleted.  It seems to me that they proffer the local authority a nebulous interpretation which would allow for easy escape.  I think it is implicit that the local authority follow through on the section and that they make reasonable inquiry. If you spell it out in the manner presented in the Bill, what will happen is that people will make cursory inquiries and their interpretation of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; could be quite subjective.  The whole purpose of the Bill is to curb dereliction and to try to tackle it seriously.  To openly invite people to suggest that they have made &ldquo;reasonable inquiry&rdquo; is in my view tempting fate a little.  I suggest that there is no need for the words and I propose that they be deleted.</P>

      <P>This amendment would impose a very exact requirement on local authorities in every possible case to ascertain the owner and occupier of a derelict site and not just as the section has it where these can be ascertained by reasonable inquiries.  It is common knowledge that intractable problems of dereliction and underdevelopment of land can arise from land title problems.  To charge local authorities in every case with getting to the bottom of those problems would be required virtually the impossible. I consider the qualifications about reasonable inquiry to be necessary and I urge those in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> In page 8, subsection (2), line 33, after &ldquo;representations&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and a file containing all representations received by the local authority following the giving of a notice under this section shall be retained by such local authority and shall be kept at the offices of the local authority and shall be available for inspection at the offices of the local authority during office hours&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes the addition of some words to section 9 (2).  I think it will be necessary to read that and see how the amendment reads in.  Section 9 (2) as contained in the Bill provides that: &ldquo;Before making any entry on the register in relation to any land, the local authority shall give to any owner and occupier, where they can be ascertained by reasonable enquiry, notice of their intention to make such entry and shall consider any representations any owner or occupier may make in writing within such a period as may be specified in the notice and may either make the entry or not as they think proper having regard to such representations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, where the local authority envisage entering land on the register as being derelict, they can afford the owner of the land an opportunity to make a representation.  Presumably on the basis of that representation the local authority will go ahead and proceed to enter land as a derelict site or they will not do so.  If they enter the land as a derelict site under section 9 (1) the various particulars of what is being entered must feature on the register and these are listed in section 9 (1) (a) to (f).  If they do not enter the land, having made an inquiry, presumably they will not have entered it as a derelict site due to the content of the representation received.  There may be within a neighbourhood or area a considerable degree of concern about a piece of land and my contention is that the general public who are affected by the condition of land or a building in an area are entitled to know why a local authority refuse to enter it on a register or, having thought about <Col N="544" /> entering it, decline to do so having received representations from the owner of the land.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 adds the following words to subsection (2): &ldquo;and a file containing all representations received by the local authority following the giving of a notice under this section shall be retained by such local authority and shall be kept at the offices of the local authority and shall be available for inspection at the offices of the local authority during office hours.&rdquo;  That would mean the general public would have access to representations made by the land owner in circumstances where the land owner does not succeed in having the land entered on the register and, more important, where the land owner succeeds.  For example, the land owner may, in response to a local authority's approach, make promises by way of representations that particular works will be carried out in a period of time, or where there is a view that the property could in the future pose a danger to people, the landowner promises to take action.  There should be a degree of public accountability in those representations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem.  If those representations are secret representations made to a local authority and undivulged to the general public, on occasions it may lead to suspicions which could put local authority officials in an unfortunate position.  It could lead to suspicions that representations were made, for example, that had no substance but due, it could be alleged, to the relationship between the land owner and a local authority official, his land was not entered on the register.  It would be most unfortunate that officials in a local authority who, I have no doubt, would approach this from an independent perspective should even be open to a charge of that nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment would ensure that the nature of what is said by the landowner is made available to the general public, that there would be clear accountability <Col N="545" /> on the part of the landowner to the people in the neighbourhood in the context of what is said in the representations and, if the representations have to be made available in a file, it would be open to other people who know better to come back at a later stage to the local authority and point out if representations are untruthful or inaccurate and the manner in which the local authority were misled. I hope the Minister will see this proposed amendment as a constructive contribution to ensure that the owner of a derelict site or a building in disrepair who makes representations not to be entered on the land register is aware that those representations are made by way of a public document and what he says to the local authority can be read by other people and in a sense he can be held accountable for those representations.</P>
    <P>I hope this amendment is seen in a constructive light.  In a sense, particularly in the context of decisions where the local authority do not enter a piece of land on the register, the general public have an entitlement to know the nature of the representations made that led to a local authority ultimately deciding not to enter a piece of land on the register.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment. It is a good and useful suggestion very much in keeping with the openness with which the planning laws, for example, are operated by the local authorities at present whereby a member of the public or anyone concerned can go in and look for the file and have access to all representations.  There is no good reason why these kind of representations are not kept on file.  I presume in time they will be submitted to computer record and be easily and readily available. For all the reasons that have been advanced the Minister should accede to the amendment.</P>

      <P>Let me say a brief word in support.  I suggest that the Minister should consider the way in which An Bord Pleanála handle third party objections and exchanges between different <Col N="546" /> parties.  It is a constraint upon all participants in that process to be factual and accurate and not to blame other people for things that may not necessarily be the case.  We have to assume this register and file will be open to the public.  This amendment would inhibit landowners from pleading special circumstances if they felt the circumstances which they cited would be open to scrutiny by their neighbours and everybody else.  It has that potential virtue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it has some merit.  I gave considerable thought to this amendment and I recognise it is a serious one. We must try to be as open as we can in dealing with matters like this and I want to go down that road.  If I could I would like to put the alternative view to see if there is a basis of merit in it worth pursuing and it might be possible then to come to a conclusion.</P>
      <P>As I see it, the effect of the amendment would be to open up to the public all representations made by landowners against the entering of their lands on the derelict sites register.  I acknowledge that there is an increasing and well-founded demand for a greater degree of open Government as far as environmental issues are concerned.  A draft EC directive on access to environmental information has been under consideration for some time.  It will be coming before the Environmental Council before too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it likely to get support?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is.  While we have not yet thought it through because we have not seen the full documentation, I might support that view.  I tend towards that view if it is even-handed.  By way of general response to the trend, we are gradually increasing the range of environmental information available to the public through more frequent and accessible publications of data and otherwise. That is a good thing.  Our planning system, embodying as it does a third party right of appeal, is already an extremely open one by comparison with the kind of planning appeal arrangements which <Col N="547" /> exist in other countries.  We are well advanced and are often referred to in that context in other jurisdictions.  We have a good system in place where there is amazingly free access to information and documentation in regard to planning.</P>
      <P>The administration of derelict sites control is not entirely on a par with planning. The owner of a derelict site, unlike a planning applicant, is not seeking to change the character of his land by an overt development initiative.  Instead, he is falling down on his duty to maintain and care for his property.  There is a distinct difference between the two.  The position of the local authority is not an entirely open one.  Representations under section 9 (2) will only arise where the local authority have taken the <i>prima facie</i> view that the land should be registered on the derelict sites register.  The amendment implies that the policing of derelict sites control should in some formal way involve the public at large and not just the local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some misgiving about the idea, principally because it could be seen in certain circumstances as oppressive in relation to an individual landowner.  While for the generality of landowners it might be suitable, it may impinge on the rights of an individual in certain circumstances.  It must be said that the public enjoy common law rights in relation to nuisance quite independently of this Bill.  This Bill installs local authorities in a special way as guardians and protectors of the public interest in relation to derelict sites.  A landowner will be in a position to make representations under section 9 (2) only where the local authority acting in the public interest have <i>prima facie</i> taken the view that his land should be classified as derelict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not seem that, in giving landowners the right to make representations against this assessment by the local authority, we should build in a mechanism which would open up the whole question <Col N="548" /> to universal debate.  The local authority say something is derelict.  The owner is entitled to make representations and to have that set down.  Of course a local authority in regard to a planning application have an open mind on everything until they receive the documentation on the proposed development.  It is the reverse in these circumstances as far as the landowner is concerned.  The <i>prima facie</i> case is already in place as soon as they put him on the register, so he is entitled to make representations.  Is he entitled in those circumstances to some rights that would not necessarily involve the public in policing the local authority on what they wish to do?  In that narrow set of circumstances I have a little difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it is the wish of the House to dispose of Committee Stage tonight.  The analogy with the planning proposal which will create some kind of development, the impact of which might be negative or positive, is not necessarily valid.  If you live in a terrace of houses next door to a house that is deemed to be derelict and the state of that building is causing physical interaction with your own building, or if you are living beside a derelict site infested with rats, there is a real deterioration in the enjoyment of your own property.  I support Deputy Shatter's amendment wholeheartedly.  If in the representations by the owner of the site deemed to be derelict by the local authority in the first instance, the landowner in defence of the state of dereliction asserts or claims that part of the reason for the state of the building is nonco-operation by other parties, perhaps including the neighbours, at least the neighbour has the right by law to refute or to gain access.  That is the spirit of the amendment.  Dereliction, which is passive from the point of view of the planning process, can be disastrous from the point of view of an adjoining property owner or neighbour.  They have no redress in the law.  To suggest that they have redress in common law is to be factual but not realistic.  The cost of taking somebody to <Col N="549" /> court to seek redress in that respect is very expensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate very much that the Minister is trying to tease this out in a constructive way.  This amendment is motivated by an overall view, which I think the Minister and other Members share, that the public have a right to information about environmental matters which impinge on their day-to-day life, their well-being, their health or the enjoyment they can have within their own neighbourhood.  Under this legislation local authorities will be required to do their survey and put together a register.  It is inevitable that in the context of that exercise local authorities throughout the country, but particularly in urban areas where there are major problems relating to derelict sites, will receive representations from people in a neighbourhood who feel that due to the existence of a derelict site their enjoyment of their neighbourhood is being diminished.</P>
      <P>This Bill in practical terms will not operate purely on the basis of initiatives taken by local authorities.  Local authorities will be stimulated regularly into taking initiatives.  They will respond to representations they receive from people who feel their life is detrimentally affected by a derelict site in their area. There is an inevitability about that.  In the larger local authorities where resources are scarce and officials feel over-worked, very often the general public will act as a catalyst.  The Bill may act as the catalyst for the putting together of the initial register but, as the years go by, additions to the register will be made largely as a result of contact by the general public with local authority officials or members.  Individual councillors or corporation members may raise the issue of having a particular piece of land entered on the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authority will then make a decision that <i>prima facie</i> it appears this land should be registered and notifies the land owner.  If it then makes the decision that the land should be registered, there <Col N="550" /> is a variety of information made available. It is my contention that where it makes the decision, having decided <i>prima facie</i>, it should communicate with the owner.  If the owner then communicates with the local authority and his communication is effective in changing the decision of the local authority so that the land is not entered on the register, provided that land owner is being truthful he is in no way prejudiced by his representation being available for examination by the general public.  He is only prejudiced if his representation is misleading, and in those circumstances those people who are affected by the state of his land are entitled to know what he said and, by the nature of things, will have an opportunity to correct the record by going back to the local authority.  The fact that the local authority might have refrained from proceeding on one occasion does not mean it cannot reconsider the matter at a later stage.  I see nothing invidious, in the context of the land owner, in having that representation made public.  I can see only that this would be a means of ensuring that the maximum information is made available in the spirit of the approach being taken within the European Community, maximising information with which I am familiar and, within the spirit to which my party and other parties are committed in this House, that is the general idea of freedom of information, be it from governments or from local authorities.  I see this not as impingeing on the rights of the land owners but as respecting the rights of the individual citizen to know why his local authority have made a particular decision.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.  It is an amendment that we take seriously in our party.  I would not wish to divide the House unnecessarily this evening; we have dealt with this Bill in a most constructive spirit.  I suspect from the Minister's response that he was simply trying to tease out the implications on both sides.  It would be my final contention that this Bill is designed to protect the general public against the impact of dereliction on their lives.  The public are <Col N="551" /> entitled to know what intervention from a land owner results in a local authority not taking any action.  It would seem to me that the balance of advantage is to have as much information as possible made available.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment in the constructive spirit in which it was proposed and in the context of the overall approach adopted on all sides of this House, which is to provide a workable piece of legislation on which there is a degree of public accountability on the part of the local authority that ultimately makes the decisions.</P>
    <P>The final obvious point is that if one finds one's land entered on the register, one will be subject to a levy.  This is something we might come back to when dealing with the section as a whole.  It is not clear under section 2 how the local authority is to deal with the representations. For example if the representation were that the person agreed his land was in an appalling condition but could not afford to pay the levy and pleaded with the local authority not to impose one and not to put the land on the register, would that sort of representation change the mind of the local authority?  I do not think it is intended that it would.  All I am saying is that by ensuring these representations can be made available it will also ensure that the local authorities are careful in how they assess the veracity and credibility of the representations made to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has expressed his concern that a developer whose land should, in the view of the local authority, be entered on the register, should be entitled to be heard privately in his or her defence.  It is right that the owner should have the opportunity to make every representation to influence the ultimate decision, but if there is to be public confidence in this type of proposal, there must be access to those representations on the part of people so that they can know why a decision is not taken.  There would be the gravest suspicion and lack of confidence in the whole <Col N="552" /> process if that type of access did not exist. That is the primary reason we have such wide scope of access to information under the planning laws.  We are dealing with a social and communal problem so it is essential that all interests are heard and considered.  In the lofty hall of the City Chambers in Dublin there is a logo in stone under the statue of Mr. Drummond which proclaims that property has its duties as well as its privileges.  That sums up the situation here very well.  This legislation recognises that principle.  Granting the right to anyone with a valid interest to inspect the register and any representations that might affect the content of the register in no way impinges on the rights of the individual but recognises the duties attaching to property, particularly that which could be considered derelict.</P>
      <P>The essence of this legislation is to deal with a major blight that affects all of us in a visual or more direct way as articulated by Deputy Quinn.  We are recognising that property does impact on the lives of people who live in the community where it is located.  It would be nonsensical to, on the one hand, recognise the whole community dimension of property and, on the other hand, to seek to curtail the rights of people in relation to it.</P>
      <P>There is one final point in regard to this.  For example, in the city of Dublin the local authority itself is the proprietor of many a derelict site.  I would be worried as to whether that same local authority which is the authority to compile the register and make the ultimate decisions will include its own property on the register. The Minister will have to bear that in mind.  We are dealing with good legislation and it is important to maintain public confidence in it.  It is inevitable that if a decision that is not welcome in a locality is taken scorn will be poured over the whole scheme if there is no access to the documentation on which the decision is based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accede to the amendment.  I do not believe it will in any way impinge on the rights and privileges of land owners to make their case <Col N="553" /> but will recognise a very important social dimension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I took it as being in that fashion.  Let me put a few questions that I think are worth reflecting upon.  Should one's neighbours be involved in whether one is levied or taxed in certain circumstances? It is a question that has to be very carefully thought about.  If I do exactly as has been suggested in Deputy Shatter's amendment I am involving the neighbours in the question of whether a levy is placed on their neighbour or not. That is an important question to be answered.  It should also be remembered that local authorities, under their existing administrative arrangements, have the powers to communicate to the neighbours any item for clarification, if they deem it necessary, in the representations sought or the representations made.  The local authorities are not, in effect, stymied under the administrative arrangements which already exist from communicating certain matters and getting further responses and documentation they deem necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is involved as a principle in the legislation is that the local authorities should police this area.  I do not think we ever contemplated that we were going to involve the neighbours in the policing of it.  The seeking of information is one thing and having information made available is another but an actual policing of what subsequently might or might not appear <Col N="554" /> on the register should not be part of the brief of the neighbours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that the neighbours are directly involved as a consequence of the dereliction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  They can be involved but I am saying they will not be disadvantaged by what we are doing.  If the landowner wishes to plead personal reasons &mdash; he might very well have to do so in certain circumstances &mdash; reasons which might be of a personal nature, a title nature or a financial nature, he is entitled to make that case.  If we take the single case of a financial nature where the person makes the case in a private and confidential way, in ordinary justice and fair play if he pleads his inability to pay could he not be assured that that would not be promulgated abroad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that inability to pay would be grounds for&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I am not saying it would be a reason why he should not appear on the register.  He might wish to make the case in a personal and confidential way but not necessarily to stop the local authority from putting him on the register.  He will be put on the register whether or not his property is derelict or he is in financial difficulties.  He may wish to make personal statements in his representations that he does not wish to be promulgated abroad and in fairness and common justice he should be entitled to that much confidentiality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similar arrangements apply under the Air Pollution Act and they do not cause difficulty.  Perhaps we are going further down the road in so far as everybody looks into everybody else's pocket, everybody else's way of life and so on. The landowner is entitled to some level of confidentiality in representations he makes and that should be available.  If Deputy Shatter's amendment was to become effective, I would have thought it should have followed on with other <Col N="555" /> sections to indicate precisely how the public would be involved subsequently in having made the initial arrangements as regards deciding who would appear on the register.  It raises a question but it does not provide any solution.  It is somewhat defective in that it needs to be pursued by other sections if it is to be pursued to its finality.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the most extensive availability of information.  I do not want it to be seen that we have infringed on the rights of the other side in this, that is, the landowner.  I do not know whether I am getting any message across to the learned Deputies.  I have thought about this matter and we might be going too far too soon on this matter.  The neighbours have an entitlement to know what is going on and I accept that but I am not prepared to give them the right to say who will be levied or taxed.  That is going beyond what is intended in the Bill and also what is intended by Deputy Shatter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with the matter the Minister raised as to whether the neighbours should be involved in determining whether somebody should or should not be levied for tax.  That is not what the neighbours are involved in at all.  They are involved in trying to prevent dereliction within their community and trying to ensure that where there is dereliction the Act is used to force a landowner to make good the buildings he owns in order to put an end to dereliction. The taxation is incidental.  It is merely levied by the local authority under the Bill, in a sense, against the recalcitrant landowner who is refusing to take the necessary action to put his land into proper shape.  It is not a tax in the popular sense of being based on someone's income as a general tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an efficiency tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a form of penalty imposed on people because they have not met the necessary standard of keeping their property in good order.  A person's property can be in such bad order that it <Col N="556" /> diminishes the neighbours' enjoyment of their property.  In other words, it can impinge on other people's property rights.  It is not a question that I have a right to allow my land to go derelict.  I do not have a right to allow my land to go so derelict as to devalue other people's land, to diminish their property rights and to undermine their enjoyment of their property.</P>
      <P>It is my view that the neighbours have a definite right and entitlement to access to any information the landowner in those circumstances gave to a local authority which resulted in the local authority deciding not to include him on the register. The question of whether the person can or cannot afford to pay a levy is not relevant because, as I understand the workings of the Bill &mdash; the Minister may clarify this for me in case I am incorrect &mdash; you can be entered on the register but in a case of financial difficulty the local authority would still have discretion not to levy you for the amount stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am entered on the register I could still make the case that I should not have to make a payment because I have financial difficulties.  Equally, to use the related area of planning, one very often sees on a planning application, in particular where planning applications are made for areas which have been zoned as amenity or agriculture areas, a degree of special pleading as to why somebody should be allowed to build a cottage or a house on a particular spot.  It may relate to the fact that the land is being made available by a parent, an aunt or an uncle.  On occasions buildings are permitted to be built because members of a family are handicapped, have difficulties, or have special needs. In such cases permission is given for a planning development which would not be given in normal circumstances in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that personalised information is made available on the planning file for those who wish to inspect it if it forms part and parcel of the reasons given for <Col N="557" /> a planning application.  I stick with the view given originally on this matter which is that this provision is designed to improve the Bill and to ensure that a degree of information is available to those who are directly affected by the decision the local authority make after receiving representations from the landowner. I do not see that as an unnecessary infringement of property rights; I see it simply as making information available to the community.</P>
    <P>I have difficulty in seeing how we are going too far too fast by including this particularly simple measure in the Bill.  I invite the Minister, in the spirit in which we have dealt with this Bill to date, to accept this amendment to the section at this stage and, if he wishes to make any further changes to it, he can always come back with an amendment on Report Stage.  I invite the Minister at this stage to accept this amendment which would assist in the workings of the legislation and in the communication of information. The Minister says that a local authority would be at liberty anyway to communicate with neighbours and other people but rather in this being done as a grace and discretion exercise I take the view that a community in whose area there is land or property in poor condition have a right to receive information.  They should not receive it merely at the discretion of an official in a local authority. Without this provision the manner in which such matters may be dealt with may vary from local authority to local authority and may depend on who the county or city manager is.</P>

      <P>Let me make this final point: If I apply for planning permission I will get a decision one way or another. It is purely an administrative matter.  But what we are talking of here does not amount to quite the same thing.  It is putting you on a register saying that you are not being a good citizen that a penalty is being imposed on you.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Proper order.  That is the reason we have brought forward this legislation.  I do not want people apart from the policing force to be involved and the policing force are the local authority. Perhaps this is a sentimental thing but I hate snoops.  I am not too keen about people getting information about the personal and financial affairs of another person unnecessarily, particularly if it is not required to achieve the end result.  I do not think it would be necessary in this case.  The person's name would be put on the register in any event.  Even if the local authority decide, as a result of information they have received, that the levy is not to be applied in the same way the person's name would still be on the register.  I am reluctant to go all the way down the road with the Deputy on this one.  In any event I cannot accept the amendment because of technical deficiencies which we do not have to go into here.</P>
      <P>If I thought that the Deputies, collectively, wanted it to be this way, I would certainly take another look at the amendment between now and Report Stage.  I would ask the Deputies &mdash; this may be difficult for Deputy Quinn &mdash; to take a look at it from a landowner's point of view to see if we want to do something that will infringe on a minor right they might think they should have.  I think we should not take that line if we can achieve the end result, which I think we can, without doing so.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)  Upon a person notifying a local authority of an alleged derelict site within the area of such authority the local authority shall advise such person in writing within 21 days of receipt of such notice of the action, if any, it proposes taking following receipt of such notification and if no action is proposed, the reason why.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, this amendment is very much in the spirit of the preceding one.  The Minister said I had tabled unnecessary amendments. This amendment is put down so as to ensure that members of the general public are given information as to what action, if any, their local authority are taking with regard to an alleged derelict <Col N="560" /> site.  The amendment seeks to include a new subsection (6) in section 9 and is based on a perception of how in practice this legislation will work.  As I said earlier, I have no doubt that on many occasions letters or representations to the local authority by individuals act as a catalyst to the authority, looking at a particular building or site, to determine whether it is derelict.  If an individual makes representations and asks a local authority to take action the individual is entitled within a reasonable time on a matter as serious as this to a response from the local authority indicating that they are either going to look into it, that they previously looked into it and its condition is not such to warrant its inclusion on the register or that it has already been entered on the register.</P>
    <P>This has all got to do with giving the general public access to information.  It is important because in my experience local authorities are far too slow in responding directly to members of the general public. When an objection is raised with or representations are received by a local authority in respect of a particular planning application normally the authority on making this decision will communicate that decision to the person who has raised the objection or made the submission. Equally, in this case the local authority should be required to communicate with people who have gone to the trouble of writing or communicating with the local authority so as to complain about a particular site.  This amendment is based on the principle of access to information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <P>This amendment would place an unusually rigid statutory requirement on local authorities in relation to servicing interventions by third parties, regardless of the merits and <i>bona fides</i> of the intervention.  I genuinely believe that placing such a statutory obligation on a local authority would be inappropriate. Some element of discretion would have to be left to local authorities.  The register would be in place and the public would be entitled to make representations. Requiring the issuing of a reply within 21 days would place an excessive demand <Col N="561" /> on local authorities.  This could be abused by an organised correspondence course. We do not want to end up in a position where all of the clerical staff of a local authority would be engaged full time in answering correspondence on these matters.</P>

I do not want to place a statutory requirement on them and I ask the Deputy not to pursue the amendment. To accept it would place the local authorities in an impossible position.  As everybody would be in a position to take a look at the register I do not think this amendment is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

      <P>Let me respond briefly to what the Minister has said.  It is not a question of the register being there &mdash; if the register is there, the general public can examine it &mdash; but rather it is a question of an individual making representations to a local authority that a piece of land which has not been entered on the register should be on the register. We have this odd attitude to local government. We seem to think it will impinge on the efficiency of the bureaucracy if there is an obligation imposed on local authorities to respond relatively speedily to individuals and to give them information. Local authorities should have very specific obligations.  They are there to serve the general public and the public has a right of access to information and to responses.  If somebody is not <i>bona fide,</i> if you are talking about a crank writing a letter or a series of people running a campaign that may be a different matter but, if you are talking about someone raising a genuine problem, any half efficient business operating anywhere in a reasonable fashion in any civilised country can normally respond to a letter within 21 days.  It is the inefficiencies and the bureaucratic lack of concern in <Col N="562" /> responding to the general public which makes it so extraordinary that there should be an obligation imposed on local authorities to reply to a letter within 21 days.  That should not be extraordinary. It should happen in the context of local authorities being seen to be there to serve the communities for whom they operate.</P>
      <P>The Minister expressed serious objections to this as he feels it would tie up local authorities unreasonably.  I do not share that view but I am prepared to consider tabling this amendment in a slightly different form on Report Stage so as to remove an obligation in circumstances of what could be described as crank correspondence as opposed to someone raising a real issue.  In that context I will not pursue the amendment this evening.</P>

      <P>It is important, in the context of this section which refers to a notice that can be served &mdash; subsection (2) (a) states that a notice under this section shall specify the measures which the local authority or the Minister, as the case may be, consider to be necessary in order to prevent the land from becoming or continuing to be a derelict site &mdash; to ensure that any such measures properly restore any property or building to the condition in which it may originally have been.

However, it seems that everything referred to in the amendment could be validly required by local authorities in <Col N="564" /> the appropriate circumstances under the generality of subsection (2) (a) as it stands.  I would also be somewhat concerned at the reference to &ldquo;proper restoration of any structure&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Proper&rdquo; by reference to what criterion?  The only valid criterion for requiring action under the Bill is the elimination of the derelict condition of the land.  There may be a number of ways of doing this, proper restoration by reference, say, to principles of architectural conservation operated by the Office of Public Works or various heritage bodies which might greatly exceed the mundane requirements of rendering this site non-derelict. In those circumstances I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 45 and 46, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) direct the local authority to take such steps as may be necessary so as to ensure that a development objective or objectives for the purpose of reserving land for roads or parking places or for any of the purposes of reserving or preserving land indicated in Part IV of the Third Schedule of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, does not result in any land subject to any such development objective becoming or continuing to be a derelict site,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this section the Minister is giving a number of powers to give directions to a local authority but the area that was omitted is the one which was referred to earlier, the problem that local authorities can give rise to by their own actions.  A local authority by unrealistic development objectives, in particular with regard to road widening or road building proposals, can often be a major contributor <Col N="567" /> to or causative factor in dereliction.  I made the point that Dublin Corporation bear a considerable portion of the blame for dereliction in the city and that more than any other body they have contributed probably to in excess of 60 per cent of the dereliction by unrealistic road widening objectives contained in development plans.  Such proposals have been included in successive plans since the 1963 Act came into force.  They were put in each time a review took place with no realistic possibility of being implemented this side of the year 2000. Some of them will not be seen in the lifetime of any Member of the House.</P>
    <P>In the context of the local authority being exempt from having to pay a levy &mdash; there is little point in the authority levying themselves &mdash; the Minister should have some specific discretionary powers to intervene so as to ensure that local authorities do not contribute to dereliction as a result of unrealistic objectives being included in development plans.  I am proposing that section 13 be amended by the insertion of an additional paragraph which would empower the Minister to direct the local authority to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that development objectives for the purpose of reserving lands for roads, parking places or for any of the purposes of preserving land indicated in Part IV of the Third Schedule of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, do not result in any land subject to any such development objective becoming or continuing to be a derelict site.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to accept that amendment.  I am seeking to give him a discretionary power to intervene where he believes it is necessary to do so and to require local authorities to take action in the context of land which has remained in private ownership but which has become derelict due directly to action taken by a local authority.  It appears that for many years there is no prospect of a local authority taking any action to resolve the problem and there is no prospect of that body freeing the land of unrealistic objectives so as to <Col N="568" /> allow the landowner to get on with using it as he sees appropriate and bringing an end to dereliction.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he is concerned about private property rights and the landowner.  In my proposal I am concerned about private property rights and the landowner and about the way in which a local authority decision can impinge unreasonably and arbitrarily on rights to the detriment of the owner of the land and the local community affected by land that has become derelict as a result of the actions of the local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's concern that the objectives of the development plan reserving or preserving land should not give rise to dereliction. However, I have to say that I would not be too happy that this Bill on derelict sites should be used to provide formal inputs into the planning system.  This is more appropriate to planning legislation and, moreover, is expressly provided for in that legislation.  Under section 7 of the Planning Act, 1972 the Minister for the Environment is empowered to issue general directives as to policy in relation to planning and development to which planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála must have regard.  The Minister is also empowered by section 23 (3) of the Planning Act, 1963, to require a planning authority to vary their development plan in such a manner as he may specify.  The powers which the Deputy proposes to confer on the Minister by this amendment are adequately catered for in planning legislation and we think that the amendment, accordingly, is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister might consider the reasoned addendum proposed by Deputy Shatter as a simple piece of enabling legislation which he is not obliged to avail of.  The operative phrase is, &ldquo;the Minister may&rdquo;.  I have some worries in relation to that but I will confine myself to the thrust of the amendment proposed by Deputy Shatter. I agree with him.  Indeed, in the course of my speech on Second Stage on 14 February, as reported at column 132 <Col N="569" /> of the Official Report of that date, I gave a specific example of dereliction caused by Dublin Corporation in Charlement Street.  By virtue of moving a road line on three separate occasions that authority brought about the dereliction of property some, if not all, of which is still in private ownership.</P>
      <P>The Minister is correct in saying that the planning and development legislation, the 1963 Act and the subsequent amending legislation, enables him to do what he has read into the record.  It would be far more eloquent testimony by way of rebuttal to our argument if he could point to an example where a Minister had used those powers to have a development plan changed.  I am not aware that that power was used by the half a dozen Ministers for the Environment and Local Government who have held the office since the 1963 Act was passed.  It is because of the specific and precise nature of derelict sites that I consider it most appropriate that this enabling provision should be inserted into the section.  The operative words are, &ldquo;the Minister may&rdquo;, and the thrust and the intent will be to avoid dereliction.  I do not see how the Minister can have any difficulty in taking this on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in a difficulty.  I am very concerned that I might be doing something which would make it virtually impossible for local authorities to make reservations for road widening if they had to make estimations as to what possible dereliction might or might not subsequently ensue because of their action. This would be very restrictive on local authorities who in normal circumstances wish to do the right thing.  Usually they are carrying out the instructions of the elected members in seeking to have reservations placed for roads, parks, or whatever.  I place greater emphasis than some of my colleague and, indeed, some Members of the House, on the rights, the powers and the authority of members of <Col N="570" /> local authorities.  It is not the administrators who have the power but the members.  The members decide what local authorities should do by way of reservation and I do not wish to restrict their powers in regard to what they would like to do this year, or next year, or in reserving a road for future development.  If they had to consider what dereliction might or might not take place because of that development at some future date it would be overly restrictive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>How can I give a guarantee in regard to that while at the same time I am trying to allow local authorities to retain their existing powers of reservation. The amendment goes too far. Members of local authorities get involved in the preparation of development plans and decide on the reservations for amenity purposes, road widening, and so on. I do not want a restriction put on them in such a way that they will have to consider what dereliction might take place because of their decision.  I do not want to be restricting local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister said is fine as far as it goes but the problem is not the reservation by local authorities pursuant to a decision by members. Those members arrive at their decision following an open, above board process of consideration and reflection and that is fine.  Nobody would want to impede that.  However, as the Minister will be aware, there is a constant practice, which is not unreasonable, of forward planners in local authorities notionally deciding, without reference to anybody outside their own office, that a particular line of motorway, or roadway, or other area might at some future date be desirable for development.  They therefore begin the process of sterilisation of that area which takes the form, for example, of <Col N="571" /> ensuring that if there are planning permissions sought, setbacks, as I think they are called &mdash; that is, a certain circumscribing of the actual configuration of the planning permissions &mdash; will take place.  In other words, a local impact takes place and the genesis of those kinds of decisions is very hard to fathom, but they have nothing to do with the powers of local authority members.  They are never dealt with by local authority members; they emerge from deep within the recesses of the decision-making process by presumably concerned engineers who think this is the way to plan, and say: &ldquo;If by some chance in the future we talk about putting a piece of roadwork in an area, this is how we will have to do it&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is a point in what Deputy Quinn and Deputy Shatter have said to the extent that the way decisions are made and the definition of reservation, which is what I was trying to say earlier this evening, contribute without question to the creation of large areas of blight, and I am quite happy to point these out to the Minister if he so wishes.  I do not think any of us wants to impede or cut back on the powers of local authority members once it comes to making decisions, but there is a whole area of decision making by stealth, not malmotivated as it were, but nevertheless resulting in serious urban blight.  That is the area I believe is at the heart of this proposal.</P>

      <P>There may be a lot of sense in what Deputies are saying but let us not get carried away by putting too much rigidity into the system, whether it is the system of planning, reservations or whatever. I want to leave the system free and that flexibility and power to be retained by local authority members.  Local authority members always have the opportunity, if they so wish, to vary their development plan to accommodate whatever they think is necessary if there is the <Col N="572" /> possibility that dereliction may be caused down the road.  They have the power to do that so why take it from them?  Why should we make them less effective than what they might wish by imposing statutory rigidity on them?</P>

If the Minister was not to be concerned with dereliction created, say, by the action of the local authority, or the inaction of a local authority in the sense of a long-term road widening plan which has been continuing for years and caused dereliction, he could use the same argument about the Minister not impinging on what the local authority members are doing or opposing any urban renewal scheme anywhere.  We should not have areas designated by the Government with special tax concessions.  This is impinging in a sense on the prerogative of local authority members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am saying and Deputy Quinn possibly made the case more eloquently than I &mdash; is that the major problem here is continuing dereliction.  A classical example of that, which was mentioned earlier, is what happened to Clanbrassil Street which was in a state of utter dereliction for about 20 years before anybody got round to doing anything about the road widening plan.  As a very young child I used to shop with my family on Clanbrassil Street and I remember it as a very attractive street &mdash; and I would not have been a teenager at that stage.  Low and behold, the corporation produced a development plan with long-term road widening proposals which 20 years later somebody is finally doing something about, after total and utter dereliction has been caused along the length and breadth of that street.  It would be my contention that Dublin Corporation, in the context of Clanbrassil Street and other streets, would not have in any way prejudiced their road widening proposals if those proposals had not been produced at a stage when there was no possibility of <Col N="573" /> the corporation proceeding to implement them or having the funds to implement them.  The corporation could just as easily have produced the plans five or six years before they got on with the job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us leave aside for a moment the political rows as to whether or not it should be done.  There is no particular reason why the corporation &mdash; and someone in the corporation might have thought this was a bright idea &mdash; could not have waited 15 years and then brought the plan to the elected members of Dublin Corporation and said at that stage &ldquo;We need this plan, we think we have the resources, be it from our own resources or central Government, and we should now put this in as an objective&rdquo;.  If they had done that the dereliction which blighted that part of the city would not have happened.  That area would still be a vibrant street with people living and continuing to work there and spending money on their property.  Maybe it suited the corporation not to do that and perhaps they had a vested interest in dereliction.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This meant that when they bought people out the value of the properties dropped because of the corporation causing dereliction and blight in the area.  If the Minister is genuinely concerned about private property rights I would say that that was a naked assault on the private property rights of those people whose properties were in Clanbrassil Street, apart from being a sociological assault on the community which centred around that part of the city of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn referred to Charlemount Street.  There are areas around the city, for example, Charlemount Street and Harcourt Road, we could point to and say that they have been <Col N="574" /> blighted because of plans the corporation have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to have a general discretionary power which will enable him, when it is obvious that there is blight caused as a result of a local authority decision, to tell that local authority that cannot continue and that either they change the objective in their development plan so that the area can regenerate itself, or they get on with implementing the objective in the plan for five years, ten years or whatever.</P>
      <P>What I am trying to do is to give the Minister extra powers.  I accept that notionally he has some of these powers under the Planning Acts but I do not think they have ever been used to deal with the problem of dereliction.  By having this power in the Derelict Sites Bill, it focuses on the problem of dereliction in a way that it has not been focused on before.  This power will give the Minister discretion and he will not have to act on it unless there is a very blatant problem which needs to be pursued. There are different portions of the city of Dublin we could talk about in this context as well as one or two portions in other urban areas, but I think Dublin has been more particularly affected than any other area.  It is the area where I would envisage the Minister or one of his successors at some stage wanting to make a move on in the context of this section.  At the very least I would ask the Minister to consider this amendment or a similar provision on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes I begin to wonder what we do at times in the House. The Deputy readily admitted that the Minister has very extensive powers under various Acts but never uses them.  There are lots of powers available to planning authorities which they have never used either.  If they did use these powers we <Col N="575" /> might not get involved in a lot of claims and other things which come up at certain times.  I do not understand whether this is as a result of a lack of understanding, appreciation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because of a lack of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;or maybe there is a fault so far as the Minister or the House is concerned.  Certainly, there are extensive powers available to the Minister, and the Deputy readily admitted that, so why seek to duplicate them or put them into sharper focus?  They are either there or they are not, and if they are there they do not require sharper focus.  It is a matter of better understanding.</P>
      <P>I have to reject what the Deputy said about designated areas.  I accept that there was one designated area as far as planning was concerned, and this was given to the Custom House Docks Development Authority, but apart from that it did not affect the planning of the area.  I think it helped the area by the continued involvement in the development I see being negotiated for the quays. This will alter the face of central Dublin during the next five or ten years and it will be quite magnificent.</P>

Statutory bodies with democratically elected representatives have the power to do anything they like under the law, and the law is there in abundance to enable them to do that.

      <P>I apologise to the House. The managers on occasions assured members of local authorities in the making of plans, which is a reserve function, that funds would be available for road widening proposals and subsequently there was a delay in funding. If local authorities had independent financial resources I would not be looking for central Government powers like this but because they do not they get into a situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am surprised at the Deputy.  He has his tongue half way through his cheek when he is saying that. He should not be so naive about it.  The Deputy is well aware that, when local authority engineers are putting something forward, they are not giving any guarantee.  It is well known that they cannot give any guarantee about funding either then or later.  What they are saying is that they will be seeking funding for it and the Deputy knows how difficult funding can sometimes be.  I am saying that when members have plans put in front of them by their technical staff they decide on the rightness or the wrongness of the technical advice being given to <Col N="577" /> them to do a certain job irrespective of when the money comes.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quill gave me notice of her intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the crisis in second level schools because of the failure of the Department to make proper provision for the junior certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of the new junior certificate course into all of our second level schools in September 1989 and the consequent abolition of the intermediate certificate and group certificate examinations mark a major landmark in the development of Irish education.  This is a long overdue and long sought for educational reform.  In fairness it must be said that the Minister must be complimented on advancing the matter to this stage and bringing it to the point where <Col N="578" /> the courses are now designed and ready for implementation.  This ought to be a time of great enthusiasm among educationists and a time of great hope for parents and students alike but, unfortunately, that is not so.  What is beginning to emerge at this stage is that it is becoming a time of deep disquiet and grave apprehension for all those involved in the introduction of the new course.</P>
      <P>This anxiety and apprehension arise mainly from the refusal of the Minister to apply herself to the practical implications of putting the new programme in place in the schools.  I want to say to the Minister here tonight that there is no way a major educational reform of this magnitude can be brought about without the provision of a substantial investment in the first and subsequent years of the new programme.  The requirements are basic and very straightforward.  They fall into three categories: there is a need for adequate in-service training for the workforce; there is a need to make provision for basic essential classroom equipment; and there is a need to put in place a mechanism to oversee the successful introduction and development of the new curriculum.</P>
      <P>In relation to in-service training I fully accept that the Minister has already made some provision but clearly the provision made is not enough.  The Minister must look at her workforce in the same manner as any manager about to embark on the introduction of new technology into his plant would look at his workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Into her plant or her workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, there is no way that any successful or progressive manager of either gender would dream of considering the introduction of new technology without first making provision for intensive in-service training for the members of his or her staff.  In the case of the Minister's secretary, if she is in <Col N="579" /> the process of introducing a new work practice or new equipment into her office, one of the first things she must do before bringing in the equipment or introducing the new practice is to send her secretary away for some in-service training.  That is what any sensible person would do in the times in which we are living.  If this is done in the case of people who are dealing with hardware or software, how much more important is it that this intensive training should be provided for those in the workforce who deal with our children and with the formation of the next generation.</P>
      <P>In a nutshell what I am saying is that in-service training must be provided not alone pre the introduction of the course but on an on-going basis especially during the first three years leading to the first public examination in 1992.  There is a good deal of opinion as to how that should be done and the Minister is in receipt of a number of very solid and good suggestions from practitioners in the field.  Much of the in-service training ought to take place within schools or among groups of subject teachers on a localised basis.  There is much merit in appointing department heads with posts of responsibility in different subject areas to spearhead the introduction of the courses into schools, to monitor the progress within schools and to act as liaison people between an individual school, the course committees, or the inspector, or whoever that might be.  In schools at present responsibility is sometimes given for very flimsy posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot think of any reason why the Minister should not have a good look at what I am saying and allocate posts to persons who are prepared to act in that capacity within schools.  That would be one way of ensuring that the new course would get off to a good start and stay on the proper course.  That would be a simple mechanism and would not cost the earth.  Posts already in existence could be <Col N="580" /> allocated in that manner.  I hope I am making the position clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Deputy's point of view.  With respect, Deputy Quill, I was a teacher.  I do not agree with what you are saying but I understand what you are saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  That is all I want the Minister to do.  The important and essential point is that the success of the curriculum will ultimately stand or fall on the skill, commitment and enthusiasm of the teachers who will be called upon to put it in place.</P>
      <P>I now wish to move on to my second point.  Equally important is the provision of basic equipment to make the new approach to subject teaching possible.  I will not give a list of the equipment needed because it is much too detailed to be put into the context of this debate but I know that the joint managerial board made a full submission to the Minister outlining exactly what equipment is necessary for the implementation of the new curriculum.  I believe the Minister has no option but to meet that requirement list in full.  A range of new tape recorders, overhead projectors, laboratory equipment etc. must be provided in all our schools.</P>
      <P>My clear understanding is that what is being asked for is no more than what is the criterion accepted by the Department of Education in relation to the fitting out of new schools.  The joint managerial board want all schools to be given the same level of equipment as that now deemed necessary for the adequate fitting out of new schools.  There is nothing unreasonable about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be admitted that some schools are infinitely better equipped than others, especially the newly built schools.  Many of the community and comprehensive schools are well equipped but some of the old voluntary secondary schools are exceptionally under equipped with the kind of hardware which is so essential <Col N="581" /> if the new course is to be introduced effectively and if it is to be developed effectively.  That cannot be overlooked. Provision must be made for this on a <i>per capita</i> basis.  That is the only way that is to be done.  That is the second demand, that I make here this evening, that an adequate per capital grant be made to all schools to enable them to equip themselves adequately so as to be in a position to introduce this new programme effectively and efficiently into the schools.</P>
    <P>In addition to what has been asked for by the joint managerial board, I must ask the Minister to look especially at certain schools in areas of high disadvantage.  In such schools provision must be made for lending libraries so that children will have access to books from the recommended reading list.  If this is not done numbers of children will have access to very little reading material since much of the reading in the language area is now optional and since the old text book approach is being virtually abandoned.  If all children, whether they live in areas of high economic disadvantage or otherwise, do not have equal access to books and reading material, reading standards and, automatically, educational standards will fall significantly.  There is no doubt that better off parents will be in a better position to buy books for their children but that for the less well off children, books are not a high priority.  Children in those areas will suffer if the optional reading material is not made available.  That can only be done through the setting up of lending libraries in schools where children can borrow the books as they would from the public library.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to also put in place some kind of mechanism to oversee the workings of the new course as it develops over the first three years especially, and after.  I want adequate after sales service.  I was in the teaching service when the new curriculum for primary schools was introduced in 1971. That was a curriculum of great promise, a major change with great creativity being <Col N="582" /> brought into primary schools.  It worked exceptionally well in most cases but in some cases and in certain subject areas it worked very badly.  The main reason for that was that there was no adequate after sales service, no help for teachers who had been taught in the old way and who simply were not properly initiated into the new curriculum.  Because there was not enough help for them, in some cases the curriculum failed.  Now we have the benefit of hindsight and it is important to ensure that that kind of thing does not happen again.  It is very important that some kind of mechanism is put in place to ensure that the courses work well in all cases and in all subjects.  It is equally important to ensure that if problems develop or new insignts are gained as to how a matter might be approached, there is some body there to take on board whatever is learned from the problems that arise or from the insights gained so as to put what is learnt to good advantage, to ensure that problems do not take root at the start.  Very often we cannot say for certain how effective something will be until it is tested.</P>
    <P>The new junior certificate programme will be the cornerstone of all second level education for the remainder of this century and into the next.  By definition, it will be the cornerstone of all subsequent education because what happens in second level determines the standard of third level and of subsequent education. It is of prime importance that we get it right from the start.  If the resources I have sought are not provided in adequate measure for the first three years especially, my fear and prediction is that standards of education in many areas will drop significantly.  If that begins to happen our public education system that has a very fine tradition and a fine reputation will stand to lose.  Inevitably better off parents will seek outside schools and all sorts of grinds and educational tuition for their children.  Parents who cannot afford that their children will fall further behind and that will be the exact negation <Col N="583" /> of much of what this new junior certificate course sets out to do.  Part of the principle on which it was based was to make better provision, because of better variety, of subject matter and in the methodology of teaching for students of all ability ranges.  Unless provision is made along the lines I have outlined I have grave fears that the expectations and the objectives of the curriculum will not be met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Quill for putting down this motion and the Chair for giving us an opportunity to discuss this important topic.  I share the Deputy's long experience in the educational services. I compliment the Deputy on the great distinction with which she has conducted herself during her educational career.  That has carried her into this House.  I compliment the Deputy, too, on her contributions to educational debates. However, listening to the Deputy's demands I wondered if she is living in the real world.  As a member of a Government with a duty to deal with the country in an economic sense as well as in a social and cultural sense, I have to have regard to the Estimates voted in the House. By law I am obliged to abide by those Estimates.  I do not recall the attitude of the Deputy's party or of herself to the Estimates, but be that as it may, the democratic will of the House prevailed and the budget and the Estimates for 1989 were passed by this House.  Therefore the demands made earlier in the House tonight and the demands now made by the Deputy cannot be acceded to immediately.  I must have regard to my duties as a member of the Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy made four demands.  I acknowledge with appreciation, her tribute to my initiative in bringing these syllabi forward.  The Deputy spoke of the enthusiasm which infused the educational world when those announcements were made and when we put these new syllabi <Col N="584" /> in train.  I well remember the day last October when the unions, the management, myself and all political parties joined in that issue when the seven syllabi were issued to all the seven schools.  It is worth noting that each of the seven syllabi which went out carried the following imprimatur of the course committees and of the council of the NCCA: &ldquo;These new syllabi are to be implemented within existing resources.&rdquo;  As I say, that had the imprimatur of the then and now course committees that were composed in the main of practising teachers.  This was put out under the aegis of the board who advise me on curricular matters, the National Council for Curriculum Assessment. That was passed by all the representatives involved, then passed by the council and finally issued to the schools. That is a matter of public record and it would be well to remind ourselves of that again.</P>
    <P>It was again brought to my attention that there would be resources implications in in-services courses.  To that end I sought and obtained a 124 per cent increase from the Estimate of October. When the January budget was finally printed, there was an increase from £300,000 approximately to £700,000 approximately for in-service courses. Again, that is a matter of public record.</P>
    <P>We set up in-service committees composed of practising teachers.  I met last November with the representatives of the unions to establish the make-up of the in-service committees.  The Committees devised the courses themselves, which were then issued and in which 14,000 teachers have participated already on one full in-service day.  There is to be another similar, or perhaps dissimilar, day &mdash; depending on what the in-service course committees now decide should be the next regime of in-service courses.  That has been decided by practising teachers on the in-service committees which I have set up.</P>
    <P>Let me totally refute the remarks made by the Deputy at the commencement of <Col N="585" /> her contribution that it has not been a hands-on approach.  It has been hands-on every minute of the day with regard to the implementation of the junior certificate. A substantial investment has been made in in-service and I certainly would hope that we can improve on that, adapt and amend it.  If the committees want more localisation, we had regional days in which the 14,000 people participated. These were out of school days, not just from the normal in-service course.  That was what the teachers wanted and again we agreed.  This was correct.  The teachers need their in-service days.  Any suggestion that they should not get these is completely wrong. They have intimated to me that perhaps in-service might be made into a more localised issue with a more workshop rather than a lecturing theme.  If these committees decide that that is the way in which the in-service courses should be run, they know their needs best.  I would not like to comment on the suggestion that a post of responsibility be used in this manner.  That is another matter.  I do not know where that suggestion came from and am not particularly enthused about it.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that the range of in-service, and proposed range which will alter and change as needs develop, would be very suitable for the junior certificate. I most wholeheartedly and enthusiastically pledge myself to a very comprehensive, thorough and on-going range of in-service extending over three years and onward if needs be, depending always on what are the perceived needs as the courses get going and teachers and pupils see these needs and how the new methodology has developed.</P>
    <P>The idea of lending libraries is a very good one.  It is not the first time that Deputy Quill has brought this idea up here.  It has appeared in oral parliamentary questions.  Schools have started this in some instances on a purely voluntary basis.  I have always commended the idea and this is something <Col N="586" /> to which the joint managerial body or principals of schools or whatever should attach themselves, a mechanism in place to oversee the work of the course committees is a very solid idea.  An overall mechanism to overview how the course committees should be proceeding or how the junior certificate operates from its inception would seem a very good idea, also, and would have a report back mechanism. I would lend my attention to that and be glad to carry it out.  In most of these matters I would find myself in agreement with the Deputy.  In the matter of detail we might diverge, but on the general issues there would be agreement.</P>
    <P>We come now to the serious implication. The Deputy used the word &ldquo;demand&rdquo;, to which I would take grave exception in any circumstances bearing in mind my public financial responsibilities. The Deputy demanded an unquantified but obviously substantial increase in <i>per capita</i> grant aid for resources, equipment and all sorts of other worthy objectives. In full calmness I call these worthy objectives. One could keep on throwing resources into the education system forever and still not have the perfect system. That is the eternal charm, attraction and challenge involved in the whole area of education.  The Deputy knows that you can never leave a classroom feeling that you have evoked the proper response from every pupil, that every child has gone home knowing more and feeling happier and that the teacher is happy. Everybody is different and proceeds at a different rate.  The whole system is constantly evolving.  It is never a perfect system.</P>
    <P>A mechanism, while being a good idea is only as good as you can manage at the time and as circumstances allow.  The demand that every school in the land would, <i>hey presto</i>, be comparable with the finest new school with language and science laboratories and every other facility is a fine objective and I would have no quarrel with that.  If I had a fairy <Col N="587" /> godmother complete with wand I would wish that all 850 second level schools would be provided with shining, new, bright and burnished equipment, but then there would be some other issue at stake in education &mdash; let me continue, Deputy.  I did not interrupt.  I have a quarrel with a shrill demand for unspecified millions to be spent ar an bpointe so that every school is brought up to perfect standards overnight.  No Minister of any Department, particularly the Department of Education, could agree to do that.</P>
    <P>

They want these courses to go ahead, otherwise they would not have responded so magnificantly last October. They see a source of new morals and spirit in them with regard to the teachers.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of my request to the EC Commission to introduce measures to help Irish winter feeders, intervention for carcases was introduced for two weeks in March of this year.  This had the effect of creating a strong demand for cattle &mdash; approximately 45,000 steers were slaughtered in the two weeks &mdash; and resulted in an increase of 9p/kg for steers. This price increase alleviated the problems of the vast bulk of winter feeders. Another effect of the carcase intervention was that it facilitated a smooth run-in to the new intervention system which began on 3 April.</P>
      <P>The prices package agreed last week included a 2 per cent green pound devaluation in the beef sector.  The result of this is that the trigger for intervention, in terms of Irish pounds, has been restored to the levels which preceded the introduction of the new intervention régime. The elimination of MCAs in the cattle and beef sector, of course, increases the competitiveness of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most importantly, for the longer term I have obtained the agreement of the EC Commission to my proposal that a joint study group, comprised of officials from the Commission and my Department, be <Col N="360" /> set up to examine the whole question of the impact of seasonality on the industry. This is a significant achievement in that after years of talking about the problems of seasonality the EC Commission have been persuaded to examine the matter as a priority issue.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years, I have succeeded in obtaining special sales of intervention beef for Irish processors.  This enabled them to purchase their raw materials at competitive prices.  The elimination of monetary compensatory amounts in the beef sector also alleviated the supply problems.  I am, however, keeping up pressure on the EC Commission to sell intervention beef to our processors at competitive prices.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the importance of the cattle and beef sector to the overall economy in the country.  In fact, it represents 3.9 per cent of gross domestic product in Ireland compared to 0.5 per cent for the Community as a whole.  It is encouraging to note the improved confidence in the future of the industry.  This is reflected in the 1988 December livestock enumeration figures which showed an increase of 114,000 beef cows compared to the position in December 1987.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 38 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>I have from the beginning of my term of office been very concerned about the quota difficulties of such farmers.</P>
      <P>The initial arrangements of our national quota in 1984 have not, unfortunately, been adequate to deal with the difficulties faced by these producers.  For that reason I secured agreement from the Council of Ministers in 1987 to introduce a restructuring scheme giving special priority for the purchase of quota, without land, to small scale producers.  Under the scheme introduced in September 1987, I provided that priority for the purchase of quotas is to be accorded to small scale milk producers.  The scheme is in fact restricted to producers with quotas under 50,000 gallons and of these the first priority category is confined to producers with quotas of less than 30,000 gallons.</P>
      <P>I have also sought to help some producers by giving them priority under the scheme for temporary leasing of quotas introduced in 1988-89 and also in that year I further amended the guidelines on flexi-milk in their favour.</P>
      <P>Further more, I introduced in December 1987 a clawback system under which a percentage of quota transferring with a lease of land will be retained in a national reserve, if the lessee's total quota exceeds 50,000 gallons.  This is designed partly to add quota to the national reserve for distribution to small scale and young farmers and, more importantly in the way the scheme works, to give producers priority access to quotas becoming available for leasing with land.</P>
      <P>A number of these changes were introduced following recommendations from the group, representing all interests in the industry, which I set up to review the quota arrangements generally.  I am now asking that group to meet again to see whether there are other ways in which the national reserve could be topped up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following repeated requests from some other colleagues and myself in the recent prices negotiations, an adjustment of the milk co-responsibility levy system <Col N="363" /> was agreed which was not originally proposed by the Commission.  In the disadvantaged areas, the levy will be reduced to zero for all producers while in other areas a levy of 1 per cent will apply to those producing under 12,800 gallons and 1.5 per cent for other producers. This adjustment will be very helpful to small producers and is worth about £10 million to Irish producers in a full year.</P>
    <P>There was agreement that this would be the first stage in a process leading to the dismantlement of the levy and that there would be a further stage in the price package next year.</P>
    <P>In response to pressure from my French and German colleagues and myself to create an additional quota reserve to provide quotas for development and other priority farmers, the Commission has undertaken to prepare a report on the market situation and the conditions affecting such categories before 31 July and to submit any appropriate proposals to the Council.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the decisions to be taken on foot of this report will be another step in the action taken to meet the difficulties of small scale and other producers with special quota difficulties.</P>
    <P>For my part I will be pressing very hard to ensure that special action is taken as a result of the Commission report promised as part of last week's price settlement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 67, 82 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>Following the outbreaks of salmonella enteritidis in the later months of 1988, a series of meetings took place between officials from the Departments of Health and Agriculture and Food and representatives of interests from the poultry and eggs industry.  These discussions resulted in the formulation of a voluntary code of practice which I launched on 9 December last.  The code is addressed to all sectors of the industry &mdash; breeders, hatcheries, grower and layer farms, processors, egg packers and feed mills.  It lays down the most appropriate practices to be followed in all of these areas, sets the strictest requirements in relation to hygiene, health status and input usage, and establishes elaborate monitoring procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its launch, the code has been supplementing the extensive monitoring programme for salmonella enteritidis which my Department have been carrying out over the last six months.  This programme has involved the monitoring of eggs and poultry at all levels of the industry with the aim of identifying all possible sources of salmonella enteritidis contamination and eliminating these as quickly as possible.  The results from the first phase of the monitoring programme carried out in December and January last, confirmed that the problem of salmonella <Col N="365" /> enteritidis in the poultry sector in Ireland was very limited.</P>
    <P>A small number of breeding farm flocks, which identified positive, were removed last December in keeping with the slaughter policy adopted by the industry. This policy was aimed at ensuring that egg supplies to hatcheries and day-old placements with growers would come only from sources confirmed free from salmonella enteritidis.  The Department's monitoring programme has been continuing over recent months and the second phase of sampling has now been completed.  The preliminary results from this second round again indicate that the problem has been largely contained and that we are quickly moving to a situation where all poultry flocks in Ireland should be free of any possible link with the infection.</P>
    <P>I should, of course, say that eggs have not been identified as a possible contaminant in any case of salmonella enteritidis reported in Ireland.  Eggs have been cleared in all tests carried out to date by my Department.  While some outbreaks have been linked to the consumption of poultry meat, it is now evident that this product is not the source of contamination in all cases.  Indeed, available evidence in relation to a number of the outbreaks suggests that other sources are involved.</P>
    <P>My Department and the Department of Health have been liaising closely in dealing with salmonella enteritidis in recent months.  Our principal concerns have been to ensure that sources of contamination are eliminated quickly and that consumers are assured of reliable product.  Consumers can help themselves by buying only from reliable sources, following basic hygiene rules and by ensuring good housekeeping and cooking practices.  I endorse the exhortations given by the Minister for Health in this area in recent months.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to introduce a compensation package for income losses incurred by primary producers.  This type of measure has not been made available even in the case of notifiable diseases and I do not propose to make an exception <Col N="366" /> here.</P>
    <P>My Department are involved in discussions with the industry on the possibility of launching a suitably timed publicity campaign designed to promote the consumption of poultry and eggs.  I will keep open the possibility of making a financial contribution to the cost of such a campaign.</P>

      <P>The development programme for the pigmeat sector which I announced in July 1987 is progressing satisfactorily.  The programme involves a total capital investment of £140 million over five years in the rationalisation and modernisation of slaughtering and processing facilities.  To date, investments in excess of £80 million, backed up by generous State and EC aid, have been approved under the programme.  Three new plants are already in operation while work on a fourth has commenced.  Plans are also well advanced in respect of several other projects.</P>
      <P>The success of the development programme is dependent on a number of factors including access to an adequate supply of pigs.  Pigmeat plants which are in receipt of State and EC FEOGA assistance are required to achieve a minimum level of throughout of 6,000 pigs per week.  Some plants have already introduced incentive packages for producers aimed at increasing pig supplies and I understand that there has been a considerable interest by farmers in taking up these schemes.  Incentive packages are not the only source of encouragement to farmers to expand pig output.  The improving returns from the sector in recent months should further facilitate the required growth in pig supply.</P>

      <P>While there is no grant aid available under any existing schemes administered by my Department for the erection of equestrian facilities, export-orientated equestrian projects may, under certain conditions, be eligible for assistance from agencies such as the IDA or SFADCo.  In addition, such projects may be eligible for grant assistance from the EC under the terms of Regulation 355/77.</P>
      <P>Under EC Regulation 355/77 the EC Commission provides grant aid for capital investment projects involving the processing and marketing of agricultural products.  A horse marketing centre could qualify under this scheme.  The grant rate could be as high as 50 per cent of eligible expenditure in the disadvantaged areas of the west of Ireland or 25 per cent elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To be eligible for EC aid a project must be approved for grant aid by the Department or a grant aiding authority. While this Department has no specific funds available for the purpose and grant <Col N="372" /> agencies such as IDA and SFADCo normally direct their support towards manufacturing industry, we have set up an informal working group to draw up some guidelines for equestrian centres and to examine the provision of national aid.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if he will outline the farm income trends in each member state of the EC in (a) 1987 and (b) 1988; and the way in which these compare with the corresponding figures for each country in (i) 1985 and (ii) 1986.</P>

      <P>The most recent CSO estimates of income from self-employment and other trading income in agriculture shows increases of 17.5 per cent in 1988 and 19.6 per cent in 1987, and decreases of 6.5 per cent in 1986 and 10.2 per cent in 1985.  These figures do not allow for interest payable by agriculture.  They are expressed in nominal or current terms and do not take account of changes in inflation rates.</P>
      <P>I am circulating in a table with the Official Report the most up-to-date comparable figures on farm income trends in the different member states of the European Community.  These figures are calculated on the basis of indices of real (adjusted for inflation) net income from agricultural activity per annual work unit of family labour input.  These are obtained from the 1988 Eurostat publication <i>Agricultural Incomes.</i>  They take into account interest payable by agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As can clearly be seen from the table, farmers in Ireland have enjoyed very substantial increases in their incomes over the last two years.  They experienced by far the highest level of increase in 1987 and the second highest level of increase in 1988.  These substantial increases in Ireland more than offset the significant declines experienced in 1985 and 1986. The final column in the table shows index figures for farm income in each member state on the basis of a three year average <Col N="373" /> centred on 1980.  In 1988, farm incomes in real terms in Ireland were 183.3 per cent of the level at the beginning of the decade.  This is a substantially more favourable position than that of the other member states, except Denmark.</P>

      <P>(1)  The Special Male Beef Premium is payable on all male cattle over nine months old, subject to a maximum of 90 animals per calendar year per holding.

All cattle on which the premium is paid must be permanently marked by either a perforation or marking of the ear.</P>
      <P>(2)  Under the Suckler Cow Scheme a premium of £55 per cow is paid to a farmer for maintaining suckler cows.  The premium is paid on condition that the producer does not deliver milk or milk products for 12 months from the date of application.  In addition the number of suckler cows and-or replacement in-calf heifers kept on the holding must equal the number on which the premium has been granted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 58 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>Agreement was reached on agricultural prices and related measures for 1989/90 on 22 April.  The final compromise was based on the Commission's proposals submitted to the Council in January last but included measures submitted by the Commission and a number of issues raised by member states during the prolonged negotiations.  The package contains significant benefits for Ireland in the agri-monetary and milk sectors and these adjustments will be worth about £50 million to the farm sector in a full year.  The balance of payments gain will amount to £42 million.</P>
      <P>Details of the most important adjustments in so far as Irish agriculture is concerned are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission had originally proposed the dismantlement of the residual negative Irish MCAs in the milk, cereals and sugar sectors and a reduction in the monetary gap for sheepmeat and these proposals were agreed as part of the prices package.  These adjustments involve green rate devaluations and consequential price increases of about 1.5 <Col N="383" /> per cent for the milk, cereals and sugar sectors and 3.25 per cent for sheepmeat and are worth about £30 million to the farm sector in a full year.  Throughout the negotiations I also demanded an adjustment of the green rate for beef to eliminate the remaining monetary gap of 2 per cent and this was conceded in the later stages of negotiations.  This concession is worth about £9 million in a full year and in addition to increasing export refunds and other support measures, it will have a beneficial impact on triggering access to intervention under the revised arrangements agreed earlier in the year. This green rate adjustment, together with the adjustment which took place on 27 February, will restore the Irish intervention trigger price to the level which applied before the reform of the beef regime at the beginning of this month. The green rate adjustments will come into effect at the start of the respective marketing years.</P>
    <P>I consider that the abolition of the negative Irish MCAs which have applied continually since 1986, and the agri-monetary adjustments for other member states is a significant step forward in restoring common price levels in the Community and in creating an appropriate environment for the abolition of all MCAs by 1992.</P>
    <P>In its price proposals the Commission had proposed shortening the intervention period and further price reductions through cutting the value of the monthly increments for cereals and related crops by 25 per cent and reducing the number of increments.  These increments are designed to offset the cost of storing cereals and delaying offers into intervention until later in the marketing year.  The Council agreed to limit the reduction to only 12.5 per cent and to leave the status quo continue as regards the number.  The Commission's proposals to reduce the intervention period from 8 months to 5 months over the next two years was unacceptable to Council and agreement was eventually reached to reduce the period by one month.  The Council also agreed that cereals can be offered to intervention <Col N="384" /> at up to 15 per cent moisture content without any penalty in the form of a reduction of the buying-in price as proposed by the Commission at an earlier stage of negotiations &mdash; without this agreement the maximum moisture content would have fallen to 14.5 per cent from the present 15.5 per cent.  The Commission's original proposals on intervention would have involved losses of £7 million for the Irish cereals sector but the green rate adjustment and the concessions secured during the negotiations have virtually eliminated these potential losses.  There will, however, be a reduction of about 3 per cent in cereal support figures for 1989/90 arising from the effect of the stabiliser decisions last year but this reduction is cut to 1.5 per cent in the case of Irish producers as a result of the January green rate adjustment.</P>
    <P>The Commission agreed to report to the Council on how the set-aside system might be improved and how the administrative difficulties associated with the co-responsibility levy might be eliminated. This opens the prospect of improving the arrangements to control cereal production and hence limit the likelihood of the threshold being exceeded.  In addition I will, of course, continue to press in the GATT negotiations for more balanced trading arrangements between cereals and cereals substitutes.</P>
    <P>I opposed the proposal to cut support prices for sugar by 5 per cent as did the majority of member states.  Agreement on a 2 per cent cut was eventually reached but when account is taken of the effect of the levies the reduction in the case of sugar beet is reduced to 1.7 per cent.  In Ireland's case this reduction is more than offset by the 1.5 per cent green rate devaluation on 1 January last and the further 1.5 per cent devaluation which will come into effect on 1 July 1989.</P>
    <P>Following repeated requests from some other colleagues and myself in the recent prices negotiations an adjustment of the milk co-responsibility levy system <Col N="385" /> was agreed which was not originally proposed by the Commission.  In the disadvantaged areas the levy will be reduced to zero for all producers while in other areas a levy of 1 per cent will apply to those producing under 12,800 gallons and of 1.5 per cent for other producers.  This adjustment is worth about £10 million to Irish producers in a full year.  As an offsetting compensatory measure the butter intervention price will be reduced by 2 per cent but in current market circumstances this support price reduction should have a minimal knock-on effect on market prices.</P>
    <P>There was agreement that this would be the first stage in a process leading to the dismantlement of the levy and that there would be a further stage in the price package next year.</P>
    <P>In response to pressure from my French and German colleagues and myself to create an additional quota reserve to provide quotas for development and other priority farmers, the Commission has undertaken to prepare a report on the market situation and the conditions affecting such categories before 31 July and to submit any appropriate proposals to the Council.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the decisions to be taken on foot of this report will be another step in the action taken to meet the difficulties of small scale and other producers with special quota difficulties.</P>

      <P>The only provision in Community regulations prior to 1987 which referred to the position of small scale producers in regard to the sale or lease of quotas gave discretionary powers to member states to clawback all or part of quotas transferring with land.  Where such provisions were availed of, the quotas clawed back had to be added to national reserves for distribution to the priority category producers.  I invoked those powers in introducing the Irish clawback scheme in December 1987.</P>

      <P>1988 saw the first increase in the breeding herd since the introduction of the milk super-levy system in 1984.

Low cow and heifer slaughterings in 1989 would suggest that the increase in the breeding herd is continuing.</P>

      <P>Employment in agriculture accounts for nearly 14 per cent of the workforce which is quite high by EC standards where the figure is closer to 8 per cent.  Some decline may therefore be anticipated but traditional agriculture will continue to play an important role in providing employment.  In this context, the <i>National Development Plan</i> contains a number of measures to sustain employment levels in the agricultural and rural economy involving expenditing of £1.4 billion over the next five years, of which close to £0.7 billion will be provided by the EC.  Additional resources will be provided for on-farm investment, an increase in headage payments, and diversification of production.  The national <Col N="392" /> plan envisages additional financial support for the IDA/Department of Agriculture and Food strategy for the food and drink industry, which provides for job creation of the order of 5,000 new jobs.  the plan also provides for investment in rural tourism.  The experience gained from the operation of the integrated rural development pilot programme will be built upon to launch initiatives on a wider scale which will assist in the provision of jobs and wealth creation in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>In addition to these measures which will be assisted from the FEOGA Guidance Fund, agriculture and the rural economy in general will benefit from measures in the plan which will be assisted by the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 to 109 inclusive together.</P>
      <P>Control measures designed to combat abuses of the disability benefit scheme are a feature of the administration of the scheme.  All claims are subject to a range of checks and in particular many thousands of claims are examined each year to determine whether there are any irregularities arising from concurrent working and claiming of benefit.  These investigations are an ongoing aspect of control activity and prosecutions are taken where warranted.</P>
      <P>One aspect of the control measures involves the issue of questionnaires to a proportion of employers.  The employer is asked to indicate periods of absence from work due to incapacity on the part of a particular employee.  The general issue of questionnaires to all employers is not necessary and would be disproportionately wasteful of Department resources.  Systematic surveys of particular firms are also undertaken from time to time.  This involves a check of the disability benefit claims of employees against attendance records.  Broadly the approach is to combine a certain amount of random checking with particularly targeted examinations directed at areas which are perceived to be at risk.  It is a most cost effective and efficient approach which ensures the best use of the Department's resources and also does not unduly constitute a burden on employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="401" /> The Department is aware that some employers dismissed employees following on investigations into concurrent working and claiming.  This action is taken entirely without any consultation with or pressure from my Department.  I have a duty to ensure that beneficiaries of the scheme receive their entitlements and equally that abuse is appropriately dealt with.  I cannot comment on any subsequent or consequent action taken by third parties.</P>
    <P>The Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, provides recourse for employees who claim that they have been unfairly dismissed by laying down criteria by which dismissals are judged to be unfair and by providing an adjudication system and redress for an employee whose dismissal is found to be unjustified.  Any employee who feels that he or she has been unfairly dismissed may have recourse to the provisions of that legislation.  However, it is a matter entirely outside the remit of my Department.</P>
    <P>There are no figures available in the Department to show the proportion of the difference between Irish absentee rates and British absentee rates which can be accounted for by claiming disability benefit while at work.  It is worth noting, however, that there has been a significant change in the number of persons making disability benefit claims over the past few years.  For example, in 1981 in excess of 290,000 persons made claims for disability benefit whereas in 1988 the number was just over 180,000.  This illustrates very clearly the dramatic improvements which have been brought about by the whole range of measures undertaken over the past few years by the Department to control abuse, deal with fraud and generally cope with the question of appropriate access to the scheme.</P>
    <P>In 1986 an amnesty from prosecution for those who admitted to existing or earlier irregularities in relation to the social welfare system was introduced. However, only a handful of individuals applied under its terms in relation to disability benefit.  The approach was not particularly successful and there are no proposals to repeat it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>Where applications for export credit insurance are referred for ministerial consideration and decision, this arises only because of the nature or size of the contract or the degree of risk, which includes the country risk, involved.  This system of referral has been the procedure since the very commencement of the insurance schemes in 1971, being considered necessary from the viewpoint of prudent insurance practice and the need to safeguard the Exchequer's interest.  It has been operated by all Ministers for Industry and Commerce since the schemes began.</P>
      <P>In 1987 the broad operational framework between the Minister and the Insurance Corporation of Ireland was formalised in greater detail by way of updated agency agreement between both parties with a view to meeting the increasing volume of business covered and the wish by both sides for greater clarity and certainty in operational arrangements.  In this context, the system of referral was also formalised on the basis of its operational form up to then.  The agreement involved no new decisions on individual countries.</P>
      <P>Within the traditional framework for referral which continued, therefore, to operate in 1987 no decisions were taken in that year involving referral to the Minister in respect of any additional countries.</P>
      <P>The decision that all applications for cover in respect of Iraq should be referred for ministerial consideration was taken in 1983 and not in 1987.  It has remained the practice since.</P>
