    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will outline the plans he has for the development of a network of family history services throughout Ireland in order to ensure that Irish records of births, deaths, gravestone inscriptions and records of land holdings are used fully by modern information technology to make information on ancestry available to people throughout the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the Government's programme to expand the tourism industry, I identified better genealogical services as an important element in that programme.  For that purpose I established in 1988 the Task Force on Roots, Genealogy and Tourism to advise on and arrange for better and more co-ordinated genealogical services throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force which consisted of all relevant bodies and is chaired by an officer of my Department has now considered in detail the various aspects of the provision of improved genealogical services in Ireland.  As a result, a central <Col N="1586" /> consultancy service on roots tracing was provided in the Genealogical Office in 1989 to direct Irish people and visitors to the most appropriate sources of information on tracing their ancestors.  This service has been highly successful as measured by the public use made of it.</P>
    <P>The task force is now preparing detailed proposals for the development of a network of genealogical centres using a computerised database of genealogical records.  It will involve many groups and organisations both in the public and private sectors.  When the exact requirements, including costs, are identified precise plans will be formulated for the development and promotion of the improved and expanded national genealogical service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the National Heritage Council has submitted a report to him on the Botanic Gardens, Dublin 9; the recommendations contained in the report; and the action the Government intend to take to implement the recommendations other than the steps already announced by the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the National Heritage Council to carry out an appreciation of the National Botanic Gardens and they submitted their report to me on 25 October 1989.  Their principal recommendations relate to ministerial responsibility for the gardens and to strengthen the scientific, horticultural and amenity roles of the gardens.  The merits of these recommendations will now be fully considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he will make available and publish a copy of the report which he has received from the National Heritage Council? Would the Taoiseach agree that the Botanic Gardens are an important national asset as part of our historic heritage? Would he agree that currently the gardens are in an extreme state of dilapidation with regard to the various greenhouses, other than the Turner greenhouses for which works have now been commissioned, and that unless immediate remedial works are carried out other greenhouses within the gardens are going to reach a state of disrepair which will leave them in a condition which is irretrievable?  Can the Taoiseach indicate what steps he proposes to take to deal with that particular problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be the practice to publish reports of that kind but I can assure the Deputy that the recommendations will now be favourably considered.  They relate to strengthening the scientific, horticultural and amenity roles of the gardens.  We hope to get on with the work of improving the situation. The first step was to have the National <Col N="1588" /> Heritage Council look at the whole situation and advise us and that is now being done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that in the context of the various works that require to be undertaken in the gardens the social employment scheme could make a contribution in providing the manpower to undertake these works?  Would the Taoiseach consider making an approach to the Federation Workers Union of Ireland who have blocked the use of the scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that there are other glasshouses in the Botanic Gardens some of which are in such a poor state of repair that they have ceased to be in use?  Is the Taoiseach equally aware that 40,000 books and journals worth in excess of £8 million are currently dispersed to a variety of offices in the Botanic Gardens?  Is he aware that a herborium consisting of 750,000 individual dried specimens is distributed among three small bedrooms in a house?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we leave Question No. 4, I might mention that a fortnight ago I had four questions to the Taoiseach which he transferred to other Ministers. I have subsequently had correspondence with you on the matter.  I withdrew the questions from those Ministers last week and resubmitted them to the Taoiseach, with another question asking what criteria he uses when transferring questions. The four questions are not on the Order Paper and I presume there is correspondence somewhere for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly in order to raise the matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I received a letter from you this morning which states that the Taoiseach has no responsibility to the Dáil in relation to the criteria he uses for transferring questions.  It seems extraordinary that you say you have no responsibility as to whether the Taoiseach answers or not and the Taoiseach says he has no responsibility to tell the House why he transfers questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have striven to be as helpful to the Deputy as is humanly <Col N="1591" /> possible in this matter, both privately and publicly in the House.  I have nothing more to add.  If there is another way you want to deal with it, please do so, but you may not challenge my ruling in this fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to challenge your ruling but I do propose to raise it.  The Taoiseach is quoted in the newspapers over a period of months as having dismissed a long standing public servant and he will not answer in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want any misapprehensions to get abroad about this matter.  In regard to transferring questions, I follow exactly the same precedent as all my predecessors.  The record shows that I have answered infinitely more questions than my immediate predecessor, Deputy Garret FitzGerald.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is totally irrelevant. The Taoiseach knows he did not answer more questions.  There were four questions down because there were four party leaders in the last Dáil.  There was only one Opposition leader when Deputy FitzGerald was Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach gave one answer to four questions.  He has answered far fewer questions than Deputy FitzGerald.</P>

      <P>My main aim during the Irish Presidency of the EC will be to promote a new and invigorated approach to nuclear safety and radiation protection.  The establishment of an independent nuclear inspection force will, of course, be a major concern, but I will also be attempting to ensure that a much stronger line is taken on Community involvement and responsibility in nuclear matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the inspection force which the Minister describes, is it a minimum requirement of the Minister that such an inspection force will have the power to enter sites of particular countries at will, given that some of the countries involved are trying to resist such a notion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated that it is my intention to bring this whole area of nuclear safety on to the agenda during the Irish Presidency.  It would not be proper at this stage to go into greater detail as to the mechanisms.  I am anxious to obtain a commitment on the part of other member countries to a greater degree of two-way nuclear safety and <Col N="1593" /> agreement ultimately on the establishment of some form of monitoring authority which would be free to carry out inspections.  We are quite a long way from achieving that at present.  The Energy Council of which I will be President from 1 January, is not the council directly responsible in this area but because of my ministerial responsibilities here I will be taking an active part in ensuring that the other councils with more direct involvement and responsibility, such as the General Affairs Council, will bring forward these matters.  We will use our position during the Presidency to achieve this.  It is the intention of other Government Ministers who have a role to play in this to advance matters at their meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister does not want to say very much but I should like an assurance that we will not be talking about a limp body which effectively will be overseeing only the activities of the domestic radiological inspectorates in various countries.  That would be very little advance.  Has he had discussions with either the French or the British, who are the people mainly standing in the way of progress in this area, in order to prepare himself for his Presidency?</P>

Obviously I will not be able to see them all but I hope to see as many as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>It was acknowledged when Coillte were established on 1 January this year that, given the age profile of the transferred forests and their current and prospective timber production, the new company would not break even for a number of years.  For this reason the Forestry Act, 1988, included financial provisions relating to both current and capital expenditure which would allow some Exchequer funding of the company to continue for a time.</P>
      <P>This funding is limited so as to encourage the company both to introduce efficiencies and to make use of their commercial mandate.  It takes into account both an increasing annual planting target and growing revenue from timber sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister introduced the Coillte Teoranta Bill in the House we were given to understand that the arrangements made for the transfer in the lead-in period would be fully financed.  However, it now seems that Coillte have a cash flow problem which does not seem to indicate that even the initial year was covered.  Have the cash flow difficulties been ironed out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no unforeseen difficulties in regard to Coillte's cash flow. My Department are in constant contact with the company and I am satisfied that their financial situation will be reasonably provided for under the arrangements already mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that contractors have engaged in the harvesting of timber throughout this year and that they had forward contracts with the company?  However, they were told four or five weeks ago to cease work as the company did not have the cash, which <Col N="1595" /> seems to be contrary to what the Minister said.  Will he please explain this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to accept that Coillte has been established as a commercial State-sponsored body and it is our intention that the company would be allowed to operate commercially as freely as possible.  There will not be unnecessary interference at ministerial level in their day to day operations as it is not my wish, or indeed my role, to interfere in that way.  I am not aware of any cash flow difficulties being experienced by Coillte.  As the Deputy will appreciate, my Department and I are in constant contact with Coillte and any difficulties would be made clear to us without any delays.  There is no indication of that type of difficulty arising and commercial decisions that Coillte are required to make from day to day and week to week are a matter for the board and the management.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that Coillte Teoranta must operate on a commercial basis but, given the historical role of the forestry industry as a back-up in deprived areas for the provision of employment and industry, is the Minister aware that because of cash flow difficulties Coillte Teoranta are at present rationalising and closing down a number of their nursery operations and centralising them on the east coast?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will realise that there could be circumstances in which it would be good commercial practice to rationalise and I do not see it as something the Deputy should feel obliged to criticise.  The Deputy agreed that Coillte have a commercial remit and that they must operate in the commercial world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister <Col N="1596" /> ensure that Coillte operate in a cost effective manner?  For instance, I am given to understand that the cost of planting an acre or a hectare by Coillte is greatly in excess of the cost of planting the same acre or hectare in the private sector. Indeed, it has been suggested to me that it could be double the cost.  Is the Minister concerned that this might be the case and, if so, will he take any steps to ensure that this body will operate in a fully cost effective and efficient manner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very anxious to ensure that Coillte operate in the most cost effective way possible to ensure that their operation is commercially profitable. It is my concern that any practices which might need to be attended to, which might be deemed to be other than cost effective, should be dealt with by the company.  The Deputy can be assured that Coillte, who only commenced operations on 1 January, have been successful to date and they will have my full support in seeking to achieve the most efficient and cost effective methods available.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister undertake to make financial support available to Coillte to tide them over the period before they will receive revenue from their timber stock?  If he made such a commitment, has he honoured it? Will he agree that it is not fair to say that this is Coillte's commercial decision if the financial support on which they expected to operate is not forthcoming as expected?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Forestry Act, 1988, made provision to enable the Minister to give capital grants, grants for current expenditure and working capital to Coillte to enable them to find their feet and to support them financially during the period until they achieved their commercial objective of making a profit, which it is planned to do in a number of years.  They are on target and substantial sums have been made available to Coillte by the Exchequer in 1989.  They received a capital grant of £15 million, a current <Col N="1597" /> grant of £3.855 million, a special grant to cover stamp duty liability of £5.75 million and agency payments of £1.059, making a total amount to Coillte of £25,654,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will leaving Coillte Teoranta short in terms of cash flow make them excessively reliant on institutional commercial borrowings, which will inevitably concentrate on the maturing end of the timber cycle, thereby endangering something that was specified as socially desirable when the Act was passed, a full timber cycle commitment by Coillte Teoranta?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the argument that Coillte have been left short of capital or funding.  I am not aware of any requirement on the part of the board or the management in regard to cash flow problems.  The Deputy should accept that this is a new company which are being helped by the Exchequer in their initial years and that they are proceeding satisfactorily in carrying out the task which this House has given to them.  I know that all Members fully support the establishment of Coillte and will wish them every success in their endeavours.  The House can be assured that I will carefully take account of the development and the requirements of Coillte and assist them in whatever way possible within the constraints that apply to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>On 30 June 1989 agreements were concluded between the Minister for Energy on the one hand and Tara Exploration and Development Company Limited and Tara Mines Limited on the other in respect of sale of the State's 25 per cent shareholding in the latter company and in respect of the State's royalty entitlement of 4.5 per cent of the profits of the company as computed by the Revenue Commissioners for corporation profits tax purposes.  The shareholding was purchased by Tara Exploration and Development Company Limited and the royalty entitlement was bought out by Tara Mines Ltd.  The total consideration for the elements of value being sold was $50 million, of which $16.1 million was deemed to be in full and final discharge of all past and future royalties due to the State.</P>
      <P>The figure of $16.1 million was not arrived at through a year by year apportionment of the company's royalty liabilities and a figure in respect of the sum payable in respect of 1988 or any other year is not, therefore, available.</P>

      <P>On what basis were future royalties calculated in respect of the $16 million?  I cannot even understand in any detail how past royalties were calculated. Can the Minister tell the House how future royalties were calculated to the end of the relevant period without there being any idea of how much ore will be extracted, what profits will be made or anything of that nature?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department themselves were involved in the calculations. But, in order to assist them in arriving at the figure, they had the advice of NCB Corporate Finance.  Indeed, prior to the negotiations taking place, NCB valued the State shareholding at approximately $30 million and the State's royalty entitlement at approximately £11 million.  There were other intangibles with regard to value, that is, according to the Minister, certain restrictive rights with his shareholding and the enhancement of his shareholding in the event that Tara acquired the Bula ore body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1599" /> The technical and financial advisers examined the position with regard to the extent of the ore, its value and the State's rights under the existing agreement and arrived at a figure which is considered to have been satisfactory from the State's point of view, particularly in view of the previous value put on it and also in view of other purchases made in that area.  For instance, Outukumpu paid Canadian mining interests 90 million US dollars in February 1986 for their 100 per cent holding in Tara Exploration which gave them 75 per cent control of Tara Mines. If one takes that figure into consideration then one sees that the price of 50 million US dollars for 25 per cent of the company obtained by the State here compares very favourably with the deal accepted by the Canadian interest, which included international mining companies such as Northgate Exploration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I do not see that at all as being a favourable deal. The intent of my question has not to do with whether the deal was favourable or not, although I should be interested to know whether the new Minister assuming office really thought it was a good deal. I will confine my supplementary questions to the question of royalties and royalty payments.  On what basis did the Government or the Minister take a decision that no future generations, nothing in the future, would ever have to be paid by this company either by way of profits or royalties?  Was consideration ever given to altering, by legislation if necessary, the terms of the contract with Tara to charge royalties on ore tonnage extracted rather than on the ridiculous percentage of corporate profits?  I have raised this matter every six months since 1983.  I have been told repeatedly that the matter was so complex nobody could deal with it.  Was consideration ever given to altering the system of royalties to royalties payable on every tonne of ore extracted?  Would that not be a more suitable arrangement?</P>

There is the view that a reasonable deal was done for the State at an opportune time when zinc prices were high but it is not likely that they will remain high continuously.  In the circumstances the State seems to have got a fairly reasonable return in the matter and, as the Deputy knows, intends to put the money to very good use elsewhere in the State.</P>

In the light of the fact that less than one-third of the mine is used at this stage would he agree that the notion of throwing away all the remaining royalties for just an additional $8 million seems, to the layman, to be an extraordinary capitulation?

I am not privy to any other information that might have been taken into consideration by the then Government in arriving at a decision.  The amount of royalties outstanding and the possible payment of royalties to the State in the future arising from mining activities by this company were all taken into account in arriving at the figure agreed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 29 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>Four exploration wells have been drilled to date in 1989, all in the Celtic Sea.  Three exploration companies were involved.  One further exploration well is expected to be commenced shortly by one of these companies.  Three of the wells drilled have been plugged and abandoned as dry holes.  One well drilled by Marathon discovered gas which flowed on test at the rate of 29 million cubic feet per day.  An appraisal well to determine the extent of the reserves present has also been drilled.</P>
      <P>An evaluation of the gas find has been carried out by Marathon who have considered it sufficiently encouraging to commence preparation of a development plan for the field.  Preliminary discussions on this are currently taking place with my Department.</P>
      <P>I expect that at least four exploration wells will be drilled in 1990.  I am hopeful that additional exploration wells may also be undertaken but the drilling of any of these will depend in the first instance on the evaluation of seismic surveys being completed by certain companies.  The drilling of any appraisal wells will depend on the success of one or more of the exploration wells.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of encouraging further exploration, my Department is engaged in discussions with various oil exploration companies on an ongoing basis, and it avails of these opportunities to promote further interest in our offshore.  Promotion of technical data is also carried out and made available to interested companies.  Scientific studies on the geology of the different basins in our offshore are also undertaken and published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister to indicate to the House the estimated reserves in the Marathon discovery which he indicated flowed at 29 million cubic feet per day?  May I further ask him whether he is satisfied with the level of exploration, in particular for oil, and does he feel that some concession to bring <Col N="1604" /> home the oil discoveries already identified but thought to be non-marginally commercial should be made by the Government in order to establish Ireland as an oil producing country rather than a prospective territory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not free to disclose the estimated quantity in the Marathon second find.  The matter is still at discussion stage between the company and the State and it would not be appropriate or correct from a commercial point of view for me to do so.  Naturally, I am not satisfied with the level of exploration for oil, and this is due to a number of factors. As the Deputy knows a lot of wells have been drilled and the results to put it mildly, have not been very exciting so far.  These shows of oil have been in areas where it would be quite expensive to extract the oil.  Happily, the price of fuel oil internationally is considered to be low at present and this affects the economics of large investments to extract oil where it is expensive to bring it ashore.  It would be my hope and wish to attract continued exploration programmes for oil as well as for gas.  My predecessor introduced new terms which are considered to be very reasonable and compare very favourably with the terms available in north-west Europe.  At this point in time I do not see the need to revise the terms but I do not mind telling the Deputy that I will certainly keep an open mind on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not suggest to the Minister that he should revise the terms, which I do not think are very satisfactory from an Irish point of view, but I would ask him to consider the notion of a first home concession for oil so that we could establish ourselves as a producing country.  I think much of the difficulty lies in the fact that no commercial oil has been brought ashore and this results in Ireland being struck off the map so far as prospectors are concerned. Perhaps a first home concession, which should be very cheap to grant, might alter this position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I am very <Col N="1605" /> anxious to do whatever I can to encourage higher levels of exploration and any suggestions or ideas which are made in the House or elsewhere will certainly be seriously considered by me and I will have them fully examined.  As I have said, I will keep a very open mind in relation to this whole area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me as a false argument, because it is not the price of oil which is relevant now as to whether or not it should be explored for; it is the price when it comes ashore.  What the Minister really needs to determine is the price in five years' time.  That is what dictates whether or not exploration should be carried out at present, and not the price of oil now.  Is that not correct?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons which is understood to be valid as to why some of the oil shows which have appeared off our coasts have not been followed up by the companies is that it is not economical to do so in present circumstances.  As well as that, the technology is not yet there to take it from the depths and the locations where it has been found.</P>

Of course, that is provided that the discussions which are taking place come to a fruitful conclusion.  It is dangerous to limit oneself to a timescale but the House is entitled to know, and I am prepared to share this information, that I hope that the discussions we have undertaken with one company in particular will lead to a successful conclusion.

Is it the Government's intention to maintain for the people of the State the controlling interest in Whitegate for strategic <Col N="1609" /> reasons?  Is that a primary concern of the Government in any negotiations?  Are active discussions taking place with the three interested parties with specific reference to the statement by the Taoiseach, following his meeting with President Gorbachev, that they were interested in the Whitegate refinery?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 23 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The total area of land under forest at 31 December 1988, was 405, 671 hectares, that is 342,852 hectares owned by the State and 62,819 hectares owned privately.</P>
      <P>Because of the amount of detail sought, I propose to forward the information to the Deputies within the week on the location, species and age of planted areas, and details of commercial and non-commercial areas of land handed over to Coillte on 1 January 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forest estate transferred to Coillte <Col N="1612" /> on 1 January last, included 1,642 hectares leased from Bord na Móna and a reserve of approximately 14,000 hectares of land suitable for planting.</P>
    <P>The annual national afforestation targets set out in the National Plan are to double the rate from the 1988 figure of 15,000 hectares to 30,000 hectares by 1993.  The private sector is expected to contribute to this target by an increase in planting from 7,500 hectares this year to 15,800 hectares in 1993.  Coillte's planting rate is likewise expected to increase from this year's figure of 10,000 hectares.</P>
    <P>Coillte's mandate under the Forestry Act, 1988, is to carry on the business of forestry and related activities on a commercial basis and in accordance with efficient silvicultural practices, but they also have a duty to have due regard to the environmental and amenity consequences of their operations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his extensive reply but he did not indicate the state of the forest. There was an interest in private planting because it was expected that a semi-mature market would develop.  Has the Minister any idea of the quantities of semi-mature timber Coillte took into stock on 1 January 1989?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the considerable disquiet about the monoculture in our timber industry?  Is he aware that the pre-occupation with the various species of pine is causing extreme acidification of many of our rivers, particularly in his constituency, which is affecting fishing in those areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important not to exaggerate the position.  I am very conscious of the need to at all times follow an environmentally friendly policy.  It would not be my wish that any activities <Col N="1613" /> of Coillte or the State in relation to afforestation should in any way damage our environment.  It is clearly stated in the Acts in relation to afforestation projects that environmental considerations have to be carefully taken into account prior to decisions in relation to starting up planting operations.  I would be very anxious to have the scientific information the Deputy may have that can be substantiated made available to my Department.  He can be assured that if any evidence of that nature can be substantiated I will take whatever action is appropriate for me in order to ensure that we will not damage the environment through any activities of the forestry programme here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Industrial Development Authority periodically review the prospects for establishment of a zinc smelter in Ireland.  The most recent review in October 1987 concluded that a zinc smelter would not be viable. However, in view of improvements which have taken place in zinc prices and other factors relevant to the economics of a zinc smelter I am asking the IDA to carry out a further review of the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear the Minister is having a further review carried out.  Since the previous Minister failed to indicate in regard to the last review in 1987, would it be possible to get the basis on which the IDA carried out their assessment of viability?  This question was asked 18 months ago but the then Minister refused to answer it. <Col N="1614" /> Therefore I ask this Minister if he can tell us that.  Can he say if viability is on the basis that Rio Tinto Zinc decided it was not viable ten years before that, in other words there are smelters under-used in Europe and they need our ore for the smelters in Europe, therefore it is not viable for us to have a smelter for our own ore as it is needed elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I have examined this and I am reasonably satisfied that the decisions were based on detailed investigations carried out by the IDA and by Departments here based on what the Irish interest was.  They would not be overly influenced by what some major smelter company thought might be in their interest.  It would be wrong to imply that.  The IDA have done an excellent job, as any Minister for Energy will agree, going back over the years since ore was discovered here and since proposals were being made and continue to be made about the possibility of establishing a smelter.  It would not be wise to establish an industry here which was going to end up creating financial difficulties for the State.  Where there would be such a major financial investment it is important that in all the discussions that have taken place the State would have been involved.  The State would have been required to make a very substantial capital investment in any of the proposals that were brought forward previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State has a duty to ensure that an investment of this size should be one which had reasonable hopes of success and which would not lead the country into further difficulties.  The IDA have periodically reviewed the project down through the years.  As I said, the most recent major review was in October 1987.  That review indicated that the projections remained uneconomic because of low zinc metal price, unfavourable US$ exchange rate movements at that time and increases in labour costs.  The major changes in these factors which have taken place since that last IDA review have led me to decide it is time the IDA be asked to <Col N="1615" /> undertake another major review at this time because zinc prices have increased. They reached $2,000 per tonne in March but they have declined in recent weeks to about $1,600 per tonne and the $-punt exchange rate is reasonably favourable at present and in relative terms both electricity and labour costs have improved since the review was carried out in 1987.  Therefore, while indications at present may lead one to be more favourably disposed towards building a smelter, it should be stressed that the trends in the major factors affecting an investment decision of this size have to be analysed over the life span of this smelter, not just on conditions at present.  However, in view of the positive developments I have mentioned I intend to ask that a further major review be undertaken now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad it is being reviewed again, but I am worried about the type of review.  Will the Minister consider getting in touch with the IDA to ask them to consider in their review assessing the huge number of industrial jobs which could be developed as a result of having the processing of our ore here in order to manufacture various parts that can be made from it and exported?  Will that be considered as well as the financial viability of the smelter, in other words the value to the State as a whole?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course that would form a major part of any such review, but I think it would be wiser for me to await the IDA's recommendations.  The Deputy will be well aware that most of the existing smelter capacity in the world was constructed long before legitimate concerns about the environment were translated into new and more rigorous standards.  New smelter capacity would carry an additional investment burden to cater for these environment-related costs which would make their competitiveness in the short to medium term problematic. It is important that we get the up-to-date position and I will ask the IDA to give that.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to object to what is happening and what has happened at Sellafield.  In fairness to British Nuclear Fuels, the discharges which were the initial cause of concern there have dropped substantially.  The discharges are now at a very low level.  That has possibly been the result of the protest of the Irish Government and others in drawing the attention of the world to this problem. The reality is that because of the age of <Col N="1618" /> these nuclear power stations, it is legitimate for us to have concerns about the safety factors.  That is my primary concern. It would be the ideal situation for this country if this and a number of other nuclear plants in Great Britain were closed.  Such closure would eliminate the threat to the people living in this island in regard to their health and their future wellbeing.  The reality is that we are not in a position as of now to demand closure and expect to have the station closed tomorrow.  I am realistic enough to accept the practicalities on the ground but it is a very legitimate position for us to take, to have it as a policy that we want this station closed and to continue to avail of whatever opportunity is available to us to call for the closure of all these nuclear power stations, to bring pressure to bear on the British Government to do something about them also and to continue to express our concern because of the danger that would be involved in the event of an accident.  I stated in reply to an earlier Dáil question that our Presidency of the EC presents us with an opportunity to bring the whole question of nuclear safety to the surface and to give it a higher priority.  That would be very much part of Ireland's programme during its term of the Presidency and I, as Minister for Energy, will play a role in that as will other Ministers also.  I have no doubt that the Taoiseach, as President, will play a major role in it.</P>

      <P>A pillar of the Government's approach to Ireland's case is that legal action would be taken.  The Minister is now suggesting that this is not practicable at the moment.  What sudden change has occurred?  The previous Minister indicated to us in the House that he saw substance in the grounds presented by Greenpeace for a successful case to be taken.  What effectively has changed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In reality nothing has changed.  If I, as Minister for Energy, am <Col N="1619" /> satisfied that there is a case that can be sustained, then a case can be taken.  I could recommend to Government that a case be taken and the matter could be considered by Government but, having examined the evidence, having consulted the Attorney General and having carefully read the documentation sent to my Department by Greenpeace, it is quite clear that there would be no guarantee that a case, taken at present, on the type of evidence that is being put forward, would have any success.  It would be foolish of me, as Minister, to indicate that I would favour the taking of a case against the British authorities when I am not convinced on the evidence before me that the case would succeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the consultancy report commissioned by Government into the operations of Bord na Móna have been the subject of considerable discussions with the company. The implementation of specific measures, however, such as the recent decision to divide the company into separate solid fuel, milled peat and horticultural divisions is a matter for the commercial judgment of the board itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent board decisions, which <Col N="1620" /> included the restructuring of the company, are in line with the consultant's findings and with Government policy which continues to be that Bord na Móna should operate in a commercial fashion and should structure themselves so as to increase their competitiveness in the marketplace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply does he feel that the present dependence on the ESB contract for almost three-quarters of the board's output is a commercial basis for operation? Has he proposals, beyond those in the very poor Bill presented to this House for further development of Bord na Móna into activities other than the electricity contract?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The electricity contract is something which is under review.  The Bill, as the Deputy is aware, is merely an enabling Bill to give legislative authority to Bord na Móna to undertake other commercial activities, to free them from the constraints under which they have to operate under present legislation.  I do not think it would be fair to be too critical of the Bill because it is positive in giving Bord na Móna the opportunity to get involved in activities which they are precluded from engaging in under existing legislation.  Their involvement in other commercial activities would spread their portfolio and enable them to get into profit-making activities which would be related to their turf production.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister if he agrees that the longer this dispute is allowed run the more intractable a solution will become and whether, notwithstanding the fact that there is no machinery in place to handle this kind of dispute, precisely because it is obstructed by his Department, that there is no obstacle either in the scheme or legally that prevents the parties voluntarily agreeing to the arbitration process being set in motion?  An independent arbitrator could be mutually agreed by both parties. Does the Minister accept that it is a major step for the union to have committed themselves in advance to using an independent arbitrator subject to the condition that the outcome would be binding?  Can the Minister who has ultimate responsibility not agree to facilitate both parties in this dispute with such an independent arbitrator on the terms I have outlined?</P>

      <P>I have reservations about the proposals for dealing with No. 1.  My <Col N="1710" /> colleagues and I spent some time examining the Bill in question yesterday and today.  We have also examined the implications of a judgment issued yesterday dealing with the issues covered by this Bill.  As a result, we have a number of amendments to propose to the Bill.  The issues involved are somewhat complex and I do not believe that they can be adequately dealt with in the space of two hours this evening as proposed by the Government.  I would like, therefore, to propose that either we do not provide on the Order of Business that we conclude all Stages of the Bill by 10.30 tonight or that in the interval between Second Stage and the commencement of Committee Stage there should be a further meeting of the Whips when we have seen from the Second Stage debate what the various concerns are so that we could make a decision at that point, if necessary, to extend the amount of time available for discussion of Committee Stage of the Bill.  We want to be sure in passing this Bill, with its implications for the main Bill, that we get it right this time.  I assure the House that it is not my intention to be obstructive or to delay the passage of the Bill unnecessarily.  My main concern is to get it right.</P>

      <P>In relation to legislation on the Order Paper &mdash; which the Government have indicated they want taken this session &mdash; and in view of the fact that the Government have now agreed to establish two special committees would the Taoiseach consider, along with the Minister for the Environment, the establishment of a special committee to expedite the provisions of the Building Control Bill &mdash; now seriously delayed &mdash; whose provisions give effect to building regulations, including the statutory fire regulations?  The Labour Party would be anxious to facilitate the passage of this Bill.  Now that the Government have agreed other legislation in relation to two special committees I would invite the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>The motions before the House today arise from proposals which were agreed recently by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  While these proposals are primarily the concern of the Opposition parties, the Government nevertheless support them on the basis that they are fair to all sides of the House and have the support of the vast majority of its Members.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the motions is to allocate Priority Questions and Private Members' Time between the various Opposition parties on the basis of their numerical strength in the Dáil.  They were designed by CPP to reflect the fact that Fine Gael have 55 Deputies, while Labour and The Workers' Party have 15 and seven Deputies, respectively.</P>
    <P>The motion on Priority Questions provides that out of every ten questions put down, Fine Gael will be able to nominate seven, Labour two and The Workers' Party one.  The rota is arranged over a 15-day cycle so as to ensure that The Workers' Party will have an opportunity of putting down a Priority Question to each member of the Government over a period of time.  The motion also proposes that the sequence in which the questions will appear on the Order Paper will be decided by lottery and that Priority Questions will be taken before lottery questions, but after questions addressed to the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The motion on Private Members' Business provides that over a period of 11 weeks, Fine Gael will nominate the business on eight occasions, Labour twice and The Workers' Party once.  It is proposed that these new arrangements will <Col N="1725" /> remain in force initially up to the 1990 Easter recess.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, CPP agreed on these allocations strictly on the basis of the number of seats which each party hold in the Dáil.  While Private Members' Time and Priority Questions were only allocated on a proportional basis for the first time in the last Dáil, this is not a new concept to the House. The committees have always been constituted so as to reflect the relative strengths of the parties participating in them, while Members are elected to the Dáil in the first place on a system of proportional representation.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise at this point that these proposals do not reduce in any way the amount of time being allocated either to Private Members' Time or to Question Time.  Opposition Deputies will continue to have available to them the same amount of time which they always had.  What the motions seek to do is simply to organise that time in a reasonable manner.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress again that the Government have no direct input into the matter.  Our position is that we are prepared to support the proposals which are fairest to all sides and in deciding our stance we have taken account of the wishes of the vast majority of Deputies in the House, as well as the deliberations of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>Since the Dáil resumed on 24 October last, the Government have introduced a number of procedural reforms, all of which will improve the workings of the House generally, but some of which I am sure will be of particular benefit to individual Deputies.  The Dáil has already formally requested CPP to recommence their work in preparing proposals for televising proceedings.  The working group, which was established for this purpose, are also examining Dáil procedures and will be proposing reforms, where they are considered necessary.  Already, arising from a suggestion which I put to the working group, a new Adjournment Debate procedure has been introduced which, in my opinion, makes that debate <Col N="1726" /> more relevant.  In the past, the half-hour period set aside for the debate was not often fully utilised.  I am sure Deputies will agree that the two 15-minute debates which we now have every day is a far more productive arrangement.</P>
    <P>I am sure that over the next few months, the working group will be bringing forward other procedural reforms which will benefit Members on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>The Government accept CPP's opinion that the present proposals represent the fairest way of distributing Private Members' Time and Priority Questions among the Opposition parties.  In view of this, I recommend the motions to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be looking at them but I can assure you I am not inviting them.  The arrangements we have before us are based on the respective strengths of the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and The Workers' Party in this House.  I should like to point out that under the arrangements provided for Priority Questions, Fine Gael will have 69 per cent of the questions in each cycle.  We <Col N="1727" /> have 71 per cent of the seats of the parties in Opposition and I regard that arrangement as being scrupulously fair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>For Private Members' Time, for example, the proposed cycle will give Fine Gael just under 73 per cent of the total time for 71 per cent of the Opposition party seats.  I regard that also as being scrupulously fair.  I should like to point out to the House that my colleague and Whip, Deputy Jim Higgins, has bent over backwards to ensure that the arrangements are fair and that the other parties are facilitated by them.  We have gone as far as we can to accommodate the wishes of other parties.</P>
      <P>As I have said, these arrangements are scrupulously fair and should not, therefore, be used as an excuse by anybody in this House for making very thinly veiled threats to disrupt the business of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the issues we are debating now in a very brief debate are ones which do not normally merit debate in the House.  Notwithstanding that, they are issues of the most fundamental importance.  The Opposition parties have little enough chance to impact on legislation and the use of Questions and Private Members' Time are two key avenues open to parties in Opposition to portray their policies, to affect the way the Government are handling affairs and to bring issues of public importance on the floor of this House.</P>
      <P>In relation to the two motions before the House now, a considerable amount of debate was involved in those motions with each individual party in Opposition obviously approaching the ordering of a motion on the basis of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Excluding The Workers' Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at least having a reasonable percentage of time for their <Col N="1728" /> own party relative to their Dáil strength. That has always been the basis of motions of this sort.  In fact, the particular Standing Orders have been subject to change from time to time to reflect the strengths of the Opposition parties in this House.</P>
      <P>In relation to Private Members' Time, in particular, it is an important vehicle for parties in Opposition and maybe this debate will give us an opportunity to again look at how the Government react to Private Members' Time.  From my recollection, in recent years the only legislation which was accepted by the Government from the Opposition benches was the Judicial Separation Act.</P>
      <P>It is normal practice in many other parliaments that a proportion of Bills enacted come from Opposition Deputies and, on occasions, from Government backbenchers.  The Labour Party have used their Private Members' Time, scarce as it has always been, to the optimum effect in recent years.  It was through Private Members' Time that we defended, and forced the Government to rethink the position on the National Social Services Board.  It was thanks to a Labour Party Private Members' motion that the board remains in existence.  It was Private Members' Time that was used to defend Barrington's Hospital and haemophiliacs who suffer from AIDS and to seek compensation for them.</P>
      <P>In the past the Government did not have much regard for motions from the Opposition benches except when they were forced into positions of being defeated.  Since this Coalition will probably always outnumber the Opposition, unless the two parties in coalition are forcibly wrenched apart by circumstances in the months and years to come, I appeal to them to think again on how they react to Private Members' Business.  They should think positively of the important contribution that can be made from outside the Government benches and to accept Private Members' legislation when it makes sense, when it is logical and when it is thought out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party put forward a different proposal in relation to the ordering <Col N="1729" /> of Priority Questions.  The proposal I put to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges was accepted by all parties in Opposition.  My proposal was that Fine Gael would have three Priority Questions on a daily basis, that the Labour Party would have two and that The Workers' Party would have one.  Unfortunately, the Government did not accept that proposal because it would have meant an extra three minutes in Private Members' Time.  I deeply regret that the Government could not have found it in their hearts to accept that.  Had they done so some of the rancour that has been expressed since that would have been avoided.  On reflection, the motions before us, inasmuch as they accurately reflect the relative strengths of all the parties in the Dáil, give fair play to each Member.  It is as individuals that we are elected to serve our constituencies in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to give one minute or so of my time to Deputy Garland, if I can manage to say what I have to say in the time available.  The Workers' Party consider these two motions to be an outrageous assault on the rights of our Deputies and the two motions will therefore be opposed in the strongest possible manner by our party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One motion seeks to change the rules with regard to Priority Questions so that The Workers' Party will only be entitled to ask a Priority Question every second day.  The other motion seeks to sanction the allocation of Private Members Time in such a way as to discriminate in a very blatant manner against The Workers' Party.  What is clear from these two motions, which have the approval of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, is that these three parties are conspiring to attempt to restrict the rights which The Workers' Party are entitled to as a Dáil group defined under Standing Order 89 &mdash; a status which we won fairly and squarely by having seven TDs returned in the June contest.  At a time when there is a widespread demand for Dáil reform to make the House more <Col N="1730" /> relevant and give Deputies a greater say, these motions are an insult.</P>
    <P>It is clear from a reading of Standing Order 37 on Parliamentary Questions and the Dáil debates when the original motion to establish the Priority Question system was introduced back on 28 May 1985, that it was never envisaged at any stage that a qualifying group would be excluded from the Priority Question system on certain days.  Indeed, it is worth quoting what the then Government Chief Whip, Deputy Seán Barrett, said in the debate.  Deputy Barrett explained that the Priority Question system was being introduced so that `groups in Opposition could ask the Minister or Ministers not more than five Priority Questions'.  Replying to the debate Deputy Barrett said:</P>
    <P>We were not trying to get at anybody. If The Workers' Party succeed at the next election in electing more than seven members they will have the right to participate in Priority Question time the same as anybody else.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy reads the motion he will find that the questions asked in Priority Question time rotate.  The largest party ask the first question, the next largest party in Opposition have the right to ask the second question and if there is a third party or group they are entitled to ask the third question. There is nothing loaded in favour of the major party or group in Opposition. All the Deputy has to do is persuade others who are Independents in the House to join with him in a group of seven and over ... to deal with Private Members Time and Questions in priority time.  That is all.  The alternative is to get more people elected.</P>
    <P>That quotation is from column 2406 of the Official Report of that date. However, in the same debate Deputy Mac Giolla, who spoke for The Workers' Party accurately forecast what was going to happen when he said, &ldquo;If we get more Deputies into the House the rules will change again&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Since The Workers' Party have been represented in this House we have made <Col N="1731" /> extensive and effective use of Dáil Questions to raise issues which are of concern to the people who elected us.  Proportionately we ask far more questions than any of the other parties.  We are always being reminded by the other parties that we have less than 10 per cent of the Opposition Deputies.  But, look at the ordinary oral Questions tabled to the Minister for Labour last week.  Of the total of 21, 11 came from The Workers' Party.  On the previous day one-third of all ordinary oral Questions to the Minister for Industry and Commerce came from The Workers' Party.</P>
    <P>The other parties seem to resent the effective use by The Workers' Party of Question Time.  They cannot interfere with ordinary Questions, which are anyway subject to the uncertainty of the lottery system, without restricting the rights of their own Deputies, so they are conspiring to change the rules on Priority Questions.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the allocation of Private Members Time.  Over the past eight years, time after time we looked for Private Members Time and were told to come back when we had seven TDs.  Now that the people have elected seven Workers' Party TDs we find it is proposed to allocate Private Members time in such a way as to severely disadvantage our party.</P>
    <P>I have to say that we are deeply angry and dismayed at the role of the Labour Party in all this.  Primarily due to our efforts over the past while significant progress had been made in developing co-operation between our two parties and the Left benefited generally from this in the last election.</P>

It is disgraceful and we will be opposing the two motions.  Of course, as always, we will abide by the Standing Orders of the House.

      <P>In the one minute I have at my disposal I want to say that when I was elected to the House I came here with the intention of playing a very full part in the work of the House and I have endeavoured to do so.  Since I came in here I have tabled a number of amendments to most of the Bills on Committee Stage.  I have had 50 or 60 Questions put down on the Order Paper.  Now I find when it comes to Priority Questions and Private Members' Bills, if I am here for the next five years I will not have a single Priority Question, a single motion or a single Bill.  I think that a gross negation of the democratic principles of this House.  I call upon this House to make the appropriate arrangements to allow me a little time in this area.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, at the outset, to say that we cannot have agreement among the Opposition parties but as a Government we will try to facilitate all parties where possible.  I thank the Deputies for their comments during the debate.  This present Government are and the last Dáil was very responsive to the needs of the Opposition parties in making time available for special debates.  This is despite the fact that the Government were committed to pushing through the House their own programme of legislative reforms.  Since late 1987, for example, we had no fewer than eight special debates at the request of the Opposition.  Deputy Howlin during his contribution complained that the Government were not prepared to extend Question Time by a few minutes in order to facilitate agreements between his party and The Workers' Party on the allocation of Priority Questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>We considered this matter but we decided that the extension, the main purpose of which was to mollify the two smaller Opposition parties, was not justified.  In deciding on this we took into account the fact that up to a few years ago the duration of Question Time was only one hour as compared to the hour and a quarter we now have.  We also took account of the rights of the individual Members of this House who are not permitted to participate in Priority Questions, as pointed out by Deputy Garland.</P>
      <P>Let me say that the Committee on Privileges and Practice have at all times given every consideration to bringing about a satisfactory solution to this problem.  We met on a few occasions and the outcome of those meetings was the motion we have before us in the House.  Let me also say I am a little surprised at the attitude of The Workers' Party to the proposals here this afternoon.  In the last Dáil when The Workers' Party had just four Members they complained they were not being recognised as a full party and sought to be given the same rights as those granted to parties defined by Standing Order No. 89.  They expected to participate in every major debate on the same basis as even the largest Opposition party.  Now that The Workers' Party have seven Members and are recognised as a party under the Standing Orders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1742" /> The purpose of this Bill is to deal with the situation that has arisen following a judgment of the Supreme Court on 2 November in which the court ruled that a health board does not have the necessary statutory authority to act as a &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; within the meaning of the Children Act, 1908.  The effect of this is that the health boards are no longer able to take into their care children who have been neglected, ill-treated or abused or who are otherwise at risk.</P>
    <P>When the Government became aware of the Supreme Court judgment it considered whether the Child Care Bill, 1988, which is before this House, should be rushed through as a matter of urgency. In view of the many complex and sensitive issues dealt within the 1988 Bill, the Government decided that this would be the wrong approach and that it would be better to introduce a short amending Bill to deal with the key point of the Supreme Court's ruling, that is that health boards do not have statutory authority to act as fit persons within the meaning of the Children Act, 1908.</P>
    <P>The Government believe that this approach offers the best prospect of urgently protecting the interests of a very vulnerable group of several hundred children who are in care under fit person orders.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court judgment and the earlier judgment of the court in the same case last July raise a number of important and complex issues which impact on the whole issue of child care proceedings.  It is, of course, crucial that the right balance be struck in these proceedings between the rights of parents and the rights of children.  The issues raised require detailed and meticulous consideration and the Government feel that this can best be done in the context of the Special Committee which is being set up to deal with the Committee Stage of the Child Care Bill, 1988.</P>
    <P>I might also point out that the 1988 Bill and a large number of amendments which I circulated in advance of the Supreme Court judgment last week deal with many <Col N="1743" /> of the issues raised in that judgment including the whole question of access by parents to children when they are in care. There are no simple answers to some of these issues, impinging as they do on very fundamental human and constitutional rights.  However, I am confident that the work of the special committee on the 1988 Bill will lead to an enlightened and balanced legislative framework.</P>
    <P>The existing law in relation to child care is contained primarily in the Children Act, 1908.  Briefly, that Act allows any person who believes that the health, safety or welfare of a child is in jeopardy to bring the matter before the District Court.  If, having considered the evidence, the Justice is satisfied that it is necessary in the child's interests to do so, he may order that the child be removed from the custody of his parents or guardians and be committed to the care of a relative or other &ldquo;fit person&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The expression &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; is defined in section 38 of the 1908 Act,</P>
    <P>In this Part of this Act unless the context otherwise requires, the expression &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; in relation to the care of any child or young person includes any society or body corporate established for the reception or protection of poor children or the prevention of cruelty to children.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that this definition is not exclusive.  It does not spell out who may and who may not act as a &ldquo;fit person&rdquo;. The only thing it does is to indicate that the expression &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; includes certain societies and other bodies involved in the area of child welfare.</P>
    <P>Following the establishment of the health boards in 1970, my Department obtained legal advice to the effect that health boards can act as fit persons for the purpose of taking deprived children into care.  It was considered that such work formed an integral part of the community care and social work services that were beginning to be built up under the health boards.  Increasingly, health boards got involved in dealing with child abuse and neglect, bringing cases before <Col N="1744" /> the court and offering themselves as fit persons.  This practice has been endorsed by successive Governments to the extent that the health boards are now recognised, in fact if not in law, as the State's child care and child protection agencies.</P>
    <P>From time to time, doubts were expressed by some lawyers and others about the legal authority of health boards to involve themselves in child care. However, the general view was, and is, that this is essential work which must be done in the interests of the children concerned and that the most appropriate agencies to perform it are the health boards.</P>
    <P>The question of the legal authority of health boards eventually came up for judicial consideration in the High Court in earlier proceedings in relation to the same case that was the subject of last week's Supreme Court judgment.</P>
    <P>In order to explain matters further, it is necessary for me to give some brief details of that case without, of course, revealing the identities of those involved. Briefly, the facts are that in November 1986 a child was placed in the care of a health board as a fit person following allegations that she had been sexually abused by her father.  Some months later the parents made a <i>habeus corpus</i> application in the High Court challenging the validity of the detention of their child on a number of grounds, including a claim that the health board's statutory powers did not include a power to act as a fit person.</P>
    <P>The High Court delivered its judgment on 15 July 1988 and in relation to that aspect of the application the Court held as follows:</P>
    <P>As to whether the (named) Health Board possesses the necessary statutory powers to act as a fit person, Section 6 (1) of the Health Act, 1970 (the 1970 Act) provides that a health board shall perform the functions conferred on it under the Act, and any other functions which immediately before its establishment, were performed by a local authority (other than as a sanitary authority) in the functional area of the <Col N="1745" /> health board in relation to the operation of services provided under or in connection with the administration of the enactments specified in subsection (2).  Among the functions which were performed by the local authority were functions in connection with the administration of Part I of the 1908 Act (concerning infant life protection) and Sections 2 and 3 of the Children (Amendment) Act, 1957.  These enactments are specified in Section 6 (2) at paragraph (g).  This, however, does not prevent the health board from carrying out other functions conferred on it under the 1970 Act connected with other parts of the 1908 Act which were not carried out by the local authority.</P>
    <P>Under Section 66 (2) of the 1970 Act, a health board shall make available without charge a health examination and treatment service for pupils attending a national school.</P>
    <P>It is under this section that the (named) Health Board claims to derive its power to take the child into care under the Section 24 Order.  In my opinion, if a child has suffered sexual abuse, her health is endangered and she is in need of treatment.  The provision of care is therefore within the broad description of a treatment service. If the health board is to provide an adequate service it is essential that it be involved either directly as a fit person or indirectly with the fit person nominated.  There is no reason a suitable employee of the health board should not be named as a fit person but if for any reason that person ceased to be employed by the health board or become incapacitated, another application would have to be made to the District Court for another person to be appointed.  There are, therefore, good reasons why the board itself should be appointed.  It would not seem wise that one of the actual foster parents should be named as this would identify the whereabouts of the child in a case where secrecy is deemed essential.</P>
    <P>For the above reasons I am satisfied that the District Justice had power to <Col N="1746" /> make the Order which he did make committing the child to the care of the (named) Health Board as a fit person until she is sixteen unless the Order is sooner revoked or varied.</P>
    <P>The essential point here is that as recently as 16 months ago the activities of health boards in acting as fit persons was specifically upheld by the High Court.</P>
    <P>The parents appealed the case to the Supreme Court.  In a preliminary judgment on 27 July last, the court ruled that the fit person order was unsafe because procedures in the original trial in the District Court had not been in accordance with the necessary requirements of natural justice.  The child returned to her parents shortly afterwards.</P>
    <P>The court said that it would give its decision at a later date on other issues raised on behalf of the parents.  This was the judgment delivered last Thursday. While the court found in favour of the health board on four of the five grounds, it found against the health board in the final point when it decided that health boards do not have the necessary legal authority to act as fit persons.  In doing so, the Supreme Court reversed the decision given by the High Court just 16 months previously.</P>
    <P>I now wish to briefly explain the provisions of the Bill before the House.  Section I provides for two matters.  Firstly, that the expression &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; in the Children Act, 1908, includes and shall be deemed always to have included a reference to a health board; secondly, that the functions of a health board include and shall be deemed always to have included the power to act as a &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; within the meaning of the 1908 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that every fit person order made before the passing of this Act shall be read and have effect as if this Act were in force when the order was made. This means that the order is to be read as if at the time it was made the definition &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; included a reference to the health board, the health board concerned had at the time the necessary legal authority to act as a &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; and the <Col N="1747" /> health board the power to make suitable arrangements for the care of the child.</P>
    <P>Section 3 also contains two elements. Firstly, it provide that where on the passing of this Bill a child or young person is in the actual possession or control of any person &mdash; e.g. a social worker, a foster parent or the manager of children's home &mdash; and he is in that persons care as a result of a fit person order committing him to a health board, he shall be deemed to be lawfully in the possession or control of that person, i.e. the social worker, the foster parent or the manager of the children's home, as the case may be.  Secondly, it provides that any person, which would include a health board, may apply to the court for a new fit person order or may apply for the renewal, variation or revocation of an existing fit person order. For technical reasons I intend to bring forward an amendment to this section on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that where a child or young person has been placed in the care of a health board under a fit person order the health board shall provide such care in one of a number of ways.  It may place the child in foster care or in residential care of where the child may be eligible for adoption it may place him with a suitable person or persons with a view to his adoption.  Subsection (3) gives statutory backing to the practice of health boards in allowing children in care to go home for weekends or for holidays so as to maintain links with their families in the hope that they may be able to go home permanently.  The main purpose of subsection (4) is to apply the Boarding Out of Children Regulations, 1983, to children placed in foster care under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 5 assigns responsibility for the functions of a health board under this Bill to the staff of the health board rather than to the members of the board.  It is, of course, not intended that the functions will be performed by the CEO personally. The CEO will be able to avail of his powers under the Health Act, 1970, to delegate these functions to other officers of the board.  I might just mention <Col N="1748" /> at this point that there is an error in the first of line of section 5.  The reference to &ldquo;Section 1 and Section 2&rdquo; should be to &ldquo;Section 1 and Section 4&rdquo;.  This will be amended at Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 6 sets out the options available to a court where it finds or declares that a fit person order is invalid, whether by reason of the recent Supreme Court judgment or for any other reason.  Firstly, it provides that in such a case the court may refuse to order the delivery or return of the child or young person to its parents or any other person if the court is of opinion that this would not be in the best interests of the child.</P>
    <P>Instead the court may do any of the following: (a) make a fit person order in the respect of the child or young person as if he had been brought before the court in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 1908 Act; (b) make an order referring the matter to the justice of the relevant District Court and in such case the justice may deal with the matter as if an application for a fit person order had been made to him in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 1908 Act; (c) where a person having custody, charge or care of a child or young person has been convicted of committing certain offences or has been committed for trial for such an offence or has been bound over to keep the peace towards the child or young person, the court may make a fit person order under section 21 of the 1908 Act or refer the matter to the Court by which the persons was so convicted, committed or bound over so that it can consider the need to make an order under section 21; (d) where an order under paragraph (a) or (c) has been made by the Court it may be deemed to have been made by the District Court.  This is a technical device so that any subsequent proceedings can be dealt with in the District Court rather than in a higher court; (e) where a higher court makes an order under paragraph (b) or (c) returning the case to a District Court, the higher court may make a temporary fit person order pending the determination of the matter by the District Court.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that nothing in this <Col N="1749" /> Bill shall affect any order of a court made before the passing of the Act in which a fit person order was found or declared to be invalid.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that the Bill is to be known as the Children Act, 1989, and that the Children Acts, 1908 to 1957, and this Act, shall be read together as if they formed one Act.  This means that the various definitions contained in the Children Acts, 1908 to 1957 automatically apply to this Act.  The most important are those of &ldquo;child&rdquo; and &ldquo;young person&rdquo; which are defined as follows: &ldquo;child&rdquo; means a person under the age of 15 years and &ldquo;young person&rdquo; means a person who is 15 years of age or upwards and under the age of 17 years.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the House that this Bill has been very carefully drafted in the Attorney General's office to take account of the Supreme Court judgment and other recent judicial pronouncements. I am satisfied that it deals with the immediate difficulty that has arisen.  I believe the other issues would be more appropriately dealt with in the context of the debate on the Child Care Bill, 1988.  I would appeal to all sides of the House to support this Bill so that we can regularise the position of the large number of children who are in care.  I am appealing, therefore, for the co-operation of all Deputies in processing this Bill as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>First, as a general position, I should like to say my party are anxious to facilitate the early enactment of this emergency legislation as we too are anxious to remove any possible anxiety or stress for those 900 or so children who are in care.  The validity of their care order is now being questioned.  We have bent over backwards, along with the other Opposition parties, to accommodate the Government in this regard. Notwithstanding that, if the Minister had been here for the entire Committee Stage debate on the Child Care Bill he would be aware that there were references to some of the legal problems which existed at that time.  I specifically made reference <Col N="1750" /> to this reserved judgment of last Thursday. My information, from as far back as last August, was that the judgment which was handed down was entirely predictable. My understanding in relation to the specific issue of &ldquo;fit persons&rdquo; was that heretofore the health boards had settled out of court and not contested this issue but this time it had gone the whole of the road and it was inevitable that it would be found to be invalid.  That is all behind us now and I do not wish to have any recriminations on it.</P>
      <P>Another aspect to the politics of this matter is that since this judgment it has been agreed that the Child Care Committee would go to an all-party select committee of this House.  This is something which my party have been seeking and we will participate constructively in that committee to ensure that we have the most comprehensive child care legislation possible to update the 1908 Act as soon as possible.  Having said that I would like to welcome the contents of this Bill. When these issues came up I never pretended to be anything other than a layman but I should say that in my short experience and knowledge of this matter the whole area is a legal minefield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the debate adjourned on the Child Care Bill I was outlining in some detail the two Supreme Court decisions &mdash; March 1985 and 22 June 1987 &mdash; which basically stated that the inalienable and imprescriptible rights of parents under Article 42.1 of the Constitution were such that those rights seemed to be greater than the rights of the child and the welfare of the child being of paramount concern.  In all of these cases there is a delicate balance between the rights of the parents and the rights of the children. I have no doubt &mdash; and what happened last week confirms for me &mdash; that if and when the current major Child Care Bill is passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas there will be constitutional questions about it.  It would be absolutely prudent of the Government, under Article 6 to refer that major legislation to the President to test its constitutionality, or we will be back in with bits and parts being questioned and <Col N="1751" /> undermined.  I understand that that process takes only 60 days.  It would be better to acknowledge that situation and realise that the earliest we will have that Child Care Bill enacted will be next Easter or May.  In that situation we must look at this emergency Bill in a new light.  We must acknowledge that the major legislation will not come forward for at least six months and that shows how much more important is this legislation in shoring up all potential loopholes in the temporary situation.  It will be some months before the major legislation is enacted.  In that regard Deputy Shatter and I have tabled half a dozen amendments which have been carefully thought out to cover what we consider to be the gaps in the position at present. I wish to assure the House that this was done in the most constructive spirit.  In view of what happened last week and also in the light of previous cases which suggest that the rights of parents are so great, I reiterate my call that, when our deliberations are completed, the constitutionality of the larger Bill should be tested.</P>
    <P>Two or three factors have motivated us in tabling amendments to this Bill.  We do not inherently disagree with anything the Minister is putting forward, save in regard to section 6.  We are anxious that as many aspects as possible of the Supreme Court judgment be implemented at this opportunity.  The first point relates to the access to children by natural parents or those in <i>loco parentis</i>.  They must be entitled to know where their children are and to visit them in care.  This Bill makes no reference to access.  It simply does not deal with the issue.  Could another case come before the Supreme Court within weeks or months undermining a previous court order and seeking to make it invalid on the basis that it did not deal with the question of access?  We have set out an amendment to deal with this matter by the insertion of a new section.  Section 17 of the major Bill deals with access and amendment No. 65 on the list of amendments published by the Minister last week relates to it.  We have used the Minister's <Col N="1752" /> wording, believing that it will meet the gap identified by the Supreme Court. Given that the amendment emanates from the Minister's Department, I would urge him to consider accepting it or tabling it himself on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I have with me a copy of the Supreme Court judgment.  Mr. Justice Finlay states that it is absolutely necessary for the health board to furnish the parent in respect of whose child the care order is being sought with any documentary or any assessment evidence regarding the child on a pre-trial basis.  This would include video recordings of the assessment and written submissions by social workers &mdash; basically all the ammunition and evidence that accuses the parent. The Supreme Court in their unanimous decision could not be clearer in this regard.  They have laid down that the parents have the right under all Acts to that information.  Where we have not legally provided for those rights or where they were not adhered to, a court order might be put aside or declared invalid. The court could well decide that in a particular case the procedure was not fully adhered to, the parents were not given the necessary information and were not in a position to rebut it.  It would be a tragedy if a child were subject to the potential risk of further abuse simply because we failed to enact comprehensive legislation.  I have again chosen the Minister's wording to help bring forward that new section.</P>
    <P>Our proposed amendment states that where proceedings are instituted pursuant to Part II or Part IV of the Children Act, 1908, in relation to the care of the child or young person by a health board, all reports and assessments carried out by or on behalf of the health board and the conclusions derived therefrom relating to the child or young person shall be furnished to the child's parent and/or their legal representatives, together with any video recording compiled of any such assessment.  It is not a lot to ask that the Minister should accept that amendment or table it himself on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>The amendment dealing with video recordings states that it shall be the duty <Col N="1753" /> of the court asked to determine an application brought pursuant to sections 24, 58 or 59 of the Children Act, 1908, except an application made pursuant to section 24 of the said Act to replace a safety order, to view all video recordings made as referred to in subsection (1).  All reports of assessments and video recordings should be made available.</P>
    <P>Also emerging from the judgment is the clear right of parents to have a separate independent assessment of their child.  The whole lesson of this case is that the child was returned to the parent.  The evidence produced by the health board was wrong.  Perhaps they were over-zealous. I fully appreciate that there is a delicate balance.  The court have said that one of the key factors in the future in getting that balance right is that parents should have the right to have an independent separate assessment.  A second opinion is not a bad thing.  Our amendment states that where a child is in the care of a health board pending the determination of proceedings instituted by the health board or any person acting on behalf of the health board pursuant to sections 24, 58 or 59 of the Children Act, 1908, the health board shall make available such child at the request of the parents or any other person in <i>loco parentis</i> where a request is made to have a separate independent assessment carried out on such a child prior to the determination of such proceedings.  These three provisions would strengthen the hand of health boards and raise fewer questions about the validity of current, retrospective and future care orders.  I ask the Minister to look seriously at this matter.  I do not believe it takes major chunks out of the other Bill; it is tidying up very important work here.</P>
    <P>We are proposing that supervision orders be included in this Bill.  There is no doubt that the Supreme Court was saying literally, implicitly and explicitly that the weight of evidence that health boards have to obtain in order to procure a child care order is more rigorous than heretofore.  More procedures will have to be followed and courts will have to be more diligent in ensuring the health <Col N="1754" /> board have a very conclusive case.  How are the health board to obtain such evidence prior to getting such a court order? They may be sure in their own minds, as is ofter the case in criminal cases when the Garda are sure who committed the crime, but they cannot get the proof.  One of the vital aspects of ensuring the health boards can operate effectively with care orders is to allow them &mdash; where they cannot get a care order from the court &mdash; to try to obtain a supervision order in advance.  When they get a supervision order they should be able to have regular access in such a way as to put together sufficient documentary evidence to be able to go to the courts to obtain a comprehensive care order.  I believe that in present circumstances it will be very difficult for health board social workers to put together a dossier containing sufficient evidence against parents to get a court order.  We should recognise the new situation and assist them.  The terms of the supervision order are as laid down in the ministerial amendment to the original Bill and, therefore, the wording should not be a matter of disagreement between us.  I ask that the question of supervision orders should now be dealt with so that the situation in relation to pre-care orders can be recognised and procedures set in place to allow the court &mdash; often in acrimonious and difficult situations in which the parents are not interested in social workers and where there is very bad feeling between health board personnel and the parents and mutual suspicion &mdash; on the basis of the evidence of the supervision, to decide whether to proceed with a care order.  As there is a likelihood of further delay on this Bill and its constitutionality may be called into question, that must be pursued.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill basically seeks to set out the circumstances of what should happen to the child when events like those of last Thursday take place, in other words, where court and care orders are made invalid.  The advice given to me is that section 6 is seriously defective and I do not say that lightly.  I am also advised that there is at least a constitutional question about its retrospective and other <Col N="1755" /> aspects but, when this legislation is enacted, it will be the first target of lawyers challenging it.  We have put forward a new section 6 which would deal with some of the defects.  Section 6 (b) says that the court may make an order remitting the matter to a justice of the District Court.  Are the High Court to determine the validity of the care order and are the District Court to clarify the welfare of the child?  In other words, will there be two court cases?  It would be very costly, wrong and ambiguous to have two court cases.  Therefore, we propose the deletion of section 6 (b).</P>
    <P>There is a second defect in section 6, leaving aside the constitutional question. It also says that if the court is of the opinion that such delivery or return would not be in the best interests of the child and in any such case the court, of its own motion or on the application of any interested person, may make an order ....  How will the honourable justice decide what is in the best interests of the child?  On what basis will this be decided?  There is no criteria set out for the justice to make the decision and, therefore, we have tried to put forward procedures to give clarification so that the court can properly interpret what that means.</P>
    <P>To summarise, there is at least a constitutional question mark over section 6. Remitting cases to the District Court will involve two cases, one to deal with the welfare of the child in the District Court and one to deal with the validity of the order in the High Court.  The basis on which both courts are to determine the best interests of the child has not been satisfactorily defined.  We are trying to ensure that while this may be rushed and urgently required legislation &mdash; and we are trying to facilitate the Government and the House in every way possible &mdash; we do not want to produce shoddy, rushed and defective legislation.  I fear that unless we make the changes that conform to the Supreme Court's judgment requirements dealing with access, reports, assessments, video recordings and the right to an independent <Col N="1756" /> assessment, the legislation will not be effective.  We should also make provision for supervision orders to allow health board workers to get on with their jobs so that it is possible to come up with enough evidence to win a case.  Our amendments are reasonable and I hope the Minister and the House will agree to them in the circumstances of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is rather peculiar in that it is almost tangential on very important legislation in respect of which we have advanced to Committee Stage.  The fact that the debate is necessary is an indictment of the House for failing to enact the main body of legislation which has been in genesis and developing over a great number of years.</P>
      <P>The decision of the Supreme Court delivered on 2 November had been signalled for a long time.  Indeed many speakers on the Second Stage debate of the original Child Care Bill said that such a decision was likely to be arrived at and that judges of the High Court and the Supreme Court had indicated that it was probable that health boards would not be seen to be fit persons within the meaning of the 1908 Act.  For all those reasons, it is a cause of regret and an underlining of our own shortcomings in this House, that legislation such as the Bill we are now debating should have to be rushed through the House in a matter of hours. In fact, most Members of the House had their first sight of the Bill yesterday. There is agreement across the House that it should be enacted as quickly as possible for one reason, the precarious position of several hundred children whose legal status is &mdash; to put it mildly &mdash; questionable and who need to be sheltered by the speedy enactment of legislation by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the initial discussion took place following our Private Notice Questions last Thursday, the Government Chief Whip indicated that this legislation which sought merely to clarify and validate the position of health boards as fit persons pending the enactment of full child care legislation was to be a three paragraph <Col N="1757" /> Bill.  The Bill is marginally more substantial than that and I understand the technical difficulties that the offices of the Minister and the Attorney General must have faced in trying to put into place a legal framework which is only of temporary duration.  However, we do not know if it will remain temporary for long because we do not know how long it will take for the main legislation to move in its cumbersome way through these Houses and ultimately what challenges it may face outside them.</P>
    <P>My view is that it is important that we address the single issue of the Supreme Court decision.  Obviously, it is the intention of the House to do that in a way that is not subsequently challenged.  On the whole I accept and support the Minister's view that all the major questions in relation to care orders and the welfare of children would be more properly dealt with in a structured, less rushed way by the new Joint Oireachtas Committee ordered to be established by this House this afternoon.  Many of us sought the establishment of that committee over many years.  There are fundamental questions for that committee to address. The Minister touched on at least one of those issues himself in the course of his introductory remarks today when he said:</P>
    <P>It is, of course, crucial that the right balance be struck in these proceedings between the rights of parents and the rights of children.</P>
    <P>We were beginning to address that very issue on the Committee Stage of the other Bill.  Despite what Deputy Yates said in relation to the ultimate objective of referring the main Bill to the President for possible referral to the Supreme Court in order to test its constitutionality, I strongly believe that ultimately we may have to address the issue in a more straightforward and direct way, that is, to define in progressive ways &mdash; in a way that most progressive countries have done already &mdash; a clear Bill of Rights for Children, to set the child, its fundamental rights and wellbeing as paramount and fundamental and, if necessary, consult the people by way of referendum to <Col N="1758" /> enshrine those rights in an inalienable fashion in our Constitution.</P>

      <P>If that is thought to be necessary the Government should have the courage to do so, the courage to decide to take on whatever vested interests have been responsible for the tortuously slow progress thus far of amendment of the 1908 Act.  Should the Minister show such courage I can assure him he will have the wholehearted support of the Labour Party in bringing that amending legislation through these Houses and, ultimately, the support of the Labour Party in any referendum necessary as a consequence.</P>
      <P>For those reasons it is not proper that we address many of the fundamental questions of child care within the context of the narrow debate here this evening. There remains a mere hour to Second Stage.  This Bill is to be passed by this House by 10.30 p.m. this evening. Clearly there is insufficient time to do anything more than safeguard the precarious position of the children of our country &mdash; the up to 900 already in care and those who may become vulnerable tomorrow, who will lack the proper protection that should be afforded them by any civilised State.</P>
      <P>I note the Minister's assertion that it is the role of the health boards to be the State's child care and protection agencies.  If that is to be the case they need not only a solid legal framework within which to exercise their obligation and duty to protect children and promote their welfare; more than that &mdash; and I will say this at every available opportunity &mdash; they need to have the staffing and resources provided to enable them do so. As I have said, talk is cheap.  We often legislate and put into being frameworks that we afterwards allow to become strangled for lack of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the establishment today of the All Party Committee.  We have had sufficient time to read a great many proposals and submissions from all those <Col N="1759" /> involved in the child care area, to formulate and enact legislation that is meaningful, if only we have the courage to do so.</P>
    <P>In responding to Second Stage I would ask the Minister to address some of the reservations voiced by speakers within and without this House.  Because we are dealing with children &mdash; very vulnerable children at that &mdash; we seek unqualified assurance that the legislation will not be defective, that the question of the validity of enacting something retrospectively has been clearly thought through by the Minister and the Attorney General, that it cannot be subjected to further court action which would put children further in jeopardy or place at risk the status of those under the protection of health boards.  I will accept the Minister's assurance unreservedly should such be forthcoming in this regard.</P>
    <P>I note that the provisions of section 7 exclude cases already heard by the courts.  I am sure that is proper.  We on the Labour benches will listen with interest to the Minister's response to Second Stage and to the arguments advanced, section by section, on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill should not be seen in any way to be a replacement of the main debate that is now being properly channelled into the select committee on the Child Care Bill.  Rather I hope this Bill will be viewed simply as an emergency measure that will be supported by all Members of this House, to put at ease the minds of all those child care workers and the families of children who are at risk, so that they may be given the security of knowing that the orders that put them in a place of safety &mdash; whether in fosterage or in acceptable accommodation &mdash; are proper and correct. I can assure the Minister of the support and encouragement of the Labour Party if that is his objective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of The Workers Party I should like to make our position clear in regard to the provisions of this Bill.  We will not be opposing the <Col N="1760" /> Bill on Second Stage, though there are some important and fundamental questions that must be teased out on Committee Stage.  I might suggest that this House be prepared to sit as late as possible this evening to dispose of all discussion on amendments from wherever they may emanate and whatever may be their objective.  It is much too important a Bill for us to simply set a guillotine, as was suggested this morning, so that amendments in the name of the Minister only be put at a certain hour.  I know the Whips will discuss this matter later.</P>
      <P>Like so many other Bills with which we have dealt in previous sessions this Bill represents a spectacle of Government being <i>en retard</i>.  Indeed it is another example of delay and prevarication in the whole area of children's rights, constituting merely one more chapter in a saga that will not end with the passage of this Bill this evening.</P>
      <P>I might correct a view expressed in some media that the Government won a right to defer implementation of the major Bill with which we dealt last week &mdash; now being referred to the special committee &mdash; not to implement its provisions for another 12 months.  In fact the Government won the right in regard to that Bill &mdash; if they so choose by way of ministerial decision &mdash; never to implement the provisions of the Child Care Bill we had begun to debate.  That was the effect of the defeat of The Workers Party amendment which had sought to ensure that its provisions would be fully implemented within the next 12 months.  Government stood firm and, with the support of the Progressive Democrats, succeeded in giving the Minister power, if he so decides, never to implement any or all of those provisions. That is something which worries me enormously. In 1978 the then Fianna Fáil Government announced that, in the Year of the Child then being celebrated, there would be introduced a comprehensive package of laws dealing with the rights of children right across the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The single objective of the then Government was that we would have a charter of rights, written into our laws <Col N="1761" /> and Constitution, dealing with all aspects of children's needs and rights.  This did not happen.  What happened was that the committee were established and we were given a comprehensive report in 1980 from the Task Force on Child Care Services, a report which lay unaddressed until the introduction in 1985 of a Bill by the Coalition Government of the day.  It has to be said that Bill was not actively pursued by the Government and was eventually allowed to die a death.</P>
    <P>The next stage of the saga was in 1988 when Fianna Fáil introduced their Bill, which has only managed to get as far as the second section on Committee Stage, one and a half years later.  In the midst of all that the Supreme Court were given the opportunity to address the fundamental issues with regard to the legislation. The legislation we are talking about is the statute of the British Parliament, which was passed in 1908 and which borrows the language of schools of correction and refers to unruly children, chastisement and all the ideas typical of that era.  It is legislation of another era and has no function or relevance to the social conditions of the modern Ireland we are desperately trying to achieve.  It is an incredible indictment of all of us that parents, children, authorities and lawyers have to work a scheme of legislation so outmoded as the 1908 Children Act.</P>
    <P>The other aspect which gravely concerns me in regard to the tardiness and heavy-handed attitude of the Government in dealing with this whole area was the establishment today of a special committee to deal with the greater Bill.  The Workers' Party sought the establishment of such a committee in July so that we could at least use the months of the summer recess to work on the Bill.  This proposal was not agreed to, three months were lost and now we are putting the Bill into a special committee.  We hope that progress will be made; but who knows whether tomorrow, the next day or whenever there will be another judicial interpretation of the provisions of the 1908 Act which will arrest, divert and cause confusion in the workings of this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1762" /> Only last night the High Court handed down a further judicial interpretation of the practices which have grown up primarily as a result of the lack of attention given by this House over the decades to the areas of child custody and care.  That judgment of the Supreme Court, which forced us to address not only one aspect of the child care laws as covered in this Bill but many aspects of the law, is a remarkable judgment, or perhaps I should say a remarkable pair of judgments.  In July of this year the Supreme Court told all who wanted to know that they were unhappy with the law under the 1908 Act.  They made it clear that they would have had very definite views to express had the issue of the constitutionality of the 1908 Act been before them.  By agreement of the parties the Attorney General was not drawn into the process and the greater issue of the constitutionality of the 1908 Act was not addressed.  This House should at least consign the 1908 Act to where it belongs, 1908, before the Supreme Court does it for us.  Let us move on with some speed to replace it so that we will not be the laughing stock of the legislative and judicial world in being told by our courts that the Act we have being borrowing on since 1908 was never properly introduced into domestic law.</P>
    <P>In any event the judgment in July of this year told us that all things were not as they should be in our law and the courts were disposed to grant an order of <i>habeas corpus</i> to the parents seeking the return of their child.  That in itself is a disturbing fact and illustrates well how neglectful we in this House have been of individual rights in this area.  The child was upwards of two years in the custody of an authority who was found by the Supreme Court to have no right at all to have the child.  It is a remarkable state of affairs that by our inaction, neglect and inertia, for whatever reasons, we can allow situations like this to develop.</P>
    <P>I believe the Supreme Court in their judgment delivered the other day were screaming to this House because they did not deal just with the issue of whether or not someone was a fit person.  If anyone <Col N="1763" /> feels smug about this whole affair he should read the book written by Deputy Shatter, in another capacity, which is available on the shelves on the Library of this House and elsewhere for anyone who wants to read it.  Deputy Shatter says in his book &mdash; I have no doubt he will quote from his book but, if not, I will refer to it so that he may feel inclined to quote it &mdash; that there is no explicit statement in any legislation which suggests that health boards are fit persons for the purposes of our laws.  It is there for anyone to read it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the Supreme Court in their forceful judgment gave us, as a House, some remarkable judicial directives to ensure that when we get on with our deliberations we will not ignore issues which must be addressed and have not been dealt with in the major legislation we dealt with last week, not covered in this emergency legislation and which must be addressed by the Minister and all of us in this House in the not too distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first directive was a recognition for the first time that often in these situations there is an innocent parent and that he or she must be considered by the courts and the Legislature as having a right to retain a child or that a child should be left in the family home and the suspected or offending parent removed.  This issue has not been addressed or admitted to in <Col N="1764" /> any of the Bills which have come before the House and we should deal with it very carefully.  The court also suggests, in putting the matter right, that health boards, as of right, should be involved and consulted by the courts in regard to all applications wherever they come from.  This provision does not exist in law at present and should be legislated for.</P>
    <P>It also insists that the person to whom the child is committed be named, made known and that access should be given to parents, offending or otherwise, suspected or otherwise, during the period. The court recognises that, even though a child may be taken out of one family and put into the care of another, the primary rights of parents exist and may well be restored at a subsequent date by a court order or otherwise and that one should be working for those eventualities.  With regard to the administration of the cases once before the courts, the July judgment of the Supreme Court makes extremely interesting reading in regard to establishing and recognising the rights of parties, before the proceedings, of access to information, reports, videos, if they exist, and the use &mdash; the Minister must address this issue &mdash; of the anatomical doll device as an aid to doctors or witnesses, professional or otherwise, pursuing cases of this kind.  In this context it has to be said and made clear that when we were talking about children in care, and how they get there, we must recognise that the vast majority of them are there by the consent of their parents.  All of them, by a long shot, are not sent there because of abuse, physical or sexual.  It is estimated that of the 2,500 children in care more than two-thirds of them are there by the consent of their parents who for their very good reasons, and perhaps out of love and care and in the best interests of their children, have to admit failure on a temporary or, unfortunately, permanent basis.  We must when legislating in this context recognise that and allow for the widest possible regime to exist so as to facilitate everybody.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of the parents are single or people who have problems that <Col N="1765" /> they cannot cope with such as unemployment, poverty or social difficulties relating to drink, drugs and so on.  They cannot be condemned to the shoddy treatment that we as legislators, and successive Governments, have committed them to.  While we might legislate in the narrow sense, as we are doing today, for the welfare of children, unless we address the broader issues of poverty and unemployment in our community then all our legislation and actions in the House will be set to nought.</P>
    <P>In the recent joint report issued by the ESRI and the Combat Poverty Agency we were made aware of the well known fact, one that is often forgotten in the context of such debates, that we give a little more than £80 per week to two adults and two children to survive on even if it is not possible for those adults to find employment.  The infant mortality rate among unskilled workers is three times that found among the middle and professional classes.  Children represent a greater proportion of poverty today then they did 15 years ago.  Whatever we might be doing about updating and upgrading the law, we are going backwards in terms of providing a decent living and conditions for our children.  It should be remembered that six out of every ten households here live in poverty. I do not see how any of us can be proud of what is happening.  While the Bill forces us to give attention to an area of the law that has been greatly neglected we must at the same time avail of the opportunity of referring to the rampant poverty and the massive neglect of our children, those whom in the great proclamation we promised to cherish equally.</P>
    <P>I recognise the urgency of the Bill and what it is attempting to do.  I join with those Members who suggested that it should not be seen as a block or a deterrent to our debate on the major legislation that was before the House last week.  I hope we will consign this Bill to its proper place, beside the 1908 Act, as soon as we pass the greater legislation.  I must express a reservation about section 6.  That section could well give an <i>imprimatur</i> or invitation to shoddy practice at <Col N="1766" /> the primary court stage.  If mistakes are made the proper thing to do is to allow the courts to give the ultimate sanction of <i>habeas corpus,</i> or whatever, and compel the parties to revert to the procedures of the District or primary courts and make proper application in that way.  We have to remember that the higher courts are places that cannot be visited by many people because of the cost element.  I am worried that that section will not work to the benefit of all.  I should like the Minister to consider my point on Committee Stage and, perhaps advance more reasons why he thinks it is a better formula than what I have suggested.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the House, I should like to give eight minutes of my time to Deputy Wyse. Like other Members I should like to express my thanks and congratulations to the Government on their decision to establish a select committee to deal with the Child Care Bill.  That is the best way to deal with that Bill.  I have no doubt that it will get a speedy passage through that select committee.  As other Members have stated, there are soundings coming from the Supreme Court and the High Court to the effect that this area should be taken care of in new legislation.  It is my experience in these cases that the interests of the child are paramount and that the interests of the parents are secondary. We should bear that in mind during our debate on this stop-gap Bill, which is being introduced to close a loophole. Opposition Members may feel that there is a need to introduce amendments along the lines of those proposed by the Child Care Bill, but I do not think we should delay the passage of the Bill with them.  I was heartened to hear the attitude of Deputy Howlin, who said that these matters are too important to be decided in this emergency debate.  I accept his opinion that we will have more time in the select committee to deal with issues such as access of parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should ensure that the Bill is given a quick passage in the House so that the many cases that have been put in limbo <Col N="1767" /> as a result of the recent Supreme Court decision can be dealt with.  There have been many comments about the alleged delay in bringing the Bill forward.  In the case in question judgment was handed down by Mr. Justice Finlay in July and it dealt with the procedures that took place in the District Court.  That judgment found that those procedures were not valid.  The Supreme Court announced then that they would give a more detailed judgment on the issues at a later stage but felt obliged, in the interests of the child, to issue an interim judgment.  At no stage in the judgment issued in July did the court infer that a health board was not a fit person.  That is one of the reasons why nothing was done at that stage.  Members will be aware that such issues were to be taken care of in the Child Care Bill.  As Deputy McCartan said, we should assign the Children Act, 1908, to the dustbin.  If one looks at the Bill one will see that the intention is to repeal almost all sections of the 1908 Act.  There has been a lot of ill-informed comment about the delay in bringing that Bill forward.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that Mr. Justice Finlay in July did not deal with the question of whether a health board was a fit person.  In a previous judgment of the High Court by Miss Justice Mella Carroll, in <i>the State D and D v. the Midland Health Board,</i> the judge found that the health board was a fit person to deal with the instance.  Because of that I have no doubt that the Department of Health and many other people were of the opinion at that stage that the health boards were entitled to act even though they were not specifically mentioned in the section of the Act. You have often heard the maxim that doctors differ and patients die.  There is no doubt that in a very short time two leading members of our Judiciary have differed on this question of whether a health board would be a fit person to take into care. Deputy McCartan referred to Deputy Shatter's book &mdash; let me say an excellent book as he is in the Chamber. In that book he adverted to this matter and it has been called into question on a <Col N="1768" /> number of occasions, as I know from my own experience.  The part of the book Deputy McCartan referred to stated that section 5 (1) of the Health Act, 1970, however, provides that the health board is a body corporate and undoubtedly part of the health board's function is to provide for the reception and protection of poor children.  Therefore, it appears the health board may properly come within the concept of a fit person as defined in the Act.  Even at that stage the feeling was that the health board could be a fit person to take children into care.  To me there has been much ill-informed comment in the Press and publicly saying this Legislature is lethargic in dealing with that aspect.</P>
    <P>I find a number of aspects in the judgment that was handed down on 2 November difficult and I feel the long term effect of the judgment could have a detrimental effect on the attitude of people who might want to foster children. While Deputy Yates wants to put in an amendment here tonight, I feel these are all aspects we should tease out in greater detail on Committee Stage.  If potential foster parents were made aware that their names were to be made public, that perhaps the natural parents would have the right to follow and get access or whatever, although this happens quite often with consent, but there may be cases where the foster parents might shy away. In my area the health board are having difficulty in getting foster parents.  This may be one reason why foster parents are unwilling to come forward to take care of children and this difficulty may crop up down the line.  We should be very wary of rushing this matter here tonight.</P>
    <P>Another aspect in the judgment was the reference to the innocent parent. Again we should be wary here.  The interest of the child is paramount.  While a parent may be innocent in not having perpetrated whatever the abuse was, the child should go to somebody who will look after it and has the capability of looking after it.  An innocent party may not have the capability.  The judge stated in his judgment that there may be a reason to prevent the innocent parent <Col N="1769" /> from taking the child and that should be looked into, but we must deal very carefully with all those aspects and not rush in here.  These issues must be teased out properly.</P>
    <P>There was some comment about the way this was handled in the debates here on Second Stage of the Child Care Bill. Deputy Leyden, Minister of State, in November last year confirmed that the reasoned opinion at that time was that the health board was a fit person to be nominated.  In the judgment of 15 July 1988 High Court Justice Mella Carroll in the Midland Health Board case felt that if an employee of a health board was nominated, that employee may very well go sick, lose the job, or go out of the job or retire.  That would lead to unnecessary court applications for changing the names.  We need to tread very warily there if we decide to put in particular persons as the nominee of the health board.</P>
    <P>Section 6 causes a light problem which perhaps we can tease out on Committee Stage.  At a later stage there could be some sort of action which could put the matter here in jeopardy.  It is vitally important for the 800 or so children who are in limbo at this stage that we pass this legislation to tighten up that matter now and later we can get down to the detail and the <i>minutiae</i> of the Child Care Bill so that we can deal with this area properly.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ahern for sharing his time with me.  On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I welcome the speedy introduction of this legislation here today.  Since the ruling of the Supreme Court last week the actions taken by the Minister for Health and his Department have reflected the urgency and seriousness of this situation. However, it is unfortunate that it took last Thursday's ruling for the Department to recognise how critical it was.  The seriousness and inevitability of the position we now find ourselves in had been well flagged in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1770" /> The initial ruling of the Supreme Court last July gave a clear indication of the likely nature the full decision would take when eventually announced.  The dangers, however, were apparent long before even that.  In the Second Stage debate of the Child Care Bill which took place in this House on 14 June 1988, a year and a half ago, Deputy McDowell spoke on behalf of the Progressive Democrats. During his contribution he warned of the urgency of the Child Care Bill.  In particular he spoke of the rulings which some judges of the High Court had made even then which raised serious questions about the legality of health boards invoking powers of the District Court to have a fit person order made in respect of a child or to have children detained against the wishes of their parents.  He said that in this context the health boards had as much function in relation to the welfare of children as Bord na Móna or CIE.  Deputy McDowell warned on that occasion that, given the situation, there would be some parent who after receiving legal advice would go to the High Court and have a District Court order quashed under the 1908 Act. It is a salutary lesson to us all in this House that, 14 months after that specific warning, what was indicated then has now occurred, and instead of having anticipated this with revised legislation we are responding to it with an emergency measure.  The whole episode highlights once again the sorry rate of progress made on child care legislation and child care in particular.  That legislation was designed to revise and update the 1908 Children Act, but it has taken so long to go through that it seems now that it originated in the 1908 Act itself.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision that has been reached to establish a special committee for Committee Stage of the Bill.  We must move carefully but speedily to ensure that the legislation is completed.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome in so far as it brings to an end the limbo in which up to 800 children have been since the ruling of the Supreme Court on Thursday last.  The potential consequence of that ruling was that courts would have to order the return <Col N="1771" /> of children to homes from which, on foot of careful decisions, they had been removed.  It is a relief that this Bill removes that danger.</P>
    <P>However, there is need for caution in regard to some areas of the Bill.  For example, it is provided in section 3 that any child or young person in possession or control of any person in consequence of an order made or purporting to have been made under Part II or Part IV of the Children Act, 1908, shall be deemed to be lawful in such possession or control. I would be concerned lest the blanket nature of this measure would have the effect of legalising many orders which might be judged irregular for reasons very different from those we are concerned with at the moment.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned also in relation to section 4 in that the wide ranging nature of this measure would be beyond the needs of what is needed now.  It may be that this whole area would be served better by debate that is less rushed when the full consequences could be teased out.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister's explanation in regard to the various issues that have been raised and to hearing from him also as to the need for the sections to which attention has been drawn.  It is my hope that the response of the House to this legislation will reflect the urgency of the matter we are dealing with. However, we must realise that this can be only a temporary measure.  The issues that have been raised in the past week and which have been aired here today demand in the longer term careful and considered opinion on such questions as, for example, the whole suitability of the District Courts to deal with matters of the kind we are debating and on the need for setting up a scheme of family courts as promised in the agreed <i>Programme for Government</i>.  These considerations must urge the House to deal finally and properly with the Child Care Bill and to do so without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this <Col N="1772" /> Bill.  I am familiar, as I am sure are other Members of the House, with the proceedings which gave rise to the situation we are dealing with.  Wearing my legal hat I represented the parents who were involved in the court case concerned.</P>
      <P>The background to the case in question gives rise to a variety of concerns while the court judgments that have been delivered require emergency legislation.  No doubt, though, the legislation before us cannot deal adequately with all the problems in this area of child care.</P>
      <P>The court proceedings, as referred to by the Minister and by others, arose out of an allegation that a father had sexually abused his child, as a result of which the child was taken into care.  At all times the parents strenuously denied that their daughter had been sexually abused and it took two and a half years, through the High Court and the Supreme Court, to have released from care the child who had been taken into care &mdash; by the health board in this case.</P>
      <P>At the time the District Court made the decision that the child be taken into care an assessment had been carried out which was referred to subsequently by the Supreme Court in its decision as not being a safe assessment with regard to the procedures of the court employed in determining the issue.  The parents were given very little prior notice of the allegations being made against them.  I emphasise that I was not the lawyer involved at that time but the lawyers for the parents then had sight of a report of an assessment on the morning of the hearing of the case.  A video was made of the assessment procedures but the parents, the lawyers or the courts did not view this video.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assessment technique that was used to determine whether the child had been sexually abused was by way of the use of what are known as anatomical dolls.  The Supreme Court, in its judgment delivered in July last, made it clear that where such a vital matter as that relating to taking a child out of the care of parents arises, the court must have before it all relevant evidence, that it must view the video concerned, that the parents must see in advance the detail of <Col N="1773" /> the allegations being made against them and that assessments on the part of health boards must be furnished to the parents and to their lawyers well in advance.  It is implicit in the judgment of the court that the parents must have access to their child to have an independent assessment carried out.</P>
    <P>In this area it is essential that we do two things: that we protect the welfare of the child and in so doing provide a balance of approach.  No court, social worker, doctor or health board should ever enter into a case of alleged child sexual abuse or any other allegation of abuse on an assumption either that abuse is automatically taking place or that abuse never takes place.  There is a danger that we in Ireland have swung from the position of some years ago of assuming that child sexual abuse was not a problem within our community to assuming now that it is a problem of a far greater nature that what is the reality. Therefore, there is need to provide a balance and a perspective in this area.  I am greatly concerned that we have lost sight of that balance in recent years, though it may have been redressed by the impact in this country of much of what happened in the Cleveland case in England. I believe there is a number of cases which require review because of the approach that may have been adopted by health boards in the past three or four years, approaches which today, in the light of experience, would be accepted as defective.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are failing to address a number of matters.  It is not my intention to refer to those provisions in the Bill giving the health boards expressly the power to act as fit persons.  Deputy Yates has referred to that aspect and we are tabling some amendments for Committee Stage which will help to have that matter teased out to a greater extent.  What concerns me is that the Bill fails on a number of counts to ensure that any care proceedings brought in the intervening period between now and the coming into operation of the more comprehensive Bill will not be equally defective.  This Bill requires a provision to ensure, first, that <Col N="1774" /> pre-trial procedures protect the welfare of children and of parents.  If a child is being seriously abused it is in the interest of his or her welfare that they be taken into care and provided with protection. Equally, however, it would be totally contrary to a child's welfare that as a result of a mistaken allegation of abuse, an allegation that may be made from the best of motives, the child is taken from the family and suffers the horror of being removed, not only from parents, brothers and sisters, but from the entire extended family of grandparents, aunts, uncles and so on.  There is a necessity to ensure that we get the balance right and that future care orders are valid.  Consequently, there must be provision in this emergency legislation to set out the entitlement of parents to have full access to assessments, to impose an obligation on health boards to give access to parents in relation to videos of assessment and to ensure that a child believed to be at risk is placed in safety.  The Bill, as drafted, is defective in that it does not contain any such provision.</P>
    <P>A matter of great concern is the way in which anatomical dolls have been used in the past and continue to be used as probitive mechanism to establish whether a child has been sexually abused. In the Cleveland report one of the doctors giving evidence referred to the hazards of over-enthusiasm in using what are known as &ldquo;disclosure techniques&rdquo; and the problems of the use of anatomical dolls to establish child sexual abuse in the context of a crusade to establish that abuse is a great deal more prevalent than it is in reality.  The conclusion of the Cleveland report is that in the context of anatomical dolls and of the techniques of interviewing children and the use of such dolls as an initial part of determining whether an allegation of abuse is correct there are &ldquo;very serious dangers in their use at too early a stage in the evaluation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As in this case the Supreme Court found the decision of the court that a child had been abused was unsafe, that it could not be relied upon, that the necessary protections had not been applied, I <Col N="1775" /> am concerned there may be other children at present in care who have been taken into care without the court applying the protections required to protect their welfare and to protect the rights of parents as laid down by the Supreme Court.  I ask the Minister to indicate this evening if he is prepared at this stage to ask each health board to review every case that has been processed during the past three years in our courts where a child has been taken into care on foot of an allegation of child sexual abuse which has been corroborated in court proceedings solely by one medical practitioner giving evidence and the evidence being based on disclosure techniques deriving from the use of anatomical dolls.</P>
    <P>I wonder how many other children may be in care by mistake, because either lawyers or a district justice did not realise that these techniques are not fool-proof because they were led to believe that these techniques ensured that an allegation made could be positively established as correct.  I do not see it as posing any risk to children in care that the position with regard to their being taken into care be reviewed.  I hope and expect it would be found where children have been taken into care that in the majority of cases the court decisions were correct but I am concerned that there may be some children who should not be in care and whose parents were not able, or did not have the strength of character to pursue the matter in the courts in the way the parents involved in this case pursued the matter.</P>
    <P>I am concerned there may be some people involved in what is now euphemistically described as &ldquo;disclosure work&rdquo; who see themselves as involved in a crusade to establish that we have problems of child sexual abuse that may have been greater than many people thought ten years ago but are possibly not as great as the crusaders believe they are.  That is a major problem we have not addressed this evening.  I ask the Minister to ensure that health boards conduct that review.  I ask him to accept the amendments we propose with regard to ensuring that in <Col N="1776" /> future assessment reports are made available, the videos are viewed by the courts and that independent assessments are carried out.</P>
    <P>This is extremely important in the context of the judgment delivered but it is also important that amendments relating to giving parents the right to communicate with children taken into care are accepted.  The Supreme Court in the decision delivered on 2 November indicated quite clearly that the taking of a child into care, except in special circumstances, should not automatically cut off that child from its parents.  There must be proper arrangements for access and for communication.  That was a problem in this case where I have knowledge that other Members of this House do not have because of my involvement in it.</P>
    <P>When a child is taken into care, if that child has been seriously assaulted or abused of course he should be protected from the abuser but we also need to attend the issue of the innocent parent having contact with and access to that child.  We need to consider the devastating impact on a child, not simply being taken out of contact with an abusing parent, but being cut off from the extended family.  Children have relationships with aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins.  They have extended relationships and the draconian impact currently of care orders in the context of health boards being unco-operative with regard to access can often mean that a child is taken away from all contact with the extended family.  That is something that will be addressed in detail on the major Child Care Bill but in this Bill we must make provision for access.  I predict if we do not make that provision that will be another basis on which child care orders will be held to be invalid in future.  We will then have a similar problem and more rushed emergency legislation.</P>
    <P>There is another problem with regard to validating the place of safety order procedure.  Some years ago I tried to draw to the attention of the Department of Health that some health boards were using a place of safety order as a sort of pre-emptive strike to take children out of <Col N="1777" /> the homes of their parents and to put them into care where there was a suspicion that a child was at risk but where that suspicion could not be substantiated. That is still a major concern.  We must have a half-way house between leaving children unsupervised with parents and taking children completely away from the parental home and placing them in care. The supervision order mechanism would provide for that.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court has indicated that where a child has been abused by one parent before a care order is made there is an obligation on the court to see whether that child can properly remain in the care of the innocent parent in circumstances where that parent can ensure the protection of the child.  That matter is not properly addressed in this measure and that is another flaw in it.  Where there is a suspicion that a child is at risk but that is not confirmed &mdash; in some instances it may be wrong &mdash; there must be a different approach other than leaving the child in the family home and doing nothing to provide protection or the draconian approach of lifting the child by way of a place of safety order, taking the child from the home and the health board arranging to have an assessment carried out in the hope that the assessment will prove them to be right.  In that regard we are tabling an amendment to provide for the making of a supervision order where there is a suspicion a child may be at risk but where that suspicion does not give rise to sufficiently serious allegations to warrant the child being taken into care in order to give the health boards and social workers the right to involve themselves with the family and to provide a degree of supervision in the care of the child.  I hope the Minister can accept that amendment as a constructive proposal.</P>
    <P>Because of concern for children unfortunately on occasion some health board personnel and some medical practitioners have run headlong in the belief that new techniques developed outside this country provide the answer to determining whether abuse has occurred, particularly in the area of child sexual abuse.  I have already given the instances <Col N="1778" /> of the problems of the use of anatomical dolls.  I believe that cases in which they have been used as a probitive mechanism which have convinced courts to take children into care should be reviewed.  Those cases were prior to the time when we had individual teams operating in health board areas.  In fact, they go back to the time which the sexual assault unit in the Rotunda Hospital initiated this type of technique.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to sincerely thank all the Deputies who have contributed, apart from Deputy McCartan.  Their contributions were very positive.  I cannot understand how a debate on such an important Bill could be upset and obstructed by a Deputy who has not been in this House for very long but who legally should know better than to interrupt and try to intimidate the House when we are trying to do our business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a short Bill which is an immediate response by the Government to deal with the situation which has arisen as a result of the Supreme Court judgment of last Thursday.  I am satisfied that this Bill deals with the difficulty that has arisen. Some of the media coverage and public comments relating to that Supreme Court judgment have suggested that the decision that health boards do not have statutory authority to act as fit persons was in some way signalled by the earlier judgment in the same case, which was delivered on 27 July last.  I have studied that judgment in great detail and have to say there was no foundation for this assertion.  The judgment of 27 July last dealt solely with the pre-trial procedures and the trial itself in the District Court where the fit person order in question was originally made.  The court came to <Col N="1780" /> the conclusion that these procedures had not been carried out in accordance with the necessary standards of natural justice thus rendering the fit person order unsafe.  As a result, the court ordered the release of the child and its return to its parents.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that the judgment of 27 July did not allude in any way to the question of whether a health board is empowered to act as a fit person. This was one of five issues on which the court reserved its judgment and its decision on these points was delivered last Thursday.  In the judgment last week the Supreme Court upheld the original rulings of the High Court on four of the five issues but allowed the appeal on the question of whether a health board had power to act as a fit person.  As this House is aware, the court held that health boards do not have such a power.</P>
    <P>As this House is aware, the court held that health boards do not have such a power.  It must be said however, particularly in view of the comments which have appeared in the media, that there were no reasonable grounds for the Government, the Minister for Health or his Department to believe before last Thursday that the court would find against health boards in this way.  It is all very well for certain Deputies with the benefit of hindsight to criticise the Government for not anticipating this ruling.  However, the fact is that up to last Thursday the legal position was as laid down by the High Court in July 1988, that is, that health boards could act as fit persons.</P>
    <P>I have listened carefully to the contribution made by Deputy Yates and particularly to his views on the amendments he proposes to put down on Committee Stage.  I reiterate what the Minister for Health said in his opening speech.  This Bill is designed to deal with the immediate difficulty which has arisen and the Government are satisfied that the Bill before the House does that.  The improvement and clarification of our child care legislation generally, in the Government's view, can best be done in the context of the debate on the Child <Col N="1781" /> Care Bill, 1988, which has now been referred to a Special Committee.  I look forward to working with this committee and I am sure we will get maximum co-operation from the Opposition parties to have a comprehensive child care Bill enacted as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Deputy Howlin for his contribution on behalf of his party.  I would like to assure him and the House that in drafting the Bill the Government have the benefit and advice of the highest law officers in the State.  So far as humanly possible, every effort has been made to ensure that the legislation does the job it is designed to do, that is, to overcome the technical defects identified by the Supreme Court.  Similarly, great care has been taken to protect the status of existing fit persons orders.  I want to assure Deputy Howlin and the House that the Children Bill, 1989, is not a replacement, nor has it been intended as a replacement for the Child Care Bill, 1989.  As I said earlier, this Bill is a direct response to the effect of the Supreme Court decision of Thursday last.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan, in a wide ranging contribution, talked about the high cost of people having recourse to the higher courts in our land.  He may be able to suggest ways of changing this.  I thought section 6 is going a long way to provide maximum recourse and flexibility in the case of orders made or otherwise.</P>
    <P>As regards amendments which have been tabled by the Opposition, I intend to respond to each of them on the Committee Stage later tonight.  Every Deputy must look at this Bill on its merits and at its purpose, and then he will have a clear over-view of the comprehensive Child Care Bill which we will debate in the all party Oireachtas committee later.</P>
    <P>Finally, we will be going into Committee Stage at 8.30 p.m. and I look forward to debating each amendment put forward at that time.  I look forward to having the maximum co-operation of the House in ensuring that this Bill is enacted as quickly as possible.  Various references have been made to Deputy Shatter's book <i>Family Law in Ireland</i>.  I would like <Col N="1782" /> to quote from page 411 of that book. Deputy Shatter's own opinion was, until last Thursday:</P>
    <P>Nowadays, the overwhelming majority of such proceedings are brought by health boards and in practice, a health board is usually named as a fit person, although no express authority is conferred by the Health Acts to so act.  Section 5 (1) of the Health Act, 1970, does, however, provide that a health board is a &ldquo;body corporate' and as, undoubtedly, part of a health board's function is &ldquo;to provide for the reception or protection of poor children&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, appalled by the level of emigration revealed by the <Col N="1783" /> recent Central Statistics Office report, calls upon the Government (1) to take action to stem this haemorrhage (2) to make realistic funding available for advice and support services for our emigrants abroad and (3) to engage in purposeful diplomatic action to persuade the United States authorities to legislate in favour of our out-of-status young emigrants in the US, now numbering tens of thousands.</P>
    <P>I move the motion in the names of Deputies Deenihan, Connor, Bradford and myself.  We in this House, and indeed in the country generally, have to address the problem of emigration as a matter of urgency because otherwise we are in danger of losing a whole generation of young people and, of course, with it the vitality and the dynamism of our society. The result is that our society will remain attached to a deep rooted conservatism which may prove to be unable to make the adjustments and meet the challenges of the next century.  This House will have failed in its duty to the people if we allow that to happen.  Of course, the scale of emigration in Ireland is by any standards startling.  In the 12 months to April 1989 46,000 people left Ireland, an increase of 14,000 on the previous year.  Only in the last 24 hours there has been a study by Dr. Damien Courtney of the Regional Technical College in Cork which says that the size of the problem may have been underestimated in the census in April last and that the number who left may have been as high as 52,000 between April 1988 and April 1989.  According to the Davy Kelleher McCarthy report of 1987 the declining birth rate plus the increase in emigration will result in a negative population growth in the year 2011.  The same report estimates that 500,000 people &mdash; that is one-sixth of our present population in size &mdash; will emigrate in the next 25 years.  These will be predominantly young people.  Unless we change we will decide that their future is not in this country.</P>
    <P>In the seventies Ireland had a rapidly expanding and a youthful population. <Col N="1784" /> Indeed, it was the constant boast and it was put forward as a challenge to the politicians and the general structures of the country that as half our population was under 25 we had a difficult task in front of us.</P>
    <P>I neglected to say at the start of my contribution that I wish to share my time with Deputies Deenihan, Connor, Reynolds and Barrett.  My time will be ten minutes and the others will have 7½ minutes each with the permission of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that satisfactory? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Ten years ago we used to boast that half our population was under 25 and this provided us with a challenge for the future.  The Davy Kelleher McCarthy report said that in 1970 the average age of the population of Ireland was 26 years.  However, by the year 2011 the average age of the population will be 37 years, an increase of 11 years which will make us, by present standards, one of the oldest populations in Europe whereas we used to boast, ten years ago, of having the youngest population in Europe.  Of course, the effects of that on Irish society will be so dramatic in terms of our sociological, political, economic and psychological development that it is almost incomprehensible to us now and is something we must not allow to happen.  We must act now.  This House, this country and this Government &mdash; I use that in the very broadest sense as I do not necessarily mean the people opposite us tonight &mdash; must do something to turn that tide back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of a debate such as this is to focus on the action which can tackle the situation in a planned and in a comprehensive manner.  I would hope when we are finished with this debate tomorrow night that we will not feel we have done something for emigration or to cure the problem of emigration and that, having had the debate, we can feel that all is now well, that we can go home and sit back into our comfortable chairs and forget about it.  This is something that should be on the top of all our priorities whether <Col N="1785" /> we are Labour, Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil, whether we are in Government or out of Government, that as concerned people we should have this as the top of our agenda.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons that young people and, indeed, people of all ages are leaving Ireland is to find the work which is not available here.  It is a self-evident truth that we are not providing sufficient jobs year in year out to absorb the numbers who are leaving school and who are looking for work.  We must improve both the number of jobs available and also the range of employment because many of our highly educated young people seek a challenge which we are unable to offer them.  We are educating young people to a very high level, to third degree and sometimes beyond that, to doctorates, and they are not contributing to the growth of this country in the future because we are not providing the jobs here for them.  Even if you drop that third level cream off them and say that they may go abroad, they may advance themselves in their professions and they may come back here.  I think this is true.  I do not think we should be simplistic about it and say they are lost forever because many of them will come back and will make a very valuable contribution to the building of the economy and the country. Below that there is a level of school leavers, the 17 and 18 year olds &mdash; sometimes prepared, sometimes unprepared &mdash; leaving the country and their chances of coming back are less than those of higher education.  The taxpayers here are educating people to a high level, a higher level, indeed, than many of the countries to which they are going.  The talents of those young people are available to those other economies who did not bear the burden &mdash; that is a selfish way of putting it as I do not really mean it that way &mdash; of the cost of their education.  Many of our highly educated young people are going abroad to seek a challenge which we are unable to provide for them here.</P>
    <P>One of the things that needs to be done lies in tax reform.  The Commission on Taxation report showed that other smaller economies such as New Zealand, <Col N="1786" /> which reformed their tax systems, stemmed the flow of emigration.  That clearly demonstrates that a piecemeal reform will not achieve the objective we desire. I do not have to repeat here a point which has been frequently made from these benches over the past number of years, that unless we do something about tax reform in this country we will continue to have a disgruntled workforce at home and a huge haemorrhage of our young people abroad.</P>
    <P>The European Commission in its annual report published last week suggests that a fundamental shift in Irish taxation policy should include an easing of the personal tax levels.  These reforms are crucial as we start preparing for the challenge of 1992.  In regard to 1992 &mdash; and I will come back to this in another debate &mdash; I am disturbed to see in the last six months indications, including one yesterday from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that the goals which were set when the Single European Act was passed for 1992 are now being shifted, or being put further away, and that there is not the same political will among the nations of the 12 &mdash; I include our Government in that as one of the frontrunners lacking in the will &mdash; to see that the goals established under the Single European Act be achieved by 1992.  Their views on this do not now seem to be as strongly held as they were a number of years ago.</P>
    <P>The Commission's report makes the point that the increased Structural Funds will help to compensate for the physical disadvantage affecting nations such as Ireland, but our successes will depend on the response of private enterprise to a more competitive market.  The Structural Funds will help us here.  They are not at the level we would wish, but even at that lower level they will not be maintained unless we subscribe to the political goals that were laid down in the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>We must also, as a matter or urgency, reform our political system and make it more efficient, responsible and relevant to the changing needs of Irish society. We must listen to the voices and the words of many of our young emigrants. <Col N="1787" /> The two Deputies here next to me plus other Fine Gael Deputies have been to Boston, New York, Washington, London, Manchester and Liverpool in the last 12 months to meet these young people.  I am sure they will agree that you hear a cynicism and a defeatism which is paralysing and promotes a sense of futility among those young people.  They leave this country not solely because they feel Ireland can offer them no economic future but also because they are convinced that social and political attitudes in Ireland are firmly embedded in the past.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has hinted that his party accepts the need for reform of the Dáil. He must do more than hint and every Member of this House must co-operate in making the political process more effective.  This includes reform at local as well as national level.  The situation in East Germany shows what can happen when people lose confidence in the system; the same is happening here but it is not brought to the world's attention by TV cameras.  Every week nearly 1,000 people vote &ldquo;no confidence&rdquo; in our system by emigrating.  On the immediate practical level we must support the various action groups, commissions and resource centres who provide advice, accommodation and a sense of community for our emigrants in various countries.  We must maintain a direct link with our people abroad and help, where possible, their material needs.  On the social level it is vital to maintain that contact which facilitates the return of our emigrants.</P>
    <P>I recommend the guide to London prepared by the Irish group for the assistance of Irish youth.  It is an essential document for every young emigrant, particularly those in the 16 to 18 age group.  It applies to London, where the most deprived of our people seem to go, sometimes with no more than a £10 note.  They have no knowledge of the kind of society they are going to.  The Minister might confirm that the Government will be providing extra money to help the centres in America in the same way as those being helped in London.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1788" /> It is not just a question of losing population in a general way.  It is the fact of losing a whole generation who should be participating in the next phase of our development as a people and as a democratic State.  We must address the problem of emigration as a matter of urgency. If we do not this House will have failed in its duty to our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time available to me I call on the Government to introduce more radical and imaginative steps to provide the opportunities to keep our people at home and to stem the haemorrhage of emigration.  The attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party in government during the past two and a half years was that if public spending and borrowing were brought under control we could create the right climate for the growth of job opportunities in the private sector. This expectation has not been fulfilled to date to any significant extent, resulting in 46,000 of our people having to leave in 1988 to seek employment elsewhere.  This is a national disaster and represents the almost total failure of the Fianna Fáil Party's policy towards solving the problem. We need a major intervention programme if we are serious about keeping our young people at home and providing them with worth-while job opportunities.</P>
      <P>We need a restructuring of the apprenticeship scheme.  It is as difficult for many school leavers to get an apprenticeship as to enter a third level college.  Promised money from the Structural Funds for education should be targeted on the training of our unskilled youth.  This sector is the one most at risk when they emigrate. Meaningful programmes for them should be introduced in our post-primary schools.  A sound education is the key to their future, not only here but when they leave.  Unplanned cuts in the post-primary sector, especially in the public sector of education, have caused huge problems for both teacher and students during the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The funding to date for advice and support services must be acknowledged and I recognise the role played by the <Col N="1789" /> Minister for Labour.  The £500,000 allocated to the DÍON committee in 1989 should serve to improve existing services in Great Britain.  However, this funding must be maintained for 1990 and increased if possible.  The remit of DÍON should be extended to include the provision of funding for hostel accommodation. Suitable and reasonably priced accommodation is a major problem for many of our young emigrants.</P>
    <P>The promise made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs during his recent visit to the USA to provide funding through the Irish consulates there for emigrant services is encouraging.  The Minister when replying might say when he proposes to announce details of the extent of the funding and when it will be made available. I would also suggest that DÍON type committees be set up to allocate funds in the US.  I have been in contact with both the Irish Immigration Reform Movement and Catholic charities in the Archdiocese of New York.  Both these organisations are providing invaluable services for the undocumented Irish in New York and other centres.  The Irish Immigration Reform Movement have already received substantial funding from New York City, New York State and the American Fund.  A comprehensive funding application has been submitted to the Department of Foreign Affairs by the Irish Immigration Reform Movement. This organisation must be singled out for special mention.  They more than anybody else put the whole issue of the plight of the undocumented Irish on the political agenda in the US.  They should receive at least $100,000 to improve their existing office accommodation, hotline services and the hiring of full-time personnel.</P>
    <P>Monsignor James Murray and Catholic charities also deserve special mention for their Project Irish Outreach which provides information and counselling to new Irish immigrants.  It is the only privately funded, full-time Irish advisory and direct service office counselling newly arrived Irish immigrants in the New York area.  The project offers advice on matters of immigration, health, social <Col N="1790" /> services, maternity care, personal counselling and social matters.  The staff includes four immigrant chaplains from Ireland who live in areas where there is a high concentration of newly arrived young Irish people.  The scheme cost over $500,000 to run this year and is deserving of substantial funding when moneys are being allocated.</P>
    <P>I would also mention the work of the Irish Pastoral Centre in Boston.  Sister Veroncia Dobson is now head of this centre and two Irish priests will take up service there in the very near future.  To date all funding is from the Archdiocese of Boston and, while a major fund raising campaign has taken place this year, its financial future is far from sound.  Unless help is obtained from Ireland the centre could find itself in serious difficulty next year.</P>
    <P>Immigration reform will be dealt with in the 101st Congress.  Our objective must be to ensure that any immigration reform legislation enacted is as beneficial as possible to both undocumented and potential Irish immigrants.  There are a number of Bills before Congress at the moment.  The Kennedy/Simpson/Simon passed through the US Senate in July.  In its present form it would do little for either undocumented or potential Irish immigrants.  Congressman Brian Donnelly introduced a Bill two weeks ago which calls for an extension of the original Donnelly visa programme of 1986 for five years, with 15,000 visas to be awarded each year. The legislation would also allow for the creation of a new lottery with one application per applicant.  The original Donnelly visa scheme and its extension under the 1988 Immigration Act was and is of great benefit to Irish immigrants. This proposal would be of similar benefit.</P>
    <P>Congressmen Ben Gillman introduced a Bill last March which if enacted would allow undocumented immigrants to obtain legal immigrant status by serving in the US National Guard for three years. This Bill could be of benefit to the Irish.</P>
    <P>Congressmen Engel, Schumer and Fish are expected to introduce further Bills within the next few weeks.  Two of <Col N="1791" /> these are expected to be very favourable to the undocumented Irish.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee on immigration in the House will consider these Bills in the new year.  Congressmen Bruce Morrison, chairman of the sub-committee, is very anxious to bring forward more liberal legislation on immigration.  He has been extensively lobbied by Irish-American groups such as the AOH and the IIRM, as well as by the Minister during his recent visit to America.  As he is the main player because of his important position as chairman of this vital sub-committee, the Government must maintain close contact with him to ensure that our case is adequately represented.  The time is now ripe for change in US legislation on emigration.  Nothing will be handed to the Irish on a silver plate and an intense and united lobbying effort by the Irish-American community on behalf of the undocumented Irish and by the Irish Government is necessary if we are to pass the kind of legislation that would be favourable to our emigrants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a comprehensive motion and, with your permission, I will confine myself to one aspect, the one dealing with the extension of special welfare and advice services to our emigrants, particularly in the United States.  Special services for our emigrants in the United States are required urgently.  The proposers of the motion are primarily members of the Fine Gael parliamentary backbench committee on emigration and we propose that these services are creatively designed to respond to the real needs of the emigrants.  The Government have completely ignored the needs and the acute vulnerability of the young illegals in the United States.  However, the decision to provide funds &mdash; however inadequate &mdash; to establish welfare and advice services in some US centres at least is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was part of a delegation with three of my colleagues who visited the United States on a special emigration fact-finding mission last September and we made a special point of meeting and consulting <Col N="1792" /> the groups who, despite being ignored by the Government here, have carried on an advice and help outreach to the young Irish.  I refer to the church Outreach programme and the very good work carried on by the Irish Immigration Reform Movement.  More importantly, we went out among the young illegals and this meant going to Irish bars which have proliferated all over New York where the young Irish now live.  It meant going to GAA matches and on to building sites in places like east New York, not the most pleasant place in the world, and the north Bronx.  In many ways it resembled election canvassing but it gave us an authentic insight into the problems, fears and anxieties of the average young emigrant, an insight that Minister Collins or his entourage could not get, given the safe distance he and they kept from the average young fellow on a building site who looks with trepidation at every stranger who approaches him and the average young girl working in a badly paid, isolated job as an <i>au pair</i> or nanny.</P>
    <P>In a general way, arising from our meetings and discussions, we found that at least 90 per cent of the young people we met left this country because they had to.  Almost all agreed that they had no choice.  Well over 90 per cent of them were preoccupied with their illegal status and they agreed that it hindered them in a major way from leading a normal life in the United States.  The majority of them were unaware of their rights in terms of protection at work, rights to health care or to protection against exploitation.  These rights exist notwithstanding their legal status.  There was also a marked reluctance among the young emigrants to use the advice and welfare centres that existed, particularly those established by the city authorities. I want to pay tribute to people like Mayor Koch who, in a very enlightened way, have established emigrant outreach services to emigrants from all countries, particularly those who are illegal.  Nevertheless, the average young Irish emigrants are frightened or suspicious of these services but, fortunately, they are <Col N="1793" /> less frightened and less apprehensive of the IIRM or the Church.</P>
    <P>One other outstanding conclusion we came to was the deep sense of alienation towards Ireland and its political institutions which permeates the outlook and thinking of the average young emigrant. This arises because they feel let down, that the Government here are glad to be rid of them, and indeed there is a lot of truth in that.  I will repeat what I said in the Seanad over a year ago.  What would our unemployment figures be if the 46,000 people who left this country last year or the 50,000 who left it the year before were added to the often frightening figures of our unemployed live register?  Where would the control of public spending be if we had to fund the countless millions it would take to provide them with even subsistence social welfare?</P>
    <P>It seems that the Government are to respond to the massive problems solved for them by emigration in a way that can only be described as mean, tardy and wretched.  The provision of a sum of money for next year varies from £100,000 to £500,000 depending on who is talking. The Fianna Fáil Ministers usually refer to the lower figure and the Progressive Democrat Ministers usually refer to the higher one.  Both figures are pitiably inadequate given the size of the problems we have to tackle.  However, we agree that it is a start and we welcome it.  We may make suggestions as to how this money should be spent to help our lost generation in the United States.</P>
    <P>The system operating in the United States should be operated to the maximum, for example.  The existing agencies, the IIRM, the Catholic charities in New York and the other church outreach programmes in the major US centres should be funded for their existing work.  Money should be provided to allow them to expand their services.  All our consular offices in the various US cities should be properly staffed to co-ordinate and help the work of the voluntary agencies.  The priorities must be confidential, easily available advice centres to advise the emigrant on the various <Col N="1794" /> aspects of the law &mdash; for example, the Donnelly and Berman visa programmes and any other regulations that may affect them, such as the law on workers' sanction or the laws relating to exploitation at work.</P>
    <P>We must also use these funds to produce leaflets and publications that contain reliable and accurate information on emigration procedures, health and social services and education opportunities for the new and young Irish who live in the United States and who may wish to better themselves.  We should establish a unit for investigating reported places of exploitation of new immigrants to make sure that such people are fully informed of their rights and their right to redress.  They should also be informed of their rights in the event of injury at work or illness induced at work.</P>
    <P>There is clear evidence that many of our illegals are exploited by unscrupulous members of the legal profession in the United States who are exacting large sums of money from these unsuspecting young people on the promise that they can legalise them, which is usually impossible.  We can contribute to removing these unscrupulous shysters from the payroll of the young Irish immigrants if we put together a list of reputable solicitors &mdash; they call them attorneys &mdash; and make this information available to any emigrant who may wish to take legal advice to change their visa to a J1, J2 or H1 while they are in the United States.</P>
    <P>There is a need to look closely at certain fund raising in the United States which is ostensibly presented as being for emigrant services.  Quite clearly, some of this fund raising has nothing to do with immigrant help or welfare but has a lot to do with subversion or probably worse. Our diplomatic and consular service in the United States should co-ordinate and monitor, as far as possible, all such fund raising activities.  The fund raisers for emigrants whose bona fides are suspect should be isolated and information about such sources made available to the older Irish community, which is very important when you are talking about fund raising. Of course that information should also <Col N="1795" /> be made available to the new Irish community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of emigration can be approached from many different angles and viewpoints.  We must first define exactly what it is we are talking about.  Even if we had the Utopian dream of full employment there would still be people emigrating.  These would include people seeking new experiences, new eductional opportunities, a better climate and lifestyle and those who view emigration as affording them better reward for their efforts.  If that were all we had to deal with we would indeed be a lucky nation.  Once and for all let us put an end to the ridiculous contention that many people emigrate through choice. There are some emigrating through choice but they bear no relationship whatever to the total numbers.  Many people who are employed at home are leaving, not so much because they are low paid but because we have the most vicious and penal taxation system within the EC.  The result is that many people in work at the end of the week finish up with the same amount or less than they would receive on the dole.  That destroys the spirit, leading to the often heard cry: why should I bother; why should I work when the incentives are not there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must first accept facts.  Then we can discuss ways and means of altering the position.  First, we must seriously examine the activities of the corporate sector.  They pay a very low rate of taxation. In return they are expected to engage or employ more people.  That is not happening, with the result that the trend is away from manpower toward mechanisation.  That is understandable when one realises that our system penalises employers for providing employment. Official statements will deny that but the reality is immediately evident from those on the ground.  Indeed employment incentives are so tied up in red tape and form-filling employers simply do not bother.  A happy medium must be struck.  Surely it is not beyond <Col N="1796" /> the ability of our planners to provide a simple, fool-proof system?</P>
    <P>We must take a close look at our taxation system.  Everybody is aware that it is in a complete mess and constitutes one of the most penal worldwide.  All we are doing is tinkering with the various bands while announcing that there is more money being put in people's pockets.  The entire base of the system is wrong.  Unless far-reaching reforms are implemented there will be no incentive to our people to work and remain at home.</P>
    <P>We politicians will have to realise that many of our pronouncements on emigration and employment are being greeted with cynicism and total disbelief. The daily announcement of several hundreds of jobs by such and such a year may satisfy ministerial cravings for good publicity but those who are unemployed, on their way to the boat and train, simply regard it as rubbish.  Announcing official employment figures in order to demonstrate that unemployment is falling while ignoring the emigration figures does not fool anybody.  Charging emigrants £5 for the privilege of emigrating and treating them as tourists when they return to visit their families merely adds insult to injury.</P>
    <P>Equally solemn statements at election times proclaiming that one party or another will end emigration must cease. I was an emigrant in the United States for three and a half years.  I know that our emigrants there do not want this issue treated as a political football.  It is people who are involved and who are being hurt. We must remember that people who emigrate can be lonely and vulnerable.</P>
    <P>It is high time the Members of this House put their heads together in a practical way in an endeavour to solve this problem affecting, if not destroying, every family in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Since Fianna Fáil took over the reins of office in March 1987 well over 100,000 of our people have left this country.  Given the negative attitude of the Government toward the need for radical change in our structures, there is nothing to suggest that this unacceptable <Col N="1797" /> trend will not continue.  A great many of our young people have left, leaving sadness in family homes and destroying communities within which the vitality and enthusiasm of young people is so essential.</P>
      <P>We are the only European country where total employment is lower today than in the twenties.  Recent statistics published by the Central Statistics Office show that the total number of people at work fell by 1,000 between April 1988 and April 1989, evidence &mdash; despite all the public relations hype &mdash; that the Government are not tackling the problem of increasing the number of jobs available to those seeking employment. The sooner Government Ministers stop distorting the real figures and tackle the problem the sooner we will stop the massive brain drain now and in the future.</P>
      <P>In the short time available to me I should like to outline some of the changes necessary in order to create a positive environment for employment.  The creation of sufficient jobs constitutes the only way of stopping forced emigration.</P>
      <P>Recent increases in interest rates and the upward trend in the rate of inflation are a cause of great concern.  The Government must take immediate steps to reverse these trends and also to reduce costs to industry in many areas such as transport, fuel and insurance premiums. We are fast approaching the year 1992. The reality is that there will not be investment in manufacturing and service employment here unless we have low costs accompanied by a high level of productivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael have offered on many occasions to participate in an all party committee on tax reform.  The Government have consistently refused that offer despite the obvious need therefor.  In addition to reducing high levels of personal income tax we must introduce incentives for employers to expand their workforce and encourage greater investment particularly in manufacturing industry.  Our tax code investment funds &mdash; be they pensions or otherwise &mdash; should be encouraged to invest in manufacturing industry, in particular in small <Col N="1798" /> companies.  I propose that the provisions of the Finance Act, 1982 be amended to allow tax relief on interest paid by individuals on a loan raised to buy shares in a company established under the business expansion scheme.  This relief should be extended up to the amount of the unused portion of an individual's entitlement to tax relief in respect of mortgage interest.  Of course a realistic ceiling on tax relief for interest would have to obtain.  I propose that individuals connected with a firm should be entitled to claim tax relief on investments made by them in a research and development company sponsored by their firms.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that the need to reduce costs is an essential part of the strategy for employment growth.  The frustration of employees as a result of the high rates of personal taxation is understandable. This, together with the increase in mortgage interest rates, will lead to continuous demands for high wage increases. We must examine ways and means of encouraging greater employee participation in profit-sharing schemes.  This could be achieved either by way of bonus schemes based on productivity or employee share ownership.  A recent survey carried out in the United States shows that 10 per cent of all US workers are now involved in a scheme known as the employee share ownership programme. This scheme has been helped considerable by Congress passing a law giving generous tax advantages to workers involved in the scheme.  Why cannot we have the same here?  Surely it makes sense that, when a company is doing well, it should be possible for employees to share in the profits rather than be forced consistently to seek high wage increases?  There are numerous examples of similar schemes having been successful in different parts of the world. We should commence the process here beginning with employees in commercial State bodies.</P>
    <P>It is obvious to everybody that the unskilled worker is daily being replaced by the machine, that the need for greater investment, particularly in third level education, is vital if we are to provide <Col N="1799" /> our young people, in particular, with the skills and training to meet the challenges of tomorrow's world.  Whether we like it or not resources will have to be found to ensure that more and more of our people be given access to third-level education. Equally we must ensure that those at present on the unemployment list be given the opportunity of retraining &mdash; and I mean real training &mdash; so that they will have an opportunity of getting gainful employment.  Recent statistics show that 4 per cent of those with third-level education are unemployed, a figure well below the national average.</P>
    <P>The Government speak daily of the need to prepare for 1992; rightly so.  If we are to avail of the opportunities obtaining in Europe surely the first thing we must do is provide our people with language skills?  Yet there is the disgraceful position obtaining in which a tiny percentage of our population only are given the opportunity of learning a continental language.  Surely it is time we provided the resources so that such continental languages can be taught at primary level?  Programmes should also be devised for those who had not the opportunity, while at school, to avail of language skills to do so now.  How can we expect to compete in the European marketplace if we cannot converse with those with whom we want to do business?</P>
    <P>We have spoken sufficiently long about the possibility of the sale of shares in State companies in order to raise capital for the expansion of such companies.  It is time a date was set for the Government to report to both Houses of the Oireachtas on the possibilities, terms, advantages and disadvantages of such a move.  There is no reason commercial State bodies should not be allowed and encouraged to go into the marketplace, particularly in Europe, using their skills and expertise to compete for business in order to expand employment opportunities. The lack of capital for such expansion has managed to strangle many of these companies and the situation should no longer be tolerated.  We should also look at how employees are paid for <Col N="1800" /> their efforts in these bodies.  I mentioned earlier that we can begin to rectify this situation by promoting profit-sharing schemes to encourage those involved to increase production.  Why should those working in commercial State bodies be tied into a situation where their earnings are much lower than the private sector? This is no way to encourage expansion and development.</P>
    <P>Over the last number of years there has been tremendous growth in the numbers engaged in part-time employment.  We have failed to recognise this from the point of view of altering our taxation and social welfare codes to cater for this and the end result has been a growth in the black economy and a failure to protect the rights of those workers, either by the rates being paid or the hours being worked.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Government realise that time is running out and we cannot allow <Col N="1801" /> the scandal of emigration to plague us for much longer.  It is a public disgrace that in a country with a small population such as Ireland, we cannot supply sufficient job opportunities for the relatively small numbers seeking work.  If we adopt a positive approach to 1992, then we will succeed, if we do not the brain drain will continue.  I read recently that in 1992 there will be 25 per cent fewer school-leavers in Britain; in Germany there will be 47 per cent fewer school-leavers by 1992, and in Italy there will be 56 per cent.  These countries will be crying out for young, well-educated and skilled workers.  Ireland will have these young people and if we have not got the jobs to give them then the British, German and Italian economies will benefit from the skills that our young people can offer them.</P>

      <P>I understand there are copies so they should be circulated shortly.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has overall responsibility for emigration matters, will deal with the question of Government measures on behalf of Irish emigrants in the United States and elsewhere.  I propose, therefore, to concentrate on the first two items in the motion &mdash; those calling for Government action to reduce emigration and to provide realistic funding for emigrant advisory services.</P>
      <P>As public representatives all of us must be concerned about a situation where people who are unable to find work here &mdash; or if they have jobs but for some other reason, such as personal taxation &mdash; feel obliged to seek employment elsewhere. I fully understand and share the genuine concerns of the Members who have already spoken to this motion.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Government I can assure them that we are equally concerned about recent trends in emigration. I can also assure them of the Government's determination to come to grips with the situation and of our total commitment to redoubling our efforts directed at stimulating and accelerating the job-creation process so as to reduce the pressures which force people to look for work abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With 22,000 people registered as unemployed and a potential for growth in the labour force of about 25,000 every year this is a formidable task.  Even if we <Col N="1803" /> had the resources it would be very shortsighted of the Government to indulge in a free-spending spree of relief schemes merely to keep people off the live register. We must also avoid the temptation of treating the symptom instead of the disease simply because we find the cure unpalatable or unpopular.</P>
    <P>The hard fact that must be faced is that the one and only effective solution to involuntary emigration is to create the right conditions at home in terms of job opportunities, personal tax levels, career prospects and quality of life which will attract and absorb the annual outflows from the education sector and those on the live register.  This is a monumental task and there are no easy options or quick-fix solutions.</P>
    <P>Of course, we should not allow ourselves to be overawed or intimidated by such a challenge.  Indeed, the Government's record clearly shows that not only are we facing this challenge head-on but that our efforts over the last few years to revitalise the economy and to maximise employment growth and job opportunities are now beginning to bear fruit.</P>
    <P>All the economic indicators clearly vindicate the Government's macro-economic strategy, as set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  The cornerstone of that strategy is the twin objectives of correcting the imbalances in the public finances and restoring and strengthening the competitiveness of the economy.  Only in this way is it possible to lay the foundations for strong, organic and self-sustaining growth in national output and job creation.</P>
    <P>Because of the resolute action taken by the Government order has been restored to the public finances. Exchequer borrowing has been brought under effective control and we are on target to reducing it to manageable levels.  GNP has been rising rapidly and as a recent EC Commission report now confirms we have one of the fastest growth rates in the Community.  Exports are hitting all-time records and independent commentators and experts are forecasting sustained, robust economic <Col N="1804" /> growth for the foreseeable future. Inflation and interest rates are well below those of some of our largest trading partners and industry's order books and expectations are continuing at a high level.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Government, through careful and courageous policy measures, are succeeding in creating the most favourable climate and conditions to maintain the momentum of economic development and for embarking on the second phase of their overall strategy for accelerating the job creation process.</P>
    <P>The creation of new jobs is the primary objective of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  That programme has lowered Exchequer borrowing so that interest rates have been cut; has reduced inflation; brought about moderate pay settlements; improved the competitiveness of the economy generally, which has boosted the value of exports by close to 40 per cent and industrial production by over 25 per cent in the past two years; and has enabled personal tax rates to be reduced.  All of these developments have been designed to create the conditions in which new jobs could be created and existing jobs maintained.</P>
    <P>The programme, and the resurgence of economic activity with which it has been associated, has brought about a transformation of our employment performance. Whereas between 1980 and 1986 there was a net loss of jobs in the economy of between 70,000 and 80,000, the latest Central Statistics Office estimates show that in the two years to last April, total employment grew by 10,000. These estimates, taking into account variations in numbers on special employment schemes, indicate that, in each of the two most recent 12 month periods for which figures are available, there was a growth in employment of around 5,000.  This compares with a projected annual rate of increase in the optimistic scenario presented by the NESC in <i>Strategy for Development</i>, which had the support of all the social partners, of only 3,500.  In fact, the number at work in April 1989 was similar to NESC's projection for next year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1805" /> The growth in employment over the past two years, moreover, took place against the background of retrenchment in the public sector.  Allowing for the necessary reduction in the public sector &mdash; a course of action which had wide agreement in this House &mdash; the latest Labour Force Survey points to a substantial net increase, of the order of 35,000, in the number of private non-farm jobs in the period since the programme strategy was put in place.  This is, by any standards, a remarkable out-turn. It shows, that the policy measures taken, allied with the responsible actions of the parties to the programme, have stimulated job-creation and helped preserve viable jobs.  In this regard, the 40 per cent reduction in redundancies in the first three quarters of 1989 is a most encouraging trend.  The more recent indicators of employment are uniformly favourable, suggesting further progress on employment since the survey.  In the second quarter of this year, the number of manufacturing jobs rose by 1,200 &mdash; after allowing for the normal seasonal pick-up &mdash; on top of the 6,000 gain in the previous 12 months.  Building and construction employment is advancing strongly, as borne out by the 11 per cent increase in the index for September.</P>
    <P>The extent of the recovery in autonomous employment over the past few years has been masked by the impact of the measures necessary to restore stable public finances and create an environment for growth, but these difficult decisions are now clearly bearing fruit. As the contraction in the public sector becomes less acute, this dramatic growth in self-sustaining jobs should be increasingly reflected in overall employment performance.  Independent assessments bear out the Government's view that, if we stick to the responsible course followed in the past few years and avoid actions which would damage our international competitiveness, we can build substantially on this progress in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>Another indication of the improving employment situation is the reduction in the live register of unemployed.  That <Col N="1806" /> total is now at its lowest level for five years and is now over 32,000 lower than two-and-a-half-years ago.  These positive trends demonstrate clearly that the Government policies are working to create more jobs and reduce unemployment. These trends will accelerate and will inevitably reduce the rate of involuntary emigration, particularly when allowance is made for the impact next year of additional resources from the Community's Structural Funds, under the <i>National Development Plan.</i></P>
    <P>Although employment trends and prospects are now the most favourable for decades, there can be no room for complacency and I can assure the House that there is no relaxation of the Government's efforts to expand employment. Towards this end a special Ministerial Committee on Employment was established by the Government earlier this year.  The committee comprises the Ministers for Education, Environment, Industry and Commerce and Social Welfare and is chaired by me.  Its remit is to consider and bring forward proposals for increasing employment and reducing unemployment.</P>
    <P>Deputies will already be aware of the package of employment measures which I announced recently which were based on the committee's recommendations. The committee are actively considering a wide range of possible initiatives with a view to putting further recommendations to the Government.</P>
    <P>Despite the most favourable outcome of all these initiatives it is obvious that there will be a sizeable imbalance between labour supply and demand for many years yet.  The ESRI, and other agencies, suggest that emigration will continue for the foreseeable future but at a declining rate.</P>
    <P>The Government's view is that as long as significant numbers are interested in seeking work abroad they are entitled to receive the best possible information and advice to enable them to make an informed choice and to make a satisfactory and successful transition to the destination of their choice.  Indeed, under the EC regulations on free movement <Col N="1807" /> of workers we are obliged to provide information and advisory services in line with the Community's policy to promote labour mobility.</P>
    <P>I have always held the view that all aspiring emigrants should first be appraised of the employment and training opportunities available to them at home before deciding to emigrate.  I believe that FÁS are in the best position, through their national network of offices, to outline the various options open to them.  I also believe that the best prospects lie in ensuring that FÁS are equipped to provide a reliable full-time facility with uniform standards of service throughout the country rather than putting resources into voluntary organisations most of whose services are only part-time and the quality of which can vary considerably depending on the level of voluntary effort and the commitment or otherwise of the people involved.  My objective is to see that FÁS services to the public are developed to the highest standards, in line with the resources available to them.</P>
    <P>In order to remove any doubts about FÁS's role and responsibilities in that respect I issued a set of guidelines to FÁS in June this year setting out clearly their functions and duties in relation to services for persons interested in employment abroad.  The guidelines are based on the principles of discouragement of unplanned and unprepared emigration and the need for national policy to be supportive of EC policy to facilitate free movement of workers.  Essentially, what is involved is putting in place organised pre-departure advisory services for persons considering job-opportunities in the EC and who are properly prepared for such a move while, at the same time, discouraging those who are ill-prepared, illequipped, immature or who appear to be vulnerable or at risk.</P>
    <P>I have instructed FÁS to ensure EC vacancy notices are displayed in FÁS offices and that notices should be displayed advising job-seekers that information supplied under the EC sponsored <Col N="1808" /> SEDOC vacancy-exchange system is available on request.</P>
    <P>I have also suggested that liaison between FÁS and the employment services in the main destination countries should be developed by means of bilateral contacts and that, in co-operation with other relevant agencies, FÁS should assist Irish nationals abroad wishing to return to work here or to set up business at home.  FÁS have recently reviewed their services for intending emigrants and are in the process of developing them further.</P>
    <P>It is clear that those for whom emigration poses the greatest danger are the young, unskilled, early school leavers. Here there is a double problem; we must try to dissuade such persons from emigrating and we must try to persuade them to participate in further education and training so as to acquire skills which will enable them to earn a living.  For many, their experience of the formal education system has been an unhappy one.</P>
    <P>In January last, with my colleague, the Minister for Education, I launched the Youthreach programme.  This is an imaginative and major intervention.  It provides unqualified early school leavers who fail to find employment with up to two years further education and training. The programmes are innovative and flexible, enabling them to be tailored to suit individual needs.  An allowance is paid during the entire period.  It is our hope that this action, together with the withdrawal by the British authorities of unemployment assistance from young people, will result in unqualified persons under the age of 18 opting to remain at home instead of risking emigration.</P>
    <P>DÍON has been referred to by a number of speakers.  A small percentage of Irish people who emigrate do get into difficulties &mdash; often, I must say because of lack of proper preparation beforehand. On the advice of DÍON, the British based committee which is chaired by the Labour Attache at the London Embassy and advises me on welfare matters in relation to Irish workers in Britain, I am making available grants totalling £500,000 this year, to non-statutory <Col N="1809" /> organisations providing emergency help and advice to Irish people in Britain.  This is a 100 per cent increase on the 1988 grant and a 320 per cent on the 1986 figure.  The dramatic increase in the DÍON grants has been achieved against the background of a very difficult budgetary situation and represents an earnest of the Government's concern for our less fortunate emigrants.  In the near future I hope to be able to announce the final list of grants for this year and to be briefed fully by DÍON on the up-to-date position on the needs of emigrants to Britain and their likely financial needs for 1990.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies asked about continuing to assist DÍON in 1990. Deputies will be aware that the Book of Estimates will be published shortly.  I should like to tell them that it is our intention to try to maintain existing services. Members will have met representatives of the DÍON committee on their visits here.  They have not yet prepared their programme for 1990 but I discussed this matter with them two weeks ago when I met them in London and toured some of the centres that are in difficulty. They received money from groups here and have considered how they can work with local authorities in various boroughs in London, and elsewhere, to try to raise more money for centres, hostels and so on.  Primarily they are anxious that we should fund their full-time social workers, welfare workers and those who are working on the streets in a number of areas in London.  We are anxious to continue to work with them.</P>
    <P>Through FÁS we have done some physical work on the centres such as that in Camden Town.  There are two areas about which we must be careful.  In the debate tonight we are dealing with the young Irish people who emigrate but we must also consider the need of older Irish people to use the facilities that the centres have on offer.  DÍON, and the Government, are anxious to continue to help those people.  We want to revitalise the centres.  The vast majority of the £500,000 allocated this year to DÍON will go directly to welfare workers, social workers and those who work on the <Col N="1810" /> streets.  In their programme for 1990, which I will discuss with them some time in early December, we will attempt to gain for them any assistance they require. Also this year they are involved in a fairly large research project.  So many reports are available now that often contradict one another that DÍON are anxious to try to get a definitive programme to see exactly where the problems lie and how best they can match the funds they get themselves, from voluntary subscriptions and from the Irish Government, with money in local authorities.</P>
    <P>There are a number of excellent housing projects, some of which Deputy Deenihan mentioned. CARA was one which has been very successful in using some of the money from Irish organisations and matching that to get considerable funds from the local authorities. I think it is true to say DÍON do not want the Irish Government to become involved directly in supplying hostel accommodation, though certainly they want the staff, the welfare workers and so on.  I assure Deputies who have raised this in a constructive fashion tonight that we will continue to be as supportive of DÍON as we possibly can.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, and in response to the motion before us, I want to say that no Government have achieved so major a transformation of the economy in such a short period of time as this Government and the last Government.</P>

      <P>In general, I consider that the level of funding for DÍON grants is adequate.  I will, of course, in consultation with DÍON, be keeping the matter under close review to see whether any adjustments are needed for the next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Carey has come in this evening to play the traditional role of the Clare corner back, there is still a bit of fight left in some of the forwards around here.  I have never been ungenerous in regard to this topic.  I have always been absolutely <Col N="1812" /> truthful about it and I remain so at this time.  Changing from that side of the House to this side of the House has not changed my views about emigration, that it remains probably the greatest tragedy in this country now and in the last five years since 1984 since we began to have such a huge drain, particularly of involuntary emigration.  I feel the same disgust about the fact that so many young people have to leave this country in an involuntary way at present as they have during that five year period.  I offer no excuse whatsoever for the fact that that remains the position.</P>
      <P>I want to outline some further initiatives that have been taken by this Government in an effort to stem emigration and prepare people as well as possible for that situation.  Before I come to that I want to make a very important distinction between involuntary emigration and the increasing emigration which is taking place on a voluntary basis where people are deciding to leave their employment and go elsewhere to improve their career prospects.  Everybody would agree that there is an increasing level of such emigration which is nowhere as serious as the involuntary emigration where people are having to leave simply because they have no option &mdash; the employment opportunities are not and have not been available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the initiatives outlined by the Minister are tackling the problem of unemployment, I agree with Deputy Barrett that all of us as politicians must redouble our efforts to ensure that absolutely no effort is spared to create a climate conducive to investment to create more employment.  Even in this House it is correct to say that we must look at the structures with which we operate.  We as politicians in general and as an Oireachtas must look at our performance in relation to the creation of a climate for investment and of jobs.  We still have to put aside quite a number of the habits and prejudices of a lifetime before we will be put in a position to tackle the problems facing us.  Looking around right now I take two examples of areas where, <Col N="1813" /> despite our best efforts to create employment prospects, we are militating against ourselves seriously.</P>
    <P>The whole planning appeals process today is putting a 12 month delay on a whole range of major industrial projects which are trying to get off the ground in order to create employment.  While I am the first person to agree that we must be very careful about planning, the need to protect the environment and so on, I feel it is crazy that in our planning process when you go through the local authority a major industrial project involving major investment and major creation of jobs can be held up for 12 months.  In fact, an industrialist said to me the other day, &ldquo;Now when you are planning a project you must plan for an extra 12 months because of the inevitable appeal to An Bord Pleanála&rdquo;.  That is sheer lunacy.  As a Government and as politicians we must face up to the fact that we must clear those bottlenecks if we are to be a realistic about the need to create employment.</P>
    <P>In my area in the last couple of weeks I have come across yet another absolutely ridiculous situation.  It concerns sport holidays as part of the promotion and development of our tourist product.  In this the fastest growing area of tourism development in Europe and the US, namely, the provision of activity holidays in areas such as walking, cycling, equestrian sports and adventure sports, our legislation provides that it is almost impossible for people involved in that development to get insurance to cover those areas.  I appreciate that Deputy Barrett when he was in my position initiated some moves in this direction, but only in the last few weeks have we begun to put together legislation to deal with this problem of insurance where it relates to people who want to come into Ireland to participate in sporting activity holidays.  It is one of the key areas in regard to the development of our tourist industry where we can create thousands of jobs, yet right this day we are not in a position to respond to major development proposals because our laws in <Col N="1814" /> regard to insurance are completely outdated and archaic.  Unless we get to grips with fundamental issues such as those we cannot talk realistically about solving the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The difficulties with regard to emigration can be solved only by a continuation of the policy now being pursued to create employment and the environment conducive to investment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connor mentioned the US.  As the Minister for Finance has said, the question of emigration to the US will be dealt with by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Suffice it for me to say that major progress has been made, as the Fine Gael deputation to the US found recently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, we did not find any such thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Progress was made particularly by the Tánaiste during his tenure as Minister for Foreign Affairs but also by our Department of Foreign Affairs and by our Ambassadors and diplomats to the US.  The Fine Gael deputation, if they are honest, will admit that some of them went to the US with a view that the attainment of an amnesty for all young persons was possible.  That is a point that was put to me vehemently by Deputy Connor when he was in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the US?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality is that there is no possibility of the attainment of such anmesty.  However, progress has been made and I look forward to a continuation of that position at the hands of our Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the Department of Labour, we in the Department of Education are involved in trying to prepare in the best way possible those young people who, unfortunately are left with no option but to emigrate.  In that respect we spent £500,000 in 1988 in the provision of information centres on emigration throughout the country.  The Department seek to ensure that the youth information centres <Col N="1815" /> assist in the preparation of those contemplating emigration by way of presenting accurate information on the reality of emigration, on clarifying the fundamental issues, drawing attention to the alternatives available, challenging the common myths and misconceptions in the matter and, basically, stimulating full consideration of all the implications on the part of prospective emigrants.</P>
    <P>A range of responses has been developed by our Department including the compilation of information files covering the main areas of destination, the publication of emigration guides and leaflets, the organisation of talks and workshops in schools and at other venues on emigration and the making of videos, tapes and slides on the full range of information. All of this is in the interest of preparing for emigration as best we can those young people who must leave.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I welcome this discussion on emigration, this outbreak of concern that has been manifested by so many here this evening.  In the short time available to me I should like to state a number of facts on the issue of emigration and on the text of this <Col N="1816" /> motion.  On and off for the past 20 years I have been teaching one of the few courses at third level on sociology in this country.  There is an interesting similarity between what I have heard and what is contained in the literature.</P>
      <P>The current approach to emigration in terms of statistics and the response to the issue is characteristically dishonest. There is no attempt to link the emigration figures to the unemployment figures. Neither, for example, has there been any revelation this evening in either of the two Government speeches we have heard of the work that has been done in the ESRI on the new method of calculating migration, an aspect that has been commented on in the professional literature on this subject.  The figure of 46,000 for this year, for example, is a low figure just as the figure of 32,000 for last year was an underestimate.  I want to make my first important point in this regard by saying that even if I accept these low figures, the rate of increase between 1988 and 1989, from 32,000 to 46,000, will, if it continues, give us in 1990 the largest number of people ever to leave the country since the foundation of the State.  The previous high figure is for the year 1955.  I mention this for the benefit of those who wish to refer back to such figures, people who have more time than I have these days for such work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My next point relates to the neglect of emigration in terms of the country generally and of this House.  As all earlier speakers have said, there has not been sufficient interest in the problem.  The only occasion on which this House established a commission to examine the causes of emigration was after the 1948 election.  The Government had changed and there was a number of issues in that election, including the release of Republican prisoners and so on.  Among the demands made to the then new Government, following the burning alive of a number of people in bothies in Scotland, was that a commission would be set up to investigate the circumstances and causes of migration.  For the first time that commission put into the literature on emigration the famous push-all thesis, <Col N="1817" /> that people were pushed out by reason of lack of opportunity and attracted on the other side by opportunities there.</P>
    <P>On 23 May 1988 I received a letter from the Ceann Comhairle telling me that a question I had tabled to the Taoiseach for oral answer on 25 May was being transferred to the Minister for Foreign Affairs who was due to answer on 21 June, 1988.  On that date I asked the Minister if he would consider setting up a commission, by way of a generous all-party offer, to look at emigration in all its aspects.  The reply was that such a commission was unnecessary.  What we got was the kind of mantra we had this evening.  I need only give two lines from the paragraph concerned because it is repeated so often it sets off an automatic resonance in anything that can be listened to in any part of the world.  It is all so totally predictable.  I quote, &ldquo;Because of the resolute action taken by the Government, order has been restored to the public finances.&rdquo;  At that stage you close your eyes, visualise a little candle and go on repeating the next two pages of the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>My second point is the refusal to set up a commission on emigration.  Meanwhile, the Minister for the Environment, in reply to another question from me as to whether he proposed to consider the granting of voting rights to emigrants offered what was a major insult to our emigrants by saying that historically in Ireland there had been abuse of the postal vote.  In other words, our emigrants could not be trusted.  I had pointed out to the Minister that we were now one of two countries in the EC which did not provide for such rights, that France, for example, had four methods of voting, voting by post, by proxy, in embassies and so on. In that grand European gesture of his reply, the Minister dismissed the right of emigrants to vote.</P>
    <P>I attended a conference in London on emigration organised by TIDE and by the action Group for Irish Youth and I also attended a conference here in Dublin just over a year ago in this regard.  In September this year I visited the Irish in San Francisco and on the west coast of <Col N="1818" /> the US generally.  The growth of emigration in that latter area is interesting. For instance, instead of having just two Irish pubs in Geary Street, there are six while, instead of there being one GAA team, there are eight.  Figures for non-status emigrants to the west coast of the US are grossly underestimated.</P>
    <P>One of the sources of dishonesty in regard to emigration has been the question of the language used &mdash; non-status, etc.  How can one tell the difference between immigrants who are non-status, who are illegal, who are out of status, out of quota and so on?  This has a parallel in regard to European emigration because part of the dishonesty of those who went around spouting rhetoric regarding the effects of the integrated market, without examining or specifying what they meant by cohesion, was to say that we do not have emigration at all.  I suspect that emigration will end, not by reason of people not being forced to leave their country but because such movement will be called European labour mobility.  It is as if we did not know it but that we are really Europeans after all.  It is like some principle of magnetism &mdash; people will be drawn to Germany.  I heard a person on the radio suggesting that Irish emigrants could become an élite class in Germany. This casuistry is very interesting.  In a speech delivered by Mr. Peter Sutherland, then member of the European Commission responsible for competition policy, social affairs and education on the occasion of the annual Congress of the Irish Episcopal Commission for Emigrants, dated 11 April 1985 he had a number of things to say.  In his speech he made the following comment:</P>
    <P>I hope I shall not be misunderstood if I say that we should think a good deal about those doors (he was referring to the doors of the Community) and how we can exploit the openings they give. We have become so accustomed by miserable historic experience to regarding emigration as a curse to be avoided if at all possible that we are in danger of closing our eyes to the <Col N="1819" /> qualitatively different versions of emigration which are now beginning to beckon from mainland Europe.</P>
    <P>There were 2,000 Irish people working temporarily in Germany and Holland and there were another 500 in different parts of the Community.  Non-Community migrants living in appalling conditions totally outnumbered other migrants. Interestingly, in another document produced by the Commission at that time it showed that Ireland proportionately had more people living in Britain than had any other country in the EC living anywhere else.  The nearest was the Portuguese people living in France.</P>
    <P>My next point is the dishonest suggestion that there is a qualitatively new kind of migrant.  My own estimates are that migration to Britain is three times the volume of the migration to the United States.  I do not think people should rely only on my estimate.  Published, not by the Irish Government, this week were not one but two reports on living in London. One was entitled &ldquo;A Guide to London&rdquo; for young Irish people produced by the Action Group for Irish Youth.  Interestingly, another guide was published earlier in the week entitled &ldquo;Irish in Britain Directory&rdquo;, a comprehensive guide.  This book was produced by the Brent Irish Advisory Service.  I will content myself at this stage by saying that Ken Livingston and the Greater London Council, while it was there, did more for the Irish in Britain than any Irish Government, Minister or agency.  That is a fact.</P>
    <P>There is the suggestion that there are voluntary and involuntary migrants but if you want to use that argument it behoves you, if you are honest, to put a figure on the number of involuntary migrants.  I have been in the business of researching this matter for the past 20 years but I do not know of any means of calculating that and I should like to know where it is established.  People say there are involuntary migrants who are highly qualified but I should like to know what proportion <Col N="1820" /> of such people are leaving the country every year.</P>
    <P>Another point follows logically from that and it is in relation to one I have made already.  I believe the Irish migration to Britain is three times the volume of that to the United States, at the very least.  Where surveys have been carried out they have shown that Irish migration to the London area in particular has been primarily over 60 per cent by people who are unemployed. While people shed a bucket of tears this evening, I should like to make the following point: the majority of people going to London are going to a place where a certain amount of anti-Irish feeling has been regenerated.  By 1985 perhaps 400,000 people had been stopped under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which Act has been trawling for Irish people in Britain.  Approximately 6,500 of them have been detained.  In Mrs. Thatcher's Britain which abolished the agency that did most for Irish emigrants in Britain, the Greater London Council under the leadership of Ken Livingston &mdash; and I pay tribute to him in this House &mdash; the London those people are going to is a place where there are 400,000 unemployed. It is one where 250,000 households are on the waiting lists, where 6,000 families live in bed and breakfast accommodation because suitable accommodation is not available.  It is stated that of those who were homeless in 1986 as a result of the new atmosphere in Britain some 15 per cent said they were Irish.</P>
    <P>When we get the lecture about the new migrant who has emerged, about exercising his or her choice, when we are told that really we are all Europeans, and would it not be nice to be part of the German ruling class and all the rest of it, I ask people to look at the figures.  I ask them to be honest and realise what we are doing when we are sending people to London.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on what we are doing with this word &ldquo;emigration&rdquo;.  In ancient Greece, and indeed in most civilisations, many philosophers when their backs were to the wall exercised a choice between death and exile and they chose <Col N="1821" /> death rather than exile.  We have consistently exiled our people.  Between 1841 and 1961 two out of three people born in Ireland were living abroad.  This is the last chance we have.  After the emigration of the 1950s there was an internal migration during the sixties where the rural areas lost to the cities and that is why by 1971 Ireland was an urban rather than a rural country.  Interestingly, after that period some families came back but now because the marriage age and the size of household has fallen there will never again be such a bulge in the population. People in their millions were sent out of Ireland in the 19th century; for six pence people travelled from Mayo and Donegal to pick potatoes in Scotland. During the 1950s people left at the rate of 55,000 per year and here we go again. This is the last chance we will have to do anything in relation to keeping our population at home.  I agree with speakers from all sides who said we will have an ageing population after 1992.  What happens is that we lose the younger people and the people who remain have smaller families.  Let us compare the figures given here this evening; 5,000 net jobs to come and an estimated emigration figure of 46,000.</P>
    <P>Service for our emigrants should be provided in the United States, in London, Camden and elsewhere but what is required most from this House is recognition of the fact of what emigration is and what it means.  I turn to those who have expressed concern and I make a plea to them.  It is part of the schizoid activity of this House to suggest that emigration has nothing to do with the economic policies we are following.  When we listen to the speeches following the budget it will be clear.  Tonight we have had the first lines of the mantra: I can recite it by heart, &ldquo;at last when the public finances are coming under control&rdquo;.  As I said, you shut your eyes, meditate deeply and the rest follows.  What is this business of creating an atmosphere for investment that will lead to growth and jobs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would say that continuing on from a very brief Second Stage debate it is our intention to facilitate the Minister in what he proposes with the exception of section 6, with which we have difficulty, but the main thrust of what we will be doing this evening is to propose some additions to what the Minister is doing which is not in contravention of what he proposes but to fill what we believe are to be the gaps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 defines what is a &ldquo;fit person&rdquo;. <Col N="1823" /> I suppose this is the nub of what was found to be invalid in relation to the court orders. As far as it goes it conforms to the definition of a health board or the personnel under the control of the health board as defined by the 1970 Act and we have no difficulty with it.  I should say that one of the difficulties we have &mdash; and this comes out in section I &mdash; is that the health board was always a fit person, in other words the element of retrospection. Some of the advice we have, <i>vis-á-vis</i> section 6, is that to say, for instance, that a court order was always valid might not be constitutional.  I would ask the Minister to let me know his legal advice from the Attorney General as to the element of retrospection and the constitutionality of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this section, obviously the whole focus of the decision of last Thursday is on the questions of the health boards not being deemed to be fit persons.  I would need some convincing from the Minister for Health and from his officials in relation to the legality of this section.  I would go so far as to ask the Minister for Health if he could inform the House or if he could give us details of the legal opinion and the legal advice which he has before him on this part of the Act.  Obviously the rest of the Act will fall if section 1 does not have validity and if it does not have the retrospection which he is seeking to have.  Certainly, in many instances of which I am aware it is not possible to give retrospection by way of introducing legislation.  I would be extremely concerned that the orders which up to last Thursday were valid will now remain invalid even after the passing of this section tonight.  I would like if the Minister, or the Minister of State, would inform the House on the basis upon which they have satisfied themselves that this section will withstand any challenge that might be made because we have to take it, as a matter of course, that challenges will be made in relation to this Act as they have been in relation to the 1908 Act.  I would ask the Minister as a matter <Col N="1824" /> of urgency to give us the basis and the details of the legal advice which is available to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>On reading this section I asked for an opinion from the Attorney General's Office and I am assured that they are happy with that section legally.  Section 1 does not say that a court order was always valid.  It provides that a health board has and always has had the power to act as a fit person and it makes no mention of a court order.  The fit person definition under section 38 (1) of the 1908 Act reads as follows:</P>
      <P>In this part of this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, the expression &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; in relation to the care of any child or young person includes any society or body corporate established for the reception or the protection of poor children or the prevention of cruelty to children.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court has ruled that this definition does not encompass a health board, hence the need to provide it, to be taken to include and always have included a health board.  There is no specific provision in the Health Acts authorising a health board to act as a fit person.  Health boards have always operated on the basis that they have an implied power to do so.  The effect of the Supreme Court judgment is that health boards cannot assume such a power, hence the need to provide here that health boards have, and always have had, the power to act as fit persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given us the reasons in response, to Deputy Yates and Deputy Spring, why he has put that section in the Bill.  I do not think he has responded adequately to the query raised.  The Minister of State quoted a paragraph from my book on <i>Family Law in The Republic of Ireland</i>.  Earlier this evening I was worried that he would quote from another book which I had <Col N="1825" /> recently written but he avoided falling into that trap&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in which I point out that there was no explicit power conferred on health boards but that health boards &mdash; and I deliberately used the words &mdash;&ldquo;may properly exercise the power&rdquo;&mdash; in the context of a particular section of the Children Act.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; was very carefully used.  I made the point that in practice health boards, as the Minister has said, would act as fit persons but there was always a doubt. That is why that paragraph was written in that way because there was always a doubt as to the health board providing these powers.  The Minister has referred us to section 38 of the Children Act, 1908. The effect of the Supreme Court decision is not to say, just on Thursday last, the health board lost that power, but that since 1970 when the Health Act became operative, health boards have lacked the statutory capacity, either as a statutory body or as a body corporate, to be a fit person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty we have here is that the Minister's amendment is, in effect, retrospective legislation.  The Minister is retrospectively saying that from now on, although the health board did not have the power a week ago, or two months ago, or two years ago, or six years ago we will deem the health board always to have had that power.  The Minister had two ways of approaching the difficulty presented by the Supreme Court decision.  The first way of approaching it was to provide for a power on the part of health boards to act as fit persons in all future court cases and in a sense to thereafter require, with regard to all children who are currently in care and whose welfare require that they remain in care, that there be a new application to the courts for a care order, then no one would have had to rely on retrospectivity.  The alternative means of dealing with it &mdash; and this is the one the Minister has adopted &mdash; was by way of retrospectively attempting to validate the orders made in cases <Col N="1826" /> in the past, all of which are clearly valid at present.  This is retrospective legislation.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, very particularly, what advice he has received from the Attorney General with regard to the position if we pass this legislation, if this day week a parent challenges an order in the High Court that was made six months ago and says that at the time when the order was made the health board could not act as a fit person and goes on to say that you cannot now insert a power that did not exist six months ago, that the orders are still valid.  I would draw the Minister's attention to a very recent court case and I wonder if the Attorney General has had any regard to it.  It is a judgment delivered on Tuesday, 31 October, and reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Wednesday, 1 November.  I do not think the formal signed judgment is yet available.  It related to a decision by Mr. Justice Blayney concerning the position of a district justice who, it turned out, was not properly appointed as required by the Constitution.  An order had been made under section 49 of the Road Taffic Act, 1961, against the applicant in these proceedings.  It was argued that since the applicant had been tried by a person who was not duly appointed a judge, his trial could not have been in due course of law.  In a reserve judgment Mr. Justice Blayney said that District Justice Seamus Mahon, who was appointed a temporary justice with effect from 11 October, 1976 and a permanent justice from 20 May 1977, had not been properly appointed as a justice and that the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1988 which gave power to act as a district justice retrospectively could not validate the conviction, that Mr. Shelley had a constitutional right to be tried in a court of law.  That was not done.  The respondent was not a judge appointed in a manner provided by the Constitution. A validation of his conviction would conflict with his constitutional rights since it would purport to validate a trial which had infringed such a right.</P>
    <P>It seems the Minister is trying to validate a court decision which was invalid at the time it was made.  I would be very <Col N="1827" /> interested to know what advice the Minister has obtained from the Attorney General and whether when the Attorney General considered the decision of last Thursday in commenting on this legislation he also had regard to the decision of 31 October 1989.  If he did not have such regard, the issue raised by Deputy Yates and Deputy Spring is of some considerable importance.  Where this section may prospectively allow health boards to act as fit persons, there is very serious doubt as to whether it is constitutionally permissible for it to render valid a whole series of court orders that are clearly invalid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in accepting that once this legislation has been dealt with in this House and the Seanad the health boards will be considered by the courts as fit persons within the meaning of section 38 of the 1908 Act, but I share the fears which have been ably expressed by Deputy Shatter. The Minister did very little to allay those fears and I would ask him in the interests of all of us and certainly in the interests of the 800 children who are in limbo at present if he could give us some insight as to the advice available to him.  It would be constructive and would help us in considering this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure questions were put to the Attorney General by the Minister and his officials in relation to retrospection.  My understanding in general law is that one cannot regulate matters retrospectively. Whereas the Bill when enacted will certainly cater for the future, I would have worries and doubts as to whether when passed the health boards will be given a new status in relation to being fit persons to cover events which have taken place in the past at a time when by virtue of the decision of last Thursday they were deemed not to be fit persons.  I would ask the Minister again to give us some insight into the advice available to him, not just that the advice is that it is okay but the basis of the advice.  I am sure the constitutionality of the question has been teased out by the Attorney General and <Col N="1828" /> his staff, as well as the officials in the Department of Health.  It is in the interests of everybody, particularly of the children, that the Minister should clarify this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers on this side of the House, I am not satisfied with the Minister's response in simply using a formula to the effect that the Attorney General has been consulted and has expressed satisfaction with the constitutionality of this section.  When we were dealing with the Courts (No. 2) Bill, 1988, addressing the problems of District Justice Mahon we were assured that the provisions of that Bill would stand up to the test of judicial inquiry and would act to validate all the actions the justice had taken.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> report of the review of the decision by Mr. Justice Blayney, the point was well made that many of the orders of the district justice would now have been spent in effect and consequently there would be very few who could seek a remedy.  I remember reading the statistics of the colossal amount of work the man had managed to dispose of in any one year.  We were talking about tens of thousands of cases and orders made by him in any year.  All of those would have been spent and no problem arises.  That is not so in this instance.  The vast majority of the orders affecting 2,500 children in care would have been made at the instigation of or to a health board as the fit person to receive the child into care.  The position of each and every one of those persons and their welfare is now called into issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister should be in a position, in answer to the questions raised by Opposition speakers, to expand as to the grounds on which the Attorney General assures him, so that we can in some way review that opinion and decision.</P>

      <P>I think I speak for all Opposition Deputies when I say that it is not that we do not want health boards to be fit persons.  We want it to be sufficiently sound that further problems will not arise.  Can the Minister quote any precedent where legislation was brought <Col N="1829" /> before this House with the effect of retrospection which subsequently withstood any constitutional challenge against it? Has he given any consideration to referring this Bill under Article 26 to the President to test its constitutionality?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to cover ground which has already been well trodden. The debate on section 1 is uncannily similar to a debate in December last year on the Courts (No. 2) Bill, 1988.  In the course of the reply by the Minister on Report Stage he dealt with the kind of concerns raised here during the past few minutes.  He stated he was satisfied on the advice given to him by the Attorney General that there would not be any constitutional difficulties arising from that legislation which attempted to validate the decisions of a district justice who was not at the time lawfully acting in that capacity.  What the Minister for Health is doing this evening is exactly the same. It was stated categorically in the recent Shelly case in the High Court that the decision of the district justice was not valid and that our attempt to validate retrospectively district court judgments under the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1988, was a failure.</P>
      <P>On that occasion the Minister for Justice was asked to explain exactly the same thing we are asking the Minister for Health to do now.  It is of fundamental importance that, prior to passing this legislation tonight, the Minister answers categorically whether he is satisfied that section 1 of the Bill is not repugnant to the Constitution.  If the answer is no, I ask the Minister to elaborate having regard to the recent decision in the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1988, because we appear to be going down the same road as we did in 1988. The Blayney decision of last week in the Shelley case is one of a string of cases which will create extreme difficulties. Section 1 will lead to exactly the same situation and having regard to the seriousness of this legislation the Minister has a duty to the House to explain his reasons for saying &mdash; if indeed it is his statement &mdash; that section 1 is not repugnant to the Constitution.</P>

      <P>We have to presume, as the Bill is in this form and has had the advice of the Attorney General, that the Attorney General must have advised that in this case there is a distinction to be made in the other case, the Courts (No. 2) Bill.  If the Minister could simply tell us how the Attorney General made that distinction and the basis for it we might be satisfied.  If he cannot do that I do not see how we can get very far with this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The only bar in the Constitution on retrospective legislation is in relation to making criminal an offence which was not unlawful at the time it was committed.  Deputy Yates raised the question of retrospective legislation. It is not unique to provide an element of retrospection in legislation. For example, many Acts dealing with superannuation have been retrospective. Deputy Yates raised the point about referring the Bill to the President.  It is not a matter for the Minister or the House to recommend to the President what he should do as he has a constitutional right to decide whether any Bill should go to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality.</P>
      <P>With regard to the McMahon case referred to by Deputies Shatter and McCartan, I am advised that a distinction can be drawn between that case and the one we are dealing with here.  In the McMahon case the criminal convictions were invalid because a person has a constitutional right to be tried by a properly appointed judge or justice and in the McMahon case that was not so.  This is not the situation here as in this case there was a proper judicial hearing by a properly appointed justice who decided that the parents were unfit to have custody of their children.  Just because the wrong person was nominated as a fit person after the decision was made that the parents were unfit does not invalidate the decision that the parents were unfit to have care of their children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is digging the hole a little bit bigger into which he <Col N="1831" /> may soon disappear with the Bill.  Surely the essence of the proceedings on the fit persons orders relates to the liberty of the subject, the child in the first instance and the constitutional rights of the parents in the second?  We know how strongly those rights are written into the Constitution and how much, therefore, as legislators we are obliged to protect them.  There is as strong a constitutional regard to be had to the process of a judge making a decision in a criminal case as there is in regard to a judge making a decision in the care and committal of young persons and &mdash; by correspondence &mdash; the denial of a parent's right of custody or access to a child.  There can be no equivocation or suggestion that one is less important than the other, they are of equal importance.</P>
      <P>The issue comes down to whether the Minister of the Legislature can retrospectively validate all the orders.  Will the Minister &mdash; if he can &mdash; expand on this issue by reference to an opinion, a note, memorandum, document or résumé from the Attorney General's Office that must be to hand in his files in relation to this? This is the kernel of the Bill and the central issue of what we are about in the House, trying to put right what has not been right up to this either in law or in the administration of justice according to the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me on to a second point raised on Second Stage in the context of the Minister reviewing the position of all the cases under the jurisdiction and responsibility of the health boards.  It seems, in the light of doubts that clearly exist about the correctness of this approach, there may well be an impossibility facing us as a Legislature.  It may very well be that it is impossible to put right by law now what has not been right to date and that perhaps the only possible, practical, proper steps to be taken is for all those cases within the jurisdiction of the Minister through the health boards to be re-represented to court and proper orders made according to the law corrected by this Bill when it is passed here and in the Seanad tomorrow.  That <Col N="1832" /> is the reason for the urgency of the action and review.  I will be suggesting to the Minister, whatever about other reviews in the light of how probitive procedures were undertaken, that there is certainly a cogent argument for suggesting there is a need for the review of cases so that we are in a position to act without delay if the Minister is convinced tonight &mdash; or if a court should convince him at a very early date &mdash; that this Bill cannot be retrospective in the way he hopes it will.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I detect a certain reluctance on the Minister's part to impart more information to us in relation to the Attorney General's advice.  I am beginning to wonder about this matter.  Was the question put to the Attorney General?  I would have assumed it would have been necessary, from the point of view of the Minister putting the Bill through the House, to be able to quote, chapter and verse, from the Attorney General's advice.  As the previous speaker said, surely there is a memorandum from the Attorney General's Office to the Department of Health advising on this very important issue because, without this being clarified, there will obviously be an air of doubt over the legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The example which the Minister gave in relation to retrospection &mdash; the question of superannuation &mdash; can hardly be compared with the question of the natural rights of parents and the liberty of children. Certainly I could not see a High Court or Supreme Court judge equating superannuation rights with the subject matter of this Bill from the point of view of retrospective legislation.  I do not accept there is any need for the reticence the Minister has displayed in relation to the question of referring this Bill to the President.  There are many precedents for recommending the reference of legislation to the President, particularly in an instance like this where the doubt persists. I would much prefer to see another fortnight or month of uncertainty on the basis of the Bill being referred than our awaiting some lawyer to challenge it in, say, 12 months or two years time, putting us back in the same position.  If the only <Col N="1833" /> satisfaction the Minister has for himself is: yes, it is all right; I do not have to state the reason, or the strongest reason I can give is that we have had instances of retrospective legislation on questions of superannuation rights; in that instance probably an explanation becomes more desirable now than it was 20 minutes ago before any attempt was made to explain how this legislation would be valid.  I would ask the Minister to give us some insight into the advice given to him. There are very genuine doubts being expressed by all the speakers who have risen on section 1.  I would certainly hope that the Minister could go somewhat further in allaying those fears and doubts than he has in the past 30 minutes.</P>

      <P>Opposition Deputies are in somewhat of a difficulty in so far as we have tabled some very important amendments we want to reach.  The more we talk about one section of the Bill the more we deprive ourselves of debate in the limited three hours remaining.</P>
      <P>I should like to summarise the position of my party at this stage, which is that we remain totally sceptical about the constitutionality of this section and the element of retrospection in sections 1 and 6.  We feel the best way to deal with this issue is for the Minister and the Government to consider referring the matter to the President to test its constitutionality. I would disagree with the Minister when he says that the Government or Minister have no role in this.  I might cite the precedent of the Adoption Act when the Government referred that legislation to the President for that type of consideration and it was tested on that basis. I want it formally recorded for future reference that we remain sceptical notwithstanding anything the Minister has said.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the rights of children.  He referred also to children who are in care and the question of appeal to the court. The provisions of section 3 give that right of appeal.  I am sure Deputy McCartan would agree that what we are dealing <Col N="1834" /> with in this Bill is the particular loophole obtaining and decided in the Supreme Court on Thursday last.  The Deputy will agree that these children were before proper judicial proceedings, that their cases were examined before the courts, the courts deciding that the children should be in care.  That decision was taken having regard to the court procedures. Whether or not there are children in care who should not be is not an issue that is involved in this Bill.  My view is that if they were before the courts and the courts heard their case in a proper fashion &mdash; whether a health board was or was not a &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; is not an issue in regard to whether they should be in care. The courts did decide that they should be in care.  Therefore, we are here validating the health board as a &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; to have them in care.  As I have said already, there is no constitutional bar on this retrospection in accordance with the advice I have been given.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputies Spring and Yates about the President, it is not correct to say that we made a recommendation to the President that he should refer the Adoption Bill to the Supreme Court.  In fact we are very careful on this side of the House to recognise the constitutional position of the President.  We do not believe it is our function to recommend to the President. We have confidence in the President to take whatever decision he thinks is correct in the interest of good legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Spring suggested that we should delay resolving the matter for a month or so.  That would not be realistic because there are 800 children in care whose legal status is unclear.  We cannot really delay clarifying their status.  It is right that there be no doubt about their status.  Therefore, it is important that the Bill be passed as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I might point out that, of course, the Minister is quite correct &mdash; Bills are not referred to the President for the purpose of constitutional reference.  But it has been the practice that, where there are doubts expressed in this House of a serious kind on the <Col N="1835" /> constitutionality of a Bill, that is a factor which the President takes into account in making up his mind.  Second, it is a fact that in the last decade or so it has emerged that legislation, which is thought to be particularly appropriate for reference to the Supreme Court by that method, is legislation dealing with a net point which can be settled by the court very simply rather than complex legislation where even a full reference might miss out on some point.  This Bill seems to me to be pre-eminently of the kind which could be so referred.  On the Opposition side we feel there would be merit in doing so, although of course it is for the President to decide.</P>
      <P>However, it would be unfortunate if the Minister misled himself on one point in connection with this when he says we could not afford a month's delay because there are children in care and something might happen.  This Bill, when passed by these Houses, is deemed to be law until such time as the Supreme Court find it is not.  I think I am right in saying that constitutionally nobody would be able to take any action on the basis of this Bill not being constitutional until the Supreme Court has decided.  I do not think the courts would look behind the existence of the Bill before the Supreme Court had taken their decision.  I do not think that is an issue.  I hope the Minister will not press that.  At some point in the debate I hope he would be willing to indicate, as we in Government indicated about the Rent Restrictions Bill &mdash; that we would see merit in a reference while the matter remained entirely for the President to decide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of section 1 constitute the real reason for us having an emergency Bill before this House this evening, that is to rectify an obvious fault in existing legislation.  The more Deputies on this side of the House listen to the Minister the more worried we become that we might enact a Bill that does a lot of things but will not address the problem we set as our primary and main objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said quite clearly, <Col N="1836" /> after the enactment of this Bill, that, in relation to all care proceedings that have taken place in the past, children will be lawfully in care inasmuch as clearly their parents will be unfit.  The issue we are addressing is not that some people were found to be unfit.  The issue we are addressing is who is to be seen to be a &ldquo;fit person&rdquo; and whether we can decide retrospectively that a health board is such a &ldquo;fit person&rdquo;.  That is the main issue, that is the nub of the issue.  The Minister contends there is no constitutional bar on retrospection.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies on this side of the House have tried for the past 40 minutes to extract that clear assurance from the Minister.  The Minister was asked on more than one occasion: was the advice of the Attorney General sought?  If so, would he please inform the House what was that advice, read it into the record, so that we may be fully assured.  We all want to establish that health boards are &ldquo;fit persons&rdquo; under the Act.  The instances the Minister has given so far clearly would not give us any encouragement to believe that this section is constitutional.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a Bill on which there are based fundamental and sensitive human rights &mdash; the rights of children, the rights of parents, rights that are enshrined in the Constitution.  It is not a matter of the price of a gallon of petrol being retrospectively adjusted.  These are issues of extreme sensitivity.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated, in response to Deputy Spring, that it would not be realistic to wait.  I must say that there is a certain amount of cheek involved in that considering we have waited so long to enact this legislation and since the actual judgment has been signalled for a long time.  The fundamental thing we must do is get it right on this occasion.  I do not mind inconveniencing this House in having to debate the provision in 12 months or two years time but I object to putting the 800 plus children who we are trying to assist tonight in jeopardy again by creating further uncertainty.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I ask the Minister to answer the two simple direct questions <Col N="1837" /> which will settle this issue: has he sought the advice of the Attorney General and will he read into the record what that advice is?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Following what was said by the Fine Gael spokesperson on this issue I simply want to say that we in The Workers' Party have equal misgivings about the constitutionality of this provision.  I am concerned more and more at the Minister's failure to advise us in full as to the Attorney General's reasons for the advice he has given.</P>
      <P>Moving from the constitutional issue &mdash; there is no point in pursuing this issue much further in the light of the silence from the Minister's side &mdash; I want to refer to the legal effect of what is being proposed.  In the case which prompted this Bill &mdash; the proceedings of The State (D.) <i>versus</i> G. and Others &mdash; the Supreme Court ordered the release, by way of <i>habeas corpus</i> from custody and care, of an infant because the person in whose care the infant had been placed, the Eastern Health Board, was not a fit person on the basis that it was not legally correct.  The child was granted <i>habeas corpus</i> and released, I presume, back to the parents.  What is to stop the parents of any one of the 800 children who are at issue tomorrow, the next day or whenever the opportunity is available of going to court and seeking a similar remedy to that of the parents in the case of The State (D.) <i>versus</i> G. and Others?  What remedy would be available to the courts in that instance to protect the child?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister telling us that the words &ldquo;and shall be deemed always to have included a health board&rdquo; in section 1 be sufficient for the purposes of retrospectively redefining what a fit person was or are we going to be faced with the type of ruling which was presented in the Blayney judgment of last week, which suggests that we cannot retrospectively redefine?  Leaving aside the constitutional issue, if the Minister says that the Attorney General told him and the issue is a criminal offence only is he satisfied beyond doubt that a High Court or a higher court would allow those words <Col N="1838" /> to redefine the status of a fit person who received into custody and, by definition, deprived that infant of custody and the parents of their rights, as sufficient for the purposes of validating those orders whenever made?  Has the Minister begun to conduct any survey of the 800 children he talks about?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I want to make about the matter before the House is that one should have a care about coming to the conclusion that the legal advice given to the Minister is necessarily correct and necessarily will turn out to be correct.  I wish that were so but I am afraid experience shows that it is not so. We saw this in the not too distant past in the case of the Courts (No. 2) Bill.  I remember very well when that Bill was being rushed through in one day, as this Bill is, raising with the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Dukes as he is now, the question of the constitutionality of that Bill.  I remember being assured at the time by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Dukes, that his legal advice and the legal advice made available to him assured him that it was all in order and would turn out to be all right.  That legal advice turned out to be entirely wrong and that is why one should have a care about coming to the conclusion that the advice which is forthcoming is necessarily going to turn out to be right.</P>
      <P>There is one aspect of this matter which I wonder about and whether consideration has been given to it.  What is the position going to be of the child G. who was the subject of the Supreme Court decision which gave rise to this situation?  That person is specifically excluded from the terms of the Bill under section 7.  A very anomalous and strange situation will result under which one law would apply to every other child who is in care under a position taken up by the health board except child G. who would have been in exactly the same situation. I wonder whether the Supreme Court can tolerate that kind of situation as being constitutional when there will be one law for every child but G. and a separate law for G.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1839" /> I must express some concern about this because that in itself could give rise to some constitutional difficulty.  The issue of the child G. should have been addressed specifically in this Bill.  I know that might be a very unusual thing to do but, of course, the House has the power to overrule the Supreme Court and in effect the Bill purports to overrule that next point of law taken by the Supreme Court in the G. case.  I would have thought that consideration should have been given to overruling their decision in the G. case and dealing with the G. case specifically.  Otherwise it may well be argued in some court, the Supreme Court in particular, at some future date that that imbalance of the legal position of the child G. could not be tolerated as giving rise to an inequality affecting children who are in care.  I wonder if any thought has been given to this specific point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to make any further contribution.  I said earlier today that I have to make a declaration of interest in the sense that in the particular case which has given rise to all of this controversy I was the lawyer representing the parents.  Deputy Taylor's contribution was extraordinarily unusual and odd in the sense that if anything has been established in constitutional law it is that the Oireachtas cannot in effect overrule a decision of the Supreme Court, and the Sinn Féin funds case many years ago told us that.  The suggestion that either that decision of the Supreme Court or indeed any other decision of the Supreme Court could be simply willy nilly overruled by legislation passed in this House is so extraordinary as to deserve some comment in so far as this case has been dealt with and the child concerned is properly dealt with in the context of this legislation. Again I am careful to say that I was the lawyer involved with the parents in this case, and I do not make any special pleading on their behalf, but it is not unreasonable to say that they have been through enough during the past two and a half years without suggesting that having come to the end of a two and a half year <Col N="1840" /> court case this House is going to attempt to reverse the decision of the Supreme Court, something it cannot do anyway. With all due respect, Deputy Taylor is very seriously off the mark in that observation.</P>

      <P>The debate on this section of the Bill indicates the regrettable nature of the debate, the fact that the Bill had to be put together so quickly and the debate taken in such a short time today. I am not a lawyer but it is patently obvious to any person who has had any dealings in the drafting of legislation that there is question mark over the section.  We all know the cardinal rule in regard to this. When I was involved in the preparation of the Status of Children Bill it was claimed that we could not have retrospective legislation.  There seemed to be a bar on even considering it.</P>
      <P>I do not know how the section will change things because since last Thursday's decision the position is as if the court actions under which the children were taken into care had never happened. I am not sure how each one of those cases will be validated by this section. We are into a belt and braces issue. We have to be absolutely certain that the provisions of the Bill will withstand a test in the courts.  I am familiar with the preparation of Government memoranda and I hold the view that at some stage the Attorney General would have argued the points put to him and given reasons for adopting a certain line.  Could the Attorney General be consulted at this stage and his arguments brought forward? If that was done we would be able to reassure people in regard to the provisions in the Bill.  I hope that the unseemly haste with which we have had to put through this legislation will not be in vain.</P>

He is, of course, well learned in the law and I do not by any stretch of the imagination come close to or equal his deep and detailed knowledge of all branches of the law.  However, the Oireachtas has the <Col N="1841" /> power to change the law and if that is not the case then I do not know what we are engaged in tonight.  I appreciate that the Oireachtas does not have the power to change an interpretation by the Supreme Court of a constitutional issue but that is not what we were engaged in.

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy and I should like to ask him to please wait and listen.  The advice available to successive Ministers for Health, and to the Department of Health, is that the health boards are fit persons within the 1908 and 1970 Acts to hold children in care.  The Supreme Court, on one of five questions, ruled on a point of law that health boards were not fit people and ordered that the child be returned.  That takes account of Deputy Taylor's point. As legislators we have been given the task of changing the law to take account of decisions in the courts.  Under the guidelines of the Department of Health, 1983 and 1987, that is taken into account. Surely, we have a duty as legislators to enact the best law possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter, and others, questioned the constitutionality of the retrospection element incorporated in the section.  I should like to refer the House to the Garda Síochána Act, 1979, which dealt with the doubt about the appointing date of the then Garda Commissioner. <Col N="1843" /> The House dealt with that legislation and ensured that any decisions taken by the said officer were retrospectively in order even though there may have been a doubt about the date of appointment.</P>

      <P>I should like to tell Deputy McCartan that the judgment issued last July did not deal with the issue that the Supreme Court dealt with last Thursday.  The judgment of July dealt solely with the pre-trial procedures and the trial itself in the District Court, where <Col N="1844" /> the fit person order in question was originally made.  The court came to the conclusion that the procedures had not been carried out in accordance with the necessary standards of natural justice thus rendering the fit person order unsafe.  It was for this reason that the court ordered the release of the child and its return to its parents.</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin referred to the fact that we were talking about children and not about a gallon of petrol.  I agree with him on that and that is why we considered it so important to have the Bill before the House.  It is important that the children who are in care have their interests looked after.  Nobody is questioning the competence of the court that examined the cases originally or the competence of the witnesses of decisions that were made.  The question is whether the health board was or was not a fit person.  That question and the wording of section 1 were raised with the Attorney General and his advice is quite clear, that in his view as far as care orders are concerned there is no constitutional problem in relation to the wording of section 1.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. a1:</P>
      <P>a1 In page 2, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>2.&mdash;In any case where an application is made by a health board or any of its officers for an order pursuant to Section 24 of the Children Act, 1908, it shall be incumbent on the court hearing such application, before making any</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1845" /> order under the said section, to inquire whether the welfare of any child whose welfare might be in issue clearly requires its removal from the custody of both its parents, and should an innocent parent be available, able and willing to retain custody of such child, and to ensure the child's continuing safety and welfare, no order shall be made under the said section other than an order appointing such innocent parent as a fit person for the purposes of the said section.</P>
    <P>While commenting briefly on the Second Stage debate I said it was my intention and the intention of the Labour Party to facilitate the passage of this Bill because of its importance and the limited time available to us.  I do not propose to delay over-long on amendments.</P>
    <P>However, we have to be aware that pending enactment of the main legislation, the main Children Bill, which may well be some considerable time off yet by the time it concludes its passage through the Special Committee back into this House then to the Seanad and is enacted by signature of the President, there may be a considerable time lapse.  For that reason it is important that the procedures we put into place which will be the law until the new Bill comes into force are as good as we can make them.</P>
    <P>We have given some consideration to the legal situation since the Children Bill, 1989, was circulated this morning and we feel the amendments put down in my name would improve it.  The first amendment I have down is to insert a new section.  The main import of the new section is to preserve as far as is practicable the family situation.  A child who is identified by a health board as being vulnerable and needing protection from a guilty parent who is abusing, molesting or interfering with the child in any way, obviously has to be protected.  However, often another parent is involved and the subject of the amendment the Labour Party have put down is to give a clear duty to the court to look after the interests of the innocent parent and to inquire whether the welfare of any child might <Col N="1846" /> be at issue, requiring its removal from the custody of both its parents and whether an innocent parent is involved who would be available, able and willing to retain custody of that child.  The fundamental rights of that parent should be acknowledged and vindicated.  If a parent can establish that he or she is innocent in every way and anxious to retain custody of the child and is willing and able to protect the child and afford that child every care and attention, surely that parent should have the custody of the child rather than have the child taken away from the family and unnecessarily, in this instance, breaking up the family unit.  We think it very important that this provision be inserted into the Bill so there is a clear direction from the Oireachtas as to the preference for the maintenance of the family unit as far as practicable even when one individual parent has to be excluded from the family unit for the wellbeing and welfare of the child involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support these amendments.  Both on Second Stage of this Bill and dealing last week with Committee Stage of the more comprehensive Child Care Bill, I said repeatedly, as did other Opposition Deputies, that invariably when a child is at risk of abuse or violence or at risk generally, it was most likely that one adult was involved rather than two adults and that in those circumstances it was absolutely desirable, if not imperative, that the child be put where possible in home environment circumstances so that the disturbance and stress on the child would be kept to a minimum.  I have no doubt that there are different ways of trying to arrive at the same result.  I have tabled amendments and more amendments are being tabled to seek to get an <i>ex parte</i> barring order against the offending adult to remove not the child but the offender.  Often the psychology of these circumstances is that the child, whether he or she reports it to the social worker by way of admitting it or, further to investigation by the social worker, feels in some way he or she is the guilty party which, of course, is totally <Col N="1847" /> untrue and unfair.  Therefore, in the interests of natural justice, leaving aside the best welfare of the child, it is imperative that the offender be removed.  I am open to whether an <i>ex parte</i> barring order or what Deputy Howlin has proposed, is a better way of going about this, but I have no doubt that in descending order the most desirable circumstances for the child at risk are to stay with the family and for the offending adult to be removed, secondly, to be in fosterage which is as near to a home environment as you can get, and as a last resort, residential care. Not only are we talking about a family network of parents or a parent.  There are uncles, aunts, first cousins, grandparents and so on, and in removing the child from the family circumstances you are removing him or her from that whole network of relationships and support to that child.</P>
      <P>The lengthy, eight page judgment handed down unanimously by the Supreme Court last week referred to these points and it would be consistent, as my layman's interpretation of Mr. Justice Finlay's words, with their interpretation of what would be the most desirable action under the 1908 Act.</P>
      <P>I heard some months ago a lengthy radio programme, mostly recorded interviews with the mothers of children who had been taken into care.  One heard the most distraught descriptions of circumstances. Women who had sacrificed everything for their children and had themselves endured wife beating and, say, an alcoholic abuser of a husband saw a final tragedy, through no fault of theirs, of the children being removed from the family circumstances instead of removing the adult in question.</P>
      <P>This amendment is worthy of consideration. I regret we have no more time to deal with it.  It does not fit exactly into the type of amendments we had tabled to fill the gaps we felt the judgment exposed in the Minister's Bill, but we will support the amendments.</P>

      <P>The Workers' Party also support the two amendments being <Col N="1848" /> proposed.  They are very much in keeping with the judicial directives that were handed down by Mr. Justice Finlay, the Chief Justice, in delivering the unanimous decision of the Supreme Court in the case at hand.  I think it is worth quoting from the judgment at page 16 where in making this very unusual and almost out of desperation step of giving judicial directives to us as legislators, he indicated his view of what should be the matter of the law and practice in dealing with future applications, and unless we address these in our legislation with regard to child care proceedings we will be on the wrong side of the Supreme Court yet again when this legislation comes around to be scrutinised by that court.  It is also important, in view of the lack of progress on the substantial legislation and of suggestion in the House today, that has not been contradicted, that we are facing into a year to 18 months before we can ever hope to get the substantial legislation of the Child Care Bill into law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us face up to the reality of the progress in relation to legislation in this area.  I am talking not only of the past week but of the past decade. That rate of progress has been so slow so far as parties on all sides of the House are concerned that we are talking of a minimum of 12 months before we will be in a position to have the substantive law in place.  That being so, we should use the opportunity of this smaller Bill to improve on the situation in practice as it is.  The three amendments from the Labour Party proposing new sections address directly the issues addressed by the Supreme Court.  At page 16 of the judgment, the Chief Justice said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that in a case the facts <Col N="1849" /> of which are similar to those arising in the instant cast, namely, a suspicion grounding the original application under section 24 of illtreatment or abuse by one parent only, that there is a very definite and positive obligation on a Court to whom an application is made either under Section 24 or Section 21 of the Act of 1908 carefully to consider whether the welfare of the child clearly requires its removal from the custody of the innocent parent.  A justification for so doing could only be if the innocent party was unwilling or, as might well be the case, unable to protect the child from the risk of harm from the other parent.</P>
    <P>I do not think the case could have been put stronger.  The Supreme Court is telling us how the innocent parent should be regarded.  Up to now the innocent party had no say in the matter of these types of applications.  Invariably the parents went together to court and the motion was to take the child out of their custody. In, perhaps, 99 per cent of these cases the child will have been placed already, on foot of a safety order, in the care and control of the health board.</P>
    <P>What the Supreme Court is saying is that it is time to stop.  It says this because of the regard that must be had to the innocent parent and to the institution of the family as laid down in our Constitution and in our laws.  The court is telling us that we must address the matter both in practice and in law.  Clearly, this is what the Labour Party has attempted to do.  Their amendment is eminently sensible and should be supported.</P>
    <P>The second point the Labour Party referred to is the concept of making a clearly identifiable person responsible for the care and custody of a child being removed into care.  Further, in the judgment, the Chief Justice said:</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I am satisfied that where an Order is made for the commital of the care of a child to a fit person with the intention that it will reside with an individual that it should be made nominating such individual by name and that where the commital of the child to <Col N="1850" /> some institution which was run by a person which would qualify as a fit person pursuant to the Act of 1908 is intended that it is desirable that an individual, be it the head of such institution or the effective matron or head of care, should be nominated.</P>
    <P>That, again, is a clear declaration.  If, after today, a court makes orders without having regard to those provisions or if we do not make such provisions in our law, there will be a possibility that proceedings in the higher court could well impugn any such order.</P>
    <P>In their second amendment the Labour Party attempt clearly to address this position.  Consequently, the amendment should be supported.  The Minister has had this judgment for as long as any other Member so I trust he will have regard to these problems.  There are other directives in the judgment to which we must have regard also.  Now is the time to do that in view of the grave concern about the length of time it will take to put in place the more substantive legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these amendments. I had tabled a substantive amendment on the same lines for the Child Care Bill.  I do not think we needed the Supreme Court to tell us that where possible a child should not be removed from the home environment.  Usually there is someone who is willing and able to care for the child.  I have heard a replay of the radio programme Deputy Yates spoke of.  In one of the cases concerned the mother had suffered a nervous breakdown as a result of her child being taken from her while she was ill.  In another case the mother made a passionate plea to have her child returned to her on the basis that she was not the guilty party.</P>
      <P>I am greatly concerned that mothers such as those may be caught up in the whole machine of bureaucracy, that they are powerless in the matter of making a case for themselves.  We do not know this as these cases are heard in camera.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of making funds available, if we are to have regard to that proposal in the judgment regarding not <Col N="1851" /> taking the child from the innocent parent except where it was absolutely necessary to do so, we must realise that in most cases the innocent parent will be the mother and that she may not have the financial resources to allow her provide for the child.  If the child is put into an institution the cost to the State is much more than what would be involved in making funds available to the mother to care for the child at home.  I trust that there will be a positive response to these important amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the first amendment proposed by Deputy Howlin, I respectfully suggest that this question of &ldquo;innocent party&rdquo; is not a matter of black or white.  No doubt Deputies will be aware of cases where the father of a child had been abusing the child sexually, with the knowledge of the mother, for a number of years without the mother doing anything about the problem.  Could a woman in those circumstances be regarded as innocent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no definition of innocent party.  Perhaps the best way of dealing with this area would be by the use of the barring order procedure, where a health board could make application for a barring order to have the offending party removed from the home.  In most of these cases, the father is the quilty party but there is no provision in the amendments for his removal from the home.  The court may award custody of a child to the innocent party but the guilty party remains in the home and that can cause a problem.  There is a procedure in the barring order legislation whereby <Col N="1852" /> a mother could apply for a barring order but this whole area should be teased out thoroughly.  The insertion of a section on the lines proposed might only cause more problems than it would cure.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Law Reform Commission brought forward a consultative paper on child sexual abuse and addressed this whole area of barring orders in such incidents.  That is the direction in which we should be going.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what has been said by other Members in support of these amendments.  There have been many complicated cases where, psychologically and physically, a wife or partner has been forced into collusion or even denial because of fear or because of dependency or even of further outrages against herself or her children.  I take the point made by Deputy Ahern that the aim of the major Bill and this emergency legislation must be that the family and particularly the child be protected at all costs.  The child must be regarded as the vulnerable person and must be relieved of as much guilt as possible because it will be difficult enough to undo the other damage that will have been done.  From research and sad experience, we know the offender may move on not only to other members of the family but to the extended family. We must consider not just the victim but the potential victims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Opposition parties for their support of the amendments. I accept Deputy Ahern's point that these matters must be teased out. In a short time the debate in this House on the matter will be concluded.  What we are putting in place is the procedures that will apply until the main Act is law, which could be some considerable time. While it is incumbent on us to tease out matters, it is also incumbent on us to ensure that this legislation is the best we can offer.  The objective of the Labour Party amendments is to make the procedure as efficient, fair and as family-orientated as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not go into the arguments again <Col N="1853" /> but I will elaborate on the second amendment and I will comment also on the point made by Deputy Ahern in relation to the phrase &ldquo;innocent parent&rdquo;.  That is there because the phrase was used by the Supreme Court.  We must reflect on the decision of that court and what it indicated would be reasonable and fair legislation in relation to child care cases.</P>
    <P>The second amendment in my name has as its objective the assigning of clear responsibility to an individual so that there would not be a corporate entity who would have responsibility for a child. Unfortunately we can all instance cases where children were taken out of a situation where they were abused and put into the care of a corporate entity, a health board.  Since no individual was assigned clear responsibility for the child, the young person ends up in a home, is then moved to a foster parent and six months later is moved to another foster parent. All of this leads to instability for the child.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court has signalled that natural justice demands that an individual, a human person, should be responsible and that is what the amendment seeks to do.  Should that individual move to a different job, there is no difficulty. All it would take is three minutes, another appearance in court to have another person assigned, if that is necessary. In that way there could be a constant monitoring of the child and protection for him.  In this way children will not be sucked into a large system and forgotten.  That has happened in the past.</P>
    <P>The nub of the two amendments is to protect families as far as possible, to isolate guilty individuals who have wronged their family but not to shatter the family and the support mechanism of the extended family that should be available to all children.  I do not see why the Minister will not accept this amendment because eventually that House will legislate this type of provision in the main Bill.  I have no doubt that will be the case but why leave a gap of a year or 18 months without the proper cover?  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendments that have the support of all Opposition parties.</P>

      <P>If the Minister was prepared to accept the amendments in principle, the point made by Deputy Ahern which could have some validity despite the use of the term &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; in the Supreme Court judgment could be met by deleting the word &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; in the two cases so that it would read, &ldquo;and should a parent be available, able and willing to retain custody of such a child, who in the view of the court would ensure the child's continuing safety and welfare, no order shall be made...&rdquo;.  I hope the Minister will accept the idea behind that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the speeches of Opposition members who have made a good case for the amendments proposed by Deputy Howlin.  His proposal has evoked some sympathy from me.  However, Deputy FitzGerald has demonstrated, as perhaps Deputy Yates and Deputy Ahern inadvertently demonstrated, that there are a number of technical deficiencies in the amendment. That is no reflection on Deputy Howlin; it reflects the fact that the amendment had to be prepared in haste, just as this legislation had to be prepared in haste because it is narrow technical legislation designed to plug an immediate loophole the Supreme Court demonstrated exists in the law as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was here during Committee Stage debate last Wednesday and I did not hear anything about taking 18 months to put legislation on the Statute Book.  It is my earnest hope that it will not take that length of time to put the child care legislation on the Statute Book.  The decision of the Supreme Court was issued only a few days ago and we need more time to reflect on it.  Various speeches tonight have shown me we will have to consider this matter clearly in order to get the best possible legislation.  When the special committee debates the substantive Bill I will appeal to the representatives from my party to look sympathetically at such a proposal.  In the meantime, I appeal to the Minister to include some provision in the substantive Bill along the lines suggested by Deputy Howlin.  This <Col N="1855" /> matter needs teasing out and, on reflection, I should not like to see it passed hastily tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with the thrust of what Deputy Howlin wants to see in relation to the care of children, I do not think it would be appropriate to include the amendments at this time.  The point has been made by my colleagues and also by Opposition speakers that there are defects in the amendments.  I refer to amendment b1 where there is the following phrase &ldquo;there is no natural person who is available, able and willing to provide for the welfare of such child&rdquo;. It appears to me this would hinder a health board acting as a fit person because it is not an actual person.  It appears the court would have to exhaust all possibilities of placing the child with a natural person before it could even begin to consider placing the child with a health board.</P>
      <P>I believe legislation is not necessary.  I think it is incumbent on the District Court and the health boards to ensure that they have regard to the legitimate rights of the parent, or parents as the case may be, while ensuring that a child who should be in care is brought into care.  The health boards would take account of the points raised by Deputy Howlin.</P>
      <P>The District Court has always had regard to the position of the innocent parent.  Following the Supreme Court judgment, the relevant part of which was quoted by Deputy McCartan, the District Court is required to proceed along the lines set out in Deputy Howlin's amendment. There is a definite and positive obligation on the court to consider whether the welfare of the child requires that he be removed from the custody of the innocent parent.  The Supreme Court held that a court could only do so if the innocent parent was unwilling or unable to protect the child from the other parent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it would be appropriate to accept the amendment at this time but I will look at the point raised by Deputy O'Dea as to whether some such amendment might be incorporated in the major <Col N="1856" /> legislation.  I believe this should be teased out a lot more and the more appropriate place to do so would be the special committee because there will be more time to discuss it then.</P>
    <P>I share Deputies' concern about the length of time involved in having that major legislation passed through both Houses but I can assure them that there will be no delay on my part, or on the part of my colleague, the Minister of State, in expediting that legislation through the House.  I hope that will happen in the committee which was established today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification from the Minister.  The general consensus seems to be that there is a need for an amendment of the nature suggested by Deputy Howlin.  Both amendments are consistent with last Thursday's Supreme Court judgment, and the Minister seems to accept that it is necessary for us to move along the lines of the Supreme Court decision.  However, he appeared to say that there is an obligation on the District and Circuit Courts to observe the directions of the Supreme Court.  It would be far more opportune if, as of now, we were to give effect to the wishes expressed by Judge Finlay and his fellow judges.</P>
      <P>I take the point raised by Deputy O'Dea when he said that the amendments are flawed because of the haste with which they were put together, but they are no less flawed than the Bill itself because of the haste in which it was put together.  I do not think we have to apologise for being as human as those on the benches opposite.  In my view it is a certainty that this legislation when passed by both Houses will be discussed by the courts and I will not be surprised if there is a referral.</P>
      <P>I am surprised the Minister is not taking this opportunity to amend the Bill in a way which would be consistent with his views on the family as a unit in Irish society.  It would be a major step forward in the protection of the family against all eventualities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1857" /> There have been cases cited where children were removed from the family environment, no matter how hostile or difficult that environment might have been, and that the travelling and placement of children in institutions, then fostering and back into institutions, at times had more long-term ill effects than had other arrangements been made, such as those suggested by Deputy Ahern.  I appeal to the Minister to give these amendments more consideration.  I believe Deputy Ahern's suggestion has great merit and it could be considered on Report Stage or when the Bill is being discussed in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I believe we are missing an opportunity to make this legislation far more effective, and there seems to be agreement on all sides that we wish to do that.  Despite the assurances given by the Minister and others, looking at the parliamentary timetable, it will take more than 12 months to bring in substantive legislation. Again I ask the Minister to give this further consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to legislate for this because in natural justice there is a responsibility on the health boards and the District Courts to ensure that all factors are taken into account and to have regard to the rights of the natural parent.  It is incumbent that the District Court would take account of the issues involved, and I believe that will be done.</P>
      <P>We have a Bill with 64 sections and 57 amendments from the Government side because we believe they should be incorporated in law and we are very anxious to do that as quickly as possible.  The Opposition put down 150 amendments because, I am sure, they too believe they should be incorporated in this legislation. We could spend the next two hours making a case for the inclusion of each of these 200 amendments and each of the 64 sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is to deal with a situation which arose out of a Supreme Court decision last Thursday and in my view, as far as possible, we should confine it to that situation because we do not want to <Col N="1858" /> worsen matters.  I have already referred to amendment b1 in the name of Deputy Howlin.  Regarding that amendment it would appear that there is an obligation on the court to exhaust their inquiries to see if some natural person can be found who is willing and able to take care of the child before recognising the health board as a fit person.  This would make the situation worse than it is at present.</P>
    <P>We are prepared to look at these two amendments in the context of the major legislation.  We all agree with the thrust of what Deputy Howlin wants to do but I do not think it is necessary to have it in legislation.  However, I am not against looking at it to see if there is any amendment we can bring forward in the major legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to proceed but we appear to have agreement on all sides despite the shift in tack in the Minister's last comment which differed substantially from his initial comments. There is no use saying there are 150 amendments.  We are addressing this one.  If all sides of the House agree that this is the correct way to go about providing for the welfare of children, why not enact it tonight so that the law of the land which will be enforced between now and whenever the main Bill is enacted, will reflect this right?  Why not accept the amendment if the thrust is right?  We are not talking about 150 other amendments. we are talking about this one.</P>
      <P>This is the issue: if there is a parent the court deems to be fit he or she should have prior claim to custody of the child before the child is put into an institution or into fosterage.  If there is a parent who is deemed to be fit and is willing and able to look after that child, he or she should be the person to whom custody is given. The Minister says he thinks this would be done by the court in natural justice but is that good enough?  Would he not make sure it will be done by enacting legislation? Surely that is our duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment c1.</P>
      <P>c1 In page 2, before section 2, to inert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.&mdash;Where any health board or one of its officers applies to a court for an <Col N="1863" /> order for the appointment of a person as a fit person pursuant to Section 24 of the 1908 Act, the court shall not enter on a consideration of such application unless:</P>
    <P>(i)  the court has been satisfied that the applicant has furnished a statement to any parent or parents of a child the subject matter of such application, setting out particulars of all matters that may be alleged against such parents and which are alleged to warrant the removal of the care of the child from the care of such parents;</P>
    <P>(ii)  the court is satisfied that all reports prepared by medical practitioners and social workers, and touching upon the welfare of such child, have been furnished to the parents of such child in good time in advance of the application;</P>
    <P>(iii)  the court is satisfied that any recordings, whether audio or audiovisual, have been made available for inspection and to be heard and seen as appropriate by the parents of such child and/or their advisers.</P>
    <P>Time is passing very quickly and there are very important sections which have yet to be reached.  The reasoning behind my amendment is the judgment of the Supreme Court and to afford natural justice. The clear decision of the Supreme Court in the judgment of last week indicated that a procedure such as the one outlined in the amendment would have to be enacted in order to give natural justice to those defending an action for custody taken by a health board.</P>
    <P>The specific steps outlined are clearcut, would not impose any great burden on health boards and would assist in allowing the courts to arrive at the correct decision in relation to a custody application. It would mean, as is normal in most contested cases, that both sides would have access to all relevant information, particularly to any statements or audio visual tapes which would subsequently <Col N="1864" /> come before the courts in making a decision.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up too much time on this amendment but it springs directly from the decision of the Supreme Court, and once again I urge the Minister to accept it and to insert it in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>As in the case of the previous two amendments in the name of the Labour Party, I support Deputy Howlin's amendments.  His two amendments attempt to achieve the same ends, namely, giving regard to what the Chief Justice said &mdash; not in the most recent of the two judgments, but in the ruling handed down on 27 July 1989.  That is important because it means that the Minister has had that ruling at least for a good deal longer than the ruling handed down two days ago.</P>
      <P>The passage from the judgment delivered in July states on page 6:</P>
      <P>Furthermore, for a lawyer acting on behalf of the parents and, therefore, joining issue on the question of abuse to be in a fully prepared position to cross-examine the witnesses dealing with such evidence, it would be necessary for him to have had in good time before the trial reports or summaries of the evidence which was to be given and, in addition, an examination of any video recorded by him and by any medical witness he proposed to call.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The judgment goes on to establish an important point that the proceedings in this nature are not of themselves in essence adversarial but that there is a higher concern &mdash; the duty of the court and of the parties concerned to establish what is in the best interests of the child and not necessarily to do so by mere adversarial means.  The judgment establishes that adequate opportunities must be given to the parties on both sides to consider in full the case to be called, to consider any extraneous material that might be relied on, such as the video recording, reports and assessments, and to facilitate access for the parents to the child for the purpose of carrying out their <Col N="1865" /> own assessment or examination on a professional or other basis.</P>
    <P>The drift of the judgment in laying down a judicial directive to us is that the legislation must change direction and emphasis from what has existed heretofore. For too long in proceedings of this kind the health board or the other authority involved were able to take a child from its parents by way of a temporary order relating to a place of safety and from then on it was a fight, tooth and nail, between the social workers, the representatives of the health authority or the other body corporate involved and it was often in very sad circumstances that a court would be asked to adjudicate on a matter.</P>
    <P>The law now, courtesy of the Supreme Court, recognises that there are sides to the issue which must be respected and facilitated and that a great deal of investigation and inquiry need to be carried out.  The Supreme Court make the point that in pursuing the interests of the child there is a duty on the court ultimately to make sure that all information is available, viewed and considered by the court before a decision is taken.  These amendments are trying to address this point, but I again sadly anticipate that the attitude of the Minister will be that this is all for another day.  My concern is in regard to when that day will be and how long we will have to wait for it.  Both amendments are well and carefully drafted and they would not fall foul of any court of law. They would easily and well address the problem and should be introduced to the legislation tonight.</P>

      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank all <Col N="1866" /> Members of the House.  In an endeavour to meet that requirement I will be as quick as possible.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 8 in the names of myself and Deputy Shatter, which is being taken together with the earlier one for discussion, achieves broadly the same aspiration as Deputy Howlin's amendment. The Minister, in defence of his position earlier this evening, stated that he was refusing previous amendments on the grounds that the purpose of this Bill was that he only wished to deal with matters arising out of the Supreme Court judgment, that there is no doubt that the Supreme Court judgment stated it was invalid to obtain a court order without adhering to certain reasonable procedures. One of those reasonable procedures was to allow parents to have access to all material relating to assessments of the children in question.  Surely it is only reasonable &mdash; if we are trying to plug the gaps that have arisen out of this judgment &mdash; one gap that should be plugged is that the proper procedures for obtaining care orders be adhered to?  I have no doubt that, even in the narrow terms of what the Minister defines as the purpose of this evening's work, amendment No. 8 deals with that.  The wording has been compiled in such a way as to deal with what Mr. Justice Finlay laid down both in July and now.</P>
      <P>The reason I would prefer amendment No. 8 to Deputy Howlin's is that section 58 of the 1908 Act also enters in here. Our amendment asks that Parts II and IV of the Children Act &mdash; although this is only a technical matter &mdash; be enlarged. I am advised legally that it is more comprehensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also go two steps further in saying that as a matter of sound procedure in amendment No. 8 the court itself would have a right to view all video recordings made of such assessments.  We are talking about a delicate balance of judgment here &mdash; whether it is correct that a child is at risk, whether or not abuse has taken place, whether there is a likelihood of abuse again in the future.  The court is looking at this situation coldly.  It is only right that it should have access to the <Col N="1867" /> professional, modern technology available in reaching that decision.  It is not standard procedure, where video recordings have taken place, that the court would seek to obtain same.  I know of such cases.  That is wrong and can lead to faulty justice.  That is just commonsense as well as a requirement laid down by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is only right that the parents or those <i>in loco parentis</i> could seek a second professional opinion in asking for a separate, independent assessment to be carried out.  That would also contribute to the achievement of a balance of justice.</P>
    <P>We heard earlier on Second Stage examples of over zealous social workers, difficult circumstances, relationships breaking down totally between the professionals and the family and a separate independent assessment that would deal with some of the techniques, anatomical dolls and so on that have been questioned in Cleveland and elsewhere.  The common denominator between Deputy Howlin's and our amendment, is that all material, as of right at a pre-trial procedure, be furnished; in good time; that the parents be given notice of the allegations or material against them; that the court itself would become more professional in its approach; that it must view all video recordings; and that an independent assessment could be sought.  On the grounds of natural justice, on the pretext of what the Minister has said &mdash; that this evening's work arises out of the Supreme Court decisions and judgments &mdash; these amendments should meet with the Minister's narrow criteria and be agreed by the House this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In case Deputy Yates misunderstood me, I was talking about the judgment of Thursday last, 2 November, not that of 27 July last.  The effect of this new section would be to require the health boards to make available to the parents of a child who is the subject of personal proceedings full details of all reports of medical and social workers and other assessments carried out by the board on its behalf together with access to <Col N="1868" /> any video recordings of such assessments. That is already the position in law following the Supreme Court judgment of 27 July in the case which gave rise to last week's judgment.  In that area of judgment the Supreme Court ruled that all such assessments and videos must be made available to the parents in advance of the court hearing.  Immediately after the court delivered that judgment my Department circulated it to the health boards to arrange for its implementation in consultation with their legal advisers. I am informed that this process is under way in all the boards.  Draft guidelines to assist health board staff in operating these new procedures are being prepared.</P>
      <P>With regard to subsection (2) of Deputies Yates and Shatter's amendment, it seems unnecessary to require the court to view all videos whether or not they have been presented in evidence. For example, the health board and the parents might be in full agreement that there is nothing on the video that is of any assistance to either party and may decide there is no point in presenting it as evidence.  In such a case it would not make any sense to require the court to view all the videos.  Of course, if the health board or the parents present the video as evidence the court would be required to view it.  That is clear from the Supreme Court judgment of 27 July last.</P>

      <P>I find the Minister's attitude predictable but depressing.  Now that we have Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in Government, we are back into the old nonsense in this House when Governments, just for the hell of it, never agree to any amendments tabled by Opposition parties no matter how constructively intended they are or how useful they may be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I still wish on occasions that perhaps the media themselves would sit in when we reach this stage in debates as well and not disappear because politicians are constantly harangued from <Col N="1869" /> outside this House for not acting as legislators. The problem is that when politicians try to act as legislators they get the sort of negative attitude displayed by the Minister when he delves deeply into his Departmental brief to think of the most spurious of reasons for rejecting amendments tabled to legislation that can only improve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Howlin in the context of his amendment and Deputy Yates in the context of ours have indicated the reason for these amendments.  The merit of the amendment tabled by Deputy Yates and myself over and above that tabled by Deputy Howlin is simply that it applies to all care proceedings under Parts II and IV of the 1908 Act and not merely section 24 of that Act.  That is what is required as a result of the Supreme Court judgment.  It does deal with courts viewing videos.  Even where parents and a health board reach a conclusion that perhaps they do not want the court to view the video, because the Supreme Court have said that the dominant issue is the welfare of children and that an individual district justice has a discretion he must exercise in the context of his duty to protect the welfare of children, whether parents and a health board reach agreement about a video of an assessment being shown or not being shown in court, it seems to me the health board has a duty to tell a district justice that such a video has been made.  A district justice may decide, despite the views of the parents or a health board, to view the video.  That clearly arises out of the Supreme Court decision.  Equally, it clearly arises out of the Supreme Court decision that the parents are entitled to have their child made available to them, when a place of safety order has been made, for the purpose of independent assessments.  The Minister says that he acknowledges the Supreme Court has imposed these new requirements and that he has actually gone to the stage of issuing guidelines to health boards to tell them how they should deal with it.  Are we now to scrap the entire Child Care Bill that is supposed to be going to select committee on the basis that we do not need any <Col N="1870" /> legislation, that what we need is the distribution of secret guidelines by the Department of Health to social workers?</P>
    <P>Have these guidelines been published? Will they be tabled on the floor of this House?  Will they be lodged in the Library of this House?  Are we going to have a Kafka-esque situation where secret guidelines will emerge out of Departments to indicate to health boards secretly how to deal with court cases? Are these guidelines to be made available to parents whose children are being taken into care or where a care application is made?  Will they be made available to a district justice?  Is a district justice dealing with a child care case to be put in a position where health board social workers are operating on the basis of secret guidelines he cannot be made aware of?  With due respect, that is the height of nonsense.  The Minister recognises that the July decision of the Supreme Court requires a marked change in approach on the part of health boards. It requires a change of approach on behalf of the courts.  The way one makes provision for that is not by the issuing of letters containing guidelines; one makes provision for that by embodying it in legislation.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 tabled in the names of Deputy Yates and myself in the first list of amendments which were distributed deals with all of those matters as they arose in the July judgment.  If the Minister says he agrees with what is needed and he agrees with this amendment.  I do not understand why it should not be included in this Bill which is designed to deal with the difficulties arising from the Supreme Court case because it is this Bill the lawyers, social workers and district justices are going to have regard to in future cases.  I predict that if this amendment is not contained in this Bill.  I presume the Minister's guidelines have not gone out to district justices because they operate independently of ministerial guidelines and the district justices have not read all the guidelines &mdash; some district justices will not have read the Supreme Court decision and will not take it all that seriously, because it is a bit of case law <Col N="1871" /> somewhere which they might not have access to and they will not view videos where they should view videos.  As a result there may be some instances where children should be taken into care&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should remind the Deputy that earlier on he asked me to put the question to the House.  We want to discharge three sections and, unless we exercise some restraint, magnanimity or self-sacrifice and do not look for as much time as the Deputy has taken, the Deputy is not going to honour that to which he has already agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem can be solved very simply if the Minister accepts the amendments we have tabled.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The point at the end of the day is that if the Minister will not accept this amendment I have absolutely no doubt there are going to be instances where care orders, made in circumstances where district justices have to view videos, where health boards have not supplied them for some reason or another or where children have not been made available for independent assessments, will be set aside by the courts in the future.  Perhaps they will be set aside in circumstances where it is in the interests of the welfare of the particular child to which they are relevant that that child should in fact remain in care.  I would invite the Minister to move away from the caricature approach which I have seen so often in this House in the past and to regard the amendments tabled by the different parties in this House this evening as constructive attempts to improve the Bill.  The Minister will not lose anything of his public image if he accepts one or two of these amendments.  I invite the Minister to look very seriously at amendment No. 8 which we have tabled and to consider accepting it.</P>

      <P>Yes, because no cogent reason has been given by the Minister as to why the amendment should not be accepted.  In fact, he accepts the principle of it and tells us it is the practice.  If it is the practice by way of procedures issued by guidelines from within the Department surely it should be practice by an Act of the Oireachtas since that is the way the business of the country should be organised?  Laws enacted here should reflect what the elected representatives of the people want to see done.  It is not by statutory instrument, ministerial guideline or any other way but by laws enacted by the Oireachtas.</P>

The video is not the property of the health board and on occasion medics attached to that unit have indicated they will not release either the assessment reports or the videos.  Does the Minister know why they will not release them? They will not release them because they have been advised by the medical defence union that they should not release them to the parents.  That is not the way in which to conduct care proceedings properly. The health boards do not have full control over what happens here and it is one of the reasons we need amendment No. 8.</P>

      <P>This is a technical amendment which has been suggested by the parliamentary draftsman.  The purpose of this section is to provide that a child or young person who is in the actual possession or control of any person, for example, a social worker, foster parent or manager of a children's home, as a result of a fit person order made in favour of a health board shall be deemed to be lawfully in the possession or control of that person.  The purpose of this amendment is to restrict the operation of the provisions to fit person orders rendered invalid as a result of last Thursday's Supreme Court judgment.  It will not apply to orders which might be declared invalid for any other reason.  For example, it could happen that an order might be declared invalid because of a gross violation of a parent's right to a fair hearing of the case. It would not be proper that such an order should attract the provisions here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1876" /> The purpose of this amendment is to remove the term &ldquo;certified industrial school&rdquo; as a place where children can be put into care.  I think Deputy McCartan referred earlier to the 1908 Act which related to a Victorian era.  We do not have many certified industrial schools and those we have are totally unsuitable as places in which to put children.  It is only reasonable to ask the Minister to accept our amendment.  On Committee Stage of the Child Care Bill we sought to have a Garda station excluded and the Minister of State advised us that he was bringing forward his own amendment to remove that entire area of place of safety orders. I should like to ask the Minister to be magnanimous and reasonable and accept this minor change so that children will not be put into these draconian institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. We have reached the stage where we are arguing about very important sections without impressing the Minister.  The change proposed is a minor one but it is important in that it signals an ethos and a philosophy in a clear way.  I am surprised that the Bill is as drafted and I should like to ask the Minister to show that he is willing to listen to us, that we are not talking in a vacuum, and accept the amendment.  If he cannot accept some of the major changes we suggested, surely he can accept the minor change proposed by Deputy Yates.</P>

I am sure Deputies will appreciate why I cannot accept it.  Some 21 of our children's homes, about half of the total, are still legally certified as industrial schools. Those homes no longer deal with young offenders but now provide a service on behalf of health boards in providing accommodation for children in care.  It is proposed in the Child Care Bill to decertify these homes but in the meantime, <Col N="1877" /> I am advised, it is essential that that expression be used in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4.</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;(1)  Where an application is made pursuant to Part II or Part IV of the Children Act, 1908 in relation to the care of a child or young person and the Court is satisfied that it would be proper to make an order under the relevant part of the said Act in substitution for any such order the Court may, where it is in the best interests of a child to do so, make an order (in this Act referred to as a `supervision order') in respect of the child authorising the health board of the area within which the child resides to have the child visited on such periodic occasions as the health board may consider necessary in order to satisfy itself as to the welfare of the child and to give to his parents or to a person acting <i>in loco parentis</i> any necessary advice as to the care of the child.</P>
      <P>(2)  Any parent or person acting in loco parentis who is dissatisfied with the manner in which a health board is exercising its authority to have a child visited in accordance with this section may apply to the Court and the Court may give such directions as it sees fit as to the manner in which the child is to be visited and the health board shall comply with any such direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  Where a court makes a supervision order in respect of a child it may on the application of the health board, either at the time of the making of the order or at any time during the currency of the order, give such directions as it sees fit as to the care of the child which may require the parents of the child or a person acting <i>in loco parentis</i> to cause him to attend for treatment or attention at a hospital, <Col N="1880" /> clinic or other place specified by the court.</P>
    <P>(4)  Any person who fails to comply with the terms of a supervision order or any directions given by a court under subsection (3) or who prevents a person from visiting a child on behalf of the health board or who obstructs or impedes any such person visiting such a child in pursuance of such an order shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £250.</P>
    <P>(5)  A supervision order shall remain in force for a period of twleve months or such shorter period as may be specified in the order and, in any event, shall cease to have effect when the person in respect of whom the order was made ceases to be a child.</P>
    <P>(6)  On or before the expiration of a supervision order, a further supervision order may be made on the application of the health board with effect from the expiration of the first mentioned order upon the court determining that to make such further order is in the best interests of the child.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the provision of supervision orders.  The wording in the amendment is taken from amendment No. 65 circulated by the Minister for Health to the Child Care Bill.  We have to acknowledge that health boards will find it more difficult to get care orders. The sufficiency of evidence they have to present to a district court in order to obtain a care order is such that they may feel that they cannot pursue the application for a care order because it might fail. That does not mean that the health board would be of the view that the child in question would not be at risk.  It is the job of the House to ensure that children at risk are afforded a certain level of protection.</P>
    <P>It has been deemed prudent &mdash; I am sure this will be agreed by all sides &mdash; that supervision orders are a reasonable way to proceed in so far as they allow a health board, and an outside independent agency, to observe, on a regular basis <Col N="1881" /> of visitations, the position of the child. Regular access will be defined by a court under a supervision order.  It is only right that in the new circumstances we should give health boards permission to go to court to obtain a supervision order.  No such order exists under the 1908 Act.  It is generally agreed by all concerned, as is laid down in the Child Care Bill and the revised set of amendments, that this is a reasonable way to pursue it.  I will kick it off with that.  This is a new section to be inserted prior to section 6, which I want to come to, because I feel that is seriously defective and we will probably be challenging a vote on section 6.  In the meantime I feel supervision orders are the best way to proceed and will afford the level of protection to children at risk that may not be available otherwise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Currently if it is believed a child is at risk an application is made to the court and the court may decide the risk is sufficiently serious to warrant the child being taken into care or it may decide there may be some case for concern but the concern is not sufficiently serious to warrant the child being taken into care and as a result the child remains within the parental home.  There is no half-way house between simply leaving a child in the care of its parents unsupervised and the draconian remedy of taking a child out of the care of the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1980 the Task Force on Child Care Services recommended there should be a mechanism within our law that allows the court to make a supervision order so that, where there is a concern that the child is at risk but the concern is not such as to warrant the child being taken into care, the court can provide for a social worker attached to a health board to have access to the home, to see the child in the home, to assist the parents if they are having difficulties in the care of their child and generally to supervise the position. Therefore, there is protection for the child's welfare.  The Child Care Bill seeks to implement the provisions in relation to supervision orders.  It is clear, as a result of the Supreme Court decision and the stringent guidelines set down as to <Col N="1882" /> how the courts must approach the taking of children into care and the expressed preference of the court where there is at least one parent available, who is innocent and can look after the child, that that parent should have custody rather than a care order being made.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the decision of the High Court yesterday in a case the Minister has not yet adverted to, it seems essential that we provide the half-way house of supervision orders.  If the Minister is agreeable that they are necessary under the Child Care Bill there is no reason we cannot enact this provision so as to extend to the courts over the next 12 months, where an application is made to take the child into care &mdash; be it as a result of a section 21 or a section 24 application or a section 58 or 59 application of the 1908 Act &mdash; the option, instead of placing the child in the care of a fit person or sending the child to an industrial school, of allowing the child to remain within the family home with a supervision order made.</P>
    <P>In a sense this amendment is the ultimate test of the Minister's bona fides in his approach to this legislation.  This is an amendment about which there is no party political disagreement between us.  There is no reason this should not be included in this legislation at this stage except if the Minister feels, for some reason due to ministerial pride, that he cannot let an Opposition party get away with inserting a provision in a Bill.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment in the spirit in which it is tabled.  It is tabled in the interests of ensuring we provide protection for children at risk in circumstances where the worries about those children are not sufficiently strong to warrant a child being taken into care but where there is a need for a health board to be involved in some shape or form in supervising the nature of the care the parents are providing in the home for their child.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the comprehensive new section.  I am afraid I anticipate that the response from the Minister will be the same as that to the <Col N="1883" /> other progressive sections we have tried to insert into this Bill.  I have no doubt that he has no fundamental objection to the contents of the section or that, as I said on a previous section, in the fullness of time this will be enacted into law when the main Bill is finally arrived at.  Therefore, it escapes me why, on virtually every amendment that has come before us tonight, the Minister has taken virtually the same attitude: that it is right, but not now &mdash; make the law good, sweet Jesus, but not yet, seems to be the Minister's reaction to all attempts from the Opposition benches to make this, not a comprehensive Act, but as good as we can in the limited time we have.  The intention of the movers of this amendment is to put in a new mechanism that is widely accepted now by the caring agencies, the Members of the House, the Minister and his Department.  I am going to sit down and listen to the Minister's response.  I can only hope that for once in this long debate the Minister will surprise me and say &ldquo;Yes, this is good; I agree with it and, what is more, I am going to accept it and legislate for it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This is an important new proposal and it requires careful consideration. I believe it is not appropriate that it be rushed into law by way of amendment to the Bill; rather, it should be dealt with by the special committee who are to handle the 1988 Bill.  There was nothing in last week's Supreme Court ruling which relates directly to the introduction of supervision orders.  There is no such thing as a supervision order in current legislation.  In this case we should tease this out in the context of the comprehensive Child Care Bill which is at present before the House.  This Bill is interlinked to sections of the Child Care Bill, for example, to section 11 which deals with emergency care orders, to section 15 dealing with care orders and to section 16 which relates to the supervision <Col N="1886" /> order.  In addition there is an interim care order.  These should be looked at in the context of the major legislation, which we hope will not take too long to put through Committee Stage.  We are making good progress this evening on a number of amendments.</P>

Social workers and other personnel are calling on these children to ensure that there is no problem for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the interest of clarification, as I understand it, the Fine Gael amendment borrows heavily, if not almost totally, from a proposal drafted by the Minister.  Therefore, we are clear that our drafting is correct and that the principle is agreeable to the Minister, as it is to the rest of us.  I support the inclusion of this provision in the Bill.  The only issue, apparently, is that the Minister would have this provision later rather than earlier.  That brings us back to the nub of an issue I raised at the beginning of this debate.  I refer to my serious reservations about the commitment of the Government to pursue with any haste or sense of urgency the general area of legislation and the improvement of the law with regard to the care of children. <Col N="1887" /> This exposes fully the way in which the Minister can play around cynically with this important area of law reform, that he is not prepared to address this area.</P>
      <P>What is being proposed here would not interfere in any way with the order of the existing regime.  It is merely the introduction of something more than what exists, that is, giving power to the court, where necessary, to direct supervision in the home of the parents.</P>
      <P>The Minister talks of not rushing through this provision.  Let us put the matter straight.  We have had the report since 1980 and we have been talking on and off here since 1985 about this legislation. The Bill has been available since 1988 so who can talk of rushing anything in regard to amending the law as it relates to child care?  Least of all can the Minister talk in this vein.  He has prior responsibility in this area.  It is regrettable in the extreme that all we have had is an attempt on the part of the Minister to put through what I can only call this plaster affair of a Bill in order to keep the <i>status quo</i> in regard to the law, not being prepared to make a jot of improvement in the existing law.  Once again this underlines the Minister's total lack of commitment to either reforming or improving the law in this area.  The Minister is a cynic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The only pleasant remark I can make about the Minister's response is that, like beauty, progress is in the eye of the beholder.  So far as we are concerned there has been no progress here tonight.  It is regrettable that the Minister was not present for all of the debate the other day on the Committee Stage of the Child Care Bill.  While the Minister of State did his best to deal with the matter, there was a lengthy debate on when the major provisions of that Bill would be enacted.  Deputy McCartan tabled an amendment which was ruled out of order on the basis that it proposed a charge on the Exchequer.  That amendment was that one year from the date of its enactment, the legislation would be brought into operation.  The Government ruled that out of order.  There was a vote <Col N="1888" /> on the section and we sought a commitment to some date for implementation but none was forthcoming, not even 1992.  Therefore, what the Minister has said tonight is of great concern to us. Both within this House and outside it the Minister has said much about co-operation in expediting the passage of this legislation through the Houses.  Let it be recorded that we have had no co-operation from the Government in the matter of improving this legislation. Every co-operation was given by this side of the House in regard to the passage of the Bill.  By his actions the Minister is literally leaving to hang out to dry a child who has been adjudged by a social worker to be at risk and where the parent or parents refuse the social worker any further access to the home.</P>
      <P>All the main players in this legislation, including the Minister, are here tonight and we all agree on the principle of what is proposed. We have used the wording that was used by the Minister's officials. If the Minister continues with his intransigent approach the only sufferers will be the children who are at risk of abuse, who will have no protection whatever now and in respect of whom, as we know from the Supreme Court judgment, it will be even more difficult now to get a care order. That is unacceptable.  If the immediate protection being sought is not to be put in place there is no point in continuing to pretend that we are having a reasonable debate.  In such circumstances we will have no choice but to press the amendment to a vote.</P>

      <P>After what we have heard here tonight from the Minister his new <Col N="1889" /> maxim must be: &ldquo;make me a good law-maker, sweet Lord, but not yet&rdquo;.  We have had a very co-operative Opposition who on foot of a Supreme Court judgment of last week reacted quickly and tabled Private Notice Questions to the Minister asking for action.  We were prepared to scrub today's Order of Business as proposed in order to allow this legislation to be taken.  We acted in good faith but we have been faced with a Minister who refuses to budge on anything, who accepts the merit of amendment after amendment but who, without any cogent reason, refuses to accept any of these amendments.  The Minister is refusing to accept from this side of the House any proposal that would improve the legislation. What do we put it down to?  Is it intransigence?  We cannot even say it is arrogance because the amendment we are talking about will be his own, drafted by his Department.</P>
      <P>The sorry part of this whole unedifying spectacle is that once this Bill is enacted this will be the framework of law under which health boards will seek to look after children at risk.  We can make it better and the Minister knows that.  He knows there is merit in the amendments but he said no to each of them for one reason, which he has repeated again and again &mdash; the time has not come.  Therefore, we are enacting defective legislation by excluding the amendments which the Minister accepts have merit.  It is beyond understanding.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said we are making progress tonight and he commented on the 64 sections and the 200 amendments so far tabled on the main legislation.  Is this the Minister's view of progress?  The Opposition put considerable work into drafting progressive proposals, they sought advice from the caring agencies and tried to improve legislation but all their amendments are thrown out by the Minister as irrelevant.  If that is progress it augurs very badly for the work of the select committee established today.  I despair of making progress on this important matter.  Is the Minister unwilling to yield on any issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nub of the issue has to be <Col N="1890" /> addressed on this amendment and at this time, namely, is Dáil Éireann going to enact the best possible legislation within the time constraints and the pressures we are working under, or are we going to have a deficient piece of legislation because the Minister refuses to accept progressive proposals simply because they come from this side of the House?</P>

Deputies Shatter, Howlin and McCartan know that there has been substantial Government legislation, for example, the Companies Bill.  We have seen a raft of Government amendments to that Bill; there have been amendments to amendments. According to the arguments put forward by Deputies Howlin, McCartan and Shatter we should put through draft legislation on the nod after a few hours' debate.  In this case the proposals have been accepted in principle by this side of the House but they deserve detailed consideration.  The Deputies are not being fair to the substantive Bill.  We have <Col N="1891" /> had the report since the early 1980s and there have been various proposals but we have had only the first draft of the Bill in the past few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us put in perspective what we are proposing to do here.  I am delighted we are joined by the Progressive Democrats' wing of the Government. Whatever about the kind of approach adopted by the Minister, I would have expected that their input in the Government would have resulted in a different approach, particularly on this issue.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to insert a provision in the Children Act to allow the court where a child is at risk to make a supervision order so that a health board can lawfully supervise the welfare of that child while the child remains in the home of a parent.  It is a provision that where it is believed a child is at risk but where the evidence before a court is not sufficiently strong to warrant taking a child into care, it will allow the court to ensure that the child is not simply left unsupervised in a position where possibly he or she could be at greater risk at a later stage without the health board being aware of it.  It is a simple provision to provide for the making of a supervision order, a half-way house between leaving a child unsupervised at home and the draconian measure of taking a child into care.  It is something the Progressive Democrats advocated when they were in Opposition; it is something supported by all the Opposition members in this House; it is something advocated even by the Minister, and supported by the task force on childcare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's attitude to all of this is <Col N="1892" /> that it is a good idea but we will not do it now.  The attitude is that there are children at risk, that not all of them can be taken into care, that the health boards are perhaps supervising them even though they have no legal authority to do so and that perhaps in a year's time we will do something about the matter.</P>
    <P>This is supposed to be a legislative assembly, not a rubber stamping machine for legislation drafted by Departments. We are attempting to legislate but the Minister is refusing to allow the House to perform its proper function.  This Government, composed of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, are telling us they will not allow this legislation to be used as a vehicle to make two or three important modifications that could be passed through this House this evening.  The Minister will not do this because the proposals come from the Opposition benches.</P>
    <P>I hoped we had moved away from that kind of sterile politics.  We moved away from it in the period 1987 to 1989 because we had a minority Government who had to accept the reality of the numbers here.  Fianna Fáil are still a minority. I hope the Deputies who represent the Progressive Democrats and who are now present for the debate will look at what is happening here tonight.  It is becoming quite obvious we will not have time to deal with the other amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in dealing with amendments when we are dealing with a Government who are not prepared to accept the goodwill of Members on the Opposition benches who are trying to improve legislation.  We might as well have closed up shop at 8.50 p.m. this evening.  We have a commitment to improve the legislation and to get it right.  We have now reached the ludicrous point where we have tabled an amendment to support a change we want, using the wording the Minister regards as appropriate for the Child Care Bill, but the Minister will not allow that amendment to be made to this Bill.  I do not <Col N="1893" /> believe there is a single person outside this House who could comprehend the illogical approach of the Minister.  I fail to understand it.  For our part this issue will be put to a vote.  Bearing in mind the time we have, I hope both senior Ministers and the two junior Ministers present will consider between now and when the vote takes place that this Committee Stage should adjourn at 12.30 a.m. by agreement and be continued tomorrow morning because the legislation we are enacting is too important, to use the words of Deputy O'Dea, to be rammed through the House with no real consideration of what we are at.</P>
      <P>If the Minister was willing to indicate that he would be prepared to agree to such an adjournment at this stage to give further consideration between now and tomorrow morning, when his officials might be able to cajole him into taking a more sensible and realistic stance as opposed to doing the usual back-up job of trying to invent reasons to oppose something, he might realise that what we are proposing here is sensible in the context of providing protection for children at risk.</P>
      <P>If Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats vote against this amendment, what they will be voting against is providing protection for children at risk by introducing a legislative measure that every social worker in every health board has wanted to see enacted into law for something like ten years.  The Minister is saying he will not do it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Howlin said we wanted the best legislation within the time constraints, and that is exactly what we want. As has been pointed out so often here today, this legislation is to deal with a decision of the Supreme Court last week. I would have expected Deputy Shatter to be the first to stand up and say we should not take an amendment on a supervision order without taking it in the context of the other orders &mdash; the emergency care order, the interim order, the care order itself &mdash; and that they should all be taken together.</P>

      <P>It is important that these matters should be properly teased out in the major legislation.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, has already pointed out last week, it took two hours to deal with section 1 and two hours with section 2, and now we are dealing with a much more important section in the major legislation and trying to railroad it through in the space of minutes.  That is what the Opposition want.  I agree with Deputy Howlin when he says he wants the best possible legislation within the time constraints&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have already pointed out that there are a number of sections I would like to <Col N="1898" /> see legislated through tonight and, as the Deputies pointed out, the amendment proposed by the two Deputies opposite are taken verbatim from the Bill as presented by the Government.  We certainly would like to see it legislated, and the sooner the better.</P>

      <P>As I have said, I am satisfied that the health boards are coping with this situation. I want to see the section incorporated in legislation but I want to see the legislation brought forward in an orderly fashion.  I am satisfied that what we are presenting here tonight will deal with the issue which arose out of last Thursday's Supreme Court decision.  It is better for this House that we debate the other major section in that major Bill in the Committee.  To those who say we do not accept suggestions from the Opposition, I think it is ungracious of them to come in here and make that suggestion.  Did we not put the Bill before a special care committee at the request of the Opposition?  You could at least recognise that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear to all concerned that the reason we are pushing this amendment, among the several that are in our joint names, is that a situation is arising tonight that for either six days, six weeks, or six months, depending on how long it takes for all the processes of the major Bill to be enacted, there is the major chance that no legal protection will be offered to certain children who are at risk of abuse for whom a court order cannot be guaranteed in order to procure a care order.  That risk is sufficient for us to press to a vote a situation to afford them some level of supervision by health board personnel. In the interests of those children, the Dáil must decide now that this amendment is worthy of consideration.  I have nothing further to add.  I regret that the Minister has not seen that potential risk and acted on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, the Minister mentioned that during the time he was spokesman on health no amendments were accepted on legislation.  I would refer him to the Seanad debates on the legitimacy legislation of 1966 when numerous amendments were accepted and incorporated in the Bill.  In fact, it was withdrawn and brought back in again to the House.  It is now better legislation because legislators in that House contributed to the entirety of the Bill.  It is an example of what can be done and I would ask the Minister to seriously consider what happened at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister, in the light of the seriousness of this legislation, that the Government do not drop the guillotine on this Bill at 12.30 a.m.? It is far too serious legislation to be simply <Col N="1900" /> guillotined without substantial sections being considered and further amendments being considered.  In particular, this House needs time to look at the detail of section 6, as the Minister has it, and the amendment tabled by us on this side of the House.  Instead of dropping the guillotine on the Bill, I propose to the Minister that it be agreed that this House sit later, until we complete the matter, or that it be agreed on all sides that the guillotine not be dropped at 12.30 and that we merely adjourn consideration of Committee Stage to resume at 10.30 a.m. I would ask the Minister to respond to that request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened, in my office, to the last half hour of the debate. The argument which Deputy Shatter has just made that we sit later is the strongest argument possible in the Minister's favour in that he has been more than generous.  I have listened to speakers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;throughout the day to Deputy Howlin interrupting from time to time.  I have listened also to people such as Deputy John Bruton, of the Fine Gael Party, who has been a great advocate of the committee system and I have supported him.  In listening to the Minister proposing a special committee, he has been more than reasonable and generous in saying that he has to deal with the Supreme Court decision of last Thursday.  He is coming here in a generous mood and I do not blame the Ceann Comhairle for becoming annoyed. Quite rightly, you adjudicated with regard to the general guideline which ensued from some exchanges.  People are going to get annoyed at this hour of the night.  If Deputy Shatter suggests that we might delay it further, I am willing to sit here all night if he suggest that, but surely the Minister is right in saying that he cannot take amendments without looking at the context of other major sections of the Bill.  I think it is most unfair of the Opposition to start nit-picking at this late <Col N="1901" /> stage, especially from a party who have advocated all-party committees on various items of legislation.  This Minister is responding to a Supreme Court decision. He has the full resources of the State behind him.  I am not getting into the detail of any specific amendments. Deputy Yates refers to certain children who will be in danger of certain abuses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Is it not safer to adopt that approach?</P>

      <P>As the House appreciates, originally the order of Business was set that we would have Committee Stage of this Bill from 8.30 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. The Government did agree to a request from the Opposition that we would extend the sitting until 12.30 a.m. and we did that.  I do not see any advantage in going beyond that time.  It is important that this legislation should pass through the House tonight because it is going to the Seanad tomorrow.  It is my view that if we extend the time of the House we will go on debating the major legislation and that we would not deal with the issue before the House.

      <P>If you will indulge me for a moment, Sir.  I had thought this morning when the Taoiseach agreed to give some more time to this Bill that there would be a more mature reflection on these issues.  We have not reached the most important section in the Bill and I now invite the Government to again reflect and to defer the taking of this question until the House has had a chance to discuss the important issues arising under section 6 so that we can assure ourselves that we will have done our utmost to get the Bill right.  I ask the Minister to give us time to allow us to consider these issues properly.</P>

      <P>We debated this issue about 15 minutes ago, before Deputy Dukes came into the House.  Listening to his own spokesman and indeed to Members of his party, I was of the opinion that we had already debated the most important section of the Bill.  As I said earlier, we spent the night debating the Bill and the Deputies opposite have debated the major issues.  I do not see any advantage in debating them any further and we should conform to the Order of the House.  I might add that that was the second Order of the House, as the first stated that we would finish the Bill at 10.30 p.m.  However, we agreed to the request of the Opposition to extend the time to 12.30, which was reasonable.</P>

A great deal of uncertainty was expressed in the earlier part of the debate tonight in relation to what we are trying to do for children and their care. There seems to be a view in the House that we will not cause any great harm by delaying it for 24 hours, or indeed two days, which would give people a chance to reflect on what has happened today. A lot has been done but there are still many questions to be answered and it would be wise if the Government made a decision to allow us to discuss the matter further.</P>

I should like to ask your permission to divide my time with our spokesperson on fisheries, Deputy Madeline Taylor-Quinn, and my constituency colleague, Deputy Mary Coughlan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally accepted that the fishing industry is in a very bad and severely depressed state at present. We all know of the difficulties the people in this industry are operating under &mdash; for example, the difficulties they have with the granting of licences for fishing boats.  I think it is true to say that very few, if any, licences are being granted at present.  There is also the difficulty with the GRT, the gross registered tonnage, and very few grants are being allocated under the FEOGA scheme.  In addition, our fishing fleet are subject to quotas both at EC level and with nationally imposed quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision taken on Sunday last to close the mackerel fishing season at this early stage, almost eight weeks before the end of the year, was unprecedented and is another nail in the coffin of the fishing industry.  Never before has this section of the fishing industry been closed so early in the year.  The result of this decision is that the entire mackerel fishing fleet is tied up at piers in Killybegs and elsewhere and the fishermen are not allowed to go out to catch any more mackerel until January next year, weather permitting.  Another result is that crew members will have no option but to sign on for the dole or other social welfare benefits between now and the commencement of next year's season.  In addition, the many hundreds of people who are employed in the processing industry, crane drivers and other ancillary workers on shore, are laid off and <Col N="1912" /> they have to apply for social welfare payments. This is a disastrous blow for these people in the lead up to Christmas.  Many of the families in south-west Donegal who have traditionally depended on this industry as a source of income for their families are going to have a very lean time indeed at Christmas.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago &mdash; I think it was in 1985 &mdash; we had a similar discussion in the House when the mackerel season was closed well into the month of December. In fact, that debate was held on 11 or 12 December 1985.  The reason the industry is being closed so early is because we are paying the price of the disastrous negotiations which were conducted on our behalf last year when we got what was probably the lowest quota ever.  I warned at that time, and raised the matter in the House, about the serious implications of this low quota.  The people of Donegal and those working in the processing industry are experiencing the difficulties which have been caused by these disastrous negotiations.</P>
    <P>We cannot blame the fishermen, because they have co-operated in the management of the mackerel fisheries during the past year.  Not alone did they subject themselves to EC quotas but they also subjected themselves to national quotas and helped to manage the fisheries as best they could.  However, if a fisherman has only about 60,000-70,000 tonnes of a quota and he has a catching capacity of 150,000 tonnes he will end up in difficulties. The irony of this, and to rub salt into the wounds, is that the Dutch, the Scots, the Danes and the Norwegians are as busy as ever fishing for mackerel around our shores when our fishing fleet are tied up.  This has serious implications for our markets, which we have worked hard to capture.  The processors in Killybegs and Donegal, like those in other fishing districts, have spent a lot of time and money capturing markets abroad but they are left exposed to the Scots, the Dutch and the Danes.  That is one of the long-term difficulties we will have to face.</P>
    <P>The only alternative the fleet has is to go to the Rockall section for the remaining 2,000 tonnes of herring that is left. <Col N="1913" /> Indeed, it is hardly worth bringing them to the pier because the price is about £100 per tonne.  We should remember that 2,000 tonnes would not give us one week's fishing with our catching capacity. We could ask our fishermen to go to the Celtic Sea, where some of the quota has not been caught, but there is no market for the fish from that sea because they are out of season.  The fish caught there would not be an acceptable alternative for Japanese tastes.</P>
    <P>The only solution is for the Minister and the Government to press immediately for a supplementary quota of at least 20,000 tonnes.  That would keep the fishermen of Donegal and the mackerel fishermen at work.  Moreover, it would keep those engaged in the processing industry in employment until the end of the year.  There is a high rate of unemployment in Donegal and the people face more unemployment at this sensitive time of the year.  Emigration is staring many of our people in the face.  The common talk along the pier at Killybegs and in the factories of that town, in Meenaneary and Dunkinneely, in recent days is that their only hope is to work on the construction of the Channel Tunnel.  I do not know what the Minister's attitude to that is, but perhaps, in a perverted way, he will look favourably on that solution because it would mean a reduction in the unemployment figures.  We do not want the unemployment figures reduced by fishermen having to depart from our shores.  Those people have been engaged in this industry for years and they should not have to emigrate.</P>
    <P>This problem never arose so early in the season and in my view it is due to a lack of foresight by our negotiators in the last two years.  We have the lowest quota ever and I appeal to the Minister to make an approach to the Commission to have our quota increased by 20,000 tonnes. There are rumours circulating in Donegal that the Minister plans to have the quota increased by 2,000 tonnes, but I wonder what he will be trading off for that concession. I should like to tell him that with our catching capacity an increase of 2,000 <Col N="1914" /> tonnes will keep our fishermen in work for one week.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that we have such a short space of time to discuss this important matter.  As a local Deputy, I should like to voice my concern about this issue.  The fishermen, the processors and those who provide ancillary services are worried about this unprecedented stoppage in fishing.  I realise that we have to be good Europeans and that we must work within the system, but I must impress upon the Minister my grave concern for an industry that is the only lifeline in my constituency.  I will support the Minister in any effort he proposes to make to obtain an interim concession from the EC.  He should do everything possible to allow the boats fish until the end of December.  I am sure he will agree that seven weeks is a long time for fishermen to have to wait at a time when money is needed so desperately.</P>
      <P>It is my hope that the Minister will be successful in his appeal to the EC.  I do not wish to frustrate any negotiations that the Minister proposes having on the quota, but I hope he will be successful in his efforts.  This is a serious matter for the fishermen and processors in Donegal. We are aware of the implications nationally and of the importance of adhering to EC regulations but there is no doubt that the quota is inadequate.  It is because we are dealing with an emergency that there should be an increase in the quota to take us up to January, when the new quota system will be introduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the earliest that the mackerel season has closed for Ireland.  The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, in the House on 11 December 1985 complained about the inadequacy of an 80,000 tonne mackerel quota but <Col N="1915" /> now we have a quota of 69,000 tonnes. That is most unsatisfactory.  The Minister must impress on the EC the problem being caused by the fact that the Dutch fleet continue to fish around our coast. They have a 30,000 tonne quota and a larger fishing fleet but it appears that they are being allowed to fish unhindered.</P>
      <P>There is also concern among the fishing community that there is not proper supervision of our fishing waters.  It appears that there is one law for Irish fishermen and another for fishermen from other member states.  There is a need for a rigid policing of the quota system in all member states.  The Minister must pursue that issue at EC level.  The negotiations that have taken place to date have been unsatisfactory and the Irish case has not been put in a determined way.  The Minister should as a matter of urgency visit Brussels and insist on the EC having another look at the quota system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies for raising this important issue.  It is a matter of great regret to me that European Community policy governing the exploitation of Community fish resources has forced the closure of the Irish western stock mackerel fishery at this stage.  Once the Irish quota had been reached I had no alternative but to close the fishery.  The need for this action stems, of course, from the unsatisfactory level of catch possibilities available to our fishermen resulting from the TAC and the quotas regime approved in Brussels in December 1988.  It is nevertheless important to stress that fishery quotas, while somewhat unpalatable, are there essentially to protect the livelihood of fishermen.  It should be remembered that the first and ultimate victims of any failure to have conservation measures will be the fishermen themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Brussels last year my predecessor &mdash; I reject the idea that he did not fight hard &mdash; was faced with an almost impossible task when pressing Ireland's case for mackerel quotas due to the unfavourable stocks at that time.  I should like to assure <Col N="1916" /> Deputies that at this year's negotiations I shall endeavour, where the scientific evidence permits, to improve the catching possibilities of Irish fishermen.  In particular, I will seek every opportunity to impress upon my European colleagues the vital importance of pelagic fisheries to Ireland and I will be looking for ways and means in which recognition can be given to this.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that when the total allowable catch is decided we get 21.3 per cent of that.  That is the fixed amount and as soon as that weight of fish has been taken the fishery must close. The mackerel fishery has been subject to enormous pressures in recent years and if fish landings are to be improved effective conservation measures have to be in place throughout the entire fishery.  The mackerel stock is now at risk and continuing conservation measures will be necessary to prevent its collapse.  The recent experience of the Celtic Sea herring fishery demonstrated very clearly the disastrous consequences of over-fishing.  This fishery, which was close to total collapse some years ago, has now recovered due almost entirely to positive conservation and control measures.  The measures now being implemented in the mackerel fishery are designed to lead to a much healthier stock position in future years and, hopefully, restore this valuable fishery to its former level.</P>
    <P>As mentioned by Deputies, another important aspect that needs to be addressed is the impact of reduced mackerel landings on the home processing sector.  I have been very concerned to note that over the last few seasons the level of mackerel landings abroad by the Irish fleet has been increasing steadily with a consequent reduction in the quantities of fish available to our processors. In 1987 over 80 per cent of the mackerel catch was landed in Ireland, a bigger total allowable catch than for now.  This has fallen to 50 per cent in the current year. To some extent this has been due to the change in the migratory pattern of the fishery.  In the past the stock migrated to Norwegian waters in the summer months <Col N="1917" /> and moved south westwards to the Community waters in the autumn.</P>
    <P>In recent years, however, this migration to Community waters has been unpredictable as the fish have tended to leave Norwegian waters later each year and consequently have spent less time in the traditional spawning areas of the Scottish and Irish coasts.  This change in the pattern of the fishery has affected the Irish fishing fleet and led to a situation where it has become more economical to land a significantly higher proportion of the catch into Scottish and European ports to the detriment of the home processing industry.  This problem of reduced landings is something I intend to address as a matter of urgency and I shall be consulting the industry well in advance of next season.  I am determined to ensure that the maximum benefit of this fishery accrues to the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>Tá stair ag baint leis an bhfadhb seo, agus níl sé ar intinn agam an milleán a chur ar an Rialtas ná ar aon Aire atá ann faoi láthair.  Thosnaigh na fadhbanna seo i bhfad ó shin.  I 1978 cuireadh tuarascáil le chéile faoi na deacrachtaí a bhí ann i leith taistil.  I 1984 bhí tuarascáil ann agus bhí cruinnithe ag na hoileánaithe agus na coistí atá acu agus na Teachtaí in a measc, an Teachta Molloy, an tAire anois, agus mé féin. Táimid bréan de chruinnithe.  Bhuaileamar le triúr Airí agus níl aon rud le feiceáil as.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have just said, it is not my intention to place the blame on the present Minister, whom I wish well and this is my first opportunity of doing so in his new <Col N="1918" /> ministry.  However, there is an urgency to the issue, and I am very grateful, Sir, that you have allowed me to raise it, of the present position in the Aran Islands. I will list the points I think important.</P>
    <P>First of all, it seems that in relation to the basic Transport Acts the State transport company, CIE &mdash; under those Acts that was their title when they were mentioned &mdash; are in breach of their statutory obligations to provide a service from the islands to the mainland.  I want to take the question particularly as far as it affects the people of Inishmean and Inisheer.  Elderly people on those islands now have no service and if they wish to avail of the air service they have to pay £30.  Approaches have been made to the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, to see if he would be willing to take account of the fact that elderly people's transport costs, under their rights as I understand them to be there by statue, could be met.</P>
    <P>People, and not only such elderly people &mdash; I am sure other Deputies in the constituency have the same experience in this as I &mdash; if they are to avail of their rights under the Health Acts would again have to pay air fares of the order I mention in order to avail of what they are entitled by statute.  Already they face difficulty in arriving at an overcrowded and neglected health service by not being sure they will be seen immediately or even on the day they arrive.  Consider the difficulty of a mother and child on either of the two smaller islands.  They are faced with enormous expenditure to avail of something that one would accept in a normal part of this country would be the rights of a citizen as established.  I have given the example of the Health Acts and I could give many more examples.</P>
    <P>I want an answer this evening about a specific matter.  As one of the Deputies of the constituency, I, and others, attended a meeting on Inishmore, the largest island, at Kilronan.  On that occasion a commitment was given to the islanders.  The history of this revealed that B &amp; I produced a report in 1978.  In March 1984 there was another report.  I have spread in front of me here a sample of the literature <Col N="1919" /> that has unfolded.  The Comhaircumann Inis Mean Teo were writing to me in November 1984 with a copy, having received the interim report.  I have a long set of literature here in from of me of several pages addressed to the Office of the Minister for Communications, then Deputy Jim Mitchell.  This literature of 1986 and 1987 was, of course, accompanied by Dáil questions and items raised on the Adjournment by people, including Deputy Molloy, who is listed in several of them, and me when I had an opportunity. It led to us, the islanders' elected committee and ourselves, making at least three visits to three different Ministers.</P>
    <P>Matters worsened greatly because the <i>Naomh Eanna</i>, which had been serving the islands, then failed to pass its test and was regarded as not entitled to be given a clearing certificate to operate its service to the islands.  They then lost that service. CIE, after considerable pressure, leaving a great deal of time in which there was no service at all, provided a temporary service by the <i>Barrdick</i>.  The <i>Barrdick</i> has been described, to put it mildly &mdash; I would prefer to be polite so late at night &mdash; as an old boat.  It was bought in a clear state really without adequate fittings but it was passed as fit by the surveyor.  It was not passed fit by the surveyor initially; it was not insured.  It was certified for carrying four crew members; it carried nine, and in the same hold &mdash; the worry of the local health board &mdash; commodities, fuel and people were all carried together in the one basic part of the boat.  In this CIE treated their staff with no great respect for the long years of service they had given.  They were simply laid off.</P>
    <P>I do not want to give a negative picture and I want to extract as much positive progress as we can out of this.  The islanders after many discussions met together and presented proposals they had all agreed on, which was quite difficult, on all three islands for a roll-on roll-off service. At one stage we were told this was being examined by consultants, then by CIE, then by the Department themselves who had their own response, and this was all done before the three meetings took <Col N="1920" /> place with the Minister of the day.  That service is still not there.</P>
    <P>I attended the annual meeting of Comhdháil na nOileán in Spiddal. Deputy P. Gallagher, Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, was there.  We recall that these issues were raised.  They are basic because they affect the ability of people to avail of normal services to the mainland.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister reply to me?  Does he agree that the islanders have rights under the Transport Acts and that CIE cannot escape from their social obligations under those Acts?  If CIE did so, have the islanders not still direct rights under the Transport Acts?  I am reluctant to threaten the Minister, but I would advise an islander at some stage, if this continues, to seek a <i>mandamus</i> order to make quite sure these services are delivered.</P>
    <P>I have not mentioned at all that many elderly people, who over the years had to travel in the <i>Naomh Eanna</i>, which spent 75 per cent of its time tied up, at sea or whatever, preferred that mode of travel, however antiquated it was, to the air.  They are now conscripted to use air travel at a price for which they are getting no assistance.  No one in this House needs a lesson from me on expressing £30 as a proportion of an old age pensioner's pension or in relation to somebody with a family.  I have not spoken at all about people, for example, who might want second or third level education for their children.</P>
    <P>The first question the people want answered is in relation to their statutory entitlements.  Their next question relates to the status for the proposal for a rollon/roll-off service.  The third point is that at the meeting on Inis Mór the people were told by the Minister of State at the Department of Education that their requirements would figure in a submission to Europe.  That news was not greeted by these very intelligent people with the sort of enthusiasm the Minister of State may have expected.  I am asking whether proposals have been made to alleviate the problem I am highlighting.</P>
    <P>On the question of communications, it is possible to have a connecting point <Col N="1921" /> between the new services based on tele-sats and so on.  For a basic cost of between £1,000 and £3,000 we can link people on the islands to television communication. They would consider these sort of facilities luxuries but the fact remains that the people of the three Aran Islands are deprived of connection to the mainland. They are being deprived also of their rights.</P>
    <P>The last thing these people wish to be told is that they should make the tedious journey to Dublin once again only to be told at the end of whatever meeting might be arranged for them that some new study was taking place within the Department. I suggest that their time not be wasted in this way.  What they want to hear is whether the Department are accepting their proposals and if there will be an end to their long wait, a wait that began in 1978 with the first report.  In the past two years the difficulties of these people have been made a great deal worse by the going out of operation of the <i>Naomh Éanna</i> service and the putting in its place of the tug which is not suitable.</P>
    <P>The Aran islanders deserve an answer. Brave people have gone to those islands and have taken the risk of locating their industries there.  They have had to write letters asking why their materials have to be carried in this unsuitable boat. Something must be done to relieve the hardship which, I regret to say, the State by not fulfilling its obligations is inflicting on the islanders.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom i dtosach mo bhuíochas a ghabháil don Teachta Higgins as ucht an ábhar seo a chur os comhair na Dála.  Déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall seirbhís níos fearr a eagrú le haghaidh mhuintir Árrain chomh luath agus is féidir ach tá orm suil ghéar a choimeád ar na costasaí.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I am very aware of the concerns of the islanders and of their public representatives about the question of the continued provision of adequate ferry services between the mainland and the Aran Islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the islanders <Col N="1922" /> have been concerned for some years now about the quality of the ferry services to the islands.  They have been pressing, through their public representatives, for the provision of a modern service more in keeping with their needs and with the tourism potential of the islands.  It has been accepted by all concerned that the service provided by the CIE vessel, <i>Naomh Éanna</i>, was less than ideal as it approached the end of its useful life.</P>
    <P>The question of replacing and upgrading the ferry service has been under consideration for some time.  As the Deputy says, CIE, who are responsible for the provision of these services, submitted proposals for the replacement of the <i>Naomh Éanna</i>.  The islanders themselves also submitted a report, prepared for them by marine consultants, which set out their ideas for a new improved service.</P>
    <P>A proposal for consideration by the Government was formulated last year but, regrettably, it had to be put aside due to budgetary constraints.  CIE were then asked to continue to provide the best possible service within the resources available to them.  In the meantime, CIE have continued to maintain some services to the islands by arrangement with local ferry operators.</P>
    <P>The failure of the <i>Naomh Éanna</i> to have its passenger certificate renewed in October 1988 added a new dimension to deciding on future transport arrangements to the islands.  As a result, the board of CIE were requested by my predecessor to prepare a comprehensive report on the matter generally and on the various proposals put forward by all the interests concerned, including the private sector. That CIE report has been under examination in my Department.</P>
    <P>Among the proposals, and some of these were received only in recent months, is the provision of a roll-on/roll-off service, involving two vessels.  It is estimated that this option, and it remains an option, would cost substantially in excess of £5 million when account is taken of the necessary infrastructural developments and related equipment.</P>
    <P>As substantial costs are involved it is <Col N="1923" /> essential that the matter be fully and carefully assessed from an economic and commercial point of view and also, I accept, from a social point of view.</P>
    <P>I can tell the House this evening that my consideration of these proposals is almost finalised and that I will be making a submission shortly to Government on the whole question.  The Deputy will be aware of the high costs involved in any of these kinds of projects and of the need to take this factor into account.  It is necessary to take not only a sea view, as it were, of the question but to take into account the question of integrated transport to the island, that is, both air and sea transport combined and passenger <Col N="1924" /> and freight transport combined.  I can assure the Deputy that I spent many of my younger days on the <i>Naomh Éanna.</i> I know the islands well, so there is no lack of goodwill on my part in the matter of reaching a solution to this problem.  I have found the comments put to me by the Deputy and by other Deputies, including my colleague, the Minister for Energy, on previous occasions to be very helpful.  I will have further news for the Deputy when I have had an opportunity to put the submission to Government.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1628" /> Ireland is actively contributing to the development of a meaningful Community strategy for the conservation of tropical forests which will deal effectively with the causes of their destruction. While international trade in timber is not a major direct cause of tropical forest destruction, one of the actions being considered is a levy on tropical timber imported into the European Community. The funds thus raised could be used in combination with other incentives to help producer countries to better manage and conserve their forests.</P>

At that time Wateford Gas Company manufactured gas from naphtha.

      <P>BGE will give consideration to the extension of supplies to areas removed from the main gas pipeline and without existing gas grids, in the longer term, but it would be unrealistic to assume the likelihood of supply in the short to medium term in such cases.  If the route of the Dundalk gas pipeline had been closer to Ashbourne, the question of its commercial <Col N="1633" /> viability, as a centre without an existing gas grid, would still arise.</P>

There has, however, been direct consultation with the Minister for the Environment in relation to implementation of the EC Directive on Environmental Assessment which covers forestry development in certain circumstances. Furthermore, local authorities are consulted on such matters as grants for private afforestation and applications for tree felling licences under the Forestry Act, 1946.</P>
      <P>I am, of course, concerned that forestry will develop in a way best suited to enhance the environment, and will continue to consult with the Minister for the Environment and local authorities as the need arises.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the condition that, in order to qualify for the favourable low rate of excise applicable to commercial vehicles, a vehicle must not be fitted with one or more side windows in the roofed area to the rear of the driver's seat.</P>
      <P>This condition is necessary to preserve the favourable tax treatment as compared with private passenger cars and mini-buses.  The deletion of this condition would facilitate illegal conversion of commercial vehicles which had borne the lower rate into vehicles which properly attract a higher rate of excise.  There is no restriction on the fitting of such windows but, if fitted, the higher duty must be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that commercial vans are normally designed and supplied by the <Col N="1643" /> manufacturers without such windows and I am not aware of any safety problems from their use as commercial vehicles.</P>

These measures combined with a satisfactory rate of progress on farm inspections should ensure that farmers do not suffer as a result of slightly later inspections than usual.

    <P>My policy in relation to the granting or refusal of a work permit is based on the need to ensure that employment opportunities arising here are reserved, as far as possible, for Irish and EC nationals. The granting of a work permit is not considered unless an employer can prove that, despite all reasonable efforts, no suitably qualified Irish or European Community nationals are available for the position in question or unless the application falls into one of the following categories: (a) the prospective employee is a key worker and that a substantial amount of high quality employment for Irish/EC nationals will arise as a result; (b) the prospective employee is married to an Irish or EC national or a dependant or child under 21 of an Irish or EC national; (c) the person is coming as part of an officially recognised exchange programme; and (d) the prospective employee is an officially recognised refugee. Non-EC nationals in respect of whom work permits are issued must also satisfy immigration regulations.</P>

      <P>The person in question retired in 1983 on ill health grounds and was awarded a Forest Service pension.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the pension scheme, his Forest Service pension should have been reviewed on 17 September 1987 when, on reaching the age of 65, he was awarded a retirement pension from the Department of Social Welfare.  Regrettably this review was overlooked.  His Forest Service pension was reduced to the correct amount in January 1989, after the matter came to light.  I have asked that procedures be tightened to avoid any possible similar overlaps of pensions in future.</P>

      <P>The Parents Alone Resource Centre is one of the nine Irish projects participating in the Second EC Poverty Programme which ends this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 1989, the Council of Ministers adopted the Commission's proposals for a Third EC Poverty Programme which is to commence in December 1989.  The <Col N="1662" /> selection process for projects wishing to participate in the third programme has been completed at national level and the Parents Alone Resource Centre is one of the projects which have been recommended by the Government to the Commission for funding under the new programme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason he has made the means test for assessing eligibility for unemployment assistance by single persons living alone more strict from the middle of this year, in that the maximum proportion of the parents disposable income that can be assessed against an applicant has been increased from 12.5 per cent to 17 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">

      <P>Section 146 (1) (e) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, as amended by section 13 of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, provides that the means of a person for unemployment assistance purposes must take account of the yearly value of any benefit and privilege enjoyed by him or her.  In practice this is generally taken to mean the value of board and lodgings to an applicant residing in the home of his or her parents.  The purpose of the assessment is to achieve a degree of equity as between applicants in different family circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no statutory criteria for the assessment of benefit and privilege and each case is decided on its own merits. Over the years, the deciding authorities have operated from administrative criteria which relate the value of free board and lodgings to net parental income and to the number of dependants in the household.  In general the assessments resulting from these criteria have been fair and reasonable.  However, in 1980 in order mainly to ensure that applicants from small families with incomes below the average industrial wage were treated more equitably, an upper limit of 12.5 <Col N="1663" /> per cent of net parental income was introduced. This percentage figure was recently reviewed in the light of the relative increases in rates of unemployment assistance and increases in earnings since 1980 and the upper limit was increased to 17 per cent.  This represents a maximum assessment of means to be assessed against a claimant and only operates where the means assessment would otherwise exceed 17 per cent of the net parental income.  Many cases are assessed at levels below this maximum figure and are not affected by it.  Where the parental income is derived solely from social welfare payments, there is normally no assessment made in respect of board and lodgings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of ozone depletion arising from emissions of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other gases is a global one and international action is required to combat it. Ireland is participating, in conjunction with our EC partners, in international action under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, which was concluded in September 1987 under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme. The EC is implementing its obligations under the Protocol by means of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3322/88 of 14 October 1988.  The main measures of the Protocol, in relation to chlorofluorocarbons, involve stabilisation from 1 July 1989 of production and consumption at 1986 levels, a reduction of 20 per cent on the 1986 levels from 1 July 1993, and a reduction of 50 per cent on the 1986 levels from 1 January 1998.</P>
      <P>On the basis of recent scientific evidence the Montreal Protocol is now generally regarded as not going far enough and the EC has concluded that an 85 per cent reduction in CFCs production and use as soon as possible with a view to their total elimination by the end of this century is required.  The EC will be negotiating for a review of the Protocol on the basis of these conclusions at the second meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Protocol which is due to take place in London next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within that overall framework, the <Col N="1669" /> speed at which production and consumption of CFCs can be phased out is dependent on the ready availability of suitable alternatives which themselves have to be proven to be toxicologically and environmentally safe.  I believe that action at EC and international level is most appropriate and in these circumstances an outright ban on the import into and sale in Ireland of CFCs is not being considered at this stage.</P>

Under the present arrangements, grants of up to 80 per cent of the cost of constructing a new pool or 100 per cent of the cost of refurbishing an existing pool are payable, subject to the overall availability of funds for swimming pools in the Public Capital Programme and taking account of competing demands for these funds.  The scheme is restricted to swimming pools and only works which meet the standards set out in my Department's guideline specification for swimming pools are eligible for grant aid.  The Public Capital Programme provision for the scheme in the current year is £560,000.  This sum has already been allocated in full in respect of two projects. All swimming pools provided by local authorities are eligible for consideration <Col N="1679" /> under the scheme.  At present, applications for grants towards the construction of three new swimming pools and the refurbishment of eight existing pools are before my Department.</P>

      <P>The availability of medicines, whether natural or otherwise, is governed by the following regulations: Medical Preparations (Licensing of Manufacture) Regulations, 1974, Medical Preparations (Licensing of Manufacture) Regulations, 1975, Medical Preparations (Wholesale Licences) Regulations, 1974, Medical Preparations (Licensing, Advertisement and Sale) Regulations, 1984 and Medical Preparations (Control of Sale) Regulations, 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These regulations do not distinguish between &ldquo;natural&rdquo; and &ldquo;artificial&rdquo; medicines, whether proprietary or non-proprietary. The regulations arise out of our obligations under EC Directives relating to medicinal products which require, that from May 1990, no medicinal product may be placed on the market without a product authorisation.  The basis on which the regulations were drawn up relate to the quality, safety and efficacy of <Col N="1687" /> medicinal products, with a view towards protecting public health.</P>
    <P>I am currently taking steps to ensure that the EC date of May 1990 which I have referred to is met by all persons marketing medicinal products in this country.</P>

For the purpose of the scheme reckonable income means gross income from all sources, less any sum <Col N="1699" /> paid by way of contribution to a superannuation fund, and excluding also children's allowances under the Social Welfare Acts, holiday earnings of the candidate and payments under the family income supplement scheme.

      <P>Iarnrod Éireann's policy is to provide a seat on its trains for each passenger within the resources available to them.  This objective is met on most occasions.  Exceptions do arise, however, mainly at holiday weekends and on the occasion of major sporting events.  Iarnrod Éireann have assured me that every effort is made to forecast travel patterns accurately and where necessary scheduled services are augmented by auxiliary services subject to the availability of suitable rolling stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board advise me that standing on trains, while not desirable, or in accordance with their policy, does not infringe any regulations and does not have any special safety implications.  The determination of the criteria used in assessing standards for safety in trains is the <Col N="1708" /> responsibility of Iarnrod Éireann, whose staff are trained to operate trains in a careful and effective manner.  The design and construction of the rolling stock are based on the company's and their manufacturers' standards.  The vehicles are equipped to cater for very heavy levels of traffic.  The company have assured me that safety of operations is afforded the highest priority.</P>
    <P>Safety requirements in relation to the railway are monitored by my Department through the exercise of its functions in relation to the investigation of accidents and the inspection and approval of railway works as required by the legislation.</P>
