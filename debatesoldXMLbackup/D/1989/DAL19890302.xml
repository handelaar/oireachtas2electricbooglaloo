    <Title>Agreement with the United States on the Development of Technology-Based Joint Projects: Motion.</Title>
    <Col N="2156" />
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Agreement between the United States and Ireland relating to the development of technology-based joint projects between small and medium-sized companies which was laid before the Dáil on 8 December 1988. </P>
      <P>The approval of Dáil Éireann is necessary as the Agreement will give rise to a modest element of charge upon public funds of an administrative nature within the meaning of Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution. As this Agreement is to come into effect on signature by both parties this House's approval is necessary now before such signature.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Agreement is to provide a framework to encourage further joint ventures and projects between US and Irish firms.  Most of the 343 US firms now producing goods and services in Ireland operate as wholly-owned subsidiaries. Their US parents are usually large firms with a network of other such subsidiaries elsewhere in the world.  Few involve joint ventures or projects with Irish partners.  This Agreement provides a means in the future to increase the number involving Irish partners.  It is particularly aimed at smaller and medium-sized US firms who have yet to develop significant overseas operations. As 1992 looms ever nearer, the IDA see particular potential for promoting joint venture projects geared to European markets involving small and mediumsized US firms.  There are many such firms with no overseas investment which would benefit from a European presence. For some years now, the IDA's partnership programme has marketed the joint venture approach in the US and further afield.  The Agreement before the House today should facilitate these IDA efforts in several respects in the US case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The text of the Agreement was laid before the House on 8 December 1988. <Col N="2157" /> Article I commits the parties to help in the formation of joint projects.  Article II provides for a framework to find partners and funding for partnership projects.  The key element of this framework is provided for in Article III.  An executive officer is to be appointed to manage the programme.  He or she will be pivotal to the success of the Agreement.  To emphasise the complementarity with the IDA and, indeed, to avoid creating new overheads, it has been agreed that the officer will be existing IDA staff member who will be assigned to this role.</P>
    <P>Article IV provides for a designated US Department of Commerce official based in Washington to liaise with the executive officer.  This official will identify candidate US firms and seek out commercial funding sources for joint projects.  This official will work closely with the executive officer in Dublin.  This active assistance by the US authorities in locating candidate firms and also in helping US firms to locate funding within the US for their Irish projects are two significant new features of benefit to the existing IDA operation which I draw to the House's attention.</P>
    <P>Article V provides for the executive officer and the US Commerce Department official to work together to elaborate the mechanisms required to implement the Agreement.  It also provides that both parties cover their own costs: I will return to that point later.  A joint advisory committee, provided for in Article VI, will advise on general policy matters.  This committee will comprise leading private sector figures and Government officials from Ireland and the US.  I will be giving careful attention to the composition of this committee in the near future.  The closing articles, seven and eight, provide for entry into effect for five years on signature, for the Agreements amendment or extension, for termination by either party at 90 days notice and, finally, for a declaration that nothing in the Agreement prejudices the obligations of either party in other contexts.</P>
    <P>The direct benefits of this Agreement <Col N="2158" /> to Ireland lie in its potential to supplement the IDA's efforts.  The new ingredients are active US administration support in finding partners for Irish firms and funding sources for them.  The ultimate benefit to Ireland will be more jobs, wealth creation and exports.  Equally for the US side, the ultimate benefit will come largely from the earlier access to European markets of its smaller and medium-sized firms to cope with conditions in the years after 1992.</P>
    <P>The administrative costs of the Agreement will be modest.  I have mentioned that the IDA will provide the executive officer and his facilities within its existing operations.  The net extra cost will be confined to the travel costs of Irish members of the joint advisory board attending meetings in Washington.  This is estimated at £6,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my introduction, Dáil approval is being sought now as the Agreement comes into effect on signature. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will make the necessary arrangements with the US side for the signing.  I would hope that the Agreement could be made operational within weeks.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, can I again emphasise to the House that this is simply a framework: it will be up to those on both sides and, especially the executive officer on the Irish side, to make it work to best effect.  I am satisfied that it can make a difference: the concept is right, the mechanism can work, the partners are out there and both sides are committed. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to talk on this motion.  It is a welcome move.  A longstanding problem with relationships between Ireland and the US is that there has been a very low element of franchising and joint venture links between Ireland and the US despite the heavy general investment.  Indeed, some years ago it was shown that only 2 per cent of US investment was in that area although it was on a much larger scale with other countries with which the US were getting involved.  There is no doubt that this is a welcome initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2159" /> It is very important to point out that one gets out of efforts what one puts into them.  The Government's record on being willing to support research and development in Irish industry has been deplorable. In recent years there have been savage cuts in the amount of money devoted to this sort of activity.  When the National Board for Science and Technology reviewed Government funding for science and technology recently they showed a litany of dramatic cuts in research spending financed by Government in the period up to 1987.  In the manufacturing industry about which we are now talking the cut was 20 per cent.  It was greater in agriculture and still greater in building and construction where it reached 40 per cent.  In the environment which is so important to us the cut was 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the most important area in the light of what we are talking about today, the area of technology transfer, the NBST report showed that the Government had axed by 50 per cent their spending in this area.  They had halved their willingness to support initiatives in this area.  While it is all very well to talk about nurturing links between the US and Ireland and to hope that US companies will merge with Irish companies in their efforts, we must remember that we will only get out what we put in.  With the Government slicing in half their support for technology transfer of this nature, my hopes for dramatic progress are somewhat dampened.</P>
    <P>We will have to look at the whole research and development activity of our industrial sector compared with Europe, as we move into 1992.  We have an opportunity to review this area and it presents a grim picture.  Compared with European countries with which we will compete in the coming years Ireland spends only about 30 per cent of what the other European countries spend on developing new industry and investing in research and development.  If we are to move away from being the hewers of wood and the drawers of water of Europe we will have to step up that commitment of research and development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2160" /> I have to acknowledge that our problems do not only relate to the Government's unwillingness to give support in this area although it is sad to see such savage cuts.  The weakness of our industrial structure has led to our problems.  It is important to look at the structure of industry.  In the last six or eight years the only source of employment growth has come from small companies employing fewer than 50 people.  All the other branches of industry, medium sized and large industry have suffered massive cuts in employment.  We have depended heavily on the small firm to produce jobs but evidence shows that only 2 per cent of small firms spend anything on research and development.  That paints a grim picture for the future if the only source of growth in employment is coming from small companies and those companies are not able or willing to put money into research and development.  The outlook as to whether we will be able to withstand competition in Europe is not good.</P>
    <P>While this initiative is welcome and while it is focused on small and medium sized industries it is far from sufficient to redress the problem where only 2 per cent of small companies are engaging in research and development of any sort. That is the nub of the problem.  It will need a much broader initiative than what has come from the Minister today.  The Minister will need to put a great deal of work into this area.</P>
    <P>I have a direct interest, on behalf of Fine Gael, in the energy budget.  In that area, commitment to research and development has been pathetic.  We spend less than one-twentieth of the common European level of expenditure on research and development in energy. It is well known that the excessive cost of energy and the poor efficiency in use of energy in this country is one of the major handicaps with which we will have to deal as we move into a more competitive environment in the European Community. Because the Government are putting only one-twentieth of what other European countries put into this effort, we will not be able to get on top of that problem.  The other area which deserves <Col N="2161" /> some mention in this context is the multinational companies based in Ireland.  We continue to suffer from the fact that the bulk of the multinational companies in Ireland do not locate their research and development activities here as well.</P>
    <P>Recent surveys of, for example, the electronics sector which many of us look to as the great white hope and the great modern effective sector that can bring jobs to Ireland, show that Irish plants do not have the strong product development capability to produce the new generation products that will be needed from the electronics sector if those jobs are to be sustained and to grow.  The reality is that a survey of the Irish electronics sector showed that we spend only one tenth of the amount of money on research and development, comparatively speaking, as other European countries.  That shows up the problem we have had with multinational movement into Ireland in recent years.</P>
    <P>Basically, the companies have not moved their product development and their research activities into Ireland, and Ireland has become dependent on a generation of products in these sectors that may well be superseded by technology. Until we can redress the balance we will always be vulnerable.  The industries which so many of us have looked to as being on the leading cutting edge of technology may prove for Ireland to be a great disappointment if we cannot get on top of that problem.</P>
    <P>The initiative before us today, while welcome in itself, is only scratching the surface of the task that has to be taken on.  It is important that this Government address in a much more coherent way than they have been willing to do to date, the issue of Government support for research and development initiatives from small and medium size industry.</P>
    <P>I know this Government have faced a financial problem which necessitated cut backs in spending.  However, in the energy research budget that spending was cut by 90 per cent.  That does not show any real regard by this Government for the long-term value of research activity. If we are to move beyond being the <Col N="2162" /> menial workers of Europe, we must beef up this area of activity.  The Government's action in recent years in cutting research and development is effectively eating the seed potatoes that will be so important for Irish industry in the coming years.  We are squandering what would provide the basis for growth and development in this economy.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister of State, who has taken a great deal of interest and a great deal of care trying to bring in initiatives and to get a greater commitment from his Cabinet colleagues and specifically from the Minister for Finance to this effort.  It is clear that the Cabinet does not have any commitment to this area of activity.  It is sad that the Government should behave in this way.  We all know there are financial difficulties but to eat the seed potatoes of tomorrow is not the way forward.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, while the US link up is welcome, we should not forget our European colleagues.  In the energy area specifically the European Community has consistently committed about 100 million units of account to demonstration projects throughout Europe in the energy sphere.  Many of these have been extraordinarily successful, only 20 per cent failed despite the fact that these are high risk projects.  Therein lies a pool of worth-while projects that are replicable in countries like Ireland.  The Minister of State should look to these European demonstration projects as a source and pool of effectively displayed knowledge that could be applied in Ireland.  It is difficult for a small country like Ireland to engage in green field research, but to piggy-back on already proven efforts in other countries can provide Ireland with a great return.  I would like to see the Minister address that point.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look at the semi-State bodies within his own area. The present position of State companies, to whom we look for so much, is deplorable in the area of research.  Less than 0.1 per cent of their turnover is being devoted to research and development. If our energy and telecommunications sectors are to be among the most modern <Col N="2163" /> and efficient in the world, we must rectify that situation.  We will have to look not only to the US, welcome as it is, but to ourselves and to our commitment to research.  As I said earlier we will get out of this initiative what we are willing to put into it and the record to date is that this Government are willing to put very little into the effort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the Agreement before us today and I agree with the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The Progressive Democrats welcome this new and forward looking development. There is no doubt that Europe has a very serious problem when we look at the world of technology and at the state of development throughout the world. Europe is very far behind the United States and Japan.  All recent discussions and speeches which I have heard on this subject have stated clearly that a quantum leap is needed by Europe if it is to match the United States and Japan. Obviously I am thinking in terms of the Single Market that is well underway at this time.</P>
      <P>This Agreement provides this country with a strategic opportunity to play a role in helping to upgrade and get involved in research, and development with regard to technology.  I accept that we will not be capable to start with green field projects. Research and development and technology development is a very expensive business and, particularly in the United States, it is a very expensive exercise and requires large sums of capital for investment.</P>
      <P>When you look at a country like Ireland there are certain advantages which we can, with the United States, look to and offer.  The most obvious advantage is the type of graduates who qualify in Ireland at present, the calibre of these graduates is very high and their qualifications are very high.  Indeed, they are being snapped up by companies throughout the world.  Obviously we want to keep that expertise and put it to work here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the type of packages and the <Col N="2164" /> type of cost structures available here in terms of employment costs are far cheaper in many ways than in the US.  On three levels we have advantages, this country can offer to the United States. There is the quality of the students available to go into technology.  There is also the type of packages the IDA may be able to put together in terms of taxation, tax breaks, tax packages and grants packages which could be very attractive.  I would like to hear the Minister comment on this, have the Government looked at any specific package which is geared directly to suit the intent of this Agreement. That would be very important.  If it was done it would certainly look an attractive investment prospect for American companies either on a joint venture basis, which I would prefer to see, or, in other ways.  Because of those factors, the cost of research and development could be far more attractive to some of the companies in the United States.</P>
    <P>Obviously major American companies, be they large or small, will not shift their research and development entities into this country but there are opportunities for aspects of those companies to be developed in Ireland.  One very obvious area where this could happen is in the food technology sector. Ireland is without doubt one of the world leaders in the developments which are taking place in the food sector.  We have the raw materials and the produce and because of the perception of the environment of this country the quality of our food which is available on the world market has a good image.  However, with the advent of 1992 we need &mdash; and American companies could look to us for this &mdash; to look at the technological research and development which is required in this area and would be of great benefit both to companies here and companies in the United States who need access to Europe.  This is one logical and obvious area which could be developed and not enough has been done up to now.  This Agreement should be looked at specifically in this regard.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the development of Europe in the context of 1992 and, as I <Col N="2165" /> have said on numerous occasions in this House, we are strategically located <i>visà-vis</i> Europe and the United States for continued joint co-operation in the industrial area on joint projects with companies from America and in Ireland.  As American people and American industry are being made more aware of 1992, they realise the importance of gaining access to this market, access they may not have to the same extent in certain areas if they are not involved in commercial activities in Europe.  Of course, Ireland is within Europe and this Agreement should be viewed by American companies and the Secretary of Commerce as a very positive step forward in this area.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister, in relation to the Agreement, if he already has some specific projects in mind.  The reason I ask this question is that the Agreement looks fine on paper but much of what the IDA are doing in attracting American companies here for various reasons is already under way and I wonder if the Department already have some specific projects in mind.  I should like the Minister to give me an answer to that question.  Secondly, because the Agreement is related specifically to the scientific and technology fields and I want to ask the Minister if he sees this as a focus for the development of the technology parks in this country.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, specific areas, particularly in the south east, have been designated as technology parks and I want to know if the Minister and his Department see this Agreement as a way of developing those technology parks and, if so, what type of framework he is going to put in place for that to happen. We all know of the technology parks which have been developed in the UK and the enormous amount of finance which is needed to develop a technology park to the level where it can really be called a technology park.  It is not worth giving something a fancy title and having only a green field or a little workshop in the area.  It takes serious companies with research and development intent and a technology base to develop these parks. <Col N="2166" /> I should like the Minister to reply to that question also.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us what the executive officer's role will be <i>vis-à-vis</i> the IDA, the relationship which will exist there and more specifically, for example, the financing of the executive officer and whatever team he has under him so that they can do their job properly. Deputy Bruton was correct in saying that one only gets out of these projects what one puts into them and funding should be made available to put an expert team to work in this area to go to the States and work in conjunction with the people there on an ongoing basis, and not on a hit and miss basis every few months just to be seen to be doing something.  Will the IDA develop a specific package or is it envisaged that some of the packages which the IDA have in existence at present will be the vehicle for attracting industry into this country?</P>

      <P>I will conclude by asking a final question.  I want to ask the Minister what the basis of the committee will be. I do not see any mention in the Agreement of what role the American Embassy in this country will play.  I think they have a commercial attaché here and I believe there should be some role between that individual, the executive officer here and the person in the United States.</P>
      <P>Finally, as the American Ambassador is present this morning I should like to congratulate her on her stay in this country and to wish her every success on her return to the United States.  It is fair to say that she was one of the finest Ambassadors to this country and indeed she brought the life of the Embassy into the industrial, commercial and business life of this country, which has been very successful.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cullen, being the <Col N="2167" /> perfect gentleman, has stolen some of my lines.  Obviously the importance of this Agreement is verified by the presence of the Ambassador here this morning and I too should like to pay my respects to her. She has made a tremendous impression in this country and has been a great success. Obviously she is working right up to the end to ensure that this Agreement is fulfilled. I wish her the best of luck in the rest of her career, and I am not sure whether we have enough influence with Washington to have her kept in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Agreement and I want to make some brief remarks on it.  It is a step in the right direction and I hope it is successful.  It is very important that we should set out to maximise the number of joint ventures which can be put in place between Irish companies and companies in the United States.  There will be tremendous opportunities on both sides of the Atlantic, particularly in relation to 1992 and the opening up of the European Market with the implementation of the Single European Act.  They are opportunities we cannot afford to miss and we must be in a position to take full advantage of them. Therefore, I believe this Agreement is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>One aspect of the industrial programmes we have had over the past 20 years, which I believe has been a major weakness, has been a lack of joint ventures and a lack of input from Irish companies and personnel into the decision-making process which takes place within the very large multinational companies which are located in this country.  In that respect I would be in favour of the development of joint projects rather than what we have had in the past.  That is not to question the <i>bona fides</i> of the decision makers, be they in New York or San Francisco, but it is most important that we should have the maximum possible Irish input in relation to decision-making for companies on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some reservations about the Agreement and perhaps the Minister can clarify whether the nuts and bolts of the Agreement are adequate for the size of <Col N="2168" /> the task which lies ahead.  I would not like to put my money on one official in the IDA supervising this task, given the size of the task and the level of opportunity which exists in the United States for companies who are now beginning to focus on Europe and look at Europe for new market opportunities.  Many American companies, particularly small and medium ones, approach Europe with absolute apprehension, because many of these companies are owned by families who have not had any experience of selling abroad or of the European markets. Certainly, the opportunities in the United States are unlimited and I am not at all convinced that the appointment of one official will go anywhere near satisfying the opportunities that are out there.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, perhaps it is to be expected that all beginnings are weak and this may be a start in the right direction. I should like to feel that the Minister of State would come back before this House as a matter of urgency should further funding and further manpower be necessary. To save pennies, we should not delay being in a position to maximise the opportunities.  The IDA have had tremendous success in attracting foreign industry.  This is a new and welcome phase.  I would like to have a reporting process to this House.  I do not see that mentioned in the Minister's speech or in the Agreement.  It would be of interest to this House to have a report on an annual basis to ensure that the Agreement is working.</P>
    <P>One aspect on which I have some queries is whether there is an opportunity for semi-State industries within the terms of the Agreement.  The Minister might clarify that, because our semi-State industries at this time are looking for new opportunities and new directions, particularly the Electricity Supply Board and Bord na Móna.  They should be in a position to benefit and make a contribution, if permitted, within the terms of the Agreement.  To continue to be successful they will have to broaden their horizons and perhaps there will be opportunities here.</P>
    <P>In general, I welcome the Agreement. <Col N="2169" /> I hope it is a step in the right direction and that we and the companies in the United States will benefit from the Agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Agreement because of the benefit it can give to our small and medium sized companies in joint ventures.  The Workers' Party are in favour of the widest possible exchange of information, particularly in relation to research and technological development between firms in this country and firms in as many other countries as possible.</P>
      <P>Much impressive work has been done here both by Irish firms and by foreign firms based here.  Much valuable research and development work has been done particularly in the technological area.  As other speakers have said, this is only scratching the surface and the research and development area is one in which most investment should be made.  This area has not received the attention which it should have been given by many Irish firms.  Had it received more attention, we might have been able to compete better and the unemployment figures would not be as high as they are today.  Anything that helps Irish firms to expand their research and development activities is very welcome.</P>
      <P>There are a number of matters arising from the Agreement on which I want to ask clarification from the Minister.  The Agreement refers to small and medium sized companies in both countries. Ireland is a country of only three and a half million population and the United States population is over 200 million, so what constitutes a small or medium sized company here would not compare in any way with what would be regarded as such in the United States.  There is clearly a danger that the Irish firms could be dominated or swamped by very much larger US companies.  It seems odd that there was no attempt made in the Agreement to define by turnover, number of employees, or anything of that nature, exactly what constitutes a small or medium sized firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another serious matter that <Col N="2170" /> needs to be referred to.  It is well known that the United States use high technology and access to technical knowledge as a political weapon and operate a strict policy of limiting access of such information to countries which they consider to be politically acceptable to the United States.  This has nothing to do with military information but with purely technological information which relates to technology in general and especially to computers and electronic equipment. The aim of this policy is to prevent countries which the United States consider to be politically unacceptable from getting the most up to date information and technology and thereby restrict their industrial and economic development. The countries discriminated against in this way are the socialist countries of eastern Europe, as well as other countries such as Cuba and Vietnam.  It is all clearly set out in the United States Export Administration Act.</P>
    <P>The United States are, of course, quite entitled to decide what technical information they will or will not make available to other countries, but their policy and the United States Export Administration Act go much further than that. They also insist that US companies based in other countries and any countries that have access to US civilian technical information must themselves not be involved in any such export of goods or information to these socialist countries.  There is a very powerful, but rarely spoken of organisation called the Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, known as CoCom.  There are 16 nations in CoCom headed by the US.  It includes all members of NATO, except Iceland, and Japan is also a member.  It was founded in 1951 and now operates out of an annexe to the US embassy in Paris.  CoCom circulate detailed lists of goods, technical equipment and information which may not be exported or reexported by member nations to specified countries.</P>
    <P>Officially, Ireland has nothing to do with CoCom, but unofficially anyone involved in the high-tech area will accept that Ireland operates under the rules set <Col N="2171" /> down by CoCom.  On November 4 1987 the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Reynolds, in reply to a question told Deputy Pat McCartan that &ldquo;because of its militarily neutral status, the State is not a member of CoCom. However, in <i>The Irish Times</i> of February 2 1988, Mr. Colm Donlon of the IDA is quoted as saying that Ireland &ldquo;subscribed to the rules but is not a member&rdquo;, adding that subsidiaries were &ldquo;obliged by their headquarters to apply the rules in relation to CoCom&rdquo;.  According to <i>The Irish Times</i> article, the heads of a number of leading multinational companies with US parents knew all too well what CoCom were about.  One such head is quoted as saying: &ldquo;I'd be shot, drawn and quartered if they knew I was talking about CoCom.  We're not allowed to talk about it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There has been no indication that, even with the improvements in East-West relations, the United States are prepared to drop the cold war attitudes to exports to other countries which are typified by CoCom.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party would be concerned if this Agreement were to lock Ireland and Irish firms that are not subsidiaries of any US firm but are going into a joint venture with US firms more firmly into the CoCom set-up, which would mean restrictions on countries to which they could export their goods.  The United States are a very important market for Ireland and they are also a very important source of industrial investment for this country.  Very many thousands of jobs are dependent on United States investment.</P>

      <P>I was just saying that we must not allow ourselves to be cut off from other important developing markets by this Agreement in relation to our exports.  I ask the Minister to give an <Col N="2172" /> assurance that this will not happen and, in particular, that any company which enters into an arrangement with a US company to co-operate on scientific and technological matters under the terms of this Agreement will not be prevented under CoCom rules from exploring the possibilities for similar co-operation with firms in other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this programme which will benefit both nations. In regard to the number of American firms established here, it is important that there should be much greater involvement, particularly where grants are paid for their development and there should be a much greater equity base for Irish citizens in such companies.  Because of our location on the edge of Europe, the Agreement will benefit American businessmen who are anxious to be involved in the European market.</P>
      <P>The Agreement outlines the situation in regard to the IDA but there is no reference to SFADCo who look after a large share of the south and central part of the country and part of my constituency. About 30,000 people in my constituency are involved and I should like the Minister to tell me why SFADCo are not mentioned.  There is a much greater possibility of expanding the work of An Bord Scoláireachtaí Comhmalairté. They were set up in 1957 and have been of benefit to young Irish people who have gone to the United States of America on scholarships, to do research and to continue their studies.  The board comprises four Irish citizens &mdash; one of whom is the chairman &mdash; and three American citizens.  Many people in rural constituencies are very anxious to engage in third level education at home and there is great scope for expanding the board.  I ask the Minister to consider this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my thanks to the Deputies on the other side of the House for their support in relation to this Agreement. One of the important selling points we can make in this country to the United <Col N="2173" /> States and other external investors is that there has been a consistency of approach towards inward investment.  Any external investor would, of course, baulk at investing in a country where the investment could be affected by changes in policy arising from a change of Government.</P>
      <P>In recent years we have witnessed the growth of new phenomenon in United States business circles, the presence of a number of young Irish graduates in managerial positions in United States companies.  This presence offers the potential in future of persuading their boards to invest in Irish projects.  Indeed, this has already happened on a number of occasions in the recent past and the IDA and SFADCo maintain a policy of keeping in touch with these individuals. This week we saw an example of this phenomenon at work when Alltech, a biotechnology feed company established by an Irish graduate in the United States, gave further indication of their intention to move their manufacturing activity to Ireland.  Some of their other operations are already in place in Ireland.  I am, therefore, optimistic that the new mobility of well qualified Irish graduates in business circles abroad will lead to increased investment in this country.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate, correct and proper to pay particular tribute to the outgoing American Ambassador, Mrs. Margaret Heckler, who in her vivacious and energetic fashion supported this project from the outset and was instrumental in a major way in ensuring that the Agreement got to this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Originally we had sought US public funding to be used jointly with the incentive support from the Irish development agencies in support of this Agreement. However, we must be aware that there are now strict controls on public expenditure in the United States and these controls operated during the early stage of negotiations on this Agreement.  There is a strong sentiment in some quarters in the United States, including Congress, against agreements like this which are seen in some quarters as exporting United States jobs.  It took a lot of work in Washington to uncouple this particular <Col N="2174" /> Agreement in these circumstances and to get it to this point.  Indeed, I understand that, while the United States have broadly comparable deals with Israel, India and France, no further similar negotiations are now envisaged.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to Members of the House the very significant level of private United States investment in Ireland.  There are 343 United States owned companies in this country which offer employment to 38,000 people.  The United States industrial investment in this country is £4.7 billion and there are at present 26,000 United States citizens resident in Ireland.  These are significant figures and this country is fortunate that such good and fruitful relations exist between it and the United States.</P>
    <P>There are also examples of a number of successful joint ventures between Irish and American based companies.  For example, Mahon and McPhillips, the Kilkenny based engineering company, first looked at the possibility of technology transfer in 1986 when they sent executives to the United States on a fact finding mission organised by the IDA. Mahon and McPhillips had an R &amp; D department of their own but saw benefits in coming to an agreement with other companies in the water treatment area to stay in the forefront of this technology. They came to an agreement with Sanitair, a United States firm, for exclusive worldwide rights to their aeration technology. Mahon and McPhillips have now won a contract to design, manufacture and install a sewage treatment plant for Stansted, London's third airport, as a result of this Agreement.  The bulk of the equipment will be made in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>A number of joint ventures and partnership agreements have played a significant role in setting Kerry Co-op on the success route from commodity manufacturer to major international food processor. In the early seventies Kerry Co-op entered into a partnership arrangement with Erie Casein in the United States.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised queries. Deputy Mac Giolla was concerned that there was a fear of us being cut off from <Col N="2175" /> developments in other growing markets. There need be no fear in that regard as we have agreements with France, Germany and the USSR for science and technology co-operation.  Deputy Richard Bruton mentioned the lack of funding for research and development but significant extra funding has been made available in the past few years.  There was a new budget for a Science and Technology development programme in 1987 of £3 million and this was increased in 1989 to £13 million.  Programmes such as advanced manufacturing technology and technology audits programmes are designed to help meet the R &amp; D needs of small and growing Irish firms.  Deputy Richard Bruton also referred to diminished investment in research but Eolas carried out a very successful information campaign to advise firms on energy conservation.</P>
    <P>There is an increasing number of US companies moving into Ireland to do their R &amp; D &mdash; Digital, Analog, Verbatim, Western Digital and Wang.  Of course the Government wish to ensure that more and more US companies who have facilities in Ireland will also locate their R &amp; D facilities here.  I believe this Agreement will facilitate the exchange of R &amp; D and technology transfers between firms based in Ireland and the United States.  There are good vibes at present that more and more US based companies will do more R &amp; D here and this Agreement will help it further.  I commend the Agreement to the House.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this Bill is to remove one of the two obstacles in the way of ratification of the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by this <Col N="2176" /> country.  The Bill does this by providing that it will be an offence to incite to hatred on account of race, colour, nationality, religion or ethnic or national origins.  The other legislative measure required is one to provide that sentence of death may not be imposed for crimes committed by persons under 18 years of age.  This is provided for in the Child Care Bill which is not before the House. Accordingly, as soon as the present Bill and the Child Care Bill become law, the way will be clear for this country to ratify the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the object of the Bill is to enable ratification of the United Nations covenent.  However, the creation of a new category of criminal offence deserves to be considered carefully on general grounds having regard, in particular, to the constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression.  I will come back to that point later, when I deal more fully with the statutory offences now provided for in the Bill.  Before that I will briefly outline the evolution of this Bill both in international and domestic terms.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, 1988 was the 40th anniversary of the adoption by the General Assembly of the United Nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  The Preamble to this historic document recognised that respect for the inalienable rights of the individual was the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.  In adopting the declaration, the United Nations set forth the ideals for which the world community should strive.  These emerged in the aftermath of the horror, death and devastation of the Second World War and indicated that there was a new political will among the world community to secure lasting peace for mankind and to protect the individual from the scourge of dictatorship and oppression.  Even before the Universal Declaration, in the Charter of the United Nations, signed in 1945, member states reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, disregard of which had resulted in barbarous acts that outraged the conscience of mankind.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Charter and the <Col N="2177" /> Universal Declaration were followed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  In addition, in Europe, we have the European Convention on Human Rights which came into force in 1953.</P>
    <P>Although it is now 41 years since the Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was not adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations until 1966 and did not come into force until 1976.  It was signed by this country in 1973.  There has been some criticism here in Ireland of our delay in ratifying the covenant but, against that, I think it can be said that in general, this country has had a very good record on human rights. However, I am sure we all agree that ratification of the covenant by this country is a desirable objective, and one which I hope will soon be met, enabling us to meet our international obligations in this respect.  We do not have the type of multi-racial society that some of our partners in Europe have.  Nevertheless, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that the occasional problem of racial incitement does arise here.  When it does, however, it is often due to localised ignorance and fear rather than to any general sense of intolerance or hatred towards people of other races or religions.  In those circumstances, we have to be careful, in enacting legislation, while dealing with the few instances of incitement that arise in practice, not to create problems where none previously existed.  We must also be ready to meet the argument that this legislation interferes with the right to free speech merely in order to placate sections of international opinion.  On balance, I am happy that the legislation meets our international obligations and also meets our domestic needs within its limited objectives.  In those circumstances, it is important that debate on the Bill, both inside and outside the House, should be moderate and balanced.</P>
    <P>While in general we can trace the motivation for this Bill back as far as <Col N="2178" /> 1945 and the United Nations Charter, the actual provisions of the Bill are of more recent origin.  In July 1983 an interdepartmental committee was set up, which was chaired from the Attorney General's Office, with terms of reference to examine Ireland's ratification of international covenants and conventions, and with particular reference to the area of human rights.  The committee set about examining the two United Nations covenants &mdash; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The committee very quickly recognised that a proper examination of the convention would delay their examination of the covenants, so they decided to prepare a report on the covenants before proceeding to consider the racial discrimination convention and other international instruments.  The Attorney General's committee are at present examining the International Convention on Racial Discrimination and, as they recognised, the necessary detailed consideration of that convention is a major job which will take some time to complete. I think the committee took the right decision in reporting separately on the covenants, which, I hope, will shortly be ratified.</P>
    <P>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 was regarded as a preliminary step in the area of human rights. It was recognised that there should be a more elaborate formulation of standards in instruments which would have legal force as treaties between the ratifying states.  Thus, the two covenants were adopted and entered into force in 1976. The fundamental difference between the two covenants, and the reason two instruments rather than one were adopted, is that the objectives of the economic, social and cultural rights covenant are to be achieved progressively, whereas immediate compliance is required in relation to the civil and political rights covenant.  Therefore, before this country can ratify the International Covenant on <Col N="2179" /> Civil and Political Rights, we have to incorporate into our legislation any measures, not already covered in that legislation, which are necessary for compliance with the covenant.  It would have been impracticable to attempt to incorporate the entire covenant into domestic law.  The interdepartmental committee reported that it was unnecessary to do so, as most of its provisions are already covered here but, in any case, the covenant is expressed in terms which would not lend themselves to direct incorporation into Irish law.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, two measures are required so that this country may ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  These were identified by the interdepartmental committee and are, first, the abolition of the death sentence for crimes committed by persons under 18 years of age and, second, the legislation now before us, which will give effect to the provision concerning incitement to hatred in Article 20, paragraph 2 of the covenant.  As soon as these become law the way will be clear for this country to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  It is intended also to ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  The interdepartmental committee concluded that no legislative action was necessary before the latter instrument was ratified by the State.</P>
    <P>I will now briefly outline the main provisions of the Bill.  Article 20, paragraph 2, of the covenant on civil and political rights reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law. </P>
    <P>The Bill is intended to give effect to that provision.  Deputies will notice that the definition of &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; at the end of sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill covers hatred against any group of persons on account of their colour or ethnic or national origin, or on grounds of their nationality, race or religion.  It is desired to cover in this Bill also the corresponding <Col N="2180" /> requirement regarding incitement to racial hatred contained in Article 4 of the racial discrimination convention.  The term &ldquo;racial discrimination&rdquo; in that convention has reference to &ldquo;race, colour, national or ethnic origin&rdquo;.  Accordingly, the terms used in the definition of &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; in the present Bill will not only suffice in the context of the covenant but will also be wide enough to cover the corresponding provision in the convention.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is the central provision in the Bill.  It is wide in scope and creates a new offence of publishing or distributing material, or using words or behaviour, or displaying written material, in a public place, or distributing, showing or playing a recording of visual images or sounds, where these are threatening, abusive or insulting and are intended, or are likely, to stir up hatred on the grounds specified in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 carries the principle of section 2 into the area of broadcasting.  It creates a new offence of inciting hatred by broadcasting visual images or sounds that are threatening, abusive or insulting if they are intended or likely to stir up such hatred.  The definition of &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; in section 1 will ensure that, for the purposes of this Bill, the transmission, relaying or distribution of visual images or sounds by means of wire or cable will be covered by the legislation.  This is a long section, much of which is taken up with the provision of defences for persons involved in broadcasting, against whom proceedings might be taken under the section, and also with giving power to the Garda to require production of the relevant script or recording in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>Section 4 creates a new offence of preparing or possessing material or recordings of a racist or such like offensive nature to be distributed or broadcast in the State or elsewhere.  This provison will make it possible to prosecute those who prepare racist material for distribution here or abroad, where the material is likely to stir up hatred against groups of persons here or in any other country.  I am sure Deputies will be just as anxious <Col N="2181" /> as I am to ensure that this country will not be used in future for the preparation of offensive material for distribution either here or abroad.  There have been instances of this type of activity in this country and up to now the Garda have not had the necessary powers to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Sections 2, 3 and 4 are the three most important provisions in the Bill.  A very important general question which arose when the Bill was being prepared was the relationship between its provisons and the right to free expression of convictions and opinions guaranteed in Article 40 of the Constitution.  The right to freedom of expression is also guaranteed by Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights itself, and the question of the relationship between that provision and the prohibition of incitement to racial hatred in Article 20 was a live issue when the covenant was being prepared, as well as in the reviews of the working of the covenant by the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations which have taken place since then.  The right to freedom of expression is not, of course, absolute.</P>
    <P>Under the Constitution that right is guaranteed subject to public order and morality and this qualification also appears in Article 19 of the UN Covenant. I indicated earlier that it would not be practicable to incorporate the entire covenant as a Schedule to this Bill.  The legislation now before us gives a good indication of this, since the exact wording of Article 20, paragrpah 2, of the covenant could not be incorporated directly into domestic law.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental committee were of the view that the simple creation of a criminal offence in the precise terms of this provision in the covenant would limit the honest expression of opinion in private and could make punishable a wide variety of utterances and publications which might not be considered serious enough to warrant criminal sanctions. They were of the view, also, that it might be thought undesirable to permit a situation where private prosecutions of a trivial nature could be brought.  They <Col N="2182" /> thought, accordingly, that it might, on detailed examination, be considered desirable to qualify the covenant provision to some extent in the necessary legislation.  That is why the provisions in sections 2, 3 and 4, while giving effect to Article 20, paragraph 2, of the covenant, do not do so in the precise terms of that Article.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the Bill is largely consequential and related to the provisions in sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill. Accordingly, I will just briefly mention a number of these sections.  Section 5 is a standard provision exempting reports of Oireachtas or court proceedings from the scope of the offences created by sections 2, 3 and 4.  Section 7 also contains standard provisions, in this case regarding the liability of officers of corporate bodies when the body itself is guilty of an offence.  It applies to all offences under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 8 states that offences under sections 2, 3 and 4 may be instituted only by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It is intended to prevent trivial or mischievous private prosecutions and to ensure that prosecutions are brought only where the evidence is sufficient to justify the proceedings.  Section 9 gives the Garda power, under warrant, to enter and search a premises where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that offending material or recordings are being kept, and also gives the Garda power to seize any such material or recordings.  Without these powers, some of the provisions of the Bill and, in particular section 4, would be difficult to enforce.</P>
    <P>Section 10 gives the Garda Síochána powers of arrest for specified offences. These powers, also, are necessary to make the law enforceable.  Subsection (1) of section 10 gives the Garda power of arrest, without warrant, where they reasonably suspect that a person has committed an offence under section 2 (1) (b) of using offensive words or behaviour, or displaying offensive written material, which are heard or seen by persons in a public place or at a public meeting.  This type of offence has significance for public <Col N="2183" /> order and it is important that the Garda should be in a position to act immediately, without having to obtain a warrant, by arresting any person suspected of committing such an offence.</P>
    <P>I might add here that the definition of &ldquo;public meeting&rdquo; and &ldquo;public place&rdquo; are quite wide in their scope.  I am sure Deputies will agree that it would not be appropriate to attempt to curtail the free expression of opinions among small private groups, such as families.  However, where groupings are larger, that situation would be covered by the definitions and this includes cases where people are present by invitation.  Section 11 of the Bill gives the court power to order the forfeiture and destruction or disposal of offending material following a conviction under sections 2, 3 or 4.</P>
    <P>To sum up, therefore, this Bill has the limited but clear objective of meeting the requirements of the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights regarding the prohibition of incitement to national, racial or religious hatred.  In preparing the legislation we have borne in mind the corresponding provisions enacted in other countries.  It is not meant to be a Bill on racial discrimination and will not in any way slow down the examination of what legislation, if any, will be necessary to enable this country to ratify the United Nations Convention on Racial Discrimination. That examination is continuing independently of the preparation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is to be welcomed and Fine Gael will not oppose it. We will support it on the grounds that it is desirable not only to ratify the Covenant as outlined by the Minister but on the Bill's own merits as far as we are proceeding with our own legislation here. It is somewhat sad that at the end of the speech the Minister said the Bill is not meant to be a Bill on racial discrimination. If that is the case he has missed an opportunity of bringing forward comprehensive legislation to this <Col N="2184" /> House on all aspects of racial discrimination which is long overdue and on which we have fallen behind other European countries.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made it quite plain that he is bringing forward the legislation with a view to ratifying the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  I would not like to let the opportunity pass without referring to the 40th anniversary of the UN Charter on Human Rights which was celebrated throughout the free world on 10 December last.  My colleague from Galway West in the Labour Party will agree that during an Amnesty International celebration in Galway it was noteworthy that there was no Government presence.  I think I am right in saying there was no marking of this historic occasion by the Irish Government.  That was sad.  I have a feeling it was not officially recognised by the Irish Government because of some embarrassment that this legislation had not been enacted by that date.  There is an onus on us as legislators to give particular praise and recognition to the marvellous work being undertaken by international groups, such as Amnesty International, operating here.</P>
      <P>Article 20 of the Covenant as outlined in the Explanatory Memorandum mentions that &ldquo;any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence&rdquo; is to be outlawed, and that in effect is what this legislation does.  It deals with race, nationality and religion, but it is narrow in its confines.  There was an opportunity for the Minister to make reference in legislative form to our own minorities in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation should have been looked at in the broader sense of not ratifying the covenant, which we should have done many years ago.  We signed it 20 years ago and we are ratifying it now. It is a little late.  However, we must proceed with due haste.  There is need for this legislation in its own right and as far as we as a society are concerned, it would be something of a misrepresentation if it was seen we were bringing forward legislation to prohibit incitement of <Col N="2185" /> racial, religious or national hatred simply to comply with an international covenant or declaration.  We need the legislation in our own right in this State.  We need it for a number of reasons, and I do not mean to highlight in an exaggerated fashion instances of what is happening in this country.  Nevertheless, material of quite a despicable nature appears on our streets from time to time and is exported to continental countries.  I am not overestimating the problem but I hope the Bill will address it adequately.</P>
    <P>We do not have a multi-racial society but from time to time we have the appearance of right-wing groups of a rather despicable nature with fascist tendencies circulating documentation in Dublin and in rural areas.  An instance in Kilkenny some time ago has not been given sufficient publicity.  I hope that bodies such as the National Socialist Party will be brought out of their closets by this legislation and that the full rigours of the law will be brought to bear upon them.</P>
    <P>I hope the legislation will cover the production of literature by extreme republican groups.  For far too long in this city and other areas we have seen the spectacle of young people peddling extreme republican publications on Friday nights and at weekends in hostelries and pubs in order to earn some pin money.  The peddling of this documentation should come under this legislation since it covers incitement to hatred both inside and outside the State.  I hope it will have the effect of eliminating from Irish society the type of republican literature which is in some respects given official sanction.</P>
    <P>In any discussion on minority groupings or groupings within society which tend to incite hatred or discrimination, I must refer to the work undertaken by the Joint Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism during the last Dáil.  I see no reason for not continuing this committee. While the committee did a lot of work in the crime and vandalism area they also addressed themselves on occasion to locating the distribution centres of literature of an extreme right-wing nature.  I think the committee's final <Col N="2186" /> report was not published due to the intervention of a general election.  I hope the Minister will consider at this late stage reappointing the committee, which did much good over the years.  There is a great need for such a committee.  The committee investigated incidents in Kilkenny where there was an extreme right-wing group and also investigated graffiti of an evil nature which appeared from time to time in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I refer to a Dublin-based group called Harmony who have been campaigning for legislation of a comprehensive kind in relation to this matter.  They are not widely known but their motives are such as to deserve our full support.  Their primary objectives are to promote harmony, understanding and equality between all peoples in Ireland, irrespective of race, colour or national origin, to campaign for the introduction of a comprehensive race relations Act and subsequently to monitor the application of such an Act, and to collate and provide information, resources and materials for the promotion of a non-racist lifestyle.</P>
    <P>Although we are not a multi-racial society there is a need to educate our children so that they will not develop racial prejudices.  A very worth-while undertaking by Harmony was the organisation a year or two ago of a Christmas party for multi-racial families in Dublin which was visited by a white Santa Claus and a black Santa Claus.  Little things like that ensure that our young people will not grow up with racial prejudices.  With increased freedom of movement throughout the world and increased access after 1992, it is important that our young people should not be in any way discouraged from living with a multi-racial society.  We must look to our own experience, especially the manner in which the Irish Paddy was treated in Britain in the forties and fifties.  I am not saying that things are bad there now.  We must ensure that our young people do not go abroad with any form of prejudice.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the coin, we must ask whether this legislation is too restrictive. Are we denying people freedom of association and freedom of expression by <Col N="2187" /> outlawing incitement to racial, religious and national hatred?  Are we coming into conflict with Bunreacht na hÉireann, particularly Article 40 thereof?  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties did, I think, express their reservations about this legislation, if not officially then unofficially.  I would not go along with that.  An analogy was drawn with the topical Salman Rushdie book in that were a book to treat the Irish Catholic in the manner in which the Muslim is treated in Rushdie's book, perhaps it would be banned under this legislation.  I am not so sure.  We must legislate for the common good and I do not see any constitutional difficulty.  The Minister is right to proceed with this Bill, weak though it may be.  We are serving the common good by outlawing despicable and vile material.</P>
    <P>Any discussion on this Bill which does not include reference to our own ethnic groups is weak and my main objection to the Bill is that it does not deal with the discrimination against our indigenous ethnic groups.  It may be difficult to find a legal definition for our travelling community but we must address the problem of discrimination against them and the time to do that is now.  If we do not, we will be doing them a great disservice.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us it was his intention to produce a comprehensive Bill later but it is time he produced legislation to protect our minorities.  The greatest ethnic minority we have are the 20,000 members of the travelling community. They must be protected by this legislation, and Fine Gael will be tabling amendments to do so on Committee Stage.  We will be looking for support from the other Opposition parties for those amendments.  The Government, between now and Committee Stage, should consider introducing appropriate amendments against incitement to hatred and discrimination against our travelling community.  I do not think it will be difficult to find a legal definition for the travelling community.  There was little difficulty in defining gypsies on the Continent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2188" /> The British House of Lords in 1975 considered the criteria for qualification as an ethnic group and put forward the following points in regard to the legal definition of a traveller.  They were:</P>
    <P>They see themselves and are seen by others as a distinct community.</P>
    <P>They have a long, shared history of their own which can be traced back to the 12th century at least where they are mentioned in the laws.</P>
    <P>They have their own cultural tradition associated with nomadism.</P>
    <P>They have a small number of common ancestors and different families are associated with different counties.</P>
    <P>They have their own language called Cant, Shelta or the Gammon.  Some studies suggest that this language predates the Celts arrival in Ireland.</P>
    <P>They have a common oral tradition rich in folklore.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of travellers are Catholic and subscribe to popular form of religiosity.</P>
    <P>They are a minority group which have experienced rejection, oppression and discrimination down through the years. </P>
    <P>The Minister should consider those points and endeavour to include them in the legislation.  It is possible to cater for the travelling people in the Bill under discussion.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the 1986 ERSI report on travellers.  The concluding remarks of the report are interesting. They are:</P>
    <P>The circumstances of the Irish travelling people are intolerable.  No humane and decent society, once made aware of such circumstances, could permit them to persist. </P>
    <P>We have done little since the publication of that report to alter the views expressed in that report.  It detailed the appalling <Col N="2189" /> living conditions of the travelling community and pointed out that 48 per cent of travellers have no piped water; 50 per cent have no toilet facilities; 54 per cent have no connection to public electricity supply; and only 5.5 per cent live to be over 50 years of age, compared to 23 per cent in the national population.  That is an indication of the extent of the problem that must be addressed.  It is sad that the Minister did not give the travelling community an opportunity to discuss with him this legislation before it was introduced.</P>
    <P>I hope that between now and Committee Stage he will tease out with them the amendments I consider necessary if we are to outlaw the real discrimination that exists here against them.  It is outrageous to think that we are signing an international covenant which amounts to window dressing while, at the same time, we are not doing anything to sort out the problems we have at home.  It is fine to sign and ratify UN covenants but we must deal with the real problems in our State. We are ignoring the plight of the travellers and there has not been any reference to them in a Bill which carries the title Prohibition of Incitement to Racial, Religious or National Hatred.  We must address the discrimination that takes place here and it would be a simple operation to include an amendment to cater for the travelling community in the Bill.</P>
    <P>How do we rate our travellers?  We are all aware of the common descriptions directed against the travelling community. We are told that they are alcoholic, dirty, lawless, dangerous, violent, disruptive and untrustworthy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>And pay no taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another phrase used in connection with the travelling community.  Those people are treated in a derogatory way.  We must consider how they are treated in public houses, shops, hotels, dance halls, cinemas and theatres. I doubt if they would be permitted to enter our theatres because of a judgment that would be made on their appearance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A health study on travellers showed an <Col N="2190" /> extraordinary high rate of infant mortality among that community.  It is frightening to think that only 5.5 per cent of them live to be over 50 years of age and that less than 2 per cent of them exceed the age of 65.  That is a damning indictment of the way we treat travellers.  It is no harm to draw attention to the high rates of unemployment among the travelling community and it is sad to think that very few of them are in full time employment.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister consider that the Bill goes far enough to permit us to ratify the UN convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination which was signed many years ago?  I do not think it does.  I understand the Minister indicated that more comprehensive legislation will have to be introduced before we can ratify that convention and that is sad.  I wonder why it is not possible to produce a composite Bill that will permit us to ratify all the conventions we have signed.  We should not lag behind in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 1 states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;publish&rdquo; means publish to the public or a section of the public and cognate words shall be construed accordingly; </P>
    <P>I am worried about that provision in that it appears to let private gatherings off the hook entirely.  The provisions of the Bill should outlaw the despicable literature that appears from time to time.  Such literature is not distributed at public meetings and for that reason we must broaden the scope of section 1 to include private meetings.  I realise that there is a difficulty as far as private activities are concerned but the provision will not prove adequate if it is confined to public meetings.  I do not see any reference in section 2 to newspapers or television. Perhaps section 3 covers that, but I see no reason not to specify newspapers and the public media in section 2, as in section 3.</P>
    <P>The Bill is really a very weak piece of legislation unless it includes references to the travelling community.  I hope both sections 2 and 3 will be broadened to allow <Col N="2191" /> the definition of a traveller to be perhaps somebody of a substandard economic and social status.  I hope that we can sit down on Committee Stage and thrash out a necessary amendment along the lines I have suggested.  Section 3 will also have to be amended to include reference to the travelling community.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 4 and the fact that there seems to be a shift in the onus of proof in so far as it will be presumed that a piece of literature was meant for publication unless the individual can prove otherwise.</P>
    <P>I have a reservation with regard to section 8 and the fact that a private prosecution is ruled out.  The Minister stated that it was for the common good that we should eliminate prosecutions of a vexatious nature.  I am not sure if that is the right thing to do.  I feel we have narrowed things too much by allowing proceedings only at the behest of or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  There is need to allow a broadening of that so that if private individuals feel they have a clear ground under this legislation they will be able to have an action thrashed out through the courts without having to have the consent of the DPP.  We could be denying individuals the right to decide whether or not the legislation is applicable to them, or to any group, by not allowing them to proceed by way of private prosecution.</P>
    <P>We will not be opposing the Bill but I feel the Minister missed a tremendous opportunity to update the legislation in this area by not allowing us to ratify a number of United Nations conventions and cater for active discriminatin within our own State.  The Bill is all the weaker as a result.  I hope that on Committee Stage, or certainly before the Bill leaves the Houses of the Oireachtas, we can enact a stronger piece of legislation to deal with the very many problems some of which I have addressed and some of which certainly need immediate Government attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say on behalf of the Progressive Democrats that <Col N="2192" /> we will also be supporting the passage of this Bill on Second Stage.  We certainly appreciate the principles involved and support them.  It cannot be denied that Ireland has given support to the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights over the years despite the fact that we have not ratified it and despite the fact that we have not been able to ratify this particular Convention on Civil Rights. The convention that it is hoped to ratify following the passage of this Bill, and also the provision in the Child Care Bill relating to the death penalty for under 18 year olds, should find echoes among those who support the democratic system of Government.  It should be clear that Ireland is among those nations.  I hope that we will also, as a House, recognise that free speech and free political association are available here so long as they are in relation to those who stand by democracy, who do not use methods that threaten that democracy itself.  We are long overdue to ratify this convention. This convention was adopted in 1966 and we signed in 1973.  I do not understand why it has taken us this long to get to the point of ratification.  We missed an opportunity last year on the 40th anniversary of the declaration of human rights.  While I understand the legislative process is a difficult and drawn out one, it surely does not need to take 16 years to be able to pass these two pieces of legislation.</P>
      <P>The convention itself addresses civil and political rights.  In this Bill one aspect of that is being dealt with, that is, the prohibition on racial discrimination.  The Bill refers in its title to the prohibition of incitement to racial, religious or national hatred.  I note that in the Seanad debate the Minister referred to the fact that it was desired to cover the corresponding requirement in article 4 of the Racial Discrimination Convention, and by that I presume he meant the wider convention to eliminate all racial discrimination.  He hoped that this Bill would also cover the corresponding requirement prohibiting incitement to racial hatred and racial discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, at the outset I would say <Col N="2193" /> that the title to this Bill is inadequate because in the definition section and, in particular in sections 2, 3 and 4 which are the nub of the Bill, there is quite distinct reference to incitement to hatred on the basis of ethnic origins.  It is not covered in the title and I think it should be.  It would be very clear from that exactly what is meant.  As the Minister said in the Seanad, it would go a long way towards covering the point he makes about the wider convention on racial discrimination. It has to be said that we have a fairly integrated society in the Republic; I would not extend that to the North.  Nevertheless, despite the problems in the North and despite the spill over into the South we have, on the whole, an integrated society which does not divide on racial lines, and which does not find itself combating racial disturbance or hatred on a regular basis. We have found over the years that these difficulties have passed us by, by chance.</P>
    <P>This Bill shows, on the one hand, our commitment to the terms of the convention, but it also protects us from the spread or possible extension of racial disharmony which is present in more and more of the states, for instance, of the EC.  Immigrant workers all over the EC, who are coming in very larger numbers, find they are the subject of racial discrimination. It seems to me that we must always be vigilant to see that that is not tolerated in our society.  I know it is something that, certainly outside Dublin, is almost unheard of but in Dublin there could easily be said to be reasonably unhealthy attitudes among some groups of people to the gathering of certain ethnic types or people of other races in particular areas in Dublin.  I can think of some in the south inner city where there are gatherings of Muslim people, Indians and so on.  There is a tendency on the part of some Dubliners to look on that as unhealthy.  We must guard against an increase in that kind of feeling and against an increase in divisions in the community which would be based on that attitude.  I see this Bill as a first step in that direction. Certainly it is a marker which the <Col N="2194" /> Government and the Oireachtas are setting down on how far we would allow that to go and indeed that we would not allow it to go any further.</P>
    <P>Despite what I say about having a reasonably integrated community, we have our own problems.  I would not in any way wish to deny the real problems of discrimination that exist.  I am particularly thinking of the travelling community. Up to now they have not been recognised as being a separate group and therein lies their real difficulty and the difficulty for those who deal with them in authority, as neighbours and so on.  It is unnecessary and inadvisable to pass a Bill through this House and through the Seanad that refers to incitement to hatred and does not refer to the real problems that exist in Ireland.  It is quite unbelievable. I do not honestly think any other country would go about it in a slavish manner, which seems to be the Minister's approach to this Bill.  He feels there is a requirement on this country to ratify the Convention on Civil and Political Rights, that there is a difficulty in relation to Article 20 of that Convention and that we will sort it out by passing this Bill but we will not relate the legislation to the Irish scene.  That is a huge mistake.  It brings this House into disrepute and reinforces the notion abroad that politicians in Ireland and their antics are irrelevant. It behoves us in this House to look at the real problems on the ground.  If legislation is introduced to the House that enables us to deal with that in some way &mdash; I am not saying it will deal with it completely or that it will go a long way towards sorting out the problem &mdash; we should see how we can make that legislation relevant to Ireland today.</P>
    <P>Travellers are an ethnic minority.  I know that is not a view held by everybody in the country but it is coming to be accepted increasingly as people learn more about the travelling community. Under any definition of an ethnic minority they are quite clearly included.  The mere fact that when speakers in this House refer to the travellers everybody knows exactly who they are talking about and who to exclude from the definition <Col N="2195" /> clearly indicates that they are an ethnic minority, that they are recognised as a different type of people who have a different culture, a different language and different way of life.</P>
    <P>In a 1988 report from the National coOrdinator for the Education of Travellers, Sister Colette Dwyer, there is reference to prejudice and the reason 967 traveller families still live in appalling conditions.  Sister Dwyer says that one of the reasons is the unwillingness of the majority of the settled community to accept the travellers as a group and give them a chance to show that if they were given basic amenities they would take pride in where they live, take part in the normal life of the community and educate their children.  They would, therefore, be seen as full Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>There is a view taken at present by a good number of Irish people that travellers do not deserve real citizenship, that they do not deserve real protection by the law and that they do not deserve to be treated the same way as those who are not travellers.  Travellers are in an extremely small minority.  We are talking about, as this report states, 967 families. There are many towns in Ireland with far more families than that, so it should not be an insuperable problem.  It seems the problem at base is one of recognition of the fact that these people are different and should be allowed to be so.</P>
    <P>This Bill particularly allows us to give ethnic minorities that recognition.  I certainly will be pressing an amendment to that effect when we reach Committee Stage.  I would be interested in support from other parties or perhaps discussions between the parties as to a joint approach, depending on what other parties' views are on Second Stage. This is a problem we cannot get away from.  We must use the legislation before us to relate to the problems as they exist on the ground.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the Seanad debate and since then, has mentioned the danger of creating problems where none exist, the difficulty in perhaps alerting people to problems that do not exist.  One thinks of <Col N="2196" /> the type of racial disharmony there is in, for instance, some areas in Britain such as Brixton and Toxteth and in parts of Germany where there is undoubtedly racial discrimination against minorities of different countries.  Irish people simply turn away and say it is not their problem. They ask why we are passing legislation relating to racial discrimination when it has nothing to do with us.  We must allow this Bill to reflect the view that there is a problem in society.  There is a need for the Government and the Oireachtas to give a lead to put down a marker and say what society will or will not tolerate.  We are given an opportunity, in this Convention which it is proposed to ratify to restate some of the values of a true Republic.</P>
    <P>In this year of the bicentenary of the French Revolution we are more aware, and certainly becoming more and more so as the year goes on, of the underlying values and guarantees that a Republic gives to its citizens.  In the French context these values are liberty, equality and fraternity. We know that since 1789 when the revolution took place in France there have been many conflicts in Europe and outside it which arose from discrimination of various kinds, whether they were between groups within one country or between neighbouring countries. We have seen world wars.  We have seen imperialist, reactionary, totalitarian regimes threaten weaker States, weaker individuals and weaker groups within States.  The antithesis of guaranteed freedoms in the United Nations Declaration and Convention on Human, Civil and Political Rights is that type of regime.</P>
    <P>The French Revolution stands, particularly this year, as a marker for those states which have chosen the republican route, those states which have chosen to create a true republic to include for its citizens the guarantees I have mentioned. In this country that guarantee, of the liberty and equality of the citizen and fraternity, in the French terms, are not being applied particularly to the travelling community.  We are not offering them the protection the State offers other groups.  We are not offering them, as <Col N="2197" /> individuals and as a group, the rights the remainder of society takes for granted and expects the State to vindicate.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has said, the general convention on the elimination of racial discrimination is being examined by an interdepartmental committee.  This interdepartmental committee has been sitting for years and years.  It cannot be so difficult a task that they find it impossible to suggest legislative changes which will bring the terms of that covenant into effect and allow us to ratify it.  Political will is what it is all about.  I suspect that recent Governments have been short on that quality.  I would hope the Minister would encourage the Attorney General, the chairman of that committee, to make great strides to come up with the necessary reforms so that we can ratify that covenant.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I believe the word &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; should be included in the title of the Bill, as a result of which it would then be open to the House or the Minister to include other groups based on that term &mdash; ethnic origin &mdash; within the provisions of the Bill, or it would simply be very clear to those groups who wish to claim that they are being discriminated against, on the basis of their ethnic origin, to claim the protection of the provisions of this Bill.  Unlike legislation in other countries, such as the Race Relations Bill in Britain, this is not the be-all and endall of anti-discrimination law.  This Bill simply sets down markers.  This is not a positive anti-discriminatory Bill.  It prohibits certain acts, it prohibits the dissemination, preparation, publication and broadcasting of certain literature but it does not provide beyond that.</P>
    <P>We know that the issues constantly causing problems for those discriminated against in our society can relate to housing, employment, to access to places of social activity, none of which is catered for under the provisions of this Bill.  This Bill constitutes a very small step but, on account of the fact that none has been taken before, a major one.  No marker can be put down by this House or by the Seanad to the effect that they stand foursquare against discrimination.  I would <Col N="2198" /> ask the Minister to take very seriously my claim that there is a need for the inclusion of the word &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; in the title of the Bill.  I will be tabling an amendment later to that effect.</P>
    <P>Some people have expressed fears that the provisions of the Bill are too restrictive, that there are people engaged in what they consider to be reasonable occupations, critical of other groups, and that they will be prevented from carrying out these occupations henceforth.  I do not believe that is the case.  The right to free speech is not an absolute one.  It is circumscribed by the rights of society in general and the right of an individual to be protected by society.  It seems to me that is the underlying approach taken in the drafting of this Bill.  For example, it has not been decided simply to lift Article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and include it in legislation. It has been decided to incorporate it in some way in our legislative code so that it fits in with the guarantees of free speech and restricts the prohibition on access to public places.  To a certain extent I would share Deputy Flanagan's concern that that could constitute a loophole in the future.  Perhaps we should examine that on Committee Stage so that, for instance, private clubs would not mushroom to the extent that the kind of literature and seditious material about which we are talking would not simply move into the private rooms of private clubs but still be disseminated.</P>
    <P>Generally the offences created in sections 2, 3 and 4 should cover the intended aim.  I was somewhat concerned about the wording with regard to broadcasting, distribution, showing, playing or recording of visual images and sounds. We must be very careful that the wording of any section relating to broadcasting is sufficiently wide to include any development in technology because, undoubtedly, there are daily developments in that field.  We know, from another Bill passed by this House recently &mdash; the Video Recordings Bill &mdash; that the technology in relation to videos is constantly changing. It need not necessarily be the case that a tape is used.  The latest innovation is <Col N="2199" /> laser-operated recordings.  Who knows, in five years, what will be the case.  It is very important that we do not create loopholes that will obtain, say, six months or a year after the passage of this Bill if we narrow the definition too much.</P>
    <P>The reference to preparation and possession of that type of material is extremely important because, without it, we would be unable to curtail recent material, which is and has been prepared in Dublin for a number of years, not for distribution here but elsewhere &mdash; anti-Semitic literature and publications, among others, which no right thinking person would allow past their door, indeed, no right thinking person in this State would tolerate being prepared here if they knew it was going on.  To date somehow we have been unable to catch the culprits and prosecute them effectively.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill constitute a move absolutely in the right direction. It is unfortunate but, presumably, such people will simply move to another jurisdiction where the laws are looser.  We must play our part and do what we can to stamp it out.  There is a frightening increase in some developed countries to return to the kind of thinking and philosphies that underlay the Nazi régime in Germany in the thirties and forties.  It is quite frightening to me to observe the numbers of young people particularly who are seduced by the arguments and philosophies put forward of this national socialism approach &mdash; boot boys would be the best way of describing many of the people associated with this kind of thinking.  That is what people thought in Germany in the early thirties.  That is why we must not allow any group in society to promote distinctly hateful literature or to speak in that way in public which entices immature young people to join the ranks of these completely intolerable and, I think, appallingly dangerous organisations.</P>

      <P>I have not heard boot girls <Col N="2200" /> so described.  The defences in the Bill are quite wide.  In fact, I was surprised to see how wide they are.  I know the Minister is very concerned that he should not be seen in any way to contravene the Constitution and the guarantee of freedom of speech.  Therefore, the defences provided in the Bill have to allow for people to be able to prove that they had not intended the material to be abusive, insulting or threatening or, in fact, had not intended it for public display.  I hope we will not find a number of loopholes which will allow people to escape prosecution. While I also understand the Minister's reluctance to allow private prosecutions, I hope this will not mean that it will be very difficult to initiate a prosecution.  I trust that the Director of Public Prosecutions will be empowered and instructed to prosecute where reasonable complaints are made.  I know he has to use his judgment to establish whether the complaints being made are frivolous, of a nuisance type, or caused by antagonism between people.</P>
      <P>In order for this Bill to have a preventive effect, it is essential that it should be given life immediately after it is passed.  The Director of Public Prosecutions should initiate prosecutions as soon as possible against those whom he knows at present are offending against the principles of the legislation.</P>
      <P>In general, we support the Bill but we will be bringing forward amendments on Committee Stage.  I hope there will be support not just from the Opposition benches but from all sides of the House for a recognition of the real problems that exist in Irish society and a willingness to deal with them.  It is unlikely that in the next five to ten years we will get another opportunity of this type to deal with the existing problems on the ground and to give a lead to the community at large.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome the Bill as far as it goes and will support it on Second Stage.  According to the Minister, the Bill was brought in in response to a United Nations convention. I often wonder why we have to wait for <Col N="2201" /> United Nations conventions or EC directives to bring about things that are right and proper.  If there were no United Nations directive, would we ever have gotten around to bringing in a basic measure like this?</P>
      <P>I deplore the fact that much of the legislation we introduce in this field and, indeed, in other fields is in response to directives that come from international bodies.  This is entirely wrong and should not be so.  We should be bringing in this measure primarily on its merits, because it is right and just and it is needed.  Secondly, unfortunately this Bill is the absolute minimum required to comply with the United Nations convention.  There is no reason on earth why the Minister needs to do this.  Why should we adopt the minimalist approach to enable us to accede to the convention?  Why can we not for once be a bit more radical and see what the broader needs might be and deal with them even though they might be beyond the basic minimum requirements in the United Nations convention?</P>
      <P>There are many things that we need to do if we are to expand this field of law reform to anything like the degree that is necessary.  The area of racial discrimination is not touched on at all in the Bill.  This is a very crucial and important matter.  I know the Minister said that a separate committee are working on this issue as it is more complex and will take longer and all that.  That is all right as far as it goes, but it is not an answer.  There is racial discrimination of various forms in this country.  Perhaps it is not all that widespread but nevertheless it exists in the homogeneous society that we have. After all these years I wish it had been possible to bring in a comprehensive measure when we were dealing with it and cover the questions of racial hatred and discrimination which affect a number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan referred to the organisation Harmony, and rightly so.  I am proud to be a member of that organisation and I subscribe to their objectives and the needs of their members who are affected by racial discrimination.  It might be a black person getting short shrift from <Col N="2202" /> a landlord when he wants to rent a premises or the response to him in shops.  This organisation highlights many examples of how their members have been affected.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that we are a homogeneous society perhaps the most homogeneous in Europe.  That is true.  However, I do not think that is necessarily to our credit or to our advantage.  I do not know why this should be so and whether it results from a policy on immigration to this country by refugees over the decades.  While some refugees have been taken in from various sources on occasion &mdash; the boat people, for example &mdash; by and large I do not think our record is anything that we can be wildly proud of.  To illustrate the point, I was at a Council of Europe meeting in Strasbourg a couple of weeks ago and an item which came up for discussion in the plenary session was the question of refugees from Iran and Iraq.  Reference was made to the most appalling pressure and mayhem and to the executions of the Kurds and other minority groupings.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out in reports that literally hundreds and thousands of these unfortunate people were driven out by the Iraqis and the Iranians.  The overwhelming bulk of these refugees found themselves in Turkey.  The European states represented in the Council of Europe were busy preparing reports criticising the Turks for not looking after these large numbers of refugees well enough.  I thought this was an outrage because the record not just of this country but indeed of all the European countries in taking in refugees leaves a lot to be desired.  I know that before the war there was no great rush by any of the European countries to take in Jewish refugees.</P>
    <P>I referred in Strasbourg &mdash; and I will refer to it here &mdash; to an international conference held in Evian in about 1937-38 when the Nazis said: &ldquo;we are not having the Jews but anybody willing to take them may take them&rdquo;.  There were not very many takers in the European countries and those unfortunate people, my co-religionists, ended up in the gas ovens of Auschwitz, Belsen and so on. Some came to this country and many of <Col N="2203" /> those who came worked very hard at building up the country and made a very fine contribution to it.</P>
    <P>To revert to the Turkish question and the very large numbers of refugees, running to hundreds of thousands, in the course of preparing the speech I made to that plenary session in Strasbourg, I asked the representative from the international parliamentary grouping, who was with us, to make contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs here to find out how many refugees we had taken in and the slightly surprising answer was that we had taken in none.  That is a criticism not just of us but of many of the other countries of Europe some of whose representatives were busy in the plenary session and had some neck in criticising the Turks for not properly looking after the refugees.  Some very wealthy countries in Europe were involved in that grouping.</P>
    <P>I realise that the question of taking in refugees and people who are under pressure in other regimes poses problems for us in relation to unemployment and that it would accentuate our problems. That is a line of argument but in that context it frequently happens that refugees very often make a major contribution to the host country, they set up industries and build up employment and in fact make a contribution well in excess of what otherwise might have been expected.  The whole issue is a sensitive one but we should open our minds and hearts to it just a little more than we do.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome as far as it goes. There is no question but that it is needed. Previous speakers referred to the rash of material that has been printed in this country by Nazi-type organisations.  I have seen some of this material going back over a number of years.  It is absolutely foul material reminiscent of the worst excesses of Nazi Germany.  The people who produce it use the Nazi emblems and all that sort of thing.  The material is viciously anti-Semitic, anti-Black and so on.  It has been printed here now for quite a number of years. Countless hundreds of copies of it must <Col N="2204" /> have been printed and disseminated, a small quantity within Ireland, but most of it for distribution abroad.</P>
    <P>It is not a criticism just of this Government but of the previous Government too, that it has taken so long to produce this legislation.  I would be the first to admit that.  I made many requests to the previous Government to get on with such legislation.  It has finally emerged now after this Government have been in office for two years.  Apparently, it was not possible under existing legislation to suppress the kind of material we are talking of.  I had a number of meetings with some senior Garda officers of the Special Branch to discuss the problem.  They told me they knew exactly who was producing this horrific material and where it was being printed but that in the absence of this type of legislation there was nothing they could do about it.  The meetings I had go back over three or four years and the material continued to be published during that time.  Those Nazi organisations were using this country as their printing house for the most of western Europe.  That is an appalling commentary and an absolute outrage.  The Bill will certainly assist in dealing with that aspect.</P>
    <P>There are two other aspects the Bill does not cover adequately.  One of these has already been commented on at some length by Deputies Flanagan and Colley. I support everything they said on the issue of the travellers.  The travellers have asked to be specifically mentioned in the Bill and they should be specifically mentioned. The Labour Party also will be tabling an amendment to make special provisions to cover travellers.  Perhaps we could get together with the representatives of Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats, the Labour Party and The Workers' Party, who I am sure would support it, and work out an acceptable joint amendment that will receive favourable consideration from the Minister having regard to the times that are in it.</P>
    <P>The other group who were not referred to by previous speakers is the Gay community. They also seek a specific mention <Col N="2205" /> in the Bill.  I read the speeches and comments made in the Seanad, particularly by Senator Norris.  I support what he said. It is right and reasonable that people of homosexual orientation should be recognised, for protection purposes, as a group within the ambit of this Bill.  The Minister was at pains to refute that and to say that it would be inappropriate to specifically mention the gay community and travellers in the Bill.  I studied what the Minister said in the Seanad and I remain totally unconvinced by most of his arguments. One argument was that it would open up the floodgates, and that a whole series of groups would seek specific mention in the Bill.  That is a poor point.  So far as I know only those two groups have actually requested a specific mention in the Bill.  If there was to be an opening of the floodgates it would have materialised by now and all political parties would have been lobbied.  So far as the Labour Party are concerned we have received representations from two groupings only. If they feel it necessary and desirable in their interests to have a specific mention, I say their requests are reasonable and should be acceded to.  These two groupings feel vulnerable and consider it necessary to seek the protection of the House by being specifically mentioned.  I do not see that any harm will be done by mentioning them in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There may be talk about difficulties in definition but I do not accept that.  I agree with Deputy Colley that there is no need for major detailed definition of the word &ldquo;travellers&rdquo;, for example.  The Constitution refers, for example, to the Jewish communities.  There was no great need then it was felt to go into any detailed or laborious definitions of who was a Jew, although in the State of Israel that very question has been a source of very major discussion and debate since that state was founded.  It is a question that has never been satisfactorily resolved.  I do not think we should get too hung up on the definition question. The court can determine the question of definition if it arises in court proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a very strange comment on this question in the Seanad <Col N="2206" /> debate.  He referred to the Mandla <i>versus</i> Lee case in the House of Lords in the Seanad on 30 November 1988 &mdash; Official Report, Volume 121, column 962.  He referred there to the fact that the House of Lords had decided that the definition of &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; was to be construed relatively widely in a broad cultural and historic sense.  Indeed, the House of Lords, by their decision in that case did so decide. He went on to say that it would be quite desirable that it should be left to the courts to determine whether any particular grouping fell within an ethnic definition.  The Minister went on to say he thought the Irish courts would likely follow the House of Lords decision by giving this wide definition to the word ethnic.</P>
    <P>What the Minister said in connection with that case is correct as far as it goes but it is only half the truth.  The other half of that particular story is that the court below the House of Lords, namely the Court of Appeal, also a very eminent court in the English jurisdiction, came to the directly opposite conclusion on the definition of the word &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo;.  The House of Lords overruled them in that same case and came to the opposite conclusion. The matter was dealt with by the Court of Appeal, and is referred to in the All England Law Reports 1982 at page 1109.  That particular case, for the information of Deputies, concerned the question of the Sikhs, whoever they were, within the meaning of the English Race Relations Act.  The Court of Appeal said that:</P>
    <P>Since Sikhs were merely a distinct religious and cultural community to which anyone might belong, and who could not be distinguished from other peoples of the Punjab by reference to any racial characteristic, they were not, as Sikhs, a group of persons defined by reference to &ldquo;ethnic or national origins&rdquo; within s 3 (1) of the 1976 Act. </P>
    <P>That is the English Race Relations Act, 1976.</P>
    <P>It followed that they were not a <Col N="2207" /> racial group within s 1 (1)(b) of the 1976 Act and that it was not unlawful under the Act to discriminate against them. </P>
    <P>The Court of Appeal decided that you could discriminate against the Sikhs and, indeed, the House of Lords overturned that.  My point is that the Irish courts are not bound by English decisions of that period.  They may look at them, they may be persuaded by them or they may not. They are just as likely to be persuaded by the Court of Appeal as they are by the House of Lords but they are not bound by them in any way.</P>
    <P>Why leave it to be determined and decided by the courts whether travellers are an ethnic group or not or whether members of the gay community are a group within the meaning of the Act? Why leave it open to the courts and the lawyers to get busy increasing their fees at very great expense when we can settle the matter much cheaper, quicker and simpler here in this House when we are working on this Bill?  I know the Minister is very anxious to advance and increase the earnings of the lawyers.  He showed that by his response to the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill when he refused to allow district jurisdiction, which would have considerably cheapened the cost.  His sole objective seems to be to provide substantially increased earnings for solicitors and barristers specialising in family law.  Why leave it to the courts to decide when we can settle the matter now?  This surely is the time to do it, to take it out of the ambit of the courts, to put it beyond legal argument and to settle it now, if that is what the House is minded to do.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the question of racial discrimination is not being dealt with here today.  There is a lot of talk about the people of this country being largely homogeneous.  They may be in the ethnic sense, but there are certainly very wide disparities in the economic sense.  This country is far from homogeneous in the economic or social sense. I have seen established statistics which show that 5 per cent of the population of <Col N="2208" /> Ireland own 70 per cent of the wealth. There is nothing very homogeneous about that.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that other aspects of the Bill will not work very well or that the Bill will not be effective unless it is tightened up substantially by amendment on Committee Stage.  The Bill is modelled largely on the British legislation which has been followed in the setting out of offences in sections 2, 3 and 4. I am surprised we followed the British legislation so slavishly, particularly basing proof of guilt on establishing what the intention of the person disseminating the literature was, when it must be known that the English legislation, based on that same premise, failed very badly.  Many prosecutions in England have failed because of the difficulty in establishing what was the true intention of the person.</P>
    <P>We all understand that it is very difficult to prove what is in a person's mind, or what their intention was.  It is not something that can be established on evidence. By and large, if a person said he meant this, or he did not mean that, or he did not intend the other, that is not something that is easily proved or disproved in a court.  We will have considerable difficulties in making prosecutions stick if we do not amend this legislation.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one English case to highlight the point where the question of intention was involved &mdash; the Race Relations Board versus the Associated Newspapers Group.  Judgment was given on that matter on 1 March 1978 arising out of the English Act.  An advertisement was inserted in one of the main English newspapers run by the Associated Newspapers Group advertising for nursing staff in a hospital in South Africa. Included in the advertisement were the words &ldquo;all white patients&rdquo;.  The Race Relations Board, who have responsibility for these matters in England, took the view, rightly, in my opinion, that the advertisement was discriminatory in that those words meant clearly that only white nurses would be employed in these jobs. They sought a declaration that the paper had acted contrary to section 6 of the Race <Col N="2209" /> Relations Act, 1976, by publishing an advertisement which could reasonably be understood to be an intention to discriminate. The court dismissed that claim saying they could not be satisfied that the intention of the newspaper was an act of discrimination.  I think that is regrettable because the intention of the person under the prosecution becomes the critical factor in determining his or her guilt. Very substantial possiblities of defence are left open if we leave the Bill as it stands.  The standard of proof that would be required to establish it under this Bill as drafted is altogether too high and should be changed.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other possible defences that may be thrown up by the Bill if we leave it in its present form.  I will refer to one which occurs to me and perhaps the Minister would have a look at it between now and Committee Stage. This deals with the position in relation to public meetings.  I think Deputy Flanagan referred to this point already but I want to refer to a slightly different aspect of it. Section 2 (3) states that a public meeting means &ldquo;a meeting at which the public are entitled to be present, on payment or otherwise and as of right or by virtue of an express or implied permission.&rdquo;  I want to draw particular attention to the words &ldquo;as a right&rdquo;.  In other words, a public meeting is a meeting where the public can go &ldquo;as of right&rdquo;.  If, for argument's sake, a Nazi party call a meeting at some hotel on a Monday night but they say: &ldquo;The organisers reserve the right to refuse admission&rdquo; can we then say that members of the public may go to that meeting as of right?  The organisers will say: &ldquo;No, they cannot because we are reserving the right to refuse admission. Therefore, you can go into the meeting with our permission or we can stop you if we want to&rdquo;.  That could be a way out of saying it is not a public meeting within the meaning of the Bill.  It strikes me that way on a preliminary reading of the section and I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments on it.</P>
    <P>I am a bit puzzled by the distinctions which are drawn in the various sections between material for dissemination in the <Col N="2210" /> State and material for dissemination outside the State.  The offences defined in section 2 point out that hatred means &ldquo;hatred against a group of persons in the State on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion or ethnic or national origins&rdquo;.  I do not know why that definition is confined to hatred within the State. If material exists which advocates hatred of people on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, or whatever, whether within the State or not, this should be regarded as an offence.  Why limit this offence to material published within the State?  If material is published about the blacks in South Africa, will that escape being regarded as an offence because it is not within the State?  On the other hand, section 4 states that it will be an offence to be in possession of written material &ldquo;in the State or elsewhere&rdquo;.  I believe there should be no limitation in any of the sections confining this offence to material referring to people within the State.</P>
    <P>The word we are concerned with in this Bill is &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; and the title of the Bill refers to the prohibition of incitement to hatred.  Perhaps consideration should be given &mdash; and I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments on this &mdash; to broadening this somewhat.  Material could be produced on a group of people, a religious or an ethnic group, which could ridicule them or hold them up to contempt without necessarily inciting hatred. We should also consider prohibiting that kind of activity.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will move amendments on Committee Stage dealing with the sexual orientation of people.  I see that in the Seanad the Minister was very much against this.  He made the point that not many of the other countries which have adopted the convention have made specific mention of groupings with a particular sexual orientation in their legislation.  He pointed out that the only countries which have done so are some of the Scandinavian countries.  I hold the Scandinavian countries in high regard. They have an advanced view of these matters and it would be good if we emulated the Scandinavian countries in this <Col N="2211" /> respect rather than those countries which did not feel it necessary to include a specific reference to the gay community who have asked and made representations for protection under the Bill because they feel it necessary.  As I said before, when they have made that request it should be met.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill so far as it goes.  It needs to be tidied up substantially on Committee Stage.  I appeal to the Minister to be open and receptive to the amendments which the Opposition spokespersons have indicated they will put down to the Bill.  I urge the Minister to try to ensure that the very important further measure needed on racial discrimination in general is speeded up and brought before the House as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>My contribution will not be long.  I welcome the Bill and I trust that it will be passed with appropriate expedition.  I also trust that the Opposition parties will not press amendments which would be likely to cause delay or unnecessary controversy at a later stage. I welcome the generous support given by the Opposition parties to the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill can be approached from two perspectives: the domestic-national perspective and the international perspective. There are very strong domestic reasons why we should introduce this legislation.  Even though this is a homogeneous country in terms of nationality and ethnic origin, there are a number of minority religions in the country, all of which can be protected by this legislation. Indeed, the majority religion in the South is the minority religion in the North and in that way the provisions of the Bill relating to protection against incitement to religious hatred appeal to all religious sections and I am sure will be welcomed <Col N="2212" /> by all.  The fact that we are now in a position to ratify a very important UN convention on civil and political rights brings before us the importance of human rights.  The fact that this Bill is now before the House highlights the fact that Ireland has always had a very strong commitment to human rights and to the international structures and instruments which have promulgated and defined these human rights, many of which have been accepted in the political and philosophical culture of this country as natural rights which were there prior to any convention or positive law.</P>
    <P>The constructive comments made by the Opposition in relation to the inclusion of the travelling community are to be welcomed and I urge the Minister to bear them in mind in any modifications he might propose to the Bill.  The travelling community may not be recognised by the courts as a group of people who should be protected by the Bill or who should come within its ambit, and the provision of separate defences and protections for the travelling people would be a very positive step and would be of great assistance to the travelling people and the public generally.</P>
    <P>Problems arise from discrimination and its incitement to hatred against the travelling people from time to time.  With the changing society and the changing cultural background of the travelling people, the changing physical contacts with which they live nowadays, strains and tensions have developed in this country in the last ten to 20 years.  That the travelling people have changed from a nomadic, rural class, well integrated in a very special cultural way with the rural society in the thirties, forties and fifties, to a predominantly urban-based class is creating tensions.  It would be very wrong and remiss of us if we did not recognise these tensions.</P>
    <P>It is very unfortunate that various areas have fallen behind in dealing with the challenges posed by the proper treatment and settlement of the travelling people.  I come from an area in County Westmeath where in the towns, Athlone and Mullingar in particular, there has been a very <Col N="2213" /> positive attitude towards housing the travelling people.  Perhaps Mullingar might boast of the greatest success here in this regard.  Many of these families have settled in and are now taking their place in an excellent way in the community and are well accepted as part of the community.  I wish that that picture would be reflected throughout the country and, in particular, in the Dublin area.  There, there seems to be an utter intransigence on the part of local populations to accept travellers into their midst.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Abbott</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an enormous cultural problem, and an enormous amount of generosity is required of ordinary people to encourage the tolerant attitude which is needed to help the travelling people to integrate.  The mere provision of housing and of legislation such as is proposed in the Prohibition of Incitement to Racial, Religious or National Hatred Bill is not enough to ensure that the tensions which arise in which this hatred could be generated can be prevented.  It is necessary, in addition to providing basic housing, for us as a society to redefine with the travelling people their future cultural role in this country.  To that extent, in addition to housing, to physical facilities and places to live, we must look at the ethos of the travelling people and enable them to work out, through special training facilities and workshops, a basis for their positive contribution to our society in the years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current criticism &mdash; if criticism it may be &mdash; of ordinary people who may have prejudices against the travelling people is that the travelling people do not, in their eyes, make a contribution to, and perhaps take an excessive amount out of, society as they know it.  They <Col N="2214" /> regard it as not putting sufficient back into it.  We must set up structures to enable the travelling community to make their contribution, to give back to society what they can in the most colourful and creative way possible.  We should not miss the opportunity here of recognising the positive qualities of the travelling people, their creativity, their dependability in relation to financial matters which is often overlooked.  If we look at the record of rent paying, or mortgage paying, or loan paying of the travelling community, we find that they are much better in relation to meeting their commitments than any other section of society within that particular income group.  That is a phenomenon which is very often not known by the general public.  One sees that in local authorities.  Wherever itinerants get houses they are very good at paying the rent and at ensuring that their commitments are met.  This exhibits positive qualities among the travelling people that must be exploited.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are travellers who get drunk, who get into crime.  There are also very positive aspects in the culture of travellers in this country which exhibit a very high moral attitude to areas of life. There is the unfortunate tendency for communities suddenly to start off the hue and cry against the traveller if one of them steps out of line.  That one isolated incident will be used in the classical racial hatred situation in an effort to show that the whole group are a bad lot and are to be excluded from society, if not actually persecuted.</P>
    <P>This Bill, if it contains mention of the travelling community, will help that community, the general population and administrators and legislators to direct their minds towards the job that they have to do to ensure a full development of the travelling people and a full integration into the rest of the community in the years to come.  I do not regard it as an impossible task.  With goodwill all around, it can be done.  This Bill, if amended as suggested by the Opposition to include the travelling community, will be a very major instrument in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill can be approached from the <Col N="2215" /> two perspectives.  The second which I mentioned was the international perspective. It is important that Ireland would be regarded by the international community as a country which would outlaw, in a formal as well as factual sense, racial and religious hatred.  One thinks of the treatment of the Kurds in Iraq, Iran and neighbouring countries already mentioned by a previous speaker; the treatment of the Turkish minority in Bulgaria; indeed, the treatment by the Turks before independence in Bulgaria; the treatment of the Hungarian and German ethnic minorities in Romania. One thinks of the treatment of the Catholic religion in Latvia, Estonia and the Ukraine in years past and in the Ukraine to the present day.  One thinks of the treatment of the Christian minority in the Armenian regions and of the Muslim minorities in parts of southern Russia. The list could go on and on.  In all these areas the growth and promotion of religious and ethnic hatred and discrimination give rise to political and international tensions and to very considerable injustice and denial of human rights.</P>
    <P>By passing this proposed legislation, this House shows to the world that we abhor that type of religious and ethnic discrimination.  We have an historic detestation of the type of inherent imperialism that is concerned with that discrimination and the hatred which precedes and accompanies it.  The proposed legislation has an important impact on the commitment of this country and other countries to the pursuit of the achievement of basic human rights.  The passing of the Bill will certainly give our representatives in international fora dealing with the area of human rights and discrimination a higher standing and they will be in a position to lend greater weight to their arguments on behalf of disturbed and discriminated against minorities throughout the world.</P>
    <P>There were comments in relation to the lack of definition and the difficulty of proving an intention on the part of a person saying certain things which could <Col N="2216" /> be an incitement to hatred but the Bill should not necessarily be rejected or technically amended as a result.  The Bill is primarily a statement of intention and principle to which the public will react on a consensus basis.  If we are dependent on prosecutions on a regular basis to prevent incitement to racial or religious hatred then, as a community in a small island, we have failed.</P>
    <P>The Bill, first and foremost, puts forward the philosophical approach rather than the technical one.  It will cause the culture to remain one of tolerance and moderation rather than causing the cul ture to be one where the technical provisions of the Bill will be tested on a regular basis and put to the extreme test. I hope this Bill will never be used.  Certainly its provisions will be rarely used if the cultural and community experience over the past few years continues.  We are lucky that there is generally a spirit of tolerance which can be encouraged to grow.  I hope it will be encouraged to grow by the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 excludes an offence from anything said in a place that is not a public place as defined by the Bill.  I am worried that that could possibly drive hatred into private clubs or lodges.  This country has had an unfortunate experience of secret societies promulgating hatred and disturbance from behind closed doors. Nevertheless, the provision that the matter would be dealt with in the public domain is an important first step and if it is ever necessary to examine the sufficiency of that provision, I am sure that, in the fullness of time, more detailed provisions can be provided.  Once one legislates for the surveillance of private meetings of clubs and meetings generally behind closed doors one is going into a difficult constitutional area and is likely to run across fundamental rights in other areas of the people who wish to have privacy to discuss various matters.</P>
    <P>The fact that one is in a country where there is freedom of expression through the newspapers and television will ensure that the activities of any secret societies or lodges inciting hatred will be fully exposed and the public in general will <Col N="2217" /> react against them.  They will not get a chance to flower in a public area because of the provisions of this legislation.  While a lot of hatred and sedition has been and might in the future be hatched behind closed doors in clubs or lodges, it must always reach the public domain by way of the newspapers or airwaves before it hurts someone.  For that reason, the provisions of the Bill would influence the thoughts of anyone who would wish to form a club for the purpose of pursuing the objectives of religious hatred and discrimination and would prevent them from planning their undesirable activities in the knowledge that, if they reached the public domain, or if they put their plans into effect they would be stymied by this legislation.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, areas where legislation can never reach.  I recollect a particularly sad case which was documented &mdash; I think by the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo;&mdash; about a year ago relating to the case of a marriage of an Irish girl to a black man living in one of the Dublin suburbs.  I was thinking how the legislation might be used to curb the type of alleged persecution reported in that programme of the unfortunate couple. The type of fly-by-night attacks and snide remarks made by anonymous people in crowds would be very difficult to catch under this legislation.  One feels a sense of defeat when one realises that it is very hard to legislate for the bully and the purveyor of hatred.  Ultimately one relies on the good sense of people not to engage in the sort of private bullying and discrimination evidenced by the report of that case.</P>
    <P>No matter what one might say about the deficiencies of the Bill, it is an important step.  I welcome its provisions and the positive reaction of the Minister &mdash; if it can be forthcoming &mdash; in relation to the travelling community.  I do not see any reason for mentioning the gay community in particular in the Bill and I accept the reasoning of the Minister in his speech in the Seanad in relation to that.</P>

      <P>I welcome Deputy <Col N="2218" /> Abbott's support for the idea that the travelling community should be specifically covered in the Bill, in whatever way that may be achieved.  Deputy Taylor indicated that he would support the idea of a joint amendment coming from the Opposition parties to seek to have them included.  I do not know whether that is necessarily a good idea, although I have no objection to it.  It may be that a variety of amendments might be the best way of dealing with the problem as, when you apply different minds to a problem, you get a synthesis of other ideas.  At any rate, I welcome his support and I hope it is an indication of the general opinion on the Fianna Fáil benches in regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>Let me say also by way of preamble to what I have to say on this Bill that the Bill does not deal with the question of discrimination.  It does deal with the question of incitement to hatred, which I presume could lead to discrimination, but it does not seek specifically to outlaw discrimination.  I wonder whether on that basis this Bill would enable us to ratify the covenant.  Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states:</P>
      <P>All persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law.  In this respect the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. </P>
      <P>That question is not dealt with in this Bill and it is not proposed to do so.  I ask the Minister to indicate if he is satisfied that he would be allowed to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  It is clear that we have not to date moved towards outlawing discrimination on the grounds referred to in Article 26.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some time The Workers' Party have been seeking the introduction of <Col N="2219" /> legislation which would outlaw the incitement of racial, religious and national hatred.  We acknowledge that introducing this Bill is a step forward but our welcome has to be conditional.  The Minister's approach in regard to this matter is half-hearted.  He has done the least possible to achieve what he thinks he is going to achieve &mdash; freedom to ratify the covenant.  As I said, I have my doubts that he will be in a position to do so but even if he will be in a position to do so he has approached this matter in a minimal way and has avoided taking on board the very real concerns expressed by minorities in our society, such as the concerns expressed by the travelling and gay communities.  No attempt has been made to cater for these groups in this legislation.  This could have been done quite easily.  The Minister may argue that it is not necessary to cater for them in this Bill so as to be in a position to ratify the covenant.  I say, fine, but surely the opportunity should have been taken to deal with these very real problems.</P>
    <P>The Bill reflects our tendency to clap ourselves on the back and to say that we are free by and large from the racism and racist attitudes to be found in other countries.  Of course this is not necessarily so.  It is true we have experienced no major racial confrontations and this is probably due to the fact that there is no significant immigration of nationals of other countries.  The evidence shows that when Irish people go abroad, especially to countries which have significant racial minorities, we are not any better or worse when it comes to holding racist attitudes.  There is nothing to suggest from our attitudes to minorities such as the travellers, blacks, coloureds or gay people that we have any reason to be complacent.  There is some evidence to suggest that a person's race plays an important part in determining what way they will be treated by our immigration service.</P>
    <P>The results of the two recent referenda, the so-called right to life amendment and the very modest proposal to introduce a limited form of divorce, <Col N="2220" /> would suggest that respect for the rights of minorities is not that deeply rooted, even for those of fairly substantial minorities. It would seem that in the case of the divorce referendum and in the case of travellers that the people who object are primarily concerned with property and property rights.</P>
    <P>A vicious, murderous campaign has been waged by the Provisional IRA against the Protestant community in Northern Ireland for the best part of the past 20 years.  A large number of people in the Republic seem to be either indifferent or at best ambivalent about this even though the people who pursue the campaign claim they are doing so in the name of the Irish people.  It would be interesting to examine the findings of a study published in 1977 by Micheál Mac Gréil in a book entitled <i>Prejudice and Tolerance in Ireland</i> which ran to more than 500 pages.  I am not aware whether the findings have been updated since then or whether anybody else has undertaken research in more recent times.  The results of this survey carried out in the Dublin area are quite revealing and show, contrary to what we might expect, that when people were asked about what categories of nationals or others of a social category would be welcomed into the family by way of inter-marriage between 70 per cent and 80 per cent replied that they would be quite happy to welcome English, Welsh or Scottish people, unmarried mothers, deserted wives and a whole range of other people into the family but when it came to the travellers the percentage was as low as 30.  The only people who were regarded with less esteem were criminals and drug addicts. Perhaps this is an insight into our psyche.</P>
    <P>Another interesting aspect to the findings of the survey, despite our general tolerence towards the British, is that it was found among those surveyed that about 17 per cent expressed hard core anti-British attitudes, as they did in respect of blacks, coloureds and so on. As I said, there are no grounds, therefore, for complacency.  Mícheál Mac Gréil felt that the findings of the survey indicated that a good case could be made <Col N="2221" /> for the introduction of a Minorities Rights Act which would have a positive effect on intergroup attitudes.  At page 531 of the book <i>Prejudice and Tolerance in Ireland</i> he said and I quote:</P>
    <P>It should include explicit guarantees of &ldquo;fair employment&rdquo;, &ldquo;fair housing&rdquo;, etc.  Law governs behaviour and behaviour affects attitudes.  Good minority relations legislation, therefore, could go a long way to the creation of a genuinely pluralist society in Ireland, both now and in the future. </P>
    <P>It may be that attitudes have changed slightly during the past 12 years.  The findings of the study indicate that there was less intolerance among the younger people interviewed than among the older people interviewed.  On the other hand it may be that the older one gets the more intolerant one becomes.  I do not know whether that is true.</P>

      <P>It may well be the reverse.  I hope it is.  It is an important study and we should not be too complacent or happy with ourselves here today because we are introducing legislation which will outlaw incitement to hatred while failing to deal with questions of discrimination against minorities in our State.</P>
      <P>Much of the racism in the modern world has its origins in the colonial system under which the European countries considered themselves more civilised and enlightened than people in African and Asian countries, that the European way of life in some way had a God-given superiority over other lifestyles or cultures, and other countries and their peoples were there to be exploited for the benefit of the colonial powers.  It is, of course, much easier to kill a person you have created in your mind as in some way inferior or not quite human, and that attitude to coloured and other people was developed in order to enable colonial powers to exploit them to the best advantage, to take their land and simply push them aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2222" /> It is extraordinary when you look at countries where this has happened that even today some people you would consider to be the most enlightened regard aborigines, American Indians and others as something less than human.  I was quite shocked some years ago when a friend of mine who had emigrated to South Africa came home for a couple of years &mdash; before he left he was quite radical &mdash; and told me how inferior the blacks were, their brains were that much smaller, they could not really manage things, they could not cope with running a country, they were inferior to the white people, if white people did not run South Africa it would fall into chaos and so on. When he was visiting the house his young son wanted to know if we did not have a black machine to do the housework.  It was appalling.  Nevertheless that is the reality of attitudes which exist in places like South Africa.</P>
    <P>We should not be too complacent because there are elements of that kind of thinking in our own society.  You have to pinch yourself sometimes when listening to the rhetoric used to support the Provisional IRA campaign in Northern Ireland.  They talk about &ldquo;Brits&rdquo; and &ldquo;Brits out&rdquo; and then they settle down to define whom they regard as Brits. Sometimes you have to stand back when you are caught up in the furore about the British press, British justice and statements made quite freely in this House as well to the effect that there is no justice in British courts for Irish people.  That is a condemnation of a whole 50 and odd million people in Britain simply because they happen to have had the unfortunate &mdash; or fortunate as the case may be &mdash; accident of being born on a particular island.  We must be careful all the time and examine our consciences to ensure that we are not feeding such attitudes to people who may be less able to judge the rights and wrongs of the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Prejudice which leads to hatred is based on ignorance and fear and it is surely the function of the people in this House to avoid creating a situation where that hatred or ignorance is perpetuated, particularly in relation to our fellow <Col N="2223" /> countrymen and women in Northern Ireland, be they Catholic or Protestant or of no religion whatsoever.  Racial hatred is all too common in many countries.  Just this week in the USA a former leading member of the Ku Klux Klan and an advocate of neo-Nazi racial policies was elected as a Republican member of Congress.  In the last general election in France the National Front got 14 per cent of the vote.  Racism is never far below the surface in various parts of the world.  For instance, the way Palestinians have been treated by the State of Israel amounts in many respects to a form of racialism.  This is particularly tragic as the State of Israel was established largely as a result of world horror at the unspeakable treatment of Jews by Nazi Germany.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the worst example of modern racism is undoubtedly to be found in South Africa.  Most modern proponents of racism try to disguise it as something else but there is no disguising the appalling racist nature of the South African State.  The General Assembly of the United Nations has condemned apartheid as a crime against humanity and the UN Security Council reaffirmed that apartheid is a crime against the conscience and dignity of mankind.  The Assembly declared that policies based on racial discrimination and racial superiority are reprehensible and repugnant to human dignity.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on us as a country to combat racism regardless of where it occurs throughout the world and to ensure that it never gets a hold here. To that extent it is regrettable that the Government have not taken a more positive attitude to the introduction of trade sanctions against the South African régime as Opposition leaders like Bishop Desmond Tutu have suggested.  Indeed, it is ironic that our trade with South Africa continues to grow.</P>
    <P>In relation to our own attitudes, of the 13 people deported from this State between 1983 and 1987 seven were Hong Kong Chinese, two were Nigerian, two were Ghanaian and one was a citizen of <Col N="2224" /> the USA.  This seems to indicate that the colour of a person's skin can colour the attitude of the immigration authorities.</P>
    <P>It has been widely acknowledged that there has been a problem here in recent years of racist and neo-Nazi organisations from other European countries taking advantage of the absence of any racial hatred legislation here to produce in Ireland offensive material which would have been illegal in their own countries. I have a couple of examples of that kind of thing here, one of which was produced, presumably, for distribution in Britain.  It has an address: c/o 69 Eugene Street, Dublin 8.  It is called <i>People's News Service.</i> I do not propose to read out any of the rubbish in it, but it is quite appalling. It is aimed directly at people in Britain but it uses an Irish address.</P>
    <P>There is another newsletter with the glorious title in Irish of <i>Ar Agaidh</i> with an address at 40 Brian Boru Street, Cork City, Eire &mdash; a new perspective &mdash; and it contains various attacks on people, some of them appalling.  Incidentally, it is dated April 1987, No. 6, so it is not ancient material by any means.  It has some of the most appalling material in it.  Interestingly enough, it has an attack on myself and others in this House, and on Deputy Mervyn Taylor, in relation to our policies.  This kind of rubbish is being circulated not just in Britain.  Ireland is not being used just as a place to print material for circulation in Britain.  This material is circulated in Ireland as well by Irish people, not by British people. Therefore, we cannot be complacent about it.  That the Bill will attempt to deal with this problem as well is welcome and we hope the measure will prove effective.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Bill sets out to deal with incitement to hatred not just on the basis of race or colour, nationality or religion, or ethnic or national origin is also welcome.  However, a major flaw in the Bill relates to the definition of &ldquo;hatred&rdquo;.  In section 2 hatred is defined as meaning hatred against a group of persons in the State.  This seems an extraordinary definition.  The only possible interpretation seems to be that <Col N="2225" /> it will not be an offence to stir up hatred against groups outside the State. In the Irish context this means it would not be possible to take action against those who attempt to stir up hatred against people in Northern Ireland, be they Protestant, Catholic, or otherwise. Section 3 which relates to radio or televsion broadcasts also uses this very restrictive definition of hatred as referring only to hatred against a group of persons in the State.</P>
    <P>We are fooling ourselves if we do not recognise that the most pernicious form of radical and religious hatred in this country is represented by the campaign of the Provisional IRA and in a more minor way by the UVF.  From their very establishment, we identified the Provos and their &ldquo;Provisionalism&rdquo; as a sectarian and racist philosophy which incited murder and violence against fellow Irish people and which had nothing in common with the Irish radical revolutionary tradition. The Provos may claim that the target of their campaign is the British Army, but the fact is that the vast majority of their victims have been Irish Protestants and Catholics who refused to support their campaign or actively opposed them.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to speak much longer.  Much of the activity of the Provisionals, especially features such as the deliberate policy of murdering only sons of Protestant farming families in Border areas, amounts to a form of genocide.  For too long sections of society in the Republic have been unwilling to face up to the genocidal, racist nature of the Provo campaign. There is a need for society to take a stronger stand against the Provisionals. <Col N="2226" /> It is not enough simply to stand aside and ignore the Provos in the hope that they will go away.  The Provos and Provisionalism must be challenged politically. The Provos must be stood up to and defied in a democratic way.  It is important not only to declare that their attitudes are not acceptable but to examine our own attitudes which might in some way feed their belief that in some way they are serving the interests of the country.</P>
      <P>Given the record of the Provisionals, it seems appalling that in our first attempt to introduce legislation to outlaw racial and religious hatred we should effectively exclude their murderous campaign from the scope of the Bill.  I would appeal to the Minister to look again at the definition of hatred.  We will certainly be tabling an amendment on Committee Stage in regard to it.  It seems a terrible indication of double standards that we should consider incitement to hatred of a group outside the State as less objectionable than a group within the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is totally unacceptable that the Government have chosen to ignore the specific problems of travellers.  The travelling community are probably the nearest we have in this State to an ethnic minority and there is no doubt that they have been subjected to what amounts to racial hatred on many occasions.  We have at present a campaign of opposition in certain parts of County Dublin to the establishment of halting sites for the travelling community.  This is deplorable.  I represent the constituency of Dublin North-West which, I am proud to say, has done more than its share in offering facilities to the travelling people.  Deputy Abbott referred to the integration of the travelling people.  We should not approach the question of the travelling community from the point of view of seeking to integrate them into our way of life.  We should obviously help those who choose to become settled but I understand quite a lot of them do not want to become settled.  Our society should be such that they can choose not to integrate. Proper housing, educational and <Col N="2227" /> health facilities should be provided for them, as for other citizens.</P>
    <P>Incitement to hatred is only one part of the problem.  There is also the whole question of discrimination against people on the grounds of race, nationality or religion.  This Bill will not make it illegal to discriminate against people on any of those grounds.  Cases of discrimination against foreign students in terms of accommodation, entry to clubs and dances, etc. have been well documented, but there is nothing in our law or in this Bill which would prevent a landlord from refusing as a matter of policy to take black tenants or prevent a club from refusing to admit blacks or Jews to membership. Indeed, there are clubs who refuse to admit women, whom we cannot regard as a minority; I understand from the census that they may even be the majority.  It is not a matter for amusement. Women are discriminated against in our society and there is no law to prevent it.  There is nothing to stop people putting up a notice saying &ldquo;no blacks served here&rdquo; or &ldquo;no Catholic need apply&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice, Deputy Gerard Collins, in the concluding sentence of his Second Stage speech in Seanad Éireann on the Prohibition of Incitement to Racial, Religious or National Hatred Bill, 1988, said:</P>
      <P>I trust Senators will agree that this is a useful short measure which will enable us to ratify the UN Covenant and will enable us also to deal with any instances of incitement to national, racial or religious hatred that might manifest themselves in this country. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those final sentiments with regard to <Col N="2228" /> hatred remind one that 280 years ago Dean Swift said: &ldquo;We have just enough religion to make us hate, but not enough to make us love one another&rdquo;.  In a world which has literally jumped over the moon in scientific terms and has created microchips to perform electronic feats of incredible magnitude, mankind had made very little progress along the road of human relations at the level of family, community, country, continent or commonwealth of nations.  Hatred, prejudice and discriminatory practices are rife everywhere.  While our country, small though it is, is possibly one of the most favoured in this regard, it is still subject to the ghastly wounding effects of intolerance, as evidenced by the conflict in the divided province of Ulster.  This Bill is very important even if only to remind us of our duty and sacred obligation to be open-minded and tolerant on all the issues that tend to divide us.  Divisiveness is a running sore that is made more virulent by self-righteous adherence to prejudiced viewpoints.</P>
    <P>Essentially the purpose of the Bill is to enable the Government on behalf of the nation to ratify the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It will also eliminate the much publicised practice of using facilities here to enable the publication of racist material which we are given to understand is being distributed in other countries for the express purpose of igniting the flames of racial hatred and division.</P>
    <P>Though a small nation, we are not without influence on the world stage and our ratification of the UN covenant will not go unnoticed.  Small nations like ours do not have the capacity to be warmongers but do have the duty to be peacemongers. That is why in addition to passing this Bill we must also foster in our own land the conditions of peace, prosperity and goodwill which will bring us on the road to peace and harmony among all sections of Irish society and more especially in Northern Ireland where hatred, intolerance and discrimination has reached the level of ultimate shame.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Seanad speech referred to the increasingly multi-racial <Col N="2229" /> status of many neighbouring states and contrasted this with the racial structure of this country.  I agree with the Minister that the structure is unlikely to change significantly for some time to come, but it is noticeable that a racial expansionary trend is slowly evolving and one is conscious of the increasing number of catering establishments that are decisively ethic in character.</P>
    <P>Moves are afoot to attract students from abroad at economic fees to take their places in our third level colleges. The Royal College of Surgeons has a decidedly mixed ethnic population.  The Irish Council for Overseas Students recently called a conference to discuss the special problems of overseas students. It is a fact that there have been some incidents of prejudice experienced by such students.  It takes only one incident to create a wrong image.  While our overseas ethnic groups are yet small in number it is essential that we treat them with the courtesy and kind attention which we expect of other nations where Irish citizens go to work or study.  For that reason I would advocate that it is not just enough to have statutory instruments to proclaim our good intentions and be a bulwark against unthinking acts.  We must also inculcate a sense of tolerance and goodwill towards other persons who differ in race, creed or colour.  It is something which the members of the subject planning committees of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment could bear in mind as they plan the subjects for the new junior and senior certificate programmes in schools.</P>
    <P>One group in Irish society mentioned in the debate has very distinct characteristics, the travelling people.  I received correspondence from the Dublin Travellers Education and Development Group who claims it an irony that the travellers whom they described as Ireland's largest ethnic minority are not mentioned in the Bill.  I understand their point of view.  If the Minister includes the travelling people by name in the Bill, will it be said that he is hanging a label on them?  Will it be said that by not naming them specifically the Bill cannot be taken <Col N="2230" /> to cover all groups?  People who live in certain areas in Dublin are labelled to such an extent that they have difficulty gaining employment.  I should like to ask the Minister to bear those views in mind when he is considering amendments for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Recent events in the Islamic world have highlighted the delicate nature of ethnic perceptions, especially as they apply to religion and culture.  When political dimensions are added to this we get a reaction of wide international impact. What started with the pen of one person now is a centre stage world event.  That is a very good example of how racial tensions accelerated by world media attention can create a major international incident.  This highlights the importance of the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as it makes it abundantly clear that the instruments of legislation required to handle these situations have to cross national boundaries. Ireland, by passing this Bill to enable our ratification of the UN Convention, is acting like a mature sovereign state.  It should not be otherwise.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental committee identified two legislative changes which are necessary to enable the ratification.  I have a very special welcome for the first one, which is the abolition of the death sentence for crimes committed by persons under 18 years of age.  The majority of our young people are still at school up to that age and the concept of hanging a school child is utterly repulsive and repugnant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to teach and emphasise more and more the sacredness of human life.  This abolition is a step in the right direction and the Child Care Bill is doubly welcome because of it.  It is very pleasing to note, too, that this Bill will enable the ratification of the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  The combined effect of all of this is an underpinning of the basic tenets of <Col N="2231" /> the civilised society to which we and all nations aspire.</P>
      <P>Apartheid is an ugly manifestation of racial discrimination at its worst and most evil.  I hope the Bill will help strengthen our national resolve in relation to this evil wherever it is practised and in whatever form.  It will no doubt be a major item when the Racial Discrimination Convention comes for consideration as this convention takes specific note of race, colour and national or ethnic origin.</P>
      <P>It is an opportune time to have the Bill before the House with section 3 dealing as it does with persons involved in broadcasting. Those who will be in charge of the new broadcasting enterprises are getting a timely reminder of their duties and obligations under the provisions of the Bill.  I hope that our radio and TV stations, as well as the printed news media will not alone seek not to offend under the terms of the Bill but will also see it as a moral obligation under their remit to consciously promote positive attitudes in areas both central and peripheral to the objectives of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and I agree with the remarks of most speakers <Col N="2232" /> that it is somewhat limited in its scope. Section 2 (2) (a) states:</P>
      <P>In proceedings for an offence under subsection (1) if the accused person is not shown to have intended to stir up hatred, it shall be a defence for him to prove that he was not aware of the content of the material or recording concerned and did not suspect... </P>
      <P>That is all very fine but a person who assaults another individual in the street could put forward the excuse that he did not realise he was going to hurt that individual.  The Minister should tighten up that section.  The reference in subsection (3) to a public meeting is important. There is a danger that private groups may, behind closed doors, pursue a policy that ultimately will lead to religious or national hatred causing serious offence to groups here and outside the country. I do not see why we should differentiate between materials produced here and those produced outside the country or offence caused here or outside the country.  An offence of a racial or religious nature is an offence irrespective of where it is committed.  The Minister should consider broadening the scope of the Bill on Committee Stage to cover that aspect.  I am sure parties in the House will be able to produce an acceptable amendment.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the relevance of the Bill to this country.  Many Members gave examples of what started out on this island in the last 20 years as good old fashioned prejudice progressing to hatred and ultimately ending in violence.  Those of us in public life and leaders on the island have a duty to ensure that we set an example in what we say and do.  We should do everything possible to ensure that we do not mislead people by the line we take.  We are all aware that warlords, sitting at their firesides, have put forward theories which ended in different groups being at each other's throats.  Many lives have been lost for one cause or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Bill must be obvious to all citizens of this State and inhabitants of the island.  Previous speakers referred to Europe in the thirties.  That started off <Col N="2233" /> as something that was allegedly good for the community and gradually, from being a little bit of intolerance stemming from a prejudice, ended in a deep and bitter hatred which caused chaos and intolerance and unmentionable things to happen to groups of people within Europe.  Coming up to 1992, we are attempting to change all that.  In the space of five minutes it is not possible to cover what should be the scope of the Bill.  I would like again to ask the Minister to try to broaden it.  Various other speakers have already referred to the issues that I have referred to.  I hope the Minister will see fit to improve this Bill because there is a need to do so.  With that I will concede to my colleague, Deputy Monica Barnes.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague and the other Deputies in the House who cooperated in giving me the time to speak this afternoon.  I thank the Minister also. It is a fine example of tolerance which is basically what this Bill is about.</P>
      <P>One of the points I would like to mention is that the Child Care Bill is also this afternoon.  I thank the Minister also needed with regard to the implementation and ratification of this Covenant. This Bill has been long in preparation but I would like to think it will be reached in the next session, even if it is necessary to set up a select committee to deal with the complexities of it.  The Minister was so remarkably productive and constructive on the last select committee that it might be a good idea to have another one in the next session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also remind the Minister that we still have to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women.  We are all thankful, particularly in the light of some of the remarks made here, that we have United Nations covenants and conventions to try to reach a world and teach it civilised tolerance among people with different <Col N="2234" /> beliefs.  As Deputy Wright said this morning, we have an alarming and terrifying example of what religious extremism and lack of tolerance will do with regard to freedom of expression.  We must always be vigilant.</P>
    <P>In this community we need to develop our own tolerance, and I agree with Deputy Wright when he says that should start at school level.  With regard to our own painful and violent situation, we should perhaps review our own history and our emphasis on the negative and the violent, and on erecting memorials only to people who killed or were killed.  I hope that out of this Bill will come a recognition of the people who seek nonviolent means of achieving tolerance. Ireland is a small country that is painfully divided by the kind of intolerances this Bill is trying to combat.  Let us learn from it.  Let us build on it and make it the strongest possible Bill in the circumstances. Above all, let us try to be a shining light among the nations of the world by not alone recognising the conventions of the United Nations but by making sure that our legislation allows us to ratify them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Deputies for their constructive contributions to the debate on this short Bill.  The first thing I wish to emphasise is that this Bill is not an anti-discrimination Bill.  It is not intended to be such, and it is not intended to take the place of such a Bill, nor will it delay the consideration of whatever legislation might be necessary in the area of discrimination. Such legislation might cover matters such as discrimination in the area of employment, admission to places of entertainment, purchase, letting of accommodation and so on.  This very wide subject would be totally outside the ambit of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Racial discrimination in such areas is dealt with in the United Nations Racial Discrimination Convention.  If this short Bill had to be expanded to cover racial discrimination in general it would set <Col N="2235" /> back the enactment of the Bill and consequently the ratification of the covenants for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>During the debate a number of Deputies emphasised the desirability of making special provision in the Bill to prohibit incitement to hatred against members of the travelling community.  I want to say again something which I have already said in the other House.  I do not for a moment condone the use of abusive words of discriminatory behaviour where this is likely to incite hatred against any particular section of the community, especially where that section is considered to be vulnerable or disadvantaged. I said also that the principal objective of this Bill is to enable ratification of the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and for that reason the Bill is confined to categories mentioned in the covenant, that is to say, national, racial and religious hatred and the associated categories mentioned in the racial discrimination convention.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the strength of feeling expressed in this House and in the other House that the Bill should make special reference to the travelling community.  I acknowledge this and I personally deplore behaviour or activities intended to stir up hatred against members of the travelling community.  It is often maintained on behalf of that community that they constitute a separate ethnic group within the State and, of course, in so far as travellers can be said to have separate origins, they are covered by the Bill. However, in view of the weight of the argument on this point and since there is continuing doubt as to whether members of the travelling community can be said to have distinct ethnic origins so that they could be regarded as already covered by the Bill, I will certainly look favourably at the question to see if we have consensus on an amendment on Committee Stage.  I invite an amendment on that subject and would sit down with those interested and use whatever professional skills are available through my office to <Col N="2236" /> have an amendment that we can all subscribe to, if we feel as I think we feel on this matter.</P>
    <P>I have explained the reason for this Bill and its evolution in both international and domestic terms.  Its objective is clear but limited.  What I am doing is bringing in legislation to enable this country to meet international obligations and, within the limits of that legislation, to deal with incitement to hatred in a domestic context.  Accordingly, within the limits of the Bill, the Gárda Síochána would have power to move against persons who prepare or possess inflammatory written material or recordings for distribution here or abroad.  I have already said that I will try to specifically accommodate the travelling community and these are examples of how the Bill will have an important domestic relevance.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to extend the scope of the Bill to include people whose presence would do nothing to improve it. Indeed, extending the Bill to include named groups would give it unlimited scope and greatly reduce its impact because once the principle was conceded there would be pressure to further extend the scope of the legislation and deserving minorities such as racial or religious minorities would be lost sight of in an unwiedly piece of legislation lacking the respect I believe it will receive in its present format.</P>
    <P>There were a number of points raised by different contributors.  I am not too sure if I will be able to deal with them all.  Deputy Flanagan referred to the constitutionality of the Bill.  As I mentioned in my introductory speech, we are conscious of the constitutional right to free speech.  That right is not absolute.  The rights of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions are subject to public order and morale.  Similarly, Article 19 of the convenant on civil and political rights gives a right to freedom of expression.  Again that right is qualified. It is subject to certain restrictions such as respect for the rights and reputations of others, the protection of national security <Col N="2237" /> and the public order and for public health or morals.</P>
    <P>Deputies Flanagan, Colley, Taylor and Abbott thought that the definitions of public place and public meeting were too restricted.  In fact these definitions are very wide in their scope and catch all but private meetings.  I am sure Deputies will not like definitions to be so wide as to include the expression of opinions among, for example, family groups.  Any meetings open to the public would be covered wherever they are held and whether the persons are there by right or by invitation or some other express or implied permission.  A person incited to hatred when on private property, for example, the balcony of a house, would commit an offence if his words or behaviour were heard or seen by persons in a public place or at a public meeting.</P>
    <P>Deputies Flanagan and Colley wanted clarification of the reasons certain proceedings could be taken only with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The effect of section No. 8 is that proceedings for an offence committed under sections 2, 3 or 4 may not be instituted except where the consent of the DPP has been obtained or the proceedings have been instituted by him. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that trivial or mischievous proceedings which might bring the law into disrepute are not brought and to ensure that prosecutions are brought only where the evidence is sufficient.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley referred to the absence of the word &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; from the long title of the Bill.  I will raise this point with the draftsman to see if it is necessary to extend the scope of the title of the Bill. She also referred to the meaning of the word &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo;.  The definition of broadcast in section 1 covers the transmission of visual images or sounds whether by wireless telegraphy or by a combination of wireless telegraphy and some other means such as a cable.  It was argued in the other House that the definition does not cover transmission by cable alone.  This is fairly rare in this country at present but it could become more common in the years to come.  I <Col N="2238" /> undertook to consult the draftsman on whether the definition could be improved to include cable transmission on its own. He has advised that while the broadcasting of any recorded items by cable only is covered, the broadcasting of live items by such means probably would not be covered.  Accordingly, I will bring in a suitable amendment on Committee Stage which will ensure that all transmissions by cable will be covered.  Of course the word &ldquo;cable&rdquo; is not mentioned in the definition.  I am using the term as a form of shorthand for all transmissions other than by wireless telegraphy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 10 February 1989, the EC Commission addressed to the Council of Ministers a proposal for a directive on the introduction of a Community withholding tax on certain interest income. Following an initial exchange of views <Col N="2239" /> in the Council the proposed directive is being examined in detail by a Council working party.  In accordance with Article 6 of Council Directive 88/361 EEC on capital liberalisation, adopted in June 1988, the Council is required to take a position on the proposed withholding tax directive by July next.</P>
      <P>The implications for Ireland of the proposed directive are under examination at present.  The issues involved are, however, complex and much remains to be clarified about the precise scope and feasibility of the proposal put forward by the Commission.</P>
      <P>The proposal attempts to respond to the real concerns expressed by various member states, including Ireland, in the discussions last year on the capital liberalisation directive.  The process of liberalisation may well give rise to distortions in capital flows in view of the differences in the tax treatment of interest income in the member states of the Community.  A minimum withholding tax in certain circumstances throughout the Community may be a reasonable way to tackle this problem if a satisfactory scheme could be agreed.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the draft directive must be adopted unanimously if it is to come into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply I wish to ask him a number of supplementaries.  Is there any indication of strong opposition to the idea of a uniform retention tax throughout the Community?  In particular, is there any indication that the United Kingdom at this early stage is opposed to such a principle? Would the Minister agree that for Ireland at any rate the implications of the absence of a uniform agreement among the member states could be very serious indeed in terms of budgetary policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the second part of the question is yes, it could be serious from a budgetary point of view if nothing was agreed.  In relation to the first part, strong opposition has been <Col N="2240" /> expressed at the meeting from the UK and from other member states also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that if unanimous support for such a directive is not forthcoming the likely implications for our Exchequer would run to hundreds of millions of pounds in any given year?  There is no practical way, in the context of free movement of capital, of ensuring that there would not be wholesale evasion of income tax if capital could be put in any bank anywhere in the member states without being subject to some form of basic retention tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many implications in the proposal as it stands for Ireland and indeed for the Irish Exchequer apart from those the Deputy mentioned.  It may be a little simplistic to say that to transfer funds abroad in general terms influences the continual liability to Irish tax on interest on such funds in the hands of an Irish resident wherever he is.  It would have implications, for instance, if the present proposal was to be implemented in that it would suggest at this stage that interest on Irish gilts would be subject to it, but that is not altogether clear.  A wide range of exemptions is provided for in the draft proposal and many of these may be relevant to the purchase of gilts.  That is why it has been referred to an <i>ad hoc,</i> high level committee. I have put down a marker in relation to existing Irish gilts indicating that this is not acceptable to us.  We have contractual agreements with Irish Government stockholders at present and we would not be prepared to breach them.  There has been quite a lot of opposition to the proposal in its present form, although it was only presented to the Council in an oral fashion at the last meeting of ECOFIN in February.  That is why it did not go any further than an initial response but the response from some member states was fairly trenchant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister confirm that the oral presentation that was made to ECOFIN included a suggestion that a rate of 15 per cent might <Col N="2241" /> apply?  Secondly, would the Minister agree that there would have to be a uniform agreement in relation to banking confidentiality throughout the member states?  If one country operates a confidential system of banking, any efforts to find out about tax liability in respect of Irish residents in that country would be completely frustrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>One member state took the view the Deputy is talking about. That country believed it might not be necessary if every member state committed itself to getting away with banking confidentiality.  That member state was alone in that view.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The United Kingdom took the view that it was not necessary at all.  I do not think I have to remind the Deputies about the approach of Luxembourg where it would have very serious implications for their Exchequer and economy.  The proposal of 15 per cent was part of the presentation that was made to ECOFIN on 13 February.  Of course this is one of the areas where there has to be unanimous agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    <P>In addition, the basic exemption limit will be increased by £200 per child for each qualifying child of the claimant.</P>
    <P>Obviously, it would be unfair to subject a person whose income is only a little more than the exemption limits to the normal taxation rules.  Accordingly, an easement from tax is given by way of what is commonly called the marginal relief system.</P>
    <P>Basically, marginal relief means that if a taxpayer's income is in excess of the appropriate exemption limit for his circumstances, his maximum liability to income tax will be set at 60 per cent of the difference between his income and the appropriate exemption limit.  Application of the marginal relief system is not an anomaly; it is a relief.  All taxpayers on marginal relief pay less tax overall than they would under the normal taxation provisions.  Marginal relief can be quite significant depending on the taxpayer's circumstances.  For example, a married employee with two children who earns £7,000 per year will be some £220 better off in the year as a result of the application of the marginal relief system.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that a system of allowances and reliefs for low income earners, age relief and a similar patchwork of reliefs is bound to give rise to an anomaly of this kind and that what is needed is a simplified system of tax credits and a low marginal rate of tax such as 25 per cent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>What is important to the taxpayer is whether he must pay more or less.  In these circumstances taxpayers who have little income over their exemption limit will pay an awful lot less.  It is that which interests the taxpayer.  Take the example of a person earning £7,000 under the normal taxation system.  After allowances of £5,186 he will be taxable on £1,814 at 32 per cent and will be paying £580.48.  If we apply the marginal relief to his circumstances, on earnings of £7,000, with an exemption limit of £6,400 applying, he will be taxable on £600 at 60 per cent amounting to £360.  It will readily be seen that that taxpayer's liability is at the lowest figure of £360 so that the saving to him, by way of application of the marginal relief system, is £220.48.  Is that a relief or an anomaly?  Which is it?</P>

This was the only way we could target to low income taxpayers, which, I am sure, everybody would commend. We will come to the question of tax credits later.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Would the Minister not agree that Deputy McCartan's suggestion that, at certain levels of income, a marginal rate of income tax of 56 per cent will apply is correct?  Does this not constitute a further accentuation of poverty traps in so far as somebody whose take home pay consists of a fixed rate, plus overtime, henceforth will be paying 56 per cent on the overtime <Col N="2246" /> if it is to the overtime the marginal relief applies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

      <P>That is what the question says but I am saying there is no marginal relief at 56 per cent.  It is 60 per cent and was never 58 per cent or 56 per cent; it is 60 per cent.  Second, I should make the point that marginal relief is temporary.  Marginal relief applies where it is of benefit to the taxpayer.  As soon as it is no longer of benefit to the taxpayer, to the people with low incomes, they are switched over to the normal taxation rate.  That is the reality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 70 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated by the Minister for Finance in his reply to the Deputy's question on 15 March 1988, Official Report of 15 March 1988, Question No. 77, column 82, a scheme of works designed to arrest the incidence of dry rot at Rathfarnham Castle has been completed by the Commissioners of Public Works.  A security firm has been engaged to safeguard the premises; leakages in the structure have been eliminated and regular inspections <Col N="2247" /> are undertaken by the commissioners' maintenance staff.  A further scheme of restoration work is being drawn up at present and work will commence in early summer.  Funds have been provided to carry out these works.  When completed it is the intention of the commissioners that, in consultation and collaboration with other interested parties, the property will be utilised for cultural, amenity and educational purposes consistent with the character of the castle and its environs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State indicate whether there is to be any demolition of any part of Rathfarnham Castle or its ancillary buildings in the course of this development scheme?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>A recommendation has been made by other parties that part of the ancillary structure of the castle should be demolished.  The Commissioners of Public Works are at present giving that matter consideration.  However, I should say that a clearer plan is being drawn up for this year which will envisage the expenditure of £180,000 on renovation works.  We cannot take a definite decision pertaining to the castle without co-operating with Dublin County Council who own part of the building and an adjoining four-and-a-half acres.  Consequently, any decision we take will be in consultation with them.  While we would welcome any imaginative proposals I can assure the Deputy that we intend to ensure that the castle will be utilised for cultural, eductional and other amenity purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a recommendation on a number of occasions over the past two years to the effect that the castle should be disposed of in its <Col N="2248" /> entirety, but the Government and Commissioners of Public Works consider it to have such a high amenity value that it should be preserved.  There are something in the region of eight acres of land adjoining the castle and, while options exist for its better use, by disposal or exchanging some of it, that would be a matter for consideration.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance in respect of the years (i) 1979 and (ii) 1988, the total amount of income tax on farming; the amount by which the yield of income tax in real terms has increased over that period; the amount by which agricultural income is estimated to have increased in real terms over the same period; and the real value in 1989 terms of the yield of agricultural rates for 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The net receipt of income tax on farming profits in 1979 and 1988 is estimated at £16 million and £82 million respectively. The 1988 figure includes some £38 million for arrears collected under the amnesty.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that, in real 1979 terms, the 1988 yield of £82 million represents an increase of £19.6 million or 122 per cent over the net receipt of £16 million for 1979.  Excluding the amnesty effect, the corresponding increase in real 1979 terms is £3.1 million or 19 per cent.</P>
      <P>While the estimate of total agricultural income has increased in nominal terms over the period in question, it has declined in real 1979 terms by about £66 million or 8¾ per cent.  The trend in more recent years, of course, shows a real increase in income.</P>
      <P>The amount of agricultural rates levied in 1979 was £35.6 million.  A breakdown of the rates paid between agricultural and other property is not available but it may be assumed that almost all this £35.6 million was in fact paid.  The real value in 1989 terms of this figure would be about £84 million.</P>

      <P>I must point out that agricultural rates were abolished in 1982 following the 1981 High Court judgment. The estimated figure for rates of £84 million is somewhat academic, as it assumes that the yield would have gone up in line with the consumer price index, that no change would have taken place on the basis on which agricultural relief was operable and that the High Court judgment had not been given.

      <P>Withholding tax was deducted from payments made on or after 6 June 1987. In 1987 a total of £20.1 million withholding tax was collected and repayments for that year were insignificant.

      <P>I am aware of the Public Hearing of the Committee on Budgetary Control of the European Parliament which was held in Brussels last January on the subject of &ldquo;prevention and combating of fraud against the Community budget in the Europe of 1992&rdquo;.  There was a series of speakers, which included President Delors and several other representatives from the Commission.  The <Col N="2258" /> public hearing received a considerable amount of press publicity.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that none of the representative's of the Commission attempted to quantify the level of fraud. However, I share the Commission's concerns in this matter and I am satisfied that there are no abuses involving Irish Government Departments.</P>
      <P>In so far as the Commission itself is concerned, a Unit for the Co-ordination of Fraud Prevention (UCLAF) has been established under the direct responsibility of President Delors.  This unit has been given the role of co-ordinating and monitoring the activities of the various directorates within the Commission.  It has a power of initiative as regards rules and methods, has management responsibilities and acts as the Commission's representative in relations with the member states.  The unit is in the process of visiting all the member states, and indeed has been invited to Ireland.  During its visit here the unit will have the chance to discuss all matters dealing with the prevention and combating of fraud with Ministers and with officials from various Departments in the framework of an Interdepartmental Co-ordination Group set up under the auspices of the Department of Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 22, 24 and 35 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners' essential function in collecting taxes is necessarily dependent on events having occurred which given rise to a liability to tax.  However, in certain circumstances in order to facilitate taxpayers, the commissioners are prepared to give an opinion, in advance, on the possible tax consequences of a proposed course of action.  In replying to such representations the conditional nature of the opinion is made clear.  This is because the final determination of the tax liability rests upon the facts as they are revealed to the Inspector of Taxes, or on the hearing of an appeal, and neither the fact finding process nor the eventual application of the law to those facts is predetermined by an advance opinion by the Revenue Commissioners.  It would seriously compromise the inspector's statutory function to hold him bound by a ruling given in advance of the completion of the events which determine what the actual ruling should be.  The courts have confirmed in the case referred to by Deputies that &ldquo;an Inspector is not bound by a prior opinion <Col N="2262" /> expressed to the taxpayer by the Revenue Commissioners&rdquo;.  Consequently, there is no uncertainty in respect of the status of prior opinions given by the Revenue Commissioners and I do not propose to take any action in the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if it is his intention to publish the consultants' report to enable elected representatives to comment before the Government makes its submission for EC Structural Funds for the greater Dublin area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland's regional development plan which forms the basis for applications for assistance from the EC Structural Funds is now nearing completion and it will be submitted to the EC Commission before the deadline of 31 March this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Community is committed to doubling assistance from the Structural Funds to the least prosperous regions, including Ireland by 1992.  However, the precise amount which Ireland will receive will be determined in the Community Support Framework which the Commission will draw up in consultation with Ireland following the submission of the national development plan.  It would not <Col N="2268" /> be appropriate at this stage to put a firm figure on Ireland's likely receipts.</P>
    <P>The drafting of operational programmes is at an advanced stage.  The report of the consultants who have been engaged by the Government in the context of the Dublin area has not yet been completed.  It is expected that it will be available during this month.  No decision has been taken regarding the publication of the report.  Consultations have taken place with the social partners through the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and with local representations, interest groups and individuals through the sub-national working and advisory groups. As the Taoiseach has indicated arrangements will be made to debate the plan in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am calling, firstly, Deputy Gregory who has a question tabled on this subject and is present in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there has been no ongoing consultation whatever with the elected members of Dublin City Council in relation to work of the consultants? Indeed, the city council had to call a special meeting within the last two weeks to draw the City Manager's attention to their concern at the absence of consultation? Is the Minister concerned at this situation and could he indicate what action he might take to ensure that, as in other areas, there is proper consultation with the elected members representing Dublin city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If what Deputy Gregory has said is correct &mdash; and I have no reason to doubt it &mdash; then questions have to be asked as to why the structures which were put in place are not working in relation to Dublin Corporation as in every other local authority.  In relation to the second part of his question, I have no plans to change the composition of the working groups or the advisory groups at this late stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2269" />
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister try to ensure, even at this late stage, that there is direct consultation &mdash; I am not asking him to change the structures &mdash; with the members of Dublin City Council?  Is it his intention to try to ensure that a significant proportion of whatever funds become available will go directly to disadvantaged urban communities as distinct from infra-structural projects such as roads and so forth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>An element of infra-structural spending on productive investment will be the surest way to make a decent response to poverty.  The creation of jobs is one of the biggest contributions that the Structural Funds could make.  In that regard improving our infrastructure, by reducing some of the cost disadvantages in which we operate at present, should lead to the creation of jobs.  That is one of the most direct ways in which we can respond to poverty and disadvantaged areas.  In relation to further discussions the matter should be taken up with the City Manager as to why the structures are not working.  What is the situation?  Is the Deputy reporting that the advisory groups are not working?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">

      <P>The Minister in his reply said the amount of money is not available and will not be until the plans are revised.  I am aware of that.  My question asked the Minister to give an Estimate of the amount involved, estimates of £3 billion and £4 billion have been tossed about.  Can the Minister say if those figures are close to the mark?  Since Ireland is one region so far as the EC is concerned, can the Minister say who will decide on the allocation of that £3 billion, £4 billion or whatever to the different regions in the country?  Will the EC allocate it to the different areas or do the Government decide on the overall allocation within the country?</P>

      <P>We will lodge the national plan by 31 March.  There are no allocations made on the basis of that plan; the allocations are made after the operational programmes have been lodged in Brussels and have been gone through specifically.  It is only on foot of the operational programmes that specific amounts will be allocated.  I am not going to speculate as to what the figure may be. I can assure Deputy Mac Giolla and the House that I will be looking for the maximum amount which can be got out of the Structural Funds.  I know figures of £3 billion and £4 billion have been speculated on, but these are very wide of the mark.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance in respect of the years 1979 to 1988, the amount by which the basic personal tax allowance has increased in nominal terms; the amount by which its real value has raised; if he will consider consolidating the personal, PAYE and PRSI allowances into a uniform personal allowance; and if he will make a statement on maintaining the value of allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 1979-80 tax year, <Col N="2275" /> the basic personal allowance stood at £1,115 for a single person, £1,185 for a widowed person and £2,230 for a married couple.  In the current tax year, the figures are £2,050, £2,550 and £4,100, respectively.  These represent a fall of 18.6 per cent in real terms in the case of the single and married allowances and of 4.8 per cent in the case of the widowed person's allowance.  If one takes account of the PAYE and PRSI allowance the single and widowed persons have seen an increase in real terms in their total allowances, and the allowances of a married couple with one spouse earning have fallen in real terms by less than 5 per cent.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to incorporate the personal, PAYE and PRSI allowances into a uniform personal allowance.  Apart from other considerations, as the Deputy will be aware, the PAYE and PRSI allowances do not at present apply to all taxpayers and to incorporate them into a uniform allowance would, therefore, involve a substantial cost.</P>
      <P>As regards the final part of the Deputy's question, I should point out that maintaining the value of allowances in real terms is not the only way of alleviating the income tax burden.  In the recent budget, for example, I announced an increase of £250 for a single or widowed person, and £500 for a married couple, in the general exemption limits, with increases also in the age exemption limits; the introduction of a child addition of £200 per child in conjunction with the exemption limits; a reduction in the standard rate of income tax from 35 per cent to 32 per cent &mdash; the first reduction in the standard rate for over 20 years &mdash; and in the top rate of tax from 58 per cent to 56 per cent; and extensions of the 48 per cent band by £200 for a single or widowed person and £400 for a married couple, and of the standard rate band by £400 for a single or widowed person and £800 for a married couple.  These reliefs, which are estimated to cost over £200 million in the 1989-90 tax years, will be of benefit to all taxpayers and represent a substantial alleviation of the income tax burden.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans at present to review the legislation in question. The Deputy will recall that a proposal to rationalise and up-date the various schemes of assistance for disabled drivers was put forward by the Government in the 1988 budget.  This would, <i>inter alia,</i> have involved the repeal of section 43 (1) of the Finance Act 1968. In the event, the proposed changes were found to be unacceptable to organisations representative of disabled drivers and the matter was not proceeded with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Whereas I accept that the Minister's predecessor ran into <Col N="2279" /> trouble with disabled drivers who at that time were entitled to this relief, I would ask the Minister to consider that hand amputees are people who were not considered at that time, who were not consulted and who were strangers to that controversy.  They are suffering an injustice compared with leg amputees.  Surely the Minister should address them separately from that controversy.  Would he not agree that it is unfair to discriminate against them just because agreement cannot be arrived at with those who are missing their lower limbs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>My predecessor made very effort to try to bring in the new scheme in consultation with the Department of Health and the organisations representing disabled drivers would not accept it in any shape or form.  My door is open in relation to a renewal of something in that regard.  If we get to that situation, I will take on board the suggestion made by Deputy McDowell.  It has been in the criteria for quite a long time. However, we are not prepared to allow the open abuse of this system that was taking place previously.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided in July 1987 that a programme should be devised for the sale of surplus State property and that the receipts therefrom should be used to redeem the national debt.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance, in consultation with the Office of Public Works, established the required programme which is being monitored closely.  A total of nearly £5 million was realised in 1988 by way of Exchequer extra receipts.  In addition, the 1988 capital allocations to certain State agencies took into account a total of £5.5 million for expected receipts from property sales.</P>
      <P>The disposal programme is being continued in 1989 and I have included a figure of £15 million in the budget arithmetic in respect of property sales.  In 1989, a further £7 million from sales of property has been included as part of the capital allocations of the Department of Health and the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
      <P>As regards leasehold property, the Government have a policy of disposing of leases to the greatest extent possible and of seeking to reorganise Civil Service accommodation to maximise the use of rented office space.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister state what that will represent in terms of European average at the end of the year, or indeed of the average for the year?  Is the Minister in a position to give hope to the unemployed?  When does he expect we will see a significant decrease in unemployment? His colleague, the Minister for Labour, has suggested that 1989 would see a significant decrease.  Given the Minister's reply, that does not seem to be the case.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mitchell is talking about negligible figures in unemployment. He knows as well as I do that that is not in the very short term.  He knows as well as I do the increase that takes place in our labour force every year. It is hoped that with an average 3 per <Col N="2282" /> cent growth last year and 3 per cent projected for this year, there will be an increase of 13,000 more people at work this year.  This takes into account the number coming into the labour force, as well as everything else.  Certainly it is moving in the right direction.  The Government's economic policies are geared towards a movement in that direction.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is clear that the average figure of 232,000 on the live register could vary upwards or downwards, depending on the number of new jobs created.  It could also vary upwards or downwards depending on the number of people who emigrate.  If more than expected emigrate, the figures will come down and if fewer, the figures will go up. On what estimate of emigration is the live register figure of 232,000 people based?</P>

In any given month there can be new jobs in industry, some industries shedding jobs, closures, strikes, and all sorts of fluctuations.  We operate on the average, but at given stages it can be higher or lower during the year.  We are talking about estimates.  That is our best estimate. Some people would say that it is higher than some of the other forecasts that have been given.  I would refer the Deputy to the other forecasts, some of which were pre-budget.  Ours is post-budget. It takes into account the input from the Structural Funds and the post-budget situation in relation to tax deductions and social welfare payments.  We forecast the position and let us hope that we can do better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable Ireland to accede to two maritime conventions. Both conventions are related and were drawn up at the same diplomatic conference and both have implications for the civil jurisdiction of the Irish courts in relation to maritime matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more important convention is the 1952 International Convention relating to the arrest of seagoing ships.  The intention behind this convention was to produce uniform international rules in relation to the arrest of a ship to secure a civil claim.  Irish maritime interests have for some time advocated that Ireland accede to this convention.  While the convention itself in Article 2 purports to limit the circumstances under which a ship may be arrested to secure a claim, our existing <Col N="2321" /> admiralty law is such that accession to the convention will in fact lead to an increase in our admiralty jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Accession to the Arrest Convention will have a double benefit for Ireland. Firstly, it will strengthen the position of parties in Ireland dealing with foreign ships and at the same time it will ensure that ships flying the Irish flag will be protected from arbitrary arrest in respect of civil claims in other contracting states.</P>
    <P>A more immediate reason for our accession to the Arrest Convention arises from our recent ratification of the EC Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters.  This convention was given effect in Ireland by the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) Act, 1988.  During the negotiations leading to our accession to that convention it was agreed that jurisdiction in maritime matters would best be left to be dealt with by the Arrest Convention.  As Ireland and Denmark were not parties to the Arrest Convention, transitional provisions, based on the Arrest Convention, were included in the accession arrangements to allow time for Ireland and Denmark to accede to that convention. In the case of Ireland these transitional provisions will last until 1 June 1991.  If we did not accede to the Arrest Convention before the date our maritime jurisdiction in EC related cases would be governed by the general jurisdictional rules of the judgments convention and we would suffer a significant loss of admiralty jurisdiction as a result.  As the Arrest Convention will not come into effect until six months after the date of our accession to it, it is essential that we accede to the Arrest Convention sometime before the end of 1990.  With the co-operation of the House I am sure we will have no problem meeting that deadline.</P>
    <P>Before I discuss the provisions of the Arrest Convention I should make some reference to the existing admiralty jurisdiction of the Irish courts.  The distinguishing feature about admiralty actions is that it is possible to take an action <i>in rem,</i> usually against a ship or <Col N="2322" /> cargo.  In such an action you may arrest the <i>res</i> which is the object of the action. For example, if an Irish company supply goods or services to a foreign ship while it is in an Irish port and the owner of the ship refuses to pay, the Irish supplier may initiate an admiralty action <i>in rem</i> against the foreign ship and have it arrested.  If the owner does not enter an appearance the ship can be sold and the proceeds of the ship may be used to satisfy the claim. Normally, however, the ship's owner will enter an appearance, and the ship will be released on the payment of sufficient bail or security.  Bail would be the amount claimed in the action together with a sum for costs.  The action on the claim will then proceed in the normal way.</P>
    <P>The action <i>in rem</i> is an extremely valuable procedure for persons dealing with foreign ships as it would usually be the case that the person liable, i.e. the owner, will be outside the jurisdiction and will have no assets within the jurisdiction to satisfy a claim other than the ship, which, of course, can disappear overnight.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the provisions of the Arrest Convention, Article 2 provides that a ship flying the flag of a contracting state may be arrested in respect of a maritime claim as defined in Article 1 and in respect of no other claim.  The list of maritime claims in Article 1 corresponds generally with the claims which can give rise to an admiralty action under existing Irish law and in some instances is wider.  For example, existing Irish law makes no specific provision for an admiralty action in respect of disbursements made by shippers, charterers or agents. The convention does make such provision in Article 1 (1) (n) and because of this particular benefit the Irish Ship Agents Association and the Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers have strongly advocated that we accede to the convention. Also if a person suffers personal injuries in connection with the operation of a ship but the injuries are not directly caused by the ship, there is a doubt whether he can take an admiralty action <i>in rem.</i>  The position is clear under the convention.  Article 1 (1) (b) defines a maritime claim as including loss of life or <Col N="2323" /> personal injury caused by any ship or occurring in connection with the operation of any ship and in such cases the <i>in rem</i> action will be available.</P>
    <P>There are other benefits in our acceding to the convention.  Under existing admiralty law only the ship in respect of which the claim arose can be arrested. However the Arrest Convention provides in Article 3 that a ship in the same ownership as the particular ship in respect of which the claim arose may also be subject to arrest.  The right to arrest a sister ship will not apply however if the claim relates to a dispute as to ownership or between co-owners or a mortgage of a ship.  In these cases only the particular ship in respect of which the claim arose may be arrested.  The power to arrest a sister ship will greatly extend the admiralty jurisdiction of the Irish courts and should be of considerable advantage to Irish plaintiffs.</P>
    <P>When the Arrest Convention has entered into force for Ireland, ships flying the flag of contracting states will be liable for arrest only in respect of those maritime claims set out in the convention. However, ships flying the flag of non-contracting states will be subject to arrest either under the provisions of the convention or under existing admiralty law.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the Arrest Convention I should point out that it deals only with the arrest of a ship in connection with a civil claim.  The convention itself makes this clear in Article 2 where it states that nothing in the convention shall be deemed to extend or restrict any right or powers vested in Governments, their Departments, public authorities or dock or harbour authorities to arrest, detain or otherwise prevent the sailing of vessels within their jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the other convention dealt with in the Bill, the 1952 international convention on certain rules concerning civil jurisdiction in matters of collision.  The purpose of this, the Collisions Convention, is to prescribe uniform rules relating to civil jurisdiction arising out of collisions involving a ship or ships.  The Collisions Convention affects <Col N="2324" /> both admiralty and non-admiralty jurisdiction and therefore has implications for the jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts as well as for the High Court.</P>
    <P>Article 1 of the convention limits jurisdiction in cases of collision to: (a) the courts where the defendant has his habitual residence or place of business; (b) the courts where the defendant ship or sister ship has been arrested or bail furnished and (c) the courts for the place where the collision occurred provided it occurred in a port or in inland waters.  The convention, however, does allow the parties to agree to confer jurisdiction on some other court and has provisions relating to counterclaims, cases where there are several claimants and cases involving related claims.  The circumstances where the Irish courts would normally assume jurisdiction at present in cases of collision correspond more or less with those prescribed in the convention.</P>
    <P>While the convention limits to some extent the existing jurisdiction of the courts I am satisfied that it does not do so in a way that is of material disadvantage to this country.  For example, under existing law the Irish courts may exercise jurisdiction if the defendant has been served with the proceedings while temporarily present in the State.  This jurisdiction is of a type regarded internationally as exorbitant &mdash; this means that few, if any, countries would enforce a foreign court order based on such a jurisdiction.  This jurisdiction is no longer exercisable in our relationships with contracting states to the EC Judgments Convention and the Collisions Convention would restrict its exercise further in convention cases of a non-EC nature.  This should not put Irish plaintiffs at any major disadvantage, however, as such jurisdiction is of limited value in any event because of the difficulties associated with enforcing a judgment obtained in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>The major advantages of acceding to the Collisions Convention are that it will bring our law in this area into line with that of most other maritime countries as well as ensuring that ships flying the Irish flag will be protected from courts in other <Col N="2325" /> contracting states exercising exorbitant jurisdiction over them.</P>
    <P>Having given an outline of the two conventions there is little left to say about the Bill itself which is relatively straightforward.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 11 give the force of law to the Arrest Convention and the Collisions Convention respectively.  Section 14 abolishes the Cork Local Admiralty Court.  This is essentially a tidying up operation.  The Cork Circuit Court when sitting as the Cork Local Admiralty Court is the only court in Ireland other than the High Court which has admiralty jurisdiction.  However its admiralty jurisdiction, which is limited to claims not exceeding £2,000, is no longer availed of in practice.  I understand that the Incorporated Law Society and the Southern Law Association have no objection to the abolition of the Cork Local Admiralty Court.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill deals with the arrest of State ships.  It is a recognised principle of international law that warships and ships in the service of a state, not being used for trading purposes, are entitled to claim sovereign immunity. This principle was specifically provided for in Article 5 of the Collisions Convention but there is no such provision in the Arrest Convention.  Section 6 of the Bill is necessary, therefore, to avoid any danger that the Irish Courts would interpret the Arrest Convention as changing the law on the arrest of State ships.  Since the matter has not been provided for in the Arrest Convention a formal reservation will be required to deal with the question when we deposit our instrument of accession.  Many other countries have made a similar reservation.</P>
    <P>The other provisions of the Bill deal with procedural matters and questions of interpretation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased this Bill has at last come before the House because, as the Minister of State has said, the purpose of the Jurisdiction of Courts (Maritime Conventions) Bill is to <Col N="2326" /> allow Ireland to accede to the International Convention relating to the arrest of seagoing ships and the International Convention on certain rulings concerning civil jurisdiction of courts in matters of collision.  The Bill affects the civil jurisdiction of courts in respect of certain international matters.  To avoid loss of admiralty jurisdiction arising from Ireland's accession to the EC Convention on Jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, it is necessary for us as a country to join.  I welcome this Bill because it will extend the admiralty jurisdiction of Irish courts and repeal the limited admiralty jurisiction of Cork Circuit Court which is no longer in use.</P>
      <P>The Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) Act, 1988 gave effect to the EC Judgments Convention allowing Ireland to ratify the 1978 Convention of Accession.  The other transitional provisions, which expire on 1 June 1991, were inserted in the 1978 Accession Convention. The provisions of the Arrest Convention will supersede those of the Judgments Convention.</P>
      <P>The 1952 Arrest Convention unifies law relating to the arrest of seagoing vessels. A ship belonging to one of the contracting states may be arrested in any of the contracting states in respect of maritime claims.  The convention does not extend or restrict any right or powers vested in any Government's or their Departments' public authorities or dock or harbour authorities under existing domestic law or regulations to arrest, detain or prevent sailing of vessels within their jurisdiction.  A claimant may arrest either a ship in respect of the claim or another ship owned by the same owner. This excludes disputes between co-owners of ships as to ownership and the mortgages of any ship.  A ship cannot be arrested more than once in respect of the same claim by the same claimant.  In the case of a charter, the charterer, not the owner, is liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under that convention also a ship can be arrested only under the authority of a court.  The court within whose jurisdiction <Col N="2327" /> the ship has been arrested shall permit the release of the ship upon the furnishing of proper bail or security.  As the Minister said, this gives additional power to us as well as additional protection.  The request to release a ship under such a security shall not be construed as an acknowledgment of liability.  The rules of procedure relating to the arrest of a ship shall be governed by the law of the country in which the arrest was applied for.  The courts in the country in which the arrest was made have jurisdiction to determine the case upon merits if the domestic law of the country in which the arrest was made gives jurisdiction to such courts. The Arrest Convention of 1952 also applies to all contracting states.  Any ship of a non-contracting state may be arrested in the jurisdiction of any contracting state.  The non-contracting party, however, may be excluded from the benefits of the contract.  The convention does not modify the rules of law in regard to a person who has habitual residence or place of business within the states.</P>
    <P>The Collision Convention establishes rule relating to the civil jurisdiction in matters of collision.  Irish ships will benefit from the protection afforded by the convention in other contracting states. This is important.  The convention is a force of law, so the convention will not alter law of immunity from arrest of warships or ships owned or in the service of the state, except commercial ships.</P>
    <P>Under the Collision Convention an action for collision occurring between seagoing vessels or a seagoing vessel and an inland navigational craft can only be introduced before the court where the defendant has residence or business, or before the court of the place of collision when the collision has occurred within the limits of a port or in inland waters, or before the court of the place where the arrest has been effected.  The plaintiff can decide which court can be instituted. A claimant cannot bring further action against the same defendant on the same claim in another jurisdiction without discontinuing action already instituted.</P>
    <P>Counterclaims arising out of the same <Col N="2328" /> collision can be brought before the court having jurisdiction over the principal action.  If there are several claimants, any claimant may bring his action before the court previously seized of an action against the same party.</P>
    <P>The convention applies to an action for damage caused by one ship to another or the property or persons on board through ommission to carry out manoeuvres or non-compliance with regulations.  The convention does not apply to collisions involving warships or state-owned vessels, contracts of carriage or cases covered by the Rhine Navigation Convention.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the convention shall be applied as regards all persons interested when all the vessels concerned in any action belong to states of the high contracting parties.  In regard to persons interested who belong to a non-contracting state, the provisions may be made by each of the contracting states conditional upon reciprocity.  Where all persons interested belong to the same state, national law is applicable.  Disputes are submitted to the International Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>The Collisions Regulations (Ships and Water Craft on the Water) Order, 1984, applies to all vessels upon the high seas and in all waters therewith.  I understand it shall not interfere with the operation of rules made by the appropriate authority for roadsteads, harbours, rivers, lakes or inland waterways connected with the high seas and navigable by seagoing vessels.  It does not exonerate any vessels, owners, masters or crew from the consequence of any neglect to comply with the rule or of neglect of any precautions which may be required by ordinary practice of seamanship or special circumstances of the case.  The Minister in his reply might explain how the 1984 regulations fall in within this proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset.  I welcome the Bill.  I hope it will be enacted and put into force and that we in this country do not just pay lip service to Bills going through <Col N="2329" /> this House.  In 1974 we signed an International Convention for the safety of persons within our jurisdiction on the seas and to date we have not complied with the real spirit of that convention.  I hope we will make a more positive approach in relation to this and that we will be seen as a Government to act upon legislation that goes through this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It cannot really be objected to and therefore I will not waste the time of the House.  I want to ask the Minister a question arising out of the operation of the Bill.  Article 8 (2) of the Arrest Convention provides that a ship flying the flag of a non-contracting state may be arrested in the jurisdiction of any contracting state in respect of the maritime claims enumerated in Article 1 or of any other claim for which the law of the contracting State permits arrest.  It seems to allow for the extention of the category of claims in Article 1 to the ships of non-contracting states.  Does that mean that the law in respect of non-contracting states' ships is now uniform as regards the kind of actions that can be the subject matter of an arrest?  If a ship of a non-contracting state comes into Dublin, is the series of claims set out in Article 1, paragraph 1, applicable to such a ship?</P>
      <P>It seems that if section 4 (1) of the Bill becomes law, the whole convention has the force of law in the State and, if I am right, then by a back door method, even though this is an international agreement which is being brought into law, it is also legislation in respect of people who are not party to the agreement and we are widening the ground of arrest to cover the ships of such states.  If that is the case, I am quite happy.  I would be worried if it were not the case.  I would not like a two-tier right of arrest which would put ships of contracting states at a disadvantage compared with ships of non-contracting states.  That is my only question.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and indicate that my party support its passage.</P>

      <P>Ba <Col N="2330" /> mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl don Teachta Taylor-Quinn agus an Teachta McDowell, agus a rá leo gur cúis áthais dom gur chuir siad fáilte roimh an Bille seo.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies Taylor-Quinn and McDowell for the welcome they have extended to this Bill.  Before dealing with some of the points raised during the debate I should like to make some general comments.</P>
      <P>When this Bill was being prepared consultations were held with a number of bodies, including in particular the Irish Maritime Law Association.  The international parent body of that association, the <i>Comité Maritime Internationale,</i> were very actively involved in the original drafting of both the Arrest Convention and the Collisions Convention and the Irish branch have always played an active role in encouraging the adoption of these two conventions.  I should like to put on record the Minister's appreciation of the co-operation, expertise and assistance provided by the Irish Maritime Law Association when this Bill was being prepared.</P>
      <P>In my introductory speech I pointed out that it is essential that we accede to the Arrest Convention if we are to preserve our admiralty jurisdiction in respect of defendants domiciled in states party to the EC Judgments Convention. Prior to the coming into effect of the Judgments Convention the High Court always had jurisdiction to hear a case but the exercise of that jurisdiction was subject to procedural limitations.  For example, the leave of the court was required to serve a summons on a person outside the State and that would only be granted in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>In the case of certain types of maritime claims, the court could exercise its jurisdiction by means of a special procedure known as the admiralty action <i>in rem.</i> In such cases the court had an inherent power to order the arrest of a ship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Judgments Convention sets out rules governing which courts have jurisdiction and cases which come within the <Col N="2331" /> scope of the courts of contracting states are obliged to follow these rules.  These rules, except for the transitional provisions to which I have already referred in my opening speech, make no special provision for admiralty actions and taken on their own would have greatly restricted the availability of the admiralty action <i>in rem</i> where the defendant is domiciled in a contracting state.  However the Judgments Convention does provide an escape clause in Article 57, which provides that it does not affect any convention which in relation to particular matters governs jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>By virtue of Article 57, therefore, when we accede to the Arrest Convention its jurisdictional provisions will take precedence over the rules of the Judgments Convention.  As the Arrest Convention in Article 7 gives jurisdiction to the courts of the country in which the ship was arrested, it can be seen then that by means of our accession to the Arrest Convention we will retain that valuable right to take an admiralty action <i>in rem.</i></P>
    <P>Leaving aside the relationship between the Judgments Convention and the Arrest Convention, what effect will accession to the Arrest Convention have on the arrest of ships in admiralty actions?  In practice as far as plantiffs and defendants are concerned, accession to the Arrest Convention will mean little or no change except in so far as it will now be possible to arrest sister ships in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>As I explained briefly in my speech, ships flying the flags of states party to the Arrest Convention can only be arrested in accordance with the provisions of the Arrest Convention.  However, in the case of non-contracting states, their ships may be arrested either under the provisions of the convention or under any existing provision of domestic law.  I have already said that there is very little difference between the provisions of the convention and existing law, except in respect of the power to arrest a sister ship and in some other minor areas.  I have already drawn attention in my opening speech to two <Col N="2332" /> cases, personal injuries and disbursements by ship agents, where the Arrest Convention provides more extensive jurisdiction than under existing admiralty law.  It would not be feasible for me in the time available to list the other differences between claims which give rise to an admiralty action <i>in rem</i> under existing law and the maritime claims set out in Article 1 of the convention but I can assure Deputies that they are of a very minor nature.</P>
    <P>I hope I have answered the question raised by Deputy McDowell.  I said in my opening speech that when the Arrest Convention is in force ships flying the flags of contracting states will be liable to arrest only in respect of those maritime claims set out in the convention. However, ships flying the flags of non-contracting states will be subject to arrest either under the provisions of the convention or under existing admiralty law. That should satisfy the point raised by Deputy McDowell and allay any fears he may have in regard to that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor-Quinn asked me to explain the relationship between the 1984 collision regulations and the Collisions Convention.  The Collisions Convention deals only with the question of jurisdiction, that is the convention determines which country's courts will have jurisdiction. Whichever country's courts have jurisdiction will then decide which law should be applied.  If there is a collision and the Irish courts have jurisdiction then the 1984 collision regulations apply.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question. However, it is important, in view of the fact that we are now operating the transition provisions which will last until 1 June 1991, that we get the co-operation of the House in regard to the Bill.  Like the Minister for Justice, I appreciate the co-operation I have received from the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>This short Bill which sets out to terminate the licensing of stallions is ill-timed.  Following the winding-up of Bord na gCapall the industry is now in a limbo and has as its sole discipline the licensing Act.  A few days ago we got an assurance from the Minister that the register would be maintained by the Department of Agriculture and Food. We must not abolish licensing, at least until such time as new legislation is introduced to cater for the industry or the new horse directive is ratified.  I gather that that will not take place for some time. This is a time for recovery in the industry. Despite the fact that all the wrong things were done on the breeding scene, with people often using old and broken down mares and indifferent stallions, we have achieved extraordinary results.  We have 50 per cent of the world's best show jumpers but our high profile position is threatened by overseas competition which we will find it difficult to counter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The half-bred industry has suffered serious decline over recent years.  We are down to rearing 2,500 foals per annum and at present we have more buyers than horses.  The United States, Belgium and other countries have now compiled their own Irish draught register.  With the <Col N="2334" /> demise of Bord na gCapall, the Department, with Teagasc, have a major task to perform in trying to promote the value of horse breeding as a farm enterprise.  If we can produce quality horses then there will be no restrictions, no levies, no quotas, and no marketing because we enjoy pride of place with a number of overseas customers.</P>
    <P>We must run the industry in a businesslike way.  The models are there to follow such as Noel C from Millstreet.  Indeed, many others are showing the way.  We must guide and help small-scale operations. In this regard I should like to compliment the Minister and the Department on introducing the £400 grant scheme.</P>
    <P>The breeding of half-breds can be a lucrative business for those who know what they are doing and, fortunately, we have an old tradition of horse breeding here.  We have many knowledgeable people involved in horse breeding and they could spot a good animal on a casual stroll through a maze of horses at Cahermee fair.  Knowledge of horses is passed on in families or, as Deputy Doyle would say, is bred into them.  That has been a big factor in our success.  We need to encourage those involved in the horse breeding industry if we are to reverse present disastrous trends.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to abolish licensing now.  This is a time for recovery in the industry, for the implementation of regional programmes for agriculture and agri-tourism.  This is a time to seek FEOGA aid for the horse industry so that we can set people up properly with housing, base stock and so on.  This is a time for investment in the industry, for new thinking, new breeding and progeny testing but we will not get them without a licensing scheme.  Licensing, and the reasons for it, is as valid today as in 1918 when first introduced.</P>
    <P>The half-bred scene cannot be compared with the thoroughbred scene.  The thoroughbred industry, because of the massive investment involved, is carefully monitored by specialists employed by the industry.  Meticulous records are kept and there is the best performance monitoring <Col N="2335" /> of all on our racecourses.  We should not confuse the warm bloods with our native breed and we should keep our industry intact.  We owe that to our overseas buyers who need to be assured that they are buying the real thing.  I had many meetings with overseas buyers when I was Minister of State and I learned that what impressed them most was the staying power of the Irish horse.  They demand good foals from quality Irish draught mares and stallions.  The most difficult task facing us is to increase the number of Irish draught mares.  If people from the Continent are prepared to pay big prices for those animals we must deliver the goods.</P>
    <P>The Minister should get his committee to prepare a programme for the future of the industry.  Suitable people must be identified to act on that committee.  There are no real breeding criteria for good show jumpers or hunters and those involved in the industry can produce topclass animals.  We should give them all the assistance they require.  We have many reasonably good mares but the owners are finding it difficult to get good stallions.</P>
    <P>The Department must weed out the mediocre stallions and furnish good ones. The £400 grant will not help those in the industry if we do not have proper breeding stock.  I agree we should experiment with AI and embryo transplants but we must regard such work as experimental. There is renewed interest in horses from the point of view of agri-tourism. Pony trekking is now very popular and forms part of a typical holiday package.  Over the years our show jumping teams have become world famous. They have been our best ambassadors abroad comprising a real market arm not merely for the horse industry but for the country as well.  With the increasing demand for horses in the leisure scene, we now have a new factor in half-breds. We have a thriving home industry even for lesser animals.</P>
    <P>Now I come to my particular hobby which I worked at in the cattle scene, that is, identification of animals.  Both <Col N="2336" /> Ministers know well the problems in the cattle industry because of tags being lost. As a result there was a move by ERAD to bring in a rule whereby cattle arriving at the factory or the mart would not be accepted without a tag &mdash; I think they had to modify it a bit.</P>
    <P>In the case of horses, where the numbers are much smaller and more manageable, there should be no problem using the micro-chip implant.  I would favour this as by far the best method of identification.  If the British and Irish Friesian breeders who are dealing with millions of animals, are now adopting this measure there should be no problem within the horse industry.</P>
    <P>When the system is set up each animal is fitted with a tiny chip under the skin and all information on that animal can be obtained by linking to a central computer, probably in the Department. Buyers from anywhere in the world who are linked up with the system would be able to obtain accurate information about likely purchases without leaving their television screens.  That is the era we are coming into and that is the sort of competition we are up against.  They could also ascertain at any given time, without even coming here, what was available.  All information gleaned on progeny testing could be related back to the various animals tested.  Any attempt at fraud would be eliminated.</P>
    <P>The Department could observe trends in the state of play in the industry as a whole.  Armed with this information the Department would be in a position to take corrective action from time to time when necessary.  Also we could link up with people in the UK and elsewhere who are interested in Irish draught horses to our mutual advantage.  I do not wish to take from the freeze branding method, but I believe the implant is more comprehensive, more versatile and more in line with the trends for the future.  Any programme for advancement as indicated by the Minister recently must incorporate all modern technology.</P>
    <P>Nowadays quite a number of our farmers are inclined to sell off animals as yearlings and two-year-olds without <Col N="2337" /> getting the full benefit of the animal.  This is where the Millstreet scenario comes in. Indeed, Bailieboro attempted it before their demise.  It was a pity they did not get that horse arena going before they folded up because the co-ops themselves might have a place in that scene.  These horses training arenas could be set up so that farmers would have the opportunity to bring their horses to be broken so that they could sell them as three-year-olds.</P>
    <P>In all that, the discipline of licensing comes in.  The whole exercise in regard to grants and so on would be futile if we were to rush with the abolition of licensing.  I hope the Minister of State, as a result of my personal appeal to him, will have a rethink on this topic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the debate I would like to restate the reasons for this measure.  The 1934 Act was relevant in an era when horses were extensively in use in farm labour, contrary to the position now when they are predominantly used for sport and leisure activities.  Over the past 50 years horse numbers have declined dramatically and the number of stallions licensed halved in the period from 1970 to 1984.  At best licensing prevented clinically unsound stallions from standing at stud and at worst gave official standing to many stallions that were unlikely to have much impact on breed improvement. Also, once stallions were licensed they were not re-inspected.  Bord na gCapall examined this issue and in 1984 formed the view that the licensing could be dispensed with.  The board's system of approving stallions for the Irish horse register, which is being continued by my Department, is generally recognised by stallion owners and breeders as a fair and reasonable system.</P>
      <P>I would remind the House at this point that this Bill was originally sponsored by the previous Government so the views then expressed are much different from the views being expressed now.</P>

      <P>Deputy Crotty gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of his Question No. 65 on today's Order Paper which reads:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to the recent decision taken by the Revenue Commissioners to suspend until further notice in respect of stamp duty (a) the postal stamping service and (b) all telephone inquiries concerning individual cases; to the consequental inconvenience and financial cost to the general public; and to the loss of revenue to the Exchequer. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter.  I hope that our deliberations here this evening will introduce some reality into this unfortunate event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent decision of the Revenue Commissioners to suspend the postal stamping services for stamp duty and all telephone inquiries concerning individual cases to my mind and in the view of the people most affected, that is the legal profession, is very high handed.  There was no consultation whatsoever beforehand. A notice was inserted in the daily newspapers last week to the effect that these services were being withdrawn <Col N="2342" /> immediately.  This was indeed a high handed decision on the part of the Revenue Commissioners and amounts to discrimination against rural people and solicitors in particular because people living in urban areas tend to avail of the Revenue Commissioners' counter services in this respect.</P>
    <P>The postal service for this purpose is a simple operation.  It entails the receipt by the Revenue Commissioners of an envelope containing documents, when they compute the stamp duty tax to be applied to the transaction, stamp the documents and return them to the solicitor concerned.  If the Revenue Commissioners are not capable of undertaking that task or making alternative arrangements, then those duties should be handed over to the private sector just as was the collection of taxes to a sheriff in the private sector, which had tremendous results.  In other words, taxes are now being paid when due.  I heard of a case today of an unfortunate builder who had not paid his PAYE and VAT contributions in time and who was visited by the sheriff two weeks after the due date, which is unprecedented.  The Revenue Commissioners personnel in the Stamp Duty Office must be living in cloud cuckooland to be so high-handed as to request people to attend personally at their offices and deliver this tax to them. I wonder what would be the reaction were all solicitors to say to the Revenue Commissioners: we are not going to remit our tax by post; you can come to our offices and collect it?  One can well imagine that such circumstances would not arise.  Yet such would equate to the decision of the Revenue Commissioners to suspend until further notice the postal stamping service and telephone inquiries on the part of the general public with regard to this important matter.</P>
    <P>This decision should be viewed very seriously by the Government because it is undermining the confidence of the people in the State's ability to order its affairs.  In effect what the Revenue Commissioners are saying is: &ldquo;we have not <Col N="2343" /> the capacity to deal with postal inquiries in respect of an area which brings in a substantial amount of money.&rdquo;  Stamp duty rates are very high and the proceeds from stamp duty are very substantial. The Revenue Commissioners should be welcoming the legal profession with open arms and providing every facility possible to get the stamp duty revenue in as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The lack of a postal service is a source of great hardship for people down the country.  When a person buys a house or indeed land or engages in any other such transaction, he has to pay stamp duty.  It is necessary to have the legal documents stamped and the transaction finalised quickly so that the mortgage can be made available.  Bridging loans are very expensive. I do not think anybody would be happy to be on bridging for a period longer than necessary.  The Revenue Commissioners are certainly causing hardship to this sector of the community and they should take very serious note of that hardship.</P>
    <P>A few moments ago I received a reply to my query from the Revenue Commissioners, in which they made a few statements.  They state that the withdrawal of the postal service will not add an extra cost to the client or to the solicitor. Who is to bear the cost of the solicitor having to get into his car and drive to Dublin in order to attend at the Stamp Duty Office?  One solicitor has told me he sends his wife to the Stamp Duty Office once a week, that she takes a taxi and attends there for quite a considerable time, returning home when the business is completed.  This is a definite cost and must be paid for.  The legal profession are passing this cost on to the client, the ordinary Joe Citizen, whether he is buying a house or land.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners state also that it can be more efficient to attend at their office and that 75 per cent of all applications for stamping are handled through the public offices.  That is not factual, in that most country solicitors <Col N="2344" /> send their documents by post.  If they use a city agent, the agent must hawk quite a considerable number of documents from his office to the Stamp Duty Office, get them stamped and bring them back again.  There is a great fear, that documents will be lost as has happened already, because of the large volume concerned. This is very serious.  This failure to provide a service should not be foisted on the very hard pressed community and particularly those buying houses.</P>
    <P>I would make a very strong case that the Minister should approach the Revenue Commissioners and tell them to act like adults.  I do not think that any firm in the private sector would operate in this fashion.  Let us remember that Governments should be giving an example to the private sector on how to run their business, however, I am afraid they have a long way to go.  I wonder what would happen if I told my customers in the bakery that I was not prepared to take their cheques by post and that they would have to call personally and give me cash over the counter.  I can tell you that my overdraft would be very high, people would not accept it and, if I insisted, they would go to other places to do business. The State has a monopoly, but they should act responsibly.  Let us remember that the State is the servant of the people and not the master, that it should act as such and provide the service the people are entitled to.</P>
    <P>Where people are making large sums available to the Exchequer I cannot understand why they are being turned away.  During the tax amnesty the State wrote off large sums of interest payments, and more power to it as this brought in a lot of money and brought people's tax affairs up to date.  However, the State had to use a carrot to get the money in whereas in this case people want to pay but the State will not make it possible for them to do so.  This is ludicrous and should not be allowed continue beyond this week.</P>
    <P>Serving as a member of the Committee <Col N="2345" /> of Public Accounts I know of other difficulties in relation to the collection of tax.  I am aware, but I hope it is cleared up now, that cheques sent by taxpayers of all descriptions were retained in the Revenue Commissioners' safe for periods up to three months.  In fact one of my own cheques was not cashed for two months. That is not how you would operate in an efficient and organised manner and, as I said at the outset, it would certainly undermine my confidence in the State's ability to order its own affairs in a regulated fashion.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister not to let this situation continue beyond this week.  The reply I received today from the Revenue Commissioners was like something you would give to an adolescent, you would certainly not give it to a reasonable person in the street, or to a person charged with a very important duty.  For God's sake be realistic and treat the people like adults.  Let the Minister act responsibly in the very important position he holds and be responsible to the people we represent.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I hope the Minister will have a positive reply and that I will not hear more drivel of the kind I received in answer to my question today.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to put the record straight on this matter.  I sincerely regret if Deputy Crotty feels disappointed with the reply he got today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reference to a ban on postal stamping is incorrect.  There has simply been a temporary suspension of the service until such time as the current backlog can be cleared.  The decision by the Revenue Commissioners should not cause any serious difficulties for members of the public.  Most documents for stamping are presented at the public offices in Dublin and Cork and the counter services in these offices are operating normally. <Col N="2346" /> Therefore there will be no delays in stamping urgent documents.  Delays had arisen in processing postal applications and Revenue staff were having to spend an increasing amount of time dealing with inquiries about delayed cases.  The temporary suspension of the postal service will allow the backlog to be cleared quickly.</P>
    <P>Housebuyers and other private individuals should not face major increases in legal or other costs as a result of the temporary suspension of the postal service. Solicitors based outside Dublin have the option of using their town agents to present documents on their behalf.  Fees for the service are modest.  The suspension is temporary.  The Revenue Commissioners intend to restore the postal applications service as soon as the backlog has been cleared.  Arrangements are being reviewed urgently with a view to providing an improved service in the future.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners did not take this decision lightly.  They were faced with a substantial and mounting backlog of existing postal applications and an increasing demand on counter services.  The backlog was caused by a combination of an increase in both the number and complexity of documents presented for stamping and staff shortages. The volume of unprocessed instruments was so great that if postal applications continued to be accepted there would have been unacceptable delays to both new applications and the existing backlog of applications.  This would have increased costs for solicitors and their clients.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners faced a short term management problem and they took prompt action to tackle it with minimum disturbance to the public.  It was better to deal with the problem quickly and put in place better ways of undertaking the job in the future than to let the matter drag, causing a major problem later.  The simplistic solution to the problem faced by the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="2347" /> would have been the easy option of increasing the staff in the postal stamping area.  But this could not be done overnight.  Anyway, taking that step in isolation would have been not only simplistic but also costly and the cost would have to be borne by the general body of taxpayers.  Surely we can appreciate after all the effort that has been put into restoring balance to the public finances that increasing staff in any area of the public service, unless it fits in with a strategy for increasing efficiency and effectiveness, is a false solution.</P>
    <P>The Government's determination to tackle the problems in the public finances have led to a turnaround in our economic performance and prospects.  The Revenue Commissioners are in some ways the victims of the successful implementation of the Government economic policies. There has been a sharp upturn in the property market and with the greater use of more innovative methods of financing property purchases, including endowment mortgages, a greater number of documents is being presented to Revenue for stamping.  Last year over 150,000 instruments were presented excluding some 50,000 instruments for adjudication.  The yield from stamp duty in 1988 from land and property sales was £74 million &mdash; a rise of a quarter over 1987.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that only one of the stamping services provided by the Revenue Commissioners is affected.  The Revenue Commissioners will continue to provide a normal and efficient service in adjudication cases and for companies capital duties, levies and composition arrangements.</P>
    <P>A full counter service is being provided in both Dublin and Cork.  About 75 per cent of all applications for stamping are handled through the public offices.  For the majority of instruments a counter service is provided which can be completed in the normal case in well under 15 minutes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>What are affected by the temporary suspension are non-adjudication instruments which are sent to the Stamps area through the post and letter/telephone inquiries regarding such outstanding cases.</P>
      <P>Solicitors outside Dublin and Cork have the option of using town agents to avail of the speedier counter services and many have done so and are doing so.  The fees charged by these town agents are modest and vary &mdash; ranging from £3 to £15 per instrument or case.  Legal agencies operate in a competitive market and I would suggest that solicitors direct their business to the agents who provide the most effective and efficient service. The use of agents in a direct service context as an alternative to corresponding with a Revenue office on an individual client basis should, as I have said, reduce solicitor's other costs, for example for secretarial, accounting, telephones, banking and so on.  Solicitors normally charge their clients about 1 per cent of the purchase price of a house plus £100. If we take the case of a sale of a £50,000 house, the legal fees charged by the solicitor would be of the order of £600.  The additional direct cost to him or her of using the counter service through a town agent must be balanced with the savings in the cost of telephone and letter inquiries about delays.  There should not be a significant direct additional cost to the client.  The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the measures they have taken should not affect the revenue yield to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I would now like to turn to the future. Stamp duties are in the main a very old tax.  In fact, many of the existing duties are being levied under basic legislation which goes back to the 1890s.  However, we do not need to administer Victorian legislation in a Victorian way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been major changes in <Col N="2349" /> administration and work procedures in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners during the past year.  The amnesty for income and other taxes was a major innovation and the commissioners also have successfuly introduced the first stages of self-assessment for income tax. These measures required major changes in management, organisation and procedures. Stamp duties are administered within the capital taxes area and in this area of taxation the Revenue Commissioners have successfully launched a pilot scheme for the voluntary self-assessment of capital acquisition tax.  This pilot scheme was an outstanding success and as announced in the budget speech the Minister for Finance intends to introduced leglisation in the Finance Bill to make self-assessment of capital acquisitions tax mandatory.  The programme for the self-assessment of capital acquisitions tax involved very close and successful co-operation between the Revenue Commissioners and the solicitors' profession.  The Revenue Commissioners are now focusing attention on the administration of stamp duties and I am confident that with similar co-operation from the legal profession, the administration of these duties can be very much improved.</P>
    <P>What we are debating this evening is a temporary not a permanent closure of a part of the service provided.  Service will be restored as quickly as possible.  It is realised that the steps taken are a matter of concern and a cause of some inconvenience to solicitors, particularly those practising outside Dublin and Cork.  The Revenue Commissioners regret the consequential problems caused to provincial solicitors but I stress, yet again that these measures were taken in the interests of both the public at large and the legal profession in order to save them the costs of the extending delays which would otherwise have arisen.  The decision was not taken for administrative convenience.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2350" /> I assure the House that people are not being turned away.  There has been a large increase in counter transactions.  No documentation has been refused.  Processing will continue.  I respect Deputy Crotty's interest in this matter evidenced by the fact that he raised it by parliamentary question and on this Adjournment Debate.  I am sure the Deputy will agree with me, as a professional, practising public representative, that attending to people in advice centres, offices and clinics is much better than having to go through a ream of postal representations. In the same way in the Revenue Commissioners it is much more efficient and expedient to deal with cases across the counter directly with the public or through professional agents rather than having to deal with a huge amount of complex postal documentation.</P>

      <P>Finally, in the spirit of co-operation which I referred to earlier I would appeal to solicitors not to hold instruments ready for stamping until the postal service is restored.  This can only lead to problems in the future and will put an unjustifiable strain on the postal service when it is reintroduced by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the reference to tax allowances in the question refers to all existing allowances such as personal allowances, PAYE allowance, age allowance etc.</P>
      <P>The question of converting all such allowances to tax credits has been investigated by my Department and by the Revenue Commissioners on a number of occasions in the past.  The conclusions reached were that a changeover of this kind would be very difficult to justify because, in the context of our current sharply progressive tax structure, it would lead to an increase in the tax burden of a large number of taxpayers with relatively modest incomes; in any event it could not be implemented within the present tax-free-allowance-based PAYE tax collection system.  In order to bring about such a transformation, an entirely new system would have to be devised, which would entail very considerable research, development and preparation.  The changeover would involve a substantial disruption of the operations of both the Revenue Commissioners and employers and could put the PAYE yield at risk during the transitional period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 65 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their decision to suspend temporarily the postal service for the stamping of non-adjudication instruments was forced on them because of a substantial and mounting backlog of existing postal applications and an increase demand on counter services. The volume of unprocessed instruments received through the post has been so great that if postal applications continued to be accepted there would have been unacceptable delays in dealing with the backlog of applications.  The temporary suspension is aimed at enabling the backlog to be cleared as soon as possible.  The backlog was caused by a combination of <Col N="2300" /> an increase in both the number and complexity of documents presented for stamping all of which could not be disposed of by the existing staff.</P>
    <P>Housebuyers and other private individuals should not face major increases in legal or other costs as a result of the temporary suspension of the postal service. Solicitors based outside Dublin have the option of using town agents to present documents on their behalf.  Fees for the service are modest and are not normally passed on to the public.  In many instances the cost of the service could well be less than the costs which would have resulted for solicitors and their clients if the growing problem of delays in the postal service were not addressed.</P>
    <P>Most of the stamping services being provided by the Revenue Commissioners are working normally.  The commissioners will continue to provide existing services for adjudication cases, companies capital duties, levies and composition arrangements.  A full counter service is being provided in both Dublin and Cork.  About 75 per cent of all applications for stamping are handled through the public offices.  For the majority of instruments presented, the counter service is capable of processing normal cases in well under 15 minutes per case.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners' decision was not unreasonable.  Faced with a situation where delays could have rapidly escalated at considerable cost to both solicitors and their clients they took prompt action.  As well as clearing the backlog as rapidly as possible the commissioners are reviewing the operations of the stamping service.  They intend to restore the postal applications service as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>On 16 January last, my colleagues and I had consultations with members of the EC Commission regarding the preparation of the development plan to be submitted to the Commission in accordance with the new regime applicable to the EC Structural Funds.  The agreement of the Commission was obtained to the general approach of the Government to the plan, the objectives to be set and the particular sectors on which the development measures would concentrate.</P>
      <P>The Commission could not give any formal commitment in relation to the level of assistance which Ireland would obtain from the EC Structural Funds in advance of consideration of the full plan. However, it was possible to provide in the 1989 budget for developmental measures totalling £75 million, on the basis of prudent expectations of the increase in commitments for Ireland for 1989 from the European Regional Development Fund. This provision will avoid delay in the commencement of the development measures which would have been inevitable because of the procedures prescribed in the EC regulations for the formal consideration of plans and programmes and for the subsequent commitment of assistance from the EC Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>I regard the outcome of the consultations with the Commission as most satisfactory.</P>

      <P>An amount of £2,048,289,000 is provided <Col N="2303" /> under Central Fund Services in this year's budget to cover interest payments on the service of public debt.  However, for market-related reasons it is not the practice to provide forecasts of the impact of changes in interest rates on debt service costs.  In general, the impact of such changes would depend on their timing and duration and also on the timing and composition of borrowing.</P>
      <P>The level of interest rates is a matter primarily for the Central Bank. However, as set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> monetary policy is determined by the need to bring about the lowest possible interest rates consistent with international developments and exchange rate policy.  During the past two years Government policy has facilitated a dramatic fall in domestic interest rates and the prime overdraft rate of the Associated Banks has fallen by 6 percentage points, from 14 per cent to 8 per cent.  However, domestic interest rates continue to be influenced by international developments as well as by the continuing improvement in domestic economic fundamentals.</P>

      <P>No application has been received in my Department from the Mayo county development team for funding for an EC study on the possible cost of restoration of the Claremorris to Collooney railway line.  However, I am aware that an application for European Regional Development Fund assistance towards the cost of a study of the restoration of the Collooney to Claremorris railway line was forwarded direct to the European Commission by the Western Inter-County Railway Committee in December 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2304" /> Because the application was not submitted to the European Commission through my Department &mdash; which is the designated body responsible for ERDF applications &mdash; the European Commission advised that the application would not be processed until my Department's approval for the study was forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Since there would be no purpose in carrying out a study unless a reasonable prospect existed that the implementation of meaningful follow-up action would ensue, my Department sought the recommendation of my colleague, Deputy John Wilson, Minister for Tourism and Transport, on the proposal.  His Department have advised that the proposal is under consideration and that a recommendation as to whether the proposal merits support will be made having regard to all the factors involved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57, 63 and 64 together.  The document referred to from the Union of Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped contains a large number of recommendations related to allowances and services for disabled people generally. The document recommends a basic allowance for disabled people related to average earnings to replace existing social insurance and assistance provisions with an additional allowance for additional costs incurred by reason of handicap.  These proposals would involve a fundamental restructuring of social <Col N="2307" /> insurance and social assistance provisions affecting disabled people.  Recommendations in this area were also made by, <i>inter alia,</i> the Commission on Social Welfare.  The social welfare schemes in question are under review and the recommendations in the document referred to by the Deputy will be taken into consideration in that context.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme applies to persons over 66 and to persons under 66 who are incapacitated and in receipt of certain social welfare payments and persons who are blind and aged 18 years or over.  There are restrictions on the use of services in certain areas during peak hours.  These restrictions do not apply, however, to qualified disabled persons who are attending full-time rehabilitation courses or to mentally handicapped persons.  The question of further concessions in relation to the free travel scheme on the lines referred to by the Deputy will be considered as circumstances permit.</P>

    <P>There were about 4,200 invalidity pensions discontinued in this way in 1988.

      <P>The person concerned in the question should, therefore, approach his employer in the first instance about payment of any redundancy lump sum to which he considers he is entitled.

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there is a grade of blind telephonist in the Civil Service.  There has, however, been no recruitment to the grade for some time because of the embargoes on general recruitment to the public service.</P>
