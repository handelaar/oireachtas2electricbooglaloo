      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 7, 8 and 9.  It is also proposed that No. 1 shall be taken without debate.  It is further proposed that the proceedings on the Second Stage of No. 7 shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 5 p.m. today and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food shall be called on to conclude the debate not later than 4.45 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On No. 1, I would like to be clear as to how this matter arose. Could the Government confirm my understanding that the position is that in appointing members to the Select Committee on the Companies Bill the Government for reasons best known to themselves deliberately omitted the Minister for Industry and Commerce and now find themselves having to carry out, which I regret very much, an action which is to take my own constituency colleague, Deputy Power, off the committee in order to allow the junior partner of the Coalition back on?  Is my understanding correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As usual the Deputy <Col N="742" /> totally misunderstands the situation.  I find it increasingly a practice of the Deputies to misunderstand situations of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <P>Is the Taoiseach not putting the Minister back on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I could never attempt to accuse the Deputy of being mischievous in these matters but there is a very simple explanation.  On reflection, it was obvious that it would be better if the Minister were to be an actual member of the Committee, as there will be a very considerable number of amendments which he will have to propose and explain, rather than he just being an attender at the committee.  It is as simple as that.  The Deputy and his party purport to be in favour of committees and giving more work to committees of this Dáil, and this is simply a method whereby we can make this committee more effective and more expeditious in the job we are giving it to do.</P>

      <P>The night before last the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated the role that Ireland will be playing in the United Nations today in the vote on Cambodia. As the Minister is not present, perhaps the Taoiseach would draw to his attention the article which appeared in yesterday's <i>Financial Times</i> which stated that &ldquo;Cambodia's murderer prepares to take power as UK and others prevaricate&rdquo;. It is true that we are one of the countries prevaricating, by allowing this murderer back into power in Cambodia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I only had a couple of minutes to make a few introductory words on the last occasion.  I and the Labour Party welcome this Bill.  The horticulture industry has been the poor relation of the agricultural sector.  These <Col N="753" /> problems which have been recognised by the people in the industry, particularly in the area of production and marketing, have only recently been attended to.  If we are to come to terms with these problems it is imperative that the industry have an identity of its own, and a democratically elected board with proper resources and the necessary statutory powers would be able to resolve these problems much more quickly than has been the case in the past.  However, having read the Bill and listened to the Minister I fear that the board proposed will not meet those requirements.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the commitment of the Minister to horticulture in recent years. As a TD for Dublin North I am particularly concerned with the horticulture industry.  It is an area of great potential, with some of the most fertile land in this country.  Areas such as Lusk, Rush, Loughshinney and Donabate have traditionally been areas for glasshouses and horticulture generally.</P>
      <P>Soon after my election to this House I visited the Dublin Fruit Market at around 6 o'clock one morning.  At that time there was a glut of tomatoes and many growers in my constituency had to dump their tomatoes, something I did not wholly agree with, but I realised subsequently that because of EC regulations this was something that had to be done.  That morning I saw, to my dismay, the distribution of Dutch tomatoes to outlets thoughout this country.  I was disappointed with that.  While acknowledging that we are in the EC this is something that will have to be attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present operation of the Dublin Corporation Fruit and Vegetable Wholesale Market must be of grave concern to the Government and the corporation who are responsible for it.  It cannot meet the demands of today or the nineties.  The whole area is congested; basic facilities such as cold rooms are not available and there must be a question over the whole area of hygiene requirements now and in the future, even though lesser amounts of goods are being distributed from that area.  Can we blame the consumer who <Col N="754" /> complains that the fruit they have purchased will not last when brought home due to the lack of proper storage facilities at the market?  I do not blame the consumer. However, the real losers are the growers who have lost the confidence of the consumer.  Action is required by the Government and the corporation on the running of this market.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will bring together the people involved in the horticulture industry &mdash; the consumers, retailers or producers &mdash; so that they can work as a unit. The conflict of interests in recent years has not been in the interests of the industry as a whole.  Consumers require a good quality product at a reasonable price and, thankfully, more and more Irish people are prepared to demand the Irish product. Great strides have been made in this area in that producers are now prepared to accept that they must deal with these problems.  I must say, however, that consumers did not see a market reduction in the cost of tomatoes and other goods on the shelf during the summer when there was a glut on the market and Dutch tomatoes were imported.  Wholesalers and retailers have a major role to play in this area.  I have heard people on the ground say that wholesalers and retailers are not really concerned that it makes little difference to them whether their merchanise is imported or home grown, they still get their mark up.  I do not accept that argument.</P>
    <P>There must be changes if we are to have a viable industry.  Wholesalers and retailers will have to take a more patriotic approach and be seen to push the Irish product.  There is an obvious problem with the wholesale market.  Producers themselves lack information on prices and supplies required on the market and the wholesalers on their part lack information on product supply.  If this board, properly in operation, can deal with that area of major concern, in the long term it would be in everybody's interest.</P>
    <P>In my constituency in the area of horticulture the growers are the backbone of the industry.  They have to take the risk. Many of us here get up, presumably, at <Col N="755" /> about 7.30 a.m. but many of those people are up at 4.30 a.m. preparing the soil, planting and so on and at the end of the day they have to take their chances.  I have seen with regret the decline of the industry.  In the seventies when there was no problem with loans agencies like the ACC were throwing money at producers to enable them to expand.  I have seen in north County Dublin the sorry plight of families going down the tube, having to sell off their farmland to repay outstanding loans.  I hope the Bill before us can help those engaged in horticulture to establish and expand this industry, thereby giving them great potential for the future.</P>
    <P>People on the ground believe they have been let down badly by various Governments through the years.  Why was the potential of this industry not acknowledged years ago and acted upon?  Our Dutch, French and English counterparts saw this potential and acted upon it.  What will the board as envisaged in the Minister's Bill do for the industry?  I believe they will not deal with the fundamental problems.  The board will have very limited resources.  A figure of £250,000 by way of grant aid has been mentioned. Since that was announced a great selling job has been done on the Bill.  Here I acknowledge once again the role and commitment of the Minister but a selling job has been done on this by the Government, a great PR job.  It might be satisfactory in certain ways for the Minister and the interim board members but overall it has to prove itself.  Rather than getting into a major PR job the limited resources that have been made available should be targeted to areas of activity. If success in these areas could be seen on the ground it would then be possible to build up support and confidence.</P>
    <P>The structure of the board as proposed is a chairman plus ten members who will be appointed by the Minister.  This board should be democratically elected, obviously with representatives of the Minister on it.  However, under the proposed constitution, when the chips are down the people who are to be nominated <Col N="756" /> as provided for will not perhaps rock the boat.  I hope I am wrong in that regard but my experience with other such boards nominated in that way is that they tend not to rock the boat.  The members of this board should be nominated and elected by the people directly involved in the industry.  Ordinary people on the ground who have the day-to-day experience should have a place on the board because they can bring forward their expertise.  Consumers, growers and retailers should be represented.  Marketing is very important and I hope representatives of the marketing end will be on that board.  I believe they will but I hope they will not be over represented at the expense of some of the people on the lower rungs of the ladder.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the levy referred to in the Bill.  Are we going to have another rod licence experience here?  It seems the levy is to be open ended with increases on an annual basis.  The growers in particular are bound to be sceptical given the years of inaction by Government &mdash; or should I say Governments?  Some of my constituents have been involved have been badly hit by the recession out there and have loan repayments and other problems to face.  I hope we can bring confidence to them.</P>
    <P>We have talked about asking people to make contributions by way of levies etc. People will ask if they are to go on the experience of the past.  In 1982 we had 84 horticultural advisers throughout the country giving a free service to people in the agricultural sector.  In 1989 the number has been reduced to 24 and now people have to pay for that service.</P>
    <P>We must look in the overall at the amount of money required to get this board up and going.  That money is not being made available.  Have the Government any commitment to the great potential that exists?  The details in the Estimate announced yesterday show clearly the lack of concern on the part of Government for a farm advisory and development service.  A reduction from £29 million last year to £26.9 million this year will make it virtually impossible to provide a service to the agriculture <Col N="757" /> industry.  Given that sort of climate and reduction how can we get in to expand this industry and avail of the potential there when the people who were going to help them out are not available?  As one who was a member of Dublin County Committee of Agriculture before they were abolished by the previous Government I have seen at first hand that growers and farmers generally who could not afford to pay did not get the service.  The policy which brought about the reduction in staff has had a drastic effect on the industry as a whole but particularly on the horticultural industry.  The experienced people we need so much have left.  I am not trying to denigrate them but most of them are middle aged employees.  We have also lost the opportunity of getting in young people with the required enthusiasm and ability.  That is the net effect of a policy which unfortunately has not been to the benefit of agriculture generally or to the horticultural industry in particular. In relation to research, a similar experience pertains.  What needs to be done? As an interim measure the Government should acknowledge the potential for the industry.  The interim report states that 1,700 full time jobs and a net increase of 1,500 part time jobs will be provided in a five year programme.  When I look around the country I realise this projection vastly underestimates the potential of this industry.  The IDA should give this Irish industry, with great potential, the same type of support and encouragement they give to foreign companies to come to this country.  The money is there and more jobs would be created if the industry were given full assistance.</P>
    <P>We have seen foreign companies set up here with less potential and overnight many of them have left us high and dry. This industry has a great export potential. Only a few miles across the sea we have major outlets, such as Liverpool and Manchester.  There are great export opportunities in those markets not only for tomatoes but for nursery stock, potatoes, soft fruit, etc.  I hope the board will encourage the export of these products and can have the necessary marketing and research carried out.  We must <Col N="758" /> improve our marketing if the industry is to attain these goals.  However, it is essential that we remove some of the constraints in the industry, such as the absence of tax relief on nursery stock exports and the very high fuel costs to the greenhouse industry.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Dublin North there are new horizons because of the availability of natural gas.  I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the work done by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Kirk, and the Government in taking the decision to bring natural gas into north County Dublin.  The conversion grants which commenced on 1 August are welcome but they do not go far enough.  Almost three months later there are still some growers awaiting the approval of their grant applications. There was and still is great enthusiasm from the growers.  Teagasc explained the position to the growers and they put forward proposals which were subsequently approved by Teagasc but, unfortunately, they are still awaiting the approval of the Department.  Perhaps this matter has been attended to in recent weeks but if it has not I know he will take it on board and try to speed up the process.  Growers have now ordered alternative burners and are awaiting payment.  By now many growers have had to buy and sow seed. They want to get on with the job and if there is any undue delay I hope it can be sorted out by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When it comes to the cost of natural gas, the gas company should look at the industry as a whole rather <Col N="759" /> than at individual growers.  Some of our major industries get cheaper rates, and rightly so, and the growers in the horticulture industry, particularly those in north County Dublin, should be given the same consideration.  This would help them to reduce costs and would enable them to become more competitive.</P>
      <P>Horticulture is the poor relation of agriculture, and this fact has been acknowledged.  Other sectors of agriculture, such as dairy farmers, have credit control systems but there are no comparable arrangements for those involved in horticulture.  This matter should be looked at by the board and by the Government.  I would like to see the board expanding key commodities with an organised and disciplined approach to marketing.  In this regard it may be necessary to operate incentive schemes for producers.  It is also important that the board would be able to enforce standards of grading and presentation.</P>
      <P>The kernel of the Bill is commitment to get out and do something for the industry and to give it the type of finance which is required.  That is vitally important.  I do not think it is envisaged by the board that that type of money will be forthcoming. The growers will make a contribution provided they see the commitment by the Government but unfortunately no such commitment has been given.  At this stage we require a major injection of finance for this industry.  I hope the board will put the horticulture industry on a proper footing that will give them an opportunity to be acknowledged as a sector within agriculture who are prepared to deliver jobs.</P>
      <P>The Bill has certain weakness but I hope that the Minister will take on board some of the points made in our deliberations and that the Bill will be greatly strengthened on Committee Stage.  There may be greater possibilities for Government funding.  Consumers, growers and retailers can make horticulture a vital industry which will provide job opportunities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this most important Bill.  For many years we have been hearing that something should be done about the development of the horticultural industry.  In 1987 when the previous Government came into office the Taoiseach saw fit to appoint a Minister with special responsibility for horticulture. The re-appointment of Deputy Kirk emphasises the importance the Government place on horticulture and its role in job creation, import substitution and export expansion.  There can be no doubt that to achieve the desired aims, especially in the context of the Single European Market, the foundations of the industry must be extremely strong.</P>
      <P>The hallmark of this Government, as of the previous Government, is belief in co-operation, as has been evident in the success of the agreement with the social partners.  The Government believe that the development of the horticultural industry can be achieved only if it is in the hands of a body with specific overall responsibility, but at the same time it is emphasised that the board must work with other Government agencies such as Teagasc, CTT, the IDA, SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Bord Glas must be a strong controlling body co-operating with these agencies to ensure the achievement of the aims set out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister, his staff and the interim board who have been operating since April, 1987, on not panicking and rushing to produce a slapdash plan.  They thoroughly investigated the various sectors of the horticultural industry to identify the weaknesses and decide on the best means of improvement.  We see the result in the five-year development plan which states what can realistically be achieved and the methods which must be followed.  Co-operation between the producers, the marketing sector and the State bodies is essential.  Success can lead to the creation of between 1,700 and 2,000 jobs, import substitution to the value of £31 million and increased exports to the value of £45 million.  It is imperative that the plan should succeed and it <Col N="761" /> is incumbent on all involved to follow the guidelines laid down by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Those of us who live in rural constituencies are aware of the difficulties resulting from milk quotas, beef prices and cereal problems.  We recognise the growing need for alternative land use. Unless we are successful in establishing such alternative enterprises the denuding of the countryside will continue and the fabric of the rural community will be destroyed.  An increasing number of people have been leaving rural areas. Small farmers are being brought out and ranchers are taking over.  This is a development which is not welcomed by the Government or by anybody who is interested in the general well-being of the country.  The plan has identified different sectors in the agricultural field which are targeted for growth such as field vegetables, fruit, hardy nursery stores, mushrooms, potatoes, processed vegetables and protected crops.</P>
    <P>Education is vital if we are to achieve the desired goals and section 9 ensures that the board will have a say in this area. It is sad that only one regional college, that at Tralee, provides a horticultural course.  Some neighbours of mine have attended and it has proved to be an excellent course.  Some of them have started growing unusual vegetables and are succeeding in making a living from it.  If such courses were available in other colleges it would help many people who may not know about the course in Tralee or may not be able to afford to go there.  It is important that education in this area should begin at an early age.  The school I attended provided a very interesting course in agricultural science.  Although I was born and reared on a farm I do not own one now, but nevertheless the course was of great benefit.  Horticulture should be given greater emphasis in the secondary school curriculum.</P>
    <P>The problem with growing potatoes is that people tend to produce without taking the market into account.  In many cases over production has caused prices to collapse and education in this area &mdash; as well as in the technical end &mdash; is very <Col N="762" /> important because if people are not educated on the financial end the likelihood is that the business will be a failure.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the fact that we cannot supply our own market.  I remember a former Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, the then Deputy Hegarty, trying valiantly in the 1982-87 period to organise the potato industry but his efforts did not succeed on a country-wide scale.  However, I am happy that in my area of east Cork results have been quite good and that producers, shopkeepers and supermarkets are co-operating to make the potato industry a success.  Another reason for success in the east Cork area is that Imokilly Co-operative have helped to set up a producers' group there.  It would be worthwhile for people around the country to look at this area and to follow suit.</P>
    <P>One of the main complaints I get from potato growers is the lack of adequate temperature controlled stores.  If the storage facility was increased the necessity for imports would not be as great as it is at present, especially in the April-June period when the quality of our own crop deteriorates.  In order to increase the storage facilities, a higher level of grant-aid must be made available.  The problems that potato growers come up against is that there are great prices one year and that the bottom falls out of the market the next.  In that situation, it is very hard for a grower to put himself deep into debt not knowing what will happen the following year.  For example, the year 1987-88 was very good and the amount of imported potatoes was down considerably but, this year, because of the weather being too dry early on, the potato market is not as good as it was in the previous two years.  In the long run, if the grant aid was provided to have proper storage the market, from the point of view of the suppliers and the purchaser, could be levelled out.  I do not think that anybody would disagree with the fact that the quality of Irish potatoes is much superior to those imported from any other part of the world.</P>
    <P>We also hear the hardy annual complaint regarding the marketing of <Col N="763" /> potatoes and many other vegetables.  If we compare the presentation of foreign vegetables to our own, there is cause for concern.  People selling vegetables should realise that it is necessary to grade them properly and to have them cleaned.  Good presentation catches the eye and if a product is not properly presented people will move on to another product.</P>
    <P>Since the early sixties, east Cork has been the centre of production of vegetables, especially peas.  However, they also produce beans, cauliflower, celery, sprouts, parsnips, carrots, swedes and cabbage.  This concentration was due in the main to the setting up of East Cork Foods in the early sixties.  They set up a plant in Midleton and another in Mallow and it was a profitable operation.  I am baffled as to why the Sugar Company decided to off-load it.  When East Cork Foods closed in the mid-eighties the factory was taken over by Findus which lasted for about a year.  It was then taken over by Fresh Bake and they continued the operation of vegetable growing even though the name of the company changed.  Recently Fresh Bake were bought by Campbells &mdash; one of the biggest food companies in the world.  I know that the company are satisfied with the quality of vegetables grown in east Cork. They are happy to be making a profit and indeed a company like that would not continue operating if they were not in a viable position.  Without these factories, east Cork farmers and workers would be much the poorer.  At present, 110 people are employed on a full time basis in the factories and over 100 people are employed seasonally.  This year, over 4,000 acres of vegetables were grown on contract.  Over 3,000 contained peas and there was a smaller acreage devoted to beans, sprouts cauliflower, carrots, etc.  I am well aware that the return to the farmers on these products was quite substantial. It has been a great boon to east Cork, without it many farmers would be much poorer.</P>
    <P>This year, on account of the very dry conditions in July, some peas ripened too fast and were not harvestable.  Normally <Col N="764" /> in such circumstances one would receive compensation for the seed to ensure that people would not lose out.  This year an agreement was reached between the company and Imokilty Co-operative who harvested the unusable peas and processed them for feed purposes.  This enabled farmers who had suffered as a result of the drought conditions to gain some profit from their produce.  That co-operation between the Irish Farmers Association, the co-operative and Campbells is a good example of that necessary to ensure the success of the industry.  It is also interesting to note that Campbells plan to invest further in the plants.  It is encouraging to see one of the giants in the food processing industry having two plants here.</P>
    <P>The hardy nursery stock sector has excellent growth potential.  A number of my neighbours have entered this sector over the past couple of years.  I know also that the growth of their businesses has been nothing short of phenomenal.  Not alone are they trading on the home market but they are also exporting.  They tell me they cannot produce sufficient to meet the demand obtaining.  I am glad to note that Coras Tráchtála and the IDA are taking the necessary steps to develop a co-ordinated, developing approach to export markets which, bearing in mind our natural resources and climate, constitutes enormous growth potential.</P>
    <P>Another sector being taped in east Cork is the fresh flower market.  Anybody who buys fresh flowers will be aware that they cost a considerable amount.  There is a great demand for fresh flowers. Indeed it is a sector in which more people should be encouraged to engage.  Daffodils always have been regarded as pretty flowers but, until recently, very few people regarded them as constituting a potential cash crop.  In Conna in east Cork a lady had the idea of exporting them and did so.  Also in Cobh a couple of acres of daffodils were grown last year and this year.  This venture too, proved successful.  This merely illustrates that when one looks around one discovers there are many opportunities for creating <Col N="765" /> jobs and making a good livelihood at the same time.</P>
    <P>I have read with interest many previous contributions, among which I found that of Deputy Deasy enormously interesting, demonstrating that he is very much aware of the problems confronting the horticultural industry and that he appreciates the Minister's overall approach.  From a reading of his remarks it became evident that he has got to the nub of the problem, having been a Minister formerly.  Indeed it might be no harm if some other Deputies who contributed would talk to him about the problems obtaining and the remedial action that should be taken.  It was clear from a reading of some contributions that their strategy lagged far behind the Tallaght Strategy.  Unfortunately Deputy Sheehan is not in the House; I am sure he will hear me on the monitor. He said that the Midleton factory had closed.  I should point out that the Midleton factory was never closed; neither was the Mallow one.  Deputy Sheehan would appear to suggest from his many comments that he remained in the dark like the mushrooms of west Cork about which he lamented.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents a revival of the horticultural industry.  I would urge all those engaged in that industry to co-operate with the Minister in his efforts because, only by doing so, will we be able to advance.  I should like to compliment the Minister on the work he has done and wish him success in future years.</P>

      <P>The provisions of this Bill seek to establish a body with a particular brief to develop horticulture on a market-led horticultural co-operative <Col N="766" /> basis.  I agree that a specific, organised project approach has a better chance of success than a generalised nondescript one.  However, it cannot be assumed that this automatically demands the establishment of an independent statutory body for that purpose.  The Bill, as presented, depicts the board largely as an independent body.  Among its functions there has been no emphasis laid on the necessity to liaise with co-operatives and other bodies in the private sector in pursuance of their objectives.  I submit that the main impetus for the production and marketing of horticultural produce must come from the private sector with guidance from the relevant State agencies. The success or otherwise of the board will derive from their capacity to liaise and work with the private sector.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill appear to attach too much importance to import substitution on the home market.  The potential gain here is marginal.  I stand to be corrected but I understand that our import bill in this area last year amounted to something like £31 million.  Reliance on the home market will stifle progress on volume, quality, storage, processing facilities and continuity of supply.  Also we will be perpetually vulnerable to seasonal imports of commonplace produce, such as tomatoes, carrots, cabbage and so on, resulting in a consequent difficulty in regaining market share when home produce comes on-stream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contend that the primary focus be on export markets, scrutinising them in order to ascertain their requirements.  If we become a horticultural produce exporting nation there will then be a resultant pick-up on the home market.  If we are to compete with the Dutch and others who have vast experience in this area we must improve our native produce which would automatically lead to import substitution.  But we cannot first concentrate on import substitution and then hope to export.  We must examine the European markets.  Only then will we be able to produce the type of quality product, ensuring that, say, onions from Spain and carrots from Cyprus or wherever will be substituted on the home <Col N="767" /> market.  We must remember that our consumer will buy the quality, cheaper product.</P>
    <P>The Minister is being given enormous powers under the provisions of this Bill, even to the extent of levying producers in order to meet the costs of this new layer of bureaucracy.  I would like to commend the interim Bord Glas for the study they made into the Irish agricultural industry. One of the main objectives of the interim board was to assess and improve the marketing of potatoes.  Potato production has deteriorated with the result that quality certified seed potatotes are particularly unavailable at present.  The board have brought no order into the marketing of potatoes, which was their prime function so far as I am concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government may have it in hands but it leaves much to be desired at present.  For example, why should we aim to increase the output of tomatoes, unless for export, when existing glasshouse growers of tomatoes are on the verge of bankruptcy?  They cannot complete with imported tomatoes due to our very high energy, transport and communication costs.  Despite changing over to a solid fuel system two tomato growers in my constituency are on the verge of collapse because of competition.</P>
      <P>We should be net exporters of seed potatoes to Europe because of the freedom of our soil from root eel worm and foilage blight.  No Department or State agency will handle this promotion.  What is needed is support for private companies to import foundation seed stock for propagation here so that the resultant seed can be exported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mushroom production is a prime example of where private companies and co-ops are coming together to set farmers up with houses or tunnels so that they can export their produce.  The export value of mushrooms increased from £2.7 million <Col N="768" /> in 1979 to, I understand, about £18 million in 1988 and this has increased further for 1989.  I cannot understand why we need An Bord Glas to promote our thriving mushroom industry.  What we need is to identify the market and set up a support system for companies and individuals so that they can produce a quality produce to meet the market needs.  Support is needed to help companies go out and find the markets and CTT have a major role in this regard.  Are we proposing in this Bill to give An Bord Glas similar functions to those of CTT?  This is a duplication of effort and cost.  I believe CTT could identify the market niches and promote along with Teagasc the production of produce to meet these market needs.  This Bill gives An Bord Glas the total promotional aspects of horticulture, using staff redeployed from other agencies.  That is my understanding of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not leave the staff in these agencies so that they can carry out this function?  CTT have the expertise in this area and we should allow them to embrace the whole horticultural area even if it means the employment of agricultural marketing personnel.  Agencies such as SFADCo and the IDA can provide the finance needed by companies setting up facilities and plant to get produce ready for the export market. Why should we include another body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The experience of Kerry Tree Technology is a prime example of the support given by the State to a company to produce a product for which there was a market in America.  A market for fresh flowers was identified in the US and the company set about producing daffodils. They exported the flowers to America and the bulbs to England.  The National Development Corporation &mdash; vehemently opposed by the Government when they came into being &mdash; have joined with this company in a joint venture to produce these flowers to meet the demand in the US market.  SFADCo are grant aiding facilities for the cleaning and packaging <Col N="769" /> of these flowers.  This is the way horticultural exports can be expanded.  This expansion is being achieved without An Bord Glas but with the help of existing State agencies.  Why do we need another Stage agency in this area?</P>
    <P>Christmas trees, decorative natural foliage and nursery stock have excellent export and employment potential.  We should encourage venture capital agencies to engage in joint enterprises with companies and individuals with worthwhile propositions.  Teagasc should be given the resources and directives necessary to raise their horticultural activity at research and advisory level to set quality standards and encourage the concept of orderly marketing and the setting up of producer co-ops and groups.</P>
    <P>The production of any product has two aspects &mdash; production and marketing. The product must be to a standard suitable for export and produced at an economic cost.  Marketing is vital to sell these products.  The finance which will go into the setting up and funding of An Bord Glas should be invested in marketing and either given to CTT or Teagasc so that they can go out and identify niches in the markets in Europe and fund the marketing of our horticultural produce.  They could easily do this without&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can reply to my question later on.  I should like to refer to organic farming and its potential contribution to our tourist industry. Organic farming is increasing in popularity because of consumer demand and the efforts of many farmers and scientists who are concerned about the effects of chemicals on the soil.  Continued research and development as well as further consumer pressure will eventually make <Col N="770" /> organic produce more widely available. In simple terms, organic farming is the production of crops without the use of synthetic chemical fertilisers, pesticides and fungicides and the raising of stock without artificial growth promoters either as implants or in feed.  If the food is to be subsequently processed no synthetic additives or preservatives can be added at any time.  Because of the emphasis being placed on a clean environment, wholesome food and so on, Ireland could cash in on its reputation for wholesome food on the world tourist market.  We should be emphasising more and more the quality of our air and the wholesomeness of our food.  We should try to market this on the world tourist market in order to encourage people to come here.  Ireland has great potential in this area.</P>
      <P>It is a function of our educational system to educate young farmers, through Macra, ACOT, Teagasc and our higher education institutes, about the value of producing food which is organically grown and the dangers of destroying our food industry, be it the horticulture or meat industry, by the use of chemicals. We should look very closely at this area. There should also be a public education programme on the value of vegetarian diets.  I was fortunate to come across the report of the First International Congress on Vegetarian Nutrition which was held in Washington on 16 March 1987.  Nearly 400 registrants heard evidence from around the world of the potential health benefits of a well planned vegetarian diet. They emphasised the benefits of a vegetarian diet in endurance performance. They found there was a positive link between a vegetarian diet and the control of cancer, blood pressure and heart disease. The statistics for heart disease in this country, as far as I know, show that one out of every two deaths is from a cardiac related disease.  If people were encouraged to concentrate on a vegetarian diet, I am sure we could bring down our death rate, especially deaths as a result of cardiac related illnesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We demand a programme of public <Col N="771" /> education on this subject.  The Department of Health should focus on this.  The health education programme in both our primary and second level schools should focus on it also.  It would be of major benefit to preventive medicine.  Last night we had a discussion on the Health Supplementary Estimate and it was suggested that more money should go into preventive rather than curative health care.  This is an area we could concentrate on.</P>
    <P>While I am not in favour of this Bill, I do not think there is any need for it, it will go on the Statute Book as the Government have a majority in the House.  I congratulate the Minister on his hard work since coming to office, in promoting the horticultural industry.  I mean that sincerely.  However, I suggest that the Minister takes the Bill back to the drawing board and looks at its place and mode of operation in developing horticulture. We have a &ldquo;Green&rdquo; image, which we should work on and horticulture must be made one of our prime economic growth areas.  However, I fail to see how this can be achieved by the present Bill.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to re-examine this Bill and perhaps through discussions with the Opposition spokespersons he could come up with a different formula.  There is a vast potential in horticulture but I am not convinced that setting up Bord Glas is the solution for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward a Bill to establish Bord Glas as an independent statutory body.  The Bill is needed.  However, I am a bit disappointed by some of the negative criticisms we have heard from the far side of the House.  I make an exception of Deputy Deenihan's remarks, because he was certainly constructive in what he had to say.  I agree with what he had to say on exports, because as an agricultural country we should be a leading exporter <Col N="772" /> of all agricultural produce.  It is regrettable and disgraceful that there is so much criticism at a time when we are discussing the Bill.  The Minister's predictions have been criticised.  I think the Minister has given the facts and figures as to where he sees job creation possibilities and where he sees opportunities for output of agricultural produce, particularly in fruit and vegetables.</P>
      <P>I will now refer to an article in today's <i>Irish Press</i> which has the headline &ldquo;Hothouse reception for Bord Glas Bill&rdquo;. Referring to the Minister, it states:</P>
      <P>He predicted export expansion of £58 million and the creation of 1,750 full-time and 1,500 part-time jobs in the industry.</P>
      <P>As one reads on one finds that the Minister is attacked by all the people interviewed. It further states: &ldquo;Members of the horticulture industry now predict that the dispute will escalate to the same level as the rod licence protest&rdquo; and towards the end of the article a person is quoted as saying that &ldquo;This is going to be like the rod-licence dispute, only bigger.&rdquo;  This is negative and exaggerated comment on what will happen as a result of the Bill when in fact we are discussing the setting up of Bord Glas as an independent statutory body.  One of the people interviewed was most concerned about the levy. However, for the record I would like to read from the section dealing with the levy.  Section 12 (2) states:</P>
      <P>Where a levy is payable it shall be paid by the seller of the horticultural produce concerned.</P>
      <P>(3) Levy shall be paid to the Board at such time or times and in such manner as may be prescribed.</P>
      <P>(4) The rate of levy in each year shall be such rate as may be prescribed with the consent of the Minister for Finance; and different rates may be prescribed under this subsection in respect of different classes of persons liable to pay levy.</P>
      <P>(5) the Minister may make regulations ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> (a) for excepting from the obligation to pay levy any specified class or classes of person, defined in such manner and by reference to such matters as the Minister considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>These are very important points but many speakers did not refer to them when they were attacking the concept of a levy. However I must say in fairness that I heard some speakers say they had no objection to people in the industry contributing to the horticultural industry. However there was a great deal of exaggerated comment on the levy.</P>
    <P>In the same newspaper article one of those interviewed said &ldquo;I am very concerned about political appointments&rdquo;. There is nothing unusual about political appointments to any board.  The Minister will appoint ten members to Bord Glas. This is covered in the Schedule to the Bill.  Section 7 states:</P>
    <P>(a) 5 one of whom shall be an officer of the Minister shall be persons engaged in, or having knowledge or experience .... of, or in relation to, horticulture and</P>
    <P>(b) 5 shall be persons chosen by the Minister after consultation with such persons as he considers appropriate who are engaged in, or are representative of those engaged in, horticulture or the promotion or development of the horticultural industry.</P>
    <P>There has been exaggerated negative comment on the setting up of the board. The Minister is accused of being optimistic on the future of the horticulture industry.  I urge the Minister, if he has not already considered it, to reply to this article in the <i>Irish Press,</i> to give his point of view and the views of those who are in favour of developing the horticultural industry through Bord Glas.</P>
    <P>The monitoring committee on food imports in the Department compiled a report six years ago in which they referred to the problems in the fresh fruit and vegetable market.  They found that it was difficult to assess this area because of the fact that some fruit and vegetables <Col N="774" /> produced for the fresh market are imported but may subsequently be processed and that the question of importing, processing and indeed in many cases further processing &mdash; for example where fruit pulp is made into jam &mdash; causes difficulty in showing the actual production and trade for each fruit and vegetable. The climatic factors also have to be considered.  In that regard it is welcome that we have some facts and figures of various imports and also the potential for exports.  In that regard the IDA have carried out some investigation as to where they could be of assistance.  In the IDA report of 1984 they identified their concern about the value of imports.  They gave a figure of £80 million in 1982, and that figure was increasing dramatically. They identified the main products involved as potatoes, onions, carrots, cauliflower and tomatoes.</P>
    <P>In the fresh fruit area there are certain tropical fruits which we cannot do much about, such as bananas and citrus fruits, but of the fruits grown in Ireland, the IDA identified very clearly that apple imports were increasing at a very serious rate.  Their report showed that in 1978 29,500 tonnes of apples were imported while in 1982 the figure had increased to 42,500 tonnes.  As a result, the IDA tried to identify the way they could help and, after consultation with the Department of Agriculture and Food, ACOT and AFT, as they were called at the time, they decided on grant assistance for companies engaged in the grading, storage and packing fresh fruit and vegetables on a selective basis.  As the IDA will admit, that was not a success.  That and other reasons gave rise to the need for a board such as An Bord Glas and that is why we should be looking at this matter in a positive way.</P>
    <P>In 1984 the IDA helped to establish pilot centres in Dublin, Waterford, Cork and Galway to take vegetables from Irish producers.  Quite frankly, that was not a success and in most cases the companies were taken over, some were amalgamated and some were sold.  There was a need for the IDA to consider another way to help and they are now working <Col N="775" /> with other bodies and will work with An Bord Glas when this Bill is passed &mdash; to help individual producer groups or people dealing with the added value of our fruit and vegetables.  I hope, when the Minister replies, he will give some indication what is available in the line of FEOGA grants and other EC assistance for such producer groups.  The IDA have told me that one of the problems of these groups is that, for example, when they produce carrots alone, supermarkets are not interested.  They are more interested in suppliers who produce a variety of primary vegetables.  However, I am sure all these areas will be considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's opening remarks he talked like the Minister for Health.  He said he is not an expert on diet but he talked about the link between eating fruit and vegetables and the role they play in reducing cholesterol and coronary disease. It is important that he mentioned that because fruit and vegetables, and indeed potatoes, have always had a good health image.  Their beneficial effects have always been pointed out in scientific and trade journals and in the press.  In the past we have heard a lot about vitamins, especially vitamin C, and minerals, but more recently attention has been focused on the possible beneficial effects of fruit, vegetables and potato consumption in relation to coronary and heart disease, certain cancers, diabetes and other so-called diseases of affluence.  This is an area that, I am sure, An Bord Glas will be promoting.  The consumer is always looking for fresh food, and fruit and vegetables fulfil this image.</P>
    <P>I have been told that the National Food Centre are carrying out research into the dietary fibre content and vitamin retention of food during storage.  All the experts seem to be saying that there should be increased consumption of these foods in the Irish diet, and indeed in the North European diet, with special emphasis on uncooked items such as shredded carrots, coleslaw and so on.  A great effort has always been made to encourage children to eat more fruit and <Col N="776" /> vegetables.  The Minister was quite right to refer to those areas in his opening remarks.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the role of the supermarkets.  We are told that the supermarket groups sell 60 per cent of all fruit and vegetables sold.  They have a role to play in their dealing with Irish producer groups and in promoting Irish goods in their stores.  I was very interested in a survey carried out by the Quinnsworth group and published three years ago. They succeeded in reducing &mdash; from 29 per cent to 24 per cent admittedly a small reduction of 5 per cent &mdash; the purchase of imported primary vegetables.  While there was a significant reduction in the amount of imported goods purchased, such as tomatoes and cauliflower and, to a lesser extent, potatoes, there was very little reduction in the sale of carrots and onions.  The Minister has referred to those two areas in his speech and they need much more attention.</P>
    <P>One sector that was looked at by the Quinnsworth group was cooking apples. There was no improvement in that area except that a lot of the imports come from Northern Ireland.  The supermarkets should play a greater role in promoting Irish goods.  I welcome the Minister's comments on the glasshouse industry, for which he made capital grants available under the farm improvement scheme last July.  Grants are needed for this industry which, as many Deputies have said, uses natural gas as a source of energy.</P>
    <P>One of the most profitable industries for farmers in the west to get involved in is the mushroom industry.  There are a few comments I would like to make on this industry.  Problems have been encountered with planning permission, and different local authorities seem to be divided on the question whether mushroom tunnels are temporary or permanent structures.  Planning fees can vary accordingly.  Once that matter has been clarified, smallholders show a great interest in this industry.  Of course they need money to be able to get involved in the industry but the amount of land required is small.  We used to say that <Col N="777" />&ldquo;small is beautiful&rdquo;; big is also beautiful, but certainly the growing of mushrooms can be done quite efficiently by smallholders, even though it does require a lot of time and energy.  I also wish to pay tribute to the producer groups who have organised themselves and who supply compost and provide a collection service.</P>
    <P>In relation to the export of mushrooms, transport is needed and I ask the Minister to examine the role which regional airports could play in this regard.  Recently the Minister visited Claremorris to see what is described as a mushroom village. Last year he opened a mushroom store in Strokestown, County Roscommon. Many smallholders in my own constituency of Galway are supplying both of those undertakings.</P>
    <P>Hardy nursery stock has come in for particular attention, with reference being made to what can be done along the sides of roadways, parks, and buildings. Woodland Investments in Tuam are beginning to expand and we hope they will create further jobs.  Let me digress for a moment and speak about the town of Tuam.  We had hoped that this would be a food centre for the west.  I still have hopes that it will be.  It was always regarded as a food centre when it had a sugar beet factory.  Unfortunately, that factory closed with the loss of 800 jobs. If replacement jobs are secured for the large number of unemployed there, I hope they will be in the food sector. Already we have the Galway Bay Cheese Company and Woodland Investments, and I hope that very shortly another food giant, namely, the Goodman Group, will decide to locate in Tuam.  If they are not going to locate in Tuam I hope they will say so.  The Sugar Company have always had a good involvement there and I know they would be willing to invest in Tuam if the Goodman Group decide not to come to the town.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have spoken about alternative farming.  I wonder however if they have thought out what alternative farming is all about.  To my mind, horticulture falls within that category.  It may not be as exotic as some of the other industries mentioned, but when it comes <Col N="778" /> to a smallholder making a living for himself and his family the idea of getting involved in horticulture merits attention.</P>
    <P>The daffodil and flower industry has also been referred to.  We are all used now to daffodil days and rose weeks organised as fund raising events for very deserving causes while we also have witnessed the setting up of new businesses and the opening of shops selling flowers. I have no doubt that An Bord Glas will pay particular attention to the development of this industry.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me wish the Minister well.  I hope he will not be too disappointed by some of the very negative criticisms made.  I hope when he comes to appointing the board, which is a source of much controversy, he will be able to get people with a knowledge of agriculture and who will be committed to the development of the horticultural industry. I wish him and the Government well when it comes to the setting up of An Bord Glas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to make a contribution on this Bill.  I would also like to congratulate the Minister of State on his reappointment. He is one of the few men on that side of the House I have some regard for.  I consider him to be hard working and dedicated to the portfolio he holds. However on this occasion I feel he is wasting his own and our time in setting up this board.  I would much prefer to see a man of his ability promoting the products we are developing here in the world market.  He should be the front runner and not be involved in the setting up of a board.  I am not clear what the role of this board will be and what the cost will be at the end of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record of boards and semi-State bodies since the foundation of the State is not great to say the least.  Many of them have outlived their usefulness while others should have been wound up many years ago.  It was understandable in the early days of this State that boards be set up to enable people with expertise to seek out markets for us.  Twenty-five to 30 years ago the world was a big place but <Col N="779" /> now it is a small place.  People setting up businesses today have no difficulty now in travelling to the Continent or Britain to seek out markets.  Many young men and women now do this constantly and do not seek State help.  These people should be given a free hand and not stifled through the setting up of a board which obviously will take over the work that they are now prepared to do.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose behind the setting up of the board?  Is it intended that they will be involved in marketing?  Let me cite one example of a very successful board, which is now begining to creak and that is An Bord Bainne.  Tony O'Reilly, Joe McGough and Brian Joyce were outstanding chief executives of that board.  They certainly did excellent work in the dairy industry, but many committed members of that board are beginning to feel that they should be out doing the work that this board is supposed to be doing, and quite a number have left. We should take a lesson from that, one of the successful ones.  Against that we have all the dismal failures, for example CIE which has been a millstone around the neck of the taxpayer.  If we were depending on CIE to get our young people back home to rural Ireland to pick the mushrooms they would seldom get home with the costs CIE charge if it were not for the fact that private enterprise took over the work they were supposed to be doing.</P>
    <P>I see that there are compulsory levies. Why are they compulsory if this is going to be such a great board?  If it is going to be such a success people will be queuing up to get involved.  The Minister should give them a free hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Other boards have levies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course they have, because it is the only way they can be financed.  The point I am making is that if somebody is successful people will be queuing up to get involved and it should not be necessary to have compulsion. After all we had a sad episode in the last two years because of compulsion in <Col N="780" /> relation to rod licences in the fishing industry which caused a lot of upheaval. That is for another Minister, and I hope he will have some success in that area.</P>
      <P>The level of the levy is not stated.  The Minister knows as well as I do, coming from Louth, that when one got one's milk statement at the end of the month the statement was grand with gallons of milk at £1 per gallon but when one looked at the debit side and added up Bord Bainne levies, Government levies, disease eradication levies, there was nothing left at the end of the day for the small farmer, after all his hard work.</P>
      <P>Is this what is going to happen here in the industries that are growing and are so successful at present?  Are we going to stifle them with this board?  Who will the members be?  Will they have expertise or will they be just some friends of the Minister, the Taoiseach or the Government? This is not good enough.  I have regard for the Minister but I think he is making a bad decision here this week, particularly in the light of what has happened here in relation to boards and semi-State bodies.</P>
      <P>Teagasc has a role in the development of horticulture here; but with a 7 per cent cut in funding for Teagasc how are the people in Teagasc to get out to the people who are so anxious to get involved in setting up what is now called, to use the in phrase, alternative farming enterprise. In my day, which is not that long ago, we always called it a sideline.  A good farmer always had a sideline.  In my county and constituency dairying would be the backbone of the industry, but people did not depend on milk and cows, they had poultry, turkeys for Christmas, pigs.  They were industrious and grew their own potatoes.  In this way useful income was made.  The idea is there whether one calls it a sideline or an alternative farming enterprise.  It is fine if people want to be with it and use modern phrases, but we called it a sideline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The big sideline now in my county is mushroom growing, and it is a major success.  I was delighted last Monday week to be present at a sod turning ceremony in Foxfield Mushrooms.  I have not <Col N="781" /> heard any mention here of Foxfield Mushrooms in County Cavan.  I have heard of Monaghan Mushrooms and I congratulate them on their marvellous success.  Foxfield Mushrooms are an even bigger success.  Five young brothers from a small farming background, the eldest not more than 35 years of age, some playing football for Cavan yet, have set up a multi-million pound enterprise in the growing of mushrooms.  These young men tell me that the market is developing rapidly.  I said to them on Monday week that with the rate of expansion in that county alone it was possible that the market would be flooded.  They told me that with the type of product they can produce in Cavan and the surrounding counties there is an unlimited market.  I asked them about the farmers in England and Holland who could surely compete; but they have a different approach to the growing of mushrooms.  They have gone in for the big commercial enterprise of growing 100 tunnels at a time.  A bus comes in the morning with pickers.  On Monday morning after the weekend hangover they will not have all their pickers in.  A tunnel will not be picked that day, and suddenly the quality disimproves and that moves right down the road to all of the other tunnels.  The small three to five tunnel enterprise being set up in the north east, in the Cavan, Leitrim, Louth and Monaghan areas is the ideal concept of mushroom growing, with personal family interest in getting a quality product.  Whether it is Friday, Saturday, Sunday or even Christmas Day in some cases, if the mushrooms have to be picked they will be picked, and one has a quality product.  I wish to publicly congratulate Foxfield Mushrooms on their initiative and on the hope they have given to many small farmers in the region who now have the possibility of getting a meaningful income from their small holdings since the milk quotas has deprived them of milk production.  Milk production was the last line of hope for small farmers and it was felt that if that went there was nothing left, since poultry and turkey production and the growing of vegetables had disappeared and had <Col N="782" /> been taken over by the larger growers. The mushroom industry is the lifeline we needed, the last hope for people in this area.  There are alternatives that I am sure they can get involved in; but they are doing a superb job with a family enterprise to ensure a quality product is coming on the market.</P>
    <P>What is necessary is ongoing advice. When people have the initiative to take off their coats, roll up their sleeves and make an investment of nothing less than £35,000 to set up a three tunnel enterprise &mdash; and this is a large sum of money for a small farmer with a young family &mdash; surely the least the State could do is provide them with the advice.  I am subject to correction, but I believe there is not a single horticultural instructor in Cavan or Monaghan at present.  When I was a member of Cavan County Committee of Agriculture 15 years ago, a young fellow starting out in farming, we had a horticultural instructor in Cavan and that man was extremely busy advising people around the county on potato production and the growing of various crops such as oats and barley to feed to their cattle.  The county committees of agriculture were abolished.  Then we had ACOT and we still managed to provide a horticultural instructor.  ACOT is gone and now we have this grand board Teagasc; and it is being slowly stifled.  It will be dead in 12 months at the rate of cutback we see.  It is impossible for instructors to get out.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from horticulture which we are discussing here today, unless a farmer is prepared to pay there is no agricultural instructor available to him. In a county that is so intent on surviving and on ensuring that the people stay on the small farms the least we are owed is a horticultural instructor, and I make no apology for demanding that this instructor be fully paid for by the Government. Apart from the mushroom growing which is so successful there is vegetable growing, strawberries and raspberries etc.  In the neighbouring county of Leitrim there is a very successful jam factory that could expand and develop, and we would be only too glad to provide the fruits and vegetables if we had the advice that is <Col N="783" /> necessary to instruct young farmers and others in the growing of these crops.</P>
    <P>In relation to private enterprises, Monaghan Poultry Products is an outstanding example of a private enterprise.  The poultry industry in Counties Cavan and Monaghan has expanded enormously over a number of years, despite the recent setback by the scare in England which did not effect us too seriously.  I believe we have overcome that now.  To give an indication of the extent of the development there now, farmers are erecting turkey houses which hold 20,000 turkeys at a time.  That is a major development.  Obviously there is a market there, otherwise people would not be encouraged to go into this.  In one instance I am talking about a commitment from the farmer of not less than £30,000 cash down.  That sort of enterprise must be recognised, appreciated and supported.  I presume poultry production is within the ambit of this Minister here.</P>
    <P>The poultry and horticultural instructors should be part of the development of that region.  Whatever happens in the rest of the country, the people in the north-east and in the south are well able to look after themselves.  They have a different climate and a great deal going for them.  I make no apologies for stating that since I became a Member of this House I have been campaigning for the appointment of a horticulture instructor and a poultry instructor.  If the Minister does this it will show he has the interests of those people at heart.  They are trying hard to survive in very difficult conditions.</P>
    <P>The old county committees of agriculture were much maligned and described as nothing more than a talking shop.  Nothing is further from the truth. The people on those committees knew the problems facing the farmers and brought them to their chief agricultural officer who in turn could deal with them or send them immediately to the Minister in the hope of getting some action.  In some cases he did but in others, unfortunately, he did not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> Let me refer to the transport of this quality product from the farms to the processing units set up by Kiernan Brothers in Foxfield, Monaghan Mushrooms or Monaghan Poultry Products.  The product is of high quality leaving the tunnels but because of the friction while being transported over the by-roads of County Cavan to the processing plants it is damaged when it arrives and is downgraded. That is not good enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate provides more money for roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Only 11 per cent so that we will develop: last year Cavan County Council had £60 per mile for county roads and 11 per cent of £60 is £6.50.  It will not buy an extra shovel and that is the Government's solution to the problem. If this were not so serious it would be laughable.  Unfortunately, I will have to deal with this when I go home.</P>
      <P>The fact is the produce is being damaged in transport from the unit to the processor.  That is not good enough for people who are working long and late to get a quality product out.  They are willing to suffer a cut because of competitiveness in getting a quality product on the market.  That means a grading system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no goldmine in mushrooms or vegetables.  The only way we can compete is with family labour input.  If the unions were to become involved and legislation for a minimum wage introduced, I wonder how competitive we might be. We are walking a very thin line.  There is a livelihood to be made here and there is an opportunity to be availed of, but I do not want anybody to get carried away about setting up three mushroom tunnels and then retiring and living like a gentleman farmer.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  There is a profit to be made, but you have to work for it. However, that is nothing new to me or to the Minister.  We know that in any area of agriculture &mdash; dairying, beef production or whatever &mdash; unless you work you will not succeed.  There is no such thing as putting a few cattle in a field and waiting until the end of the year and then <Col N="785" /> you have a profit.  They have to be looked after, and there is the danger of disease.</P>
    <P>That is my contribution in a nutshell. I hope the Minister does not take offence about what I said.  I ask him to reconsider setting up this board.  There are other agencies which were referred to by my colleague, Deputy Deenihan.  Coras Tráchtála, a marketing agency, should be asked to play a role.  Are they aware of this development in the north-east which is making such rapid progress?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it but the Minister should play a leading role looking for markets abroad and encouraging the people involved to take a line of action which can be successful, and which will have his blessing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. Foxe Mr. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me time to speak.  I congratulate the Minister and wish him the very best of luck in his endeavours.</P>
      <P>It looks as if the horticultural industry is due for a big expansion.  Is it not ironic that when that industry is on the verge of a breakthrough the body which always provided them with information on the most scientific and technological kind has been decimated in numbers in the last few years?  I am referring to the horticultural advisory service.  Was that due to lack of planning on the part of various Governments, not just this one but the last few, or, their lack of commitment to the horticultural industry?  Without commitment we might as well throw our hats at it.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that the board have the authority and power to recruit staff. It is reckoned that as many staff as possible will be redeployed as distinct from employing extra staff.  Will any of that staff be used to advise growers?  If so, will any of the horticultural advisers who became redundant and are expert in their field, be employed?  The Bill provides that in due course the levy will contribute to the funding of the board.  Does that mean complete funding?  If it does not, does it mean that in the first few years no levy will be collected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="786" /> The Minister has broad shoulders but he will need them.  Look at the figures over the past few years.  In 1983 our horticultural import excess over exports was £114 million.  In 1987 the import excess over exports was £150 million.  That trend must be reversed.  Exports in the same period were up by £14 million, which sounds good.  Unfortunately, at the same time imports rose by £50 million.  In regard to domestic production expressed as a percentage of the total market, in 1983 we supplied 51 per cent of the total market and in 1987 the figure was down to 46 per cent.  We are losing on the home market and so on the export-import markets.</P>
    <P>The Government's stated policy is to preserve as many family farms as possible. Those are noble sentiments and we hope that policy will succeed.  There are a few ways in which that can be done, first, by providing alternative employment, second by providing subsidies and direct handouts and, third, by getting farmers to diversify in their farming practices. We must bear in mind that 46 per cent of farmers have an income of less than £3,500 per year.  Something drastic must be done immediately if we are serious about preserving family farms. One way in which to continue the family farm is by engaging in alternative enterprises, for example, horticultural projects, mushroom production and any other type of production that one considers would come under horticulture where one acre of land can be worth 60 or 70 acres of land operated in the traditional farming manner.</P>
    <P>The members of the board will be selected by the Minister and needless to say, the success of the board will depend on its composition.  We must rely on the good judgment and integrity of the Minister in selecting that board.  In that regard, we should have no particular fears.  The success or otherwise of the board will depend on its composition and the success or otherwise of the horticultural industry will depend to a large degree on the board.  In addition, it will depend on the advice, the leadership and the guidance which the producers will <Col N="787" /> get.  After all they are the backbone of the industry.  Without them there would be no horticultural industry, there would be no board and we would not be here today debating the future of the horticultural industry in Ireland.  As the farmers are the backbone of the horticultural industry they will play the role that the farming community played over the decades in our national economy when they were the backbone of the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Mr. McDaid Mr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>At this time, I would also like to make a contribution towards this debate and to support the Minister and his assistants in the manner in which they have approached this Bill.  It is vitally important that a board of this kind be set up so that a natural resource like horticultural production can be used to its full potential.</P>
      <P>Unlike cereal growth and cattle rearing the successful development of horticultural enterprise does not depend on the possession of extensive acreage on the part of any one operator.  Coming, as I do, from Donegal a county largely composed of small farms it is appropriate that my opening remarks to the House should concern some aspects of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am heartened by the programme which has been proposed by the interim board and by the substance of the Minister's opening speech.  I am aware, of course, that this is a five-year national plan which has a two-fold purpose, the provision of extra employment and the need to greatly reduce the huge adverse gap between horticultural exports and imports.  However, I sincerely hope that, in the interests of fair play towards the less developed regions, every effort will be made to encourage this type of enterprise in my county and in the western area generally if necessary by positive discrimination.  I feel that well motivated smallholders should be aided in every way possible and that their geographical location should not be a deterrent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many years ago we had a special glasshouse scheme for the growth of tomatoes <Col N="788" /> in Gaeltacht areas.  It was a well intentioned scheme but it eventually petered out because it was not economically viable at the time to heat the glasshouses. Consequently production was confined to periods when imported tomatoes were also arriving on the market.  The Minister has referred to the much improved technology now available within the European Community.  It would appear, however, that the new glasshouse scheme will, of necessity, be confined to areas close to the natural gas grid.  The pipeline, of course, runs mainly along a route which is already rich in agricultural land and agricultural enterprise generally. Once again we in the west and north-west are seen as the poor relations.</P>
    <P>I hope that the board will examine the feasibility of providing a reasonable alternative to natural gas elsewhere, even if this means tax concessions or direct fuel subsidies.  In this respect I hope that the improved Exchequer position will mean a somewhat greater availability of resources than that envisaged when the programme was being prepared.  I would strongly agree with the suggestion that assistance for development should be confined to those producers who have acceptable marketing arrangements. Indeed the ideal scenario might involve contracts between proven producers and supermarket outlets etc. so as to minimise the problems of any seasonal gluts.</P>
    <P>The Minister has laid considerable stress on potato production and rightly so.  For a country in which the potato has played such an important &mdash; and sometimes tragic &mdash; part for centuries, it is scarcely believable that we are still plagued with the problem of how to cope with competition from the imported article. There has been a long tradition of potato growing in my own county.  Indeed for many years Donegal was the source of major exports of seed potatoes to Mediterranean countries especially.  Not long ago we were producing 10,000 acres of seed in the county.  This has now declined by 90 per cent.  It is an unfortunate fact that the task of producers has been made no easier by the cost of <Col N="789" /> production and the difficulty in maintaining the sometimes unreasonable standards demanded by certain importing countries.  I look forward to the board's forthcoming report on this matter. However, there is no earthly reason our production and presentation of ware potatoes for both home and export markets should not be drastically improved. As recently as a few days ago in one of our more well-known supermarket chains I bought potatoes which were so badly blighted that most had to be discarded. The House is well aware that at certain times of the year these supermarkets can display imported potatoes which are clean and well graded.  It is not surprising, therefore, that the average shopper will automatically put these in their shopping basket, even &mdash; as I suspect &mdash; if the Irish product is a good deal better in taste.  By comparison, our own potatoes are badly presented.  Too often they are dirty and there is not enough evidence of grading. One does not have to be a top-class chef to know how infuriating it can be to boil a pot of potatoes where some are four or five times larger than others.  The packs I have seen were described as having been graded from 45mm to 80mm.  This is much too wide a range in the first place but even that is not adhered to.  I trust that the board will urgently address the problems of grading and presentation and that they are afforded the power and personnel to ensure that the labelling of produce means exactly what it says.</P>
    <P>I welcome the emphasis the Minister has placed on hardy nursery stock and amenity horticulture.  This is an area in which there is enormous potential in both home and export markets.  The home market can be stimulated to a very great degree if our local authorities can be convinced of the importance of landscaping to tourism development and to the aesthetic wellbeing of our own people.  This is something in which we are sadly lacking in comparison with many other countries. I would refer particularly to the planting of trees along roadways, especially new roadways.  Every road design should automatically provide for the planting of trees arranged in a suitably artistic <Col N="790" /> manner.  I would especially refer to the approach roads to many of our towns and cities.  As a general rule these roads are lined with an unsightly array of industrial buildings, warehouses, garages, etc.  The planting of trees at appropriate intervals on both sides of such roads would distract one from these eye-sores and would present an altogether more pleasing picture.</P>
    <P>In my own county we have seen the completion in recent weeks of a magnificent dual carriageway outside Letterkenny. This is the route along which most tourists travel on their way to the Donegal highlands and it includes a mile of precisely the same type of ugly approach road which I have described. I sincerely hope that Donegal County Council will set a good example by planting rows of semi-mature trees along this road.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned the great importance of fresh fruit and vegetables from a health point of view.  As a medical practitioner I would of course heartily concur with this view.</P>
    <P>There was a marvellous conference in London recently on the role of vitamins in disease prevention.  Representatives from 30 countries attended.  Doctor Gladys Block, an epidemiologist at the American National Cancer Institute stated, and I quote &ldquo;as doctors we have never conveyed to the public adequately that increasing the intake of fruit and vegetables is associated with reduced risk of cancer.  I think the effect of fruit and vegetables in cancer prevention is overwhelming.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Other speakers from various parts of the world showed how studies &mdash; I will not give a medical lecture &mdash; into the vitamins, E. C. and B, carotene in particular, played a vital role in the prevention of oral cancers.  Moreover C and B carotene played a particular role in the prevention of cervical cancer and low levels of the vitamin E were found in people with stomach and pancreatic tumours.  These vitamins and substances <Col N="791" /> known as anti-oxidants are found in yellow-green fruit and vegetables.  The Minister mentioned our high incidence of coronary artery disease in comparison with France.  In fact, we in Ireland are at the top of the list.  France is not even in the top ten.  The general public are not adequately aware of this, or of the protective effects of vitamins and fruit and vegetables in medical matters.  We are constantly reminded to wash fruit and vegetables before use to get rid of the residue of pesticides and artificial fertilisers which are so commonly used nowadays.</P>
    <P>This brings me to a point to which there is only a passing reference in the board's report, namely what is generally referred to as organic farming.  I believe about 100 producers qualify under this label and utilise only some 2,000 acres.  The estimated revenue from organic farming is in the region of £700,000.  I am well aware of the higher costs and extra labour involved, but I am also aware that producers who are engaged in this type of enterprise can readily sell their produce at a premium.  Large food stores in London and elsewhere have departments which specialise in organically-produced food and their experience has been that customers are quite willing to pay the higher prices.  I would earnestly suggest that the board should positively encourage this area of production.  If a workable system of licensing and labelling of organically-produced fruit and vegetables could be put in place, I have no doubt that the producers concerned would be well rewarded for their efforts in markets at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome this Bill.  I have merely touched upon some of the activities which will be covered by the board but I am most impressed by the wide variety of enterprises which have been researched.  In this, my first contribution in the House, I trust I shall be excused if I urge the board to give special attention to Donegal.  My county was all but severed from the rest of this State by Partition and is the only area of the western seaboard not served by a railway.  Our <Col N="792" /> isolated position and lack of a rail link has added to our difficulties in economic development.  In the early eighties the Fianna Fáil Government gave approval for the building of an airport near Letterkenny and an excellent site was accordingly purchased by Donegal County Council.  Unfortunately, that project was cancelled in summary fashion by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition immediately on assuming office.  I would encourage the Government to give an early go-ahead to this vital part of our development so that, among other things, we can fly out some of the produce we hope will be generated by the Bord Glas programme.  I may have deviated at times from the matter before us and I appreciate the leniency you have shown me.</P>

      <P>I thank the various Deputies who have contributed.  The frank and full exchange of the views reflected the general interest in the future development of the horticulture industry.  The considerable research input in the contributions made also reflects recognition of the potential of that industry.  Quite a few new Deputies have taken the opportunity to make their maiden speeches and some of them were very fine and worthwhile contributions.</P>
      <P>I have been sadly disappointed by the approach Fine Gael have adopted towards the Bill.  Obviously they have decided to oppose it.  Deputy Farrelly, their spokesman, led off for Fine Gael and his approach was disappointingly negative.  He spoke at length in criticising the Bill but I did not see any semblance of an alternative proposal.  What is the attitude of Fine Gael towards the development of our natural resources and the improvement of employment?  The sentiments the Deputy expressed are very disappointing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Owen made a very bold attempt to denigrate the Bill.  Bearing in mind that she represents north County Dublin in which the horticultural industry is very important, I must ask if the views <Col N="793" /> she was expressing are in the long-term interest of those involved in horticulture in that constituency.</P>
    <P>I welcome the comments of the Labour Party and The Workers' Party which were quite supportive and reflected a recognition of the necessity for a worthwhile initiative in relation to this industry. There is a need for State intervention. I am not suggesting that it should be excessive but we must consider the needs of the industry in the context of its disorganised state and serious decline over many years.  My predecessor made worthwhile efforts to lay a firm foundation for the industry and he had a body whose role was chiefly advisory.  Unfortunately this did not halt the decline which has been going on for many years. The industry has been disorganised, disjointed and subject to much critical comment. Those in the political arena and those involved directly in the industry have had to bear considerable criticism, primarily from consumers who have dissatisfied with the quality of produce available through the wholesalers and ultimately the retailers.  The industry is, in short, very much under-developed.</P>
    <P>Most speakers referred to the momentum of growth which the mushroom industry has generated within a few years.  The significant point is that the growth in that industry has built up a momentum on the basis of very tight discipline and well organised marketing approach.  We are exporting about 80 per cent of our total mushroom production and marketing it successfully in Great Britain, a market which is competitive and is growing by about 6 per cent per annum.  We set out projections in our five-year development proramme published at the end of 1988 and those projections will certainly be realised in a much shorter period than originally envisaged.  Deputies referred to several firms who are the leaders of the industry, such as Foxfield Mushrooms, Monaghan Mushrooms, Walsh Mushrooms and Carbury Mushrooms.  These are the people who are setting an example for other sectors of the industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> Bord Glas have a necessary role in coordinating, motivating and acting as a catalyst for the future development of the whole industry.  When this legislation was being framed we had the valuable and worthwhile experience of having had the interim board in place since March 1987. I paid tribute to that interim board who, over a short time, set about their task and achieved quite significant results.</P>
    <P>An initial analysis was made of the needs of the industry, which was badly needed to see where the opportunities were and to make them part of the programme of the industry.  The report of the commodity teams formed the basis of our five year programme which I mentioned earlier and which was published at the end of last year.</P>
    <P>The quality of life and the standard of living is improving all the time and people are more conscious of what they eat and what are regarded as healthy foods.  All the indications are that people will eat increased quantities of fruit and vegetables in the years ahead.  That is what happened in equally developed economies and there is no reason to doubt that the same trend will apply here. The industry and the people working in it must ensure that we are in a position to supply as much of the market requirement resulting from that increased consumption as we possibly can.  Given the soil and the climatic constraints it will not be possible for us to supply the total market requirement.  We should bear in mind that the industry by its very nature is labour intensive.  We need to create jobs as quickly as possible and we should have a development strategy for the horticultural industry.  An Bord Glas must be seen as the dynamo for the creation of jobs and the production of the increased output needed to supply the home market.  I hope, too, that it will result in our having a bigger share of the export market.</P>
    <P>An Bord Glas have their origins in a policy document which Fianna Fáil put together when in Opposition.  While not having access to up-to-date information &mdash; which is a problem for parties in Opposition &mdash; the possibilities and the potential <Col N="795" /> recognised at that time and clearly set down in the policy document have been borne out by the passage of time.  They now form the basis for this legislation.</P>
    <P>I was very surprised to hear Deputy Farrelly say that political parties should bring policy documents forward when in Opposition and that when they get into Government they should effectively forget about them.  That kind of attitude gives politicians a bad name and reduces public confidence in the political system. I am very disappointed that Fine Gael have adopted that approach.  Surely they should have a more constructive and pragmatic approach towards the whole economic development and the creation of employment generally?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do we need An Bord Glas?  As I said earlier, it is because the horticultural industry was seriously disorganised. If one looks at the total output and range of produce within the industry one finds that it is a very diverse industry which, perhaps, leads to fragmentation within it.  We need market co-ordination and the producers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Producers must have their system of marketing organised.  There is a producer group grant scheme in operation and the thrust of the efforts of all the people involved will be towards getting as many people as possible involved with producer groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately 20 per cent of producers are involved at present and another 10 per cent probably have their own satisfactory arrangements with wholesalers and suppliers.  We do not object to that because there is an organised discipline in their approach. However, I emphasise yet again that we <Col N="796" /> must get our producers to organise themselves into marketing groups.  There are three producer groups at present, Green Ace, Dublin-Meath and Fingal.  I should like to think that more producer groups will be formed around the country.</P>
      <P>The review of the industry and development programme by the interim board to which I referred earlier clearly identified marketing as the Achilles' heel of the industry.  People could grow successfully but there was a deficiency in the presentation and the perception of the product on the shelves.  The consumer needed to be convinced that the Irish produce was of good quality and I am glad to say that there has been a steady improvement in that regard.  However, we want to see an acceleration of that improvement.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that over the years the horticultural industry have not gathered momentum to organise themselves.  It is also regrettable that the agricultural organisations did not show a great interest in organising the industry.  It is quite understandable that main income products such as livestock, milk, cereals and beet should have all the attention they deserve but special attention should be given to the horticultural sector.  If it is going in the wrong direction there is a need for a board to set it on the right path towards development.  That is why we propose in this Bill that the State will have an involvement through the establishment of An Bord Glas which will be a catalyst for development and a co-ordinating body bringing everybody and every activity connected with the industry together.  The interim board have laid the foundations of contact with the different strands within the industry and it really will be a matter of the new statutory board exchanging the baton and continuing the whole development process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new board will act as a co-ordinator between the producers and Teagasc and between the horticultural industry and boards of the IDA and CTT.  Many Deputies asked if there would be duplication between the role of CTT and An Bord Glas.  CTT will continue to have responsibility for the export marketing <Col N="797" /> of products.  We are glad that the working arrangement with them is very satisfactory and there is no reason to doubt that such an arrangement will continue to be satisfactory when the new board are in operation.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill that we will have a consultative role in investment decisions within the industry and on which the IDA and other bodies will be making decisions.  That is as it should be. I do not see any danger of overlap&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>They should have done that through the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said I do not see any danger of overlap or duplication in that sort of arrangement.  We will also have a close involvement with the retail trade. Obviously, as part of promotional work, we will have to be involved in publicity with regard to the importance of fruit and vegetables in the national diet.  It is a question of convincing more people that they should eat more fruit and vegetables and, as a result, remain healthy.</P>
      <P>Of course the new board will need staff as it would not be possible to operate adequately without them.  However, there will not be a plethora of people involved in the secretariat.  We will have the number required to effect the changes and to co-ordinate the industry.  The remuneration and conditions of employment will be set in the same way as those for any other similar State body.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have an annual consultative role in the formulation of the horticultural end of the Teagasc programme. Teagasc will retain responsibility for research, advice and education. Their programme will have to be drawn <Col N="798" /> up in consultation with An Bord Glas before being put into effect in any given year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no sign of any overlap or duplication in that type of arrangement. I said earlier that the industry was in urgent need of development.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I set out clearly what were the possibilities for import substitution, increased output and increased job creation.  We said we would create 1,750 full-time and 1,500 part-time jobs. It may well transpire that those figures are conservative; indeed the indications already are that they will be conservative. I shall be glad to admit in, say, 12 or 18 months time that the numbers employed within the industry have increased at a much faster pace then had been originally anticipated primarily because of the rate of expansion in the mushroom sector.  Of its nature it is labour-intensive.  What we want to see are the jobs coming on stream.</P>
      <P>In the course of the debate the levy received undue focus and political attention. The legislative provision incorporated in this Bill for the introduction of the levy is no different from that provided for in other legislation in respect of other State bodies for the introduction of a levy.  We have clearly stipulated that initially An Bord Glas will be funded from the Exchequer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The reality is that the regulations will have to be introduced in both Houses and the Members will have to take a decision in regard to them at that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>On the domestic or the imported ones?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about the <Col N="800" /> introduction of a levy at home, a national provision.  The Deputy asked me whether they would apply to imports.  I replied that they would and also, of course, to domestic produce in the normal way.</P>
      <P>I regret very much that at least one Member of the House drew a parallel between the introduction of levies and the rod licence dispute.  There is no comparison good, bad or indifferent between the two.  It is unfortunate that this red herring is being raised because it gives a completely false impression.</P>
      <P>I said that initially the funding of An Bord Glas will be by the Exchequer.  With the passage of time, hopefully there will be a levy introduced from which portion of the board's funding will derive.  Those are the circumstances in which other State boards operate at present and have done for a very long time.  I do not see why it should be contended that the circumstances surrounding An Bord Glas should be any different from those pertaining to any other State board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>There were increases on existing levies for cattle and sheep also implemented.  I might remind Deputy Farrelly that, at that time, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, the then Fine Gael spokesman on agriculture, accepted the levies, accepted the principle, that they were a fact of life.  Indeed the principle of a levy was strongly supported by Deputy Deasy, a former Minister for Agriculture, who has had considerable experience in the matter of introduction of <Col N="801" /> levies and the operation of State boards generally.  At a later point I will come to Deputy Deasy's observations on the appointment of members to those boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should remember that the Tallaght strategy is over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The people on the Fine Gael side of the House, now objecting to the introduction of a levy in respect of an industry badly in need of development, should think again.  I would appeal to Deputy Farrelly to go back to the Fine Gael front bench and request them to reconsider their stance on, and approach to, this Bill.</P>
      <P>In the course of his remarks in this House on 2 November Deputy Farrelly said there had been no contact established with the horticulture industry when this Bill was being prepared.  If I remember correctly, Deputy Owen also referred to that fact.  Deputy Farrelly read out a letter from the chairman of the IFA horticulture committee.  In such circumstances I would not normally quote from correspondence with individuals but, as Deputy Farrelly chose to do so &mdash; for the sake of balance, if nothing else &mdash; I believe the reply issued by my private secretary to that letter should now be put on record and reads as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dear Aidan,</P>
      <P>Mr. Séamus Kirk TD, Minister for Horticulture has asked me to reply to your letter of 31 October, 1989, about the Bill now before the Dáil to establish An Bord Glas as a statutory body.</P>
      <P>The Minister has already agreed to meet your organisation on 10 November &mdash; my letter of 23 October in reply to the letter of 10 October from Mr. Michael Mahon refers.  The Minister understands that you were aware of this meeting at the time you wrote your letter of 31 October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be helpful to put the Bill in perspective and put a few points on record.  The interim Bord Glas as you <Col N="802" /> know comprises a very wide selection of people from all sides of the industry. As far back as July 1987 the Minister understands that you were authorised to make progress reports on matters coming before the Bord to your National Council and Horticultural Committee.  As you are also aware the question of the format and functions of the proposed statutory Bord have been discussed by the interim Bord on numerous occasions and the Bord has been regularly briefed on progress. Indeed the Minister further understands that you were in fact a member of a sub-committee set up to go into the whole question of the structure of the statutory Bord.</P>
    <P>The announcement of the publication of the Bill was made at a Press Conference on 11 September.  At that Press Conference the Minister indicated that he expected the Bill to be passed &ldquo;early in the coming session&rdquo;.  In addition yourself and various people in your organisation were supplied with copies of the Bill at that time.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances the Minister is at a complete loss to understand how you can complain about lack of consultation or knowledge of progress in regard to the legislation or that your organisation had not ample time since 11 September to present its views.</P>
    <P>That letter speaks for itself in response to what was said in this House.</P>
    <P>There were references to removal of functions and staff from Teagasc and the Department and alleged overlapping of functions, for example, with Córas Tráchtála Teoranta.  In regard to the later, CTT will, as already indicated, still be responsible for export promotion, although obviously Bord Glas will work in close harmony and collaboration with them.  Indeed, the interim board have already been doing that.  As regards Teagasc and the Department, there will be no extraction of staff.  Teagasc will continue to be responsible for research, training and advice although Bord Glas <Col N="803" /> will have a role in relation to the horticultural elements as provided for in section 8 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The functions of Bord Glas are set out in sections 4, 5, 8, 9 and 10 of the Bill. These are functions which the Department would not and do not normally perform. The Department will continue to perform their normal functions in relation to policy formation, advice to the Minister, regulatory work and so on. There is a very clear distinction here and Deputies will note that Bord Glas have important consultative roles in the spheres of investment policy and higher education as well as an input into the horticultural element of the annual programme of activities of Teagasc.</P>
    <P>I believe strongly that the method of appointment of board members provided for in the Bill is the best one.  The Oireachtas should have the right to question the Minister's nominations.  Giving the right to non-elected bodies to nominate is not the best way to proceed.  Such nominations may produce good results but there is an equal if not a greater possibility that board members so appointed are not going to be the best ones for the job.</P>
    <P>The people I like to see on State boards are those who, in their individual capacities, have not only a good knowledge of the business of the board but who have the drive and imagination needed to enable that board to have the policies that will make them an effective and successful board.</P>
    <P>The trouble with giving the right to organisations to nominate members is that the quality of the board member and his suitability for the particular work of the board may not be always the criterion by which the organisation will consider his selection for nomination.  Very often within organisations rewards are given for work already done, for certain allegiances or for any other reason imaginable within organisations as to why some particular person needs to be rewarded.  That is not a good way in which to select a board.</P>
    <P>There is also the risk that somebody <Col N="804" /> nominated by an organisation will look upon himself at board meetings as being more representative of the organisation than somebody who is prepared to be his own man in debates.  We all know, of course, that people will be affected by their membership of organisations or their particular activities.  Of course all of us can be so affected but we need people on boards who can, in the first instance, act as individuals.</P>
    <P>There is also the risk that the board nominees of a particular organisation will look on themselves as needing to report back constantly to their organisations so that at board meetings you are dealing not with an individual who will stand up and say things for himself but rather with somebody who is constantly looking over his shoulder at those who sent him to the board seat which he occupies.</P>
    <P>I was greatly heartened when Deputy Austin Deasy spoke, in the midst of a very helpful intervention, on the subject of nominations to the board.  I know this is not the first time Deputy Deasy has expressed these sentiments but that does not in any way weaken the strength of the reasoning behind those sentiments.  I fully agree with them.  I would like to assure the House that, as the Bill provides, there will be full consultation with as many people and interests as we consider necessary before nominations are made to the board of An Bord Glas but there will not be a simple acceptance of people being imposed from outside.</P>
    <P>I want to deal briefly with the transfer of land and charges for services.  The provision in section 6(1)(b) is simply a contingency provision and no such transfer is envisaged at the moment.  On the question of charges for services, this is a similar provision to that contained in the Teagasc Act.  There is no question of anyone being required to pay for a service not availed of.  The type of situation envisaged here is that Bord Glas will be enabled to charge for a specific service provided for the industry and nothing more.</P>
    <P>On the question of funding, Deputies will be aware that a sum of £250,000 was provided in 1989.  This is a significant sum <Col N="805" /> and it enabled the board effectivley to discharge their functions.  The Estimates for 1990 contain a provision of £500,000, an increase of 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>Questions were also asked about EC aid.  Such aid is available under a number of headings.  For example, there is aid available for producer groups for fruit and vegetables and recently such aid was extended to potato producers.  Aid is also available under the farm improvement programme.  There is also aid for marketing and processing and, of course, IDA and SFADCo provide aid for industrial horticultural projects.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to organic farming.  I would like to tell the House that Bord Glas have set up a widely representative and expert group to examine this sector in detail and the board hope to have a report from the group shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen referred to natural gas. A number of horticultural producers in north Dublin applied to An Bord Gáis for connection to the gas supply under very favourable terms offered by the board.  The interim Bord Glas were very much involved in the negotiations which resulted in these favourable terms.  I think that anybody who joined to the gas supply system at that time is quite happy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen has, however, complained about producers who did not make use of that facility.  I am sorry if there are producers who were not prepared to take up the special offer made by Bord Gáis at that time.  However, Bord Gáis are a commercial organisation and I cannot tell them at what price they should sell gas, although naturally I would like it to be given at as favourable a rate as possible to horticultural producers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen said that the glasshouse grant scheme was only for people in big business.  I am afraid she is wrong.  The applications to date range from people of modest extent to glasshouses which are reasonably large in size.  I agree with Deputy Owen that practically all of the glasshouses in this country are badly in need of being replaced and, of course, <Col N="806" /> this is what the new grant scheme is all about.</P>
    <P>The only way forward is through the modern glasshouse and I am very glad to be able to tell the House that some weeks ago I had the pleasure of accompanying a full busload of north County Dublin glasshouse owners to County Wexford to see the most up-to-date and modern glasshouse in Ireland.  It is not a huge glasshouse but it is owned and managed very successfully by the kind of horticultural producer who is a model on how to do the job.  This man knows what is he about and does his job very well. He is producing top quality produce and is getting the best yields.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton raised the question of plant health.  As of now, exports of hardy nursery stock must be free of all serious organisms.  In terms of the Single Market which is to be reached on 1 January 1993, there will be in the plant health area, a further liberalisation of trade between member states by cutting down on the number of inspections and formalities in the movement of plants.  Details of this proposal have yet to be worked out in Brussels but the essence of the new arrangements is that the emphasis will be mainly directed at the point of dispatch, with reduced controls along the way or at the point of destination.  The onus will be on the producer selling his produce to guarantee disease freedom.  I and my Department have co-operated, and will continue to co-operate, with the industry in reaching this goal.  I want to restate and emphasise that our aim at the continuing discussions in Brussels will be to retain the well-founded reputation Ireland has of being free from so many harmful organisms.</P>
    <P>Deputy Martin referred to education and suggested that An Bord Glas should have a role in second level as well as in higher education.  I should like to assure the Deputy that An Bord Glas will have an involvement here in that they will be concerned with the formulation of the horticultural content of the annual programme of the activities of Teagasc which, of course, includes non-degree horticultural education.  The board will <Col N="807" /> have to ensure that such education is in accordance with the needs of the industry.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to support this Bill and to allow its free passage through the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Tairgim: &ldquo;Go léifear an Bill an Dara hUair.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom leithscéal a ghabháil libh toisc nach bhfuil ar chumas an Aire Stáit ag Roinn na Gaeltachta, an Teachta Pat the Cope Gallagher bheith i láthair anseo inniu.  Is amhlaidh go raibh air imeacht gan choinne agus ní raibh neart aige air.</P>
      <P>Is é cuspóir an Bhille ghairid seo ná an uasteorainn £60 milliún atá leagtha síos san Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta (Leasú), 1987, do na hairleacain as an Phríomh-Chiste chun Údarás na Gaeltachta a mhéadú go dtí £80 milliún.  Tá an uasteorainn do £60 milliún sroiste ó mhí an Mheithimh seo caite agus tá sé fíor-thábhachtach mar sin go n-ardófar í gan mhoill le go bhféadfar tuilleadh airleacan a chur ar fáil don Údarás.  Léiríonn an Bille seo cé chomh dáiríre is atá an Rialtas maidir le tacaíocht a thabhairt don Údarás ina gcuid iarrachtaí chun forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn agus caighdeán maireachtála a muintire a fheabhsú.</P>
      <P>Cuirtear soláthar caipitil ar fáil don Údarás ar dhá bhealach: deontas-i-gcabhair trí Vóta Roinn na Gaeltachta &mdash; caipiteal vótáilte a ghlaotar air sin; agus airleacain inaisíoctha ón Phríomh-Chiste &mdash; caipiteal neamh-vótáilte a ghlaotar air sin.</P>
      <P>Úsáidtear caipiteal vótáilte chun deontais a íoc mar chabhair chun tionscail nó scéimeanna táirgiúla fostaíochta a bhunú, a fhorbairt nó a chothabháil sa Ghaeltacht.  Caitear airleacain ar mhon-archana a thógáil, ar scaireanna a cheannach i bhfochuideachtaí agus i gcomhchuideachtaí agus chun maoin a cheannach.  Sa bhliain reatha tá suimeanna caipitil mar seo a leanas údaraithe don Údarás: caipiteal vótailte £4.8 milliún; agus airleacain £3.3 milliún.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhí deacrachtaí áirithe ag an Údarás i 1988 maidir le íocaíochtaí a dhéanamh i leith iarratas ar dheontais a tháinig chun aibíochta le haghaidh íocaíochta, ach leis an £3 mhilliún breise a cuireach ar fáil don eagraíocht anuraidh réitíodh an fhadhb sin.  Leis an teacht isteach méadaithe a bheidh ag an Údarás i mbliana ó shócmhainní a dhíol le cur leis an teacht isteach ón Stát agus ó fhoinsí eile, mar shampla, ó Chiste Sóisialta an Chomhphobail Eorpaigh, tá mé sásta nach <Col N="811" /> mbeidh fadhb ar bith mar sin ann i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Maidir le poist a chruthú, tháinig méadú arís eile &mdash; don 7ú bliain as a chéile &mdash; ar líon na ndaoine a bhí fostaithe go lánaimseartha i dtionscail sa Ghaeltacht faoi scáth an Údaráis ag deireadh 1988.  Ar 31 Nollaig 1988 bhí 5,134 dhuine fostaithe go lánaimseartha sna tionscail sin i gcomparáid le 4,946 dhuine ag deireadh 1987, i.e., méadú de 188 bpost.  Ar ndóigh, theip ar roinnt tionscal i rith 1988 agus cailleadh 825 phost, rud a chuir as go mór ní amháin don Údarás ach do na pobail áitiúla inar tharla na teipeanna sin.  Ar an taobh eile den scéal, áfach, cruthaíodh breis agus míle post nua agus is ábhar dóchais agus tógáil chroí dúinn uilig é sin.  Tá moladh tuillte ag an Údarás dá bharr agus tá mé dóchasach go leanfaidh an dul chun cinn sin sna blianta atá romhainn.  Léiríonn na torthaí atá bainte amach ag an Údarás maidir le poist a chruthú go bhfuil an borradh agus an fhorbairt atá le feiceáil ar fud na tíre anois le haithint sa Ghaeltacht fosta.</P>
    <P>Le go leanfaí le tairbhe a bhaint as an bhorradh seo chinn an Rialtas cúpla mí ó shin cead a thabhairt don Údarás méid na ndeontas a cheadófaí i mbliana a dhú-bailt ón tsuim £4.5 mhilliún a bhí aontaithe go dtí £9 milliún.  Is cinnte go gcuideoidh sé sin go mór leis an Údarás chun tograí a thiocfaidh chun tosaigh a cheadú ach caithfidh an eagraíocht féachaint chuige, oiread agus is féidir, trí fheidhm a bhaint as dianchritéir roghnaithe, gur tograí fiúntacha a chuirfidh fostaíocht shochrach ar fáil a cheadófar. Is beag is fiú don Ghaeltacht agus don tír tionscnaimh a bhunú nach mairfidh ró-fhada.</P>
    <P>Tá an tÚdarás ag brú ar aghaidh leis an obair cheannródaíochta atá ar siúl acu le blianta beaga anuas i dtaca le hacmhainní nádúrtha na gceantar Gaeltachta a fhorbairt.  Tá torthaí an tsaothair sin le feiceáil anois go háirithe i gcás an tionscal fheirmeoireacht éisc.  Tagann céatadán mór de tháirgeadh náisiúnta bradán na tíre seo ó fheirmeacha ar chósta na Gaeltachta.  I 1988 táirgeadh 2,182 tonna bradán ó na feirmeacha sin i gcomparáid le 1,109 tonna i 1987 agus <Col N="812" /> 776 tonna i 1986.  Meastar go méadóidh an táirgeadh ó na feirmeacha Gaeltachta go dtí 7,000 tonna faoin bhliain 1992, i.e., 50 faoin gcéad den táirgeadh measta náisiúnta.</P>
    <P>In éineacht le tacaíocht a thabhairt d'fheirmeoireacht bhradán féin, tá cuidiú nach beag á chur ar fáil ag an Údarás leis an tionscal phróiseáil bradán, i.e., pacáil, grádáil agus deatú, a fhorbairt sa Ghaeltacht. De réir a chéile, beidh táirgí breisluacha á gcur chun cinn de réir mar a bheidh an táirgeadh bradán ag dul i méid agus muinín ag fás sa tionscal.  Ciallóidh sé sin, ar ndóigh, go gcuirfear deiseanna fostaíochta breise ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá straitéis fhorbartha don tionscal sliogéisc sa Ghaeltacht ullmhaithe ag an Údarás.  Is é príomh-bhunaidhm na straitéise sin ná tionscal inmharthana ar scála idirnáisiúnta a fhorbairt ar mhaithe le fostaíocht a chruthú agus cúrsaí geilleagair sa Ghaeltacht a chur chun cinn.  Beidh deacrachtaí móra le sárú leis an aidhm sin a bhaint amach agus caithfear cur chuige ar mhodh eagraithe.  Tá mé cinnte nach dteipfidh ar an Údarás ón taobh sin de.</P>
    <P>Le tamall anuas tá an tÚdarás ag díriú go speisialta ar thionscnaimh straitéiseacha a bhunú sa Ghaeltacht.  Is mian leis an eagraíocht agus liomsa, mar Aire Stáit na Gaeltachta, go mbeidh páirt iomlán ag pobal na Gaeltachta i gcur chun cinn tograí nua-aimseartha a rachaidh i gcion ar thodhchaí na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge.  Is ceart go mbeidh an Ghaeltacht ar chomhchéim iomaíochta le ceantair eile sa tír i réimsí infheistíochta nua-theicneolaíochta. Chomh maith leis sin, tá an tÚdarás ag cur béime nach beag ar thograí ceadúnais agus aistriú teicneolaíochta go háirithe i gcás cuideachtaí ó na Stáit Aontaithe a bheidh ag díriú ar 1992 agus ar mhargaí chomhaontaithe na hEorpa.  Fáiltím roimh na tionscnaimh sin go léir agus roimh chinn eile nach iad a léiríonn fuinneamh agus díogras Údarás na Gaeltachta ina gcuid iarrachtaí chun forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom, ar son urlabhraí Fhine Gael ar chúrsaí Ghaeltachta, an Teachta McGinley, nach bhfuil anseo inniu, cuidiú leis an rún atá molta ag an Aire Stáit anseo i leith an Bhille ghairid seo.  Déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire Stáit as ucht an chaoi a raibh sé ar a chumas an scriopt a léamh.  Tá sé an-deacair tuiscint ar bith a chur ar chuid de na scriopteanna seo.  Ní bhíonn mórán cleachta ag an Aire Stáit ar chúrsaí Ghaeltachta, cé go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht is mó sa tír ina dháilcheantar féin, agus sílim go ndearna sé jao sách maith faoi. Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil morán suime acu siúd atá ar deoraíocht i Sasana nó i Meiriceá sa Bhille ghairid seo atá tugtha isteach anseo inniu.  Tá sé fíorthábhachtach go mbeidh an méid airgid atá le caitheamh ag an Údarás ardaithe ó £60 milliún go £80 milliún punt.  Sílim go bhfuil sé thar am go mbeadh sé ar a gcaoi ag an Udarás é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>Ag an am céanna, na mílte atá i Sasana agus i Meiriceá, níl a fhios acu siúd inniu go bhfuilimid ag caint faoin Bhille seo, agus céard a dhéanfaidh sé dóibh siúd. An mbeidh sé ar chumas Údarás na Gaeltachta tionscail a bhunú, jabanna a chur ar fáil, fostaíocht a chur ar fáil dóibh agus dá gclann taobh istigh de limistéar a gceantracha féin.  Sin an rud atá fíor-thábhachtach, agus go deimhin a bhí ar intinn gach rialtais le blianta anuas.  Is fíor go bhfuil gach uile Ghaeltacht sa tír bánaithe leis an imirce faoi láthair.  Ó thaobh chúrsaí foirne peile de agus ó thaobh chúrsaí sóisialta de, tá an t-aos óg imithe ó iarthar na tíre, agus go mórmhór ó gach ceantar Ghaeltachta.  Tá teipthe ar an Rialtas seo agus ar an iar-Rialtas cosc a chur leis an taoide sin atá ag imeacht as an tír seo.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh sé ar chumas an Údaráis obair a dhéanamh ón taobh sin de.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá neart deacrachtaí ag foireann an Údaráis faoi láthair.  Bhí, agus is dócha go mbeidh.  Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil iarratas curtha isteach ag Údarás na Gaeltachta chuig an Rialtas chun go mbeadh cumhachtaí breise tugtha don Údarás i dtreo is go mbeadh siad in ann leanúint leis an sórt oibre atá á déanamh acu faoi láthair agus go mbeidh sé ar a <Col N="814" /> gcumas athrú a dhéanamh sna blianta atá le teacht.  Mura bhfuil iarratas curtha isteach ba cheart go mbeadh, agus má tá ba cheart go mbeadh an Rialtas an-tógtha le hiarratas ar bith den sórt agus go mbeadh siad báúil don iarratas sin.  Má tá tionsclóir ar bith ag teacht go hÉirinn atá tógtha le háit ar bith Ghaeltachta agus atá tógtha le ceantar ar bith Ghaeltachta, sílim go bhfuil níos mó airgid le fáil aige ón IDA agus ó áiteacha eile, i bhfad níos mó ná mar atá le fáil aige ó Údarás na Gaeltachta chun tionscail a bhunú, agus más é sin an cás is fíor a rá go mbeadh sé i bhfad níos éasca, agus go mbeadh sé i bhfad níos báúla don tionsclóir sin a chur ar bun gar do na mórchathracha agus do oirthear na tíre ná tionscal a thosú sna ceantracha iargulta san iarthar.</P>
    <P>Tá Údarás na Gaeltachta faoi láthair ag obair leis an míbhuntáiste seo an-trom orthu i leith an IDA agus na gcomhlachtaí eile atá ag obair sa cheantar sin.  Sílim go bhfuil gcomhlachtaí eile ag teacht isteach sna ceantracha Gaeltachta, cosúil le SFADCo, agus tá siad siúd ag déileáil le cúrsaí turasóireachta agus mar sin de.  Sna blianta atá le teacht is fíor a rá go bhfuil cúrsaí tuarasóireachta ag ardú go mór agus ag dul i gcumhacht go mór agus i bhfad níos mó béime curtha ar chúrsaí turasóireachta agus mar sin de agus go mbeidh as seo amach.  Sílim go mbeidh cumhacht agus buntáiste ag an Údarás le cúrsaí turasóireachta a fhorbairt agus a phlé taobh istigh de na limistéir agus dá gceantracha féin.  Tá sé sin fíor-thábhachtach &mdash; os rud é go bhfuil polaitíocht na &ldquo;Greens&rdquo;, mar a déarfá, linn faoi láthair agus go mbeidh as seo amach &mdash; ó thaobh chúrsaí pleanála de, ó thaobh chúrsaí fhorbairt turasóireachta de, go mbeadh sé ar chumas an Údaráis pleanáil cheart agus pleanáil láidir, mar a déarfá, a dhéanamh do na ceantracha Gaeltacha sna blianta atá le teacht.  Ó thaobh chúr-saí fostaíochta de, seo an rud céanna atá scríofa agus atá curtha amach ag beagnach gach uile Aire Gaeltachta sa Dáil anseo le blianta anuas, ach amháin go bhfuil athrú ar na figiúirí.  Níl ann ach go bhfuil an tUdarás ag déanamh a ndíchill agus go bhfuil an Rialtas sásta go mbeidh níos mó fostaíochta curtha ar bun sna <Col N="815" /> Gaeltachtaí.  Tá sé sin go breá.  Ach mar a dúirt mé, tá gach uile cheantar Gaeltachta bánaithe leis an imirce faoi láthair.  Tá siad ag imeacht as an tír gach uile mhaidin ó Chnoc Mhuire agus áiteacha mar sin. Níl a fhios agam an mbeidh siad ag léamh faoi seo san <i>Irish Post</i> thall i Nua-Eabhrac nó sa Bhreatain no áiteacha mar sin.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, céard táimid ag déanamh? Séard atá mise ag rá gur cheart go mbeadh sé ar a gcumas ag Údarás na Gaeltachta rud dearfach láidir a dhéanamh ó thaobh fostaíocht a chur ar bun sna ceantracha Gaeltachta.  Go deimhin, ó thaobh fheirmeoireacht éisc agus an sórt sin tá, mar a dúirt an tAire Stáit, ceannródaíocht déanta ag an Udarás le cúpla bliain anuas, agus sílim gur cheart go mbeadh sé ar a gcumas ag an Údarás leanúint ar aghaidh leis an gceannródaíocht sin.  Anois, tá deacrachtaí ag teacht le feirmeoireacht éisc ar fud na tíre faoi láthair.  Tá imní ar chuid de na daoine agus na heagrais atá ag plé leis faoi, mar shampla, substaint a chuirtear ar na héisc chun iad a ghlanadh.  Ag breathnú le déanaí ar Albain, tá a lán deacrach-taí tar éis tarlú ar na lochanna ansin, agus ba cheart go mbeadh an tÚdarás ag breathnú go géar air seo agus gan sul isteach le tromlach fheirmeoireacht éisc a chur ar bun in áit-eacha, b'fhéidir, nach mbeadh ró-oir-iúnach chun an sórt sin oibre a dhéanamh. Aontaím leis an Aire Stáit go bhfuil sé ceart go mbeadh an tionscnamh strait-éiseach curtha ar bun agus airgead tugtha don Údarás chun é sin a dhéanamh freisin.  Tá mé buíoch den Údarás o thaobh na cheannródaíochta atá déanta acu i mo dháilcheantar féin le tionscal a bhí le cur ar bun ó thaobh fhorbairt postanna de.  Ní raibh sé ar a gcumas ag an tionsclóir an rud a chur le chéile i gceart, ach bhí Údarás na Gaeltachta anbháúil don cheannródaíocht sin.</P>
    <P>Sílim gurb shin an sórt tionscal ar cheart go mbeadh baint ag an Údarás leo. Tá sé i bhfad níos deacra orthu a bheith ar comhchéim leis an IDA ag déileáil leis na seantionsclóirí agus an sórt oibre a bhíodh ar siúl acu siúd.  Tá mé ag caint mar eolas don Aire Stáit faoin fhorbhairt <Col N="816" /> a deineadh i nGaoth Sáile ar na portaigh thíos ansin.  Níl sé ar siúl ag an am seo, ach tá súil agam nuair a bheidh na díospóireachtaí atá ar siúl faoi láthair thart agus críochnaithe go mbeidh sé ar chumas an tionsclóra é sin a chur ar ais ar siúl. Mar a dúirt mé, tá mé báúil don Údarás as ucht an chabhair agus an fháilte a chuir siad roimh an tionscal sin, agus, go deimhin, as an airgead a chuir siad ar fáil dó.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios ag gach uile dhuine go bhfuil Raidió na Gaeltachta fíorthábhachtach do na ceantracha Gaeltachta, agus cé nach dtagann sé go díreach faoi chumas an Údaráis ba mhaith liom go mbeadh staidéar curtha ar bun faoi cad é an difríocht atá déanta faoi láthair ag na stáisiúin nua raidió atá díreach taobh amuigh de na ceantracha Gaeltachta agus atá ag craoladh i mBéarla amháin tri na limistéir Ghaeltachta.  Níl a fhios an bhfuil athrú ag teacht as ucht na n-imeachtaí sin ar chúrsaí Raidió na Gaeltachta.  Más rud é go bhfuil Údarás na Gaeltachta le dul a fhorbairt sna blianta atá le teacht sílim go bhfuil tábhacht ag baint leis sin.  Ag éirí as sin, Teilifís na Gaeltachta freisin, níl a fhios agam an bhfuil airgead le fáil ó Roinn na Gaeltachta i mbliana dó sin. Tá díomá orm toisc nár cheadaigh an Rialtas anseo go fóill an t-ordú a chuir Pairlimint na hEorpa i leith, mar a déarfá, IAS &mdash; impact analysis surveys &mdash; a chur ar súil.  Má táimid chun níos mó forbairt ó thaobh feirmeoireacht éisc a chur ar bun agus cúrsaí turasóireachta, cumhachtaí breise, cúrsaí pleanáil bóithre agus mar sin de sílim go bhfuil sé fíor-thábhachtach chun forbairt cheart agus pleanáil cheart a chur ar bun ó thaobh na Gaeltachtaí de go mbeadh sí riachtanach an t-ordú sin a chur i bhfeidhm.  Mar fhocal scoir ba mhaith liom a rá go n-aontaím leis an Bille ghairid chun an méid airgid atá le fáil don Údarás a ardú ó £60 milliún go dtí £80 milliún.  Ní leor é áfach.  Ba chóir go mbeadh sé ar ghuailne an Taoisigh mar, is é Aire na Gaeltachta féin é, go mbeadh i bhfad níos mó spéise aige i gcúrsaí Gaeltachta agus go dtabharfadh seisean don Údarás na cumhachtaí breise atá iarrtha acu le go mbeidh sé ar <Col N="817" /> a gcumas acu sna blianta atá le teacht forbairt cheart agus pleanáil cheart le fostaíocht a chur ar bun do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, i dtreo is nach mbeidh orthu imeacht arís ar deoraíocht agus dearmad a dhéanamh ar chúrsaí na tíre seo.</P>

      <P>Aontaím leis an méid a dúirt an Teachta Enda Kenny agus an fáilte a chuir sé roimh an Aire Stáit as teacht isteach anseo chun an ráiteas seo a thabhairt.  Ní beag an misneach a bhí aige nuair a bhí sé ag obair le habairtí agus tearmaí ar nós &ldquo;obair ceannrodaíochta&rdquo; agus an bhrí atá leis sin ná &ldquo;pioneering work&rdquo;.  Agus ceann eile agus ba mhaith liom mo leithscéal a ghábháil mar nuair a luaigh sé tionscnaimh stratéiseacha cheap mé gurbh é a dúirt sé ná &ldquo;tionscnaimh slat iascaireachta&rdquo;.  Shíl mé go raibh rud réabhlóideach tar éis tarlú i ngan fhios dúinn go léir.  Ach dar ndóigh tionscnamh a raibh an Teachta Kenny ag caint faoi cheapfadh éinne go raibh sórt monarchain nua i gceist.  I ndáiríre séard atá i gceist ná aistriúchán uafásach ar &ldquo;strategic initiative&rdquo;.  Is cuma faoi sin, níl tábhacht ag baint leis.

    <P>Nílim chun cur i gcoinne an Bhille seo atá ag ardú an teora ó £60 milliún go £80 milliún.  Níl deacracht ag Páirtí an Lucht Oibre leis sin.  Rud a chuir iontas orm ná nach ndearnadh aon tagairt san ráiteas don bhun Acht atá i gceist, Acht 1979. Tá sé fíor a rá go bhfuil an tAcht leasaithe 1987 ann.  Ach is san bhun Acht atá na cumhachtaí go léir dlite.  Bhí sé beagáinín ait nach ndearnadh aon tagairt do Acht 1979.  Ach caithim seo a rá, agus tá sé an-tábhachtach, tá me féin bréan de bheith ag cur ceisteanna síos go dtí an Taoiseach san Dáil seo ag iarraidh air an bhfuil sé ar intinn aige cumhachtaí breise a thabhairt do Údarás na Gaeltachta, nó atheagrú a dhéanamh ar an Údarás ionnas go mbeadh sé in ann na haidhmeanna atá liostáilte san bhun Acht a bhaint amach.  Arís tá Acht ag teacht dúinn tráthnóna Déardaoin agus níl ach cúpla líne ann.  Anois tá sé fíor a rá go ndearna na ceard-chumainn taobh istigh <Col N="818" /> den Údarás staidéar ar an chaoi ina bhfuil an tÚdarás eagraithe agus chuir siad moltaí ar aghaidh chun an tÚdarás a dhéanamh níos éifeachtaí, ionas go mbeidís in ann na haidhmeanna atá acu faoin dlí a bhaint amach.  Níor tugadh aon aird ar na moltaí sin.  Arís nuair a cuireadh ceisteanna sa Dáil atá imithe agus leis na blianta, ar chuir Údarás na Gaeltachta féin aon mholtaí go dtí an Taoiseach nó Aire na Gaeltachta chun cumhachtaí breise a fháil tá sé ráite ar Raidio na Gaeltachta ag na daoine atá curtha ar an Údarás ag páirtí an Rialtais &mdash; an páirtí is mó taobh istigh den chomhrialtas, chun a bheith ceart, lucht Fhianna Fáil &mdash; Tá sé ráite ag daoine ar nós Seán Ó Neachtain gur chuir siadsan moltaí ar aghaidh go dtí an tAire.  Tá sé ráite domsa san Teach seo ag na hAirí éagsúla nár cuireadh aon mholtaí ar aghaidh.  Caithfidh duine éigin an fhírinne a rá uair éigin dúinne a bhfuil suim againn i gcúrsaí na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>An bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Aire aon rud a dhéanamh faoin Acht &mdash; leasuithe a chur isteach nó aon rud eile a dhéanamh. Dar ndóigh nílimid chun é sin a fháil amach inniu.  Tá cúpla nithe eile tábhachtach. Na deacrachtaí a bhaineann le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta, ní bhaineann siad amháin leis na cumhachtaí nach bhfuil acu.  Baineann siad chomh maith leis na cumhachtaí atá acu agus atá ag oibriú mar chonstaic do chaiteachas atá riachtanach do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, mar shampla, tá sé rí-shoiléir go bhfuil na húdaráis áitiúla ag caitheamh a ndóthain ar chúrsaí tithíochta, toisc go gceapann siad, go mí-cheart, go bhfuil cúrsaí tithíochta faoi bhráid an Údaráis.  Tá an rud ceanann céanna fíor faoi chúrsaí bóthair.</P>
    <P>Rud eile, tá an aidhm tugtha do Udarás na Gaeltachta nithe áirithe a dhéanamh faoi úsáid na Gaeilge féin a chur chun cinn.  Níl pingean rua tugtha don chospóir sin leis na blianta.  Mar sin, tá géar-ghá le leasuithe ar bhun struchtúr an Údaráis féin.  Ag an am céanna tá cumhachtaí breise ag teastáil uathu go mór mhór, mar a luaigh mé, i gcúrsaí tithíochta agus infra-struchtúir go ginearálta, mar shampla, bóithre agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> Nuair a bhí mé ag éisteacht leis an scéal go raibh 188 duine níos mó ag deireadh 1988 ag obair sna Gaeltachtaí ná mar a bhí ag deireadh 1987, bhí mé ag smaoineamh ar an chaoi in a bhfuil cúrsaí faoi láthair, cuir i gcás i gContae na Gaillimhe, go bhfuil ocht ndroichead atá contúirteach faoi láthair agus tá ceithre cinn díobh sin i nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe. Mar sin, faoin infrastruchtúr bunúsach táimid ag méadú ar an leibhéal atá ceadaithe don Údarás a thabhairt, mar shampla, ar dheontais agus mar sin de.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether the introduction of the junior certificate will involve the replacement of existing text books now in use in the junior cycle of second level schools; if she will give an estimate of the likely cost per pupil of the new books that will be required; and if she will make a statement on the likelihood of success of the new junior certificate, in the absence of adequate resources for books, in-service training, dissemination of curriculum information and information about the method of examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The new syllabuses do not represent so radical a departure from the existing syllabuses as to necessitate the replacement of the text books in all cases. This I have made clear.  The main thrust of the new syllabuses is in approach and <Col N="820" /> methodology rather than in content.  In view of this I have made available increased funding for the in-service training of teachers.  The overall in-service training allocation for 1989 is £698,000 compared with £311,000 in 1988, an increase of 124 per cent.  The provision for 1990 is £750,000, an increase of 141 per cent on the 1988 level.  In the context of these significantly increased resources for in-service the needs of the teachers of the new junior certificate syllabuses are being prioritised.</P>
      <P>With regard to dissemination of curriculum information I should point out to the Deputy that in the autumn of 1988 each second-level school was circulated with copies of the seven new syllabuses; an information brochure outlining the key issues involved in the junior certificate and a video illustrating the central developments of the new syllabuses.</P>
      <P>In addition the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment convened information seminars throughout the country to introduce teachers to the new syllabuses.</P>
      <P>In the course of the summer my Department began issuing to schools copies of guidelines for teachers.  Further copies of the guidelines and other support material are being given to teachers attending this week's national in-service seminars throughout the country.  Copies of the new syllabuses and the guidelines for teachers are also being made available for purchase through the Government Publications Sale Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the method of examination I should like to emphasise that the examination exists to serve the syllabus and not to determine it or constrain teachers in their approach to it.  The general thrust of the new junior certificate is to afford teachers as much freedom as possible within broad parameters in the planning and implementation of their work programmes to meet the specific needs of their pupils.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment will be reporting to me on assessment and examination modes based on the findings of course and in-service committees and <Col N="821" /> the assessment committee.  These findings will undoubtedly draw upon feedback to the committees from teachers implementing the syllabuses and attending the in-service seminars.  This is a normal commonsense procedure in the introduction of any new curriculum and the drawing up of sample examination papers.</P>
    <P>In 1989 my Department provided £1.9 million for free school books in the post primary area which was an increase of 20 per cent and I am pleased to say that the 1990 figure will be similarly increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that chaos reigns in many areas in regard to the operation of the in-service courses for teachers in that many schools have received no more than one day's notice of the course applying in respect of their school and some schools have not been notified at all as to when an in-service course will be organised for them?  Would she agree that it makes little sense to introduce a new curriculum without information as to how that curriculum is to be examined?  To have a junior certificate curriculum in being, while the method of its examination is unknown, is completely unsatisfactory and is putting the cart before the horse.  Is the Minister aware that the schools have received just two handbooks each even though there may be 20 or 30 teachers in some schools to whom these handbooks are supposed to be made available?  Does she regard that as adequate?  Would she further agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Four supplementaries have been put to me and I will answer the four notwithstanding that this will deny other people the right to questions.</P>
      <P>The first question is on the in-service courses.  The in-service provision has been drawn up by in-service committees consisting of serving teachers who have designed the parameters and course content of the in-service courses under the NCCA.  They are implementing their own demands.  Secondly, I have met recently with the two teaching unions and have fully implemented my promise to them with regard to hugely increased funds for in-service courses and the course content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will certainly arrange for extra handbooks to be sent to each school.  That is a matter of procedure.  With regard to advance documentation to each school in respect of in-service days, I shall arrange for that matter to be reported to the teachers who are arranging the days. That might well be the best way of dealing with it.  With regard to examinations, I will be receiving a report from the NCCA &mdash; I expect that shortly &mdash; but any introduction of the new curriculum must be <Col N="823" /> proceeded with along the lines of the main answer I have given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is an increase in the school book grant in that the change to the junior certificate involves the abandonment in many cases of prescribed texts which means students must buy a much wider range of books than previously? Therefore there is need for increased school book grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of my dealings I deal with the executives of the teachers' union who, I am quite sure, represent the views of serving teachers. Also when I go around to the schools I have occasion to meet constantly with serving teachers.  Indeed, it is not that long since I was one of those teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the increase in the school book grant, this year we were enabled to give 20 per cent of an increase to the post primary schools in this respect and that level will apply next year also, making a total increase of 40 per cent.  I am determined that is not going to go in increased demands by the booksellers. There has to be commonsense.  The <Col N="824" /> books should go to service necessitous pupils, not to serve commercial interests.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister what other steps she is taking and if is she aware that Dublin is 26th of all the counties in third level education and that 62 per cent of Dublin students are without grants?  This is the highest number of students without grant assistance.  Would the Minister agree that this is an area which she should address, particularly in view of the statistics from UCD which show that 564 sons and daughters of farmers, only 37 offspring of unskilled workers and only 72 from skilled workers were in receipt of grants in UCD?</P>

      <P>Surely the building of colleges will not assist Dublin which already has three universities, the Dublin Institute of Tecnology, etc.  The additional college in Tallaght will be of immense value but surely without further assistance to the disadvantaged areas, <Col N="825" /> particularly Dublin, extra pupils will not take up these places.  Can the Minister say if she has any intention of increasing the level of grants or ensuring that the Dublin students get their fair share of grants?</P>

      <P>There are two sectors, namely the HEA and the third level VEC colleges sectors.  I know the Deputy is aware of that but I want to separate, for answering purposes, the two areas. Under the HEA sector the statistics quoted by Deputy Mac Giolla are correct. The Clancy report indicated the clear need for the allocation of further places to Dublin students.  It was one of the issues which led me to the conclusion that Tallaght had to begin the planning for it.  As and from September 1989, with a contribution of European money and national money, over 90 per cent of the students in all the VEC colleges throughout the country &mdash; including the DIT in Dublin &mdash; are in receipt of grant aid, fees and maintenance to a greater or lesser degree.  That is a great advance for students.  It will not remove the anomalies; it will go part of the way but it is not enough.  The enhancement of the VEC colleges is one of the priorities under the ERDF funding.  That enhancement, refurbishment and additional places will allow for an increased input of students to the VEC colleges sector. Also the HEA had a committee meeting with the Secretary of my Department. They are looking at ways in which extra places can be allocated within the existing colleges.</P>

      <P>The post of remedial teacher is a permanent one, but the teacher may be shared by several schools or be redeployed among individual schools.  In the primary school area where there are 3,247 national schools, a remedial teaching service is provided to approximately 1,100 of these through 857 posts of remedial teachers.</P>
      <P>In post-primary schools almost 300 ex-quota posts are available for remedial teachers.  Also, some 650 second level teachers have participated in the Department's course in remedial education.</P>
      <P>As regards additional appointments, I announced yesterday the appointment of an additional 30 remedial teachers, 95 additional teaching posts for disadvantaged schools and the establishment of the pilot projects about which I spoke.</P>
      <P>Also, as no detailed documentation on remedial education had been provided for schools, my Department issued guidelines on remedial education in 1988.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 15, 53, 78 and 121 <Col N="829" /> together.  Youthreach offers a co-ordinated and integrated programme of training, work experience and temporary employment to early school leavers.  The programme is a Department of Education-Labour joint initiative operated through the vocational education committees and FÁS.</P>
      <P>I am assuming responsibility for the foundation year of the programme which I have introduced this year in 11 VECs. These VECs were selected on the basis of evidence that they had a high proportion of early school leavers.  While there are at present no VEC Youthreach centres in Counties Laois, Offaly, Carlow, Kilkenny, Mayo, Clare and Meath, the programme provided in FÁS centres serves these areas.</P>
      <P>I had made provision for 500 additional places in the Youthreach Programme in VEC centres with effect from 1990 and these will be selected by reference to the numbers of early school leavers, their distribution across the country and the services already available in each area.  I am not yet in a position to say whether the areas listed in the questions will be included in the extension of the programme. I will certainly bear in mind the interests of the Deputies who have put down the questions to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if it is the case that of the 1,000 places allocated so far under Youthreach, only 600 have actually been taken up? Furthermore, is she not aware that in the majority of VEC areas to which Youthreach does not apply, 27 VECs in all, there are substantial problems of educational disadvantage which need to be addressed urgently?  The idea of introducing patchwork schemes in particular areas, which are politically selected, is undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This initiative was mooted when Deputy Bruton was in Government.  It was noted in the <i>Programme for Action in Education</i>, a book I have found fascinating, as something which should be done for young people <Col N="830" /> who felt alienated from the formal education system.  I am sure the then Minister was setting about her business in regard to it but then came the general election and the Minister for Labour and I decided to look further into this proposal.  Based on this, Youthreach was initiated.  It is not possible overnight to bring Youthreach or any other programme into every corner of Ireland.  Within the area specified by the Deputies who put down the questions there are of course great learning needs and always will be.  I would hope that in the allocation of the extra places for 1990 the educational needs of the disadvantaged who have for one reason or another left the formal education system for some months will be addressed.  I take the point that there are in all of those VEC areas many disadvantaged young people who need the types of programmes we are able to deliver here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though progressively since the early eighties there has been an increase in the percentage of young people who stay on in the second level system and also an increase in the percentage of those who get formal certification, there still remains a problem to be addressed and we intend to do that in a phased way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not concerned that we have a two-tiered system for disadvantaged students?  On the one hand we have community training workshops with very limited resources and on the other, we have the Youthreach programme with considerably more resoruces. I understand also that the people operating the Youthreach programme <Col N="831" /> are better paid than those involved in the community training workshops.  Is the Minister not concerned about this?  Has she any plans to re-establish the Social Guarantee Advisory Board to ensure the provision of adequate services for all our disadvantaged young people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>To refer to it as a two-tiered system is not to use the correct appellation but I understand what the Deputy means.  There is the FÁS scheme with the community training workshops and then there is Youthreach.  Youthreach is not yet an amalgamation but it combines two years.  One is the foundation year which deals with learning as in a school, although it does not take place in a school, and the second year combines the academic nature of the foundation year plus the practicalities of the community training workshops.  The best of both existing schemes is combined in the new Youthreach scheme.  It is still in its first year, which is mainly the responsibility of the Department of Education. Only in the second year will the combination of the Departments of Labour and Education be seen.  Regarding payment of the people involved, I have not that information with me since the question does not refer to it.  The concerns which Deputy Deenihan expressed will be ameliorated when the scheme completes its first year and goes into its second year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department did not sanction the creation of a permanent whole time teacher of commerce post as proposed by the town of Wexford Vocational Education Committee because they were not satisfied that the creation of such a post was justified in <Col N="832" /> the circumstances.  This decision was arrived at following consideration of all relevant factors such as enrolment trends and the present ratio of permanent whole time teaching staff to other teaching staff in the scheme.</P>
      <P>Enrolment trends in the town of Wexford VEC show that junior and senior cycle enrolments have declined from 571 in September 1987 to 553 in September 1988 and 507 in September 1989.  I am aware that VPT enrolments have increased by 30 since September 1988 but any additional appointments generated by increased VTP numbers are required to be of a temporary or part-time nature in accordance with the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the present enrolment in the town of Wexford vocational school fully justifies the appointment, in accordance with the guidelines issued by her Department, and that the non-sanction of this appointment puts at risk a highly innovative programme on information technology which is in jeopardy because of the lack of a permanent full-time teacher of commerce?  The view in Wexford is that because of her plans to abolish the town of Wexford VEC she wants to equate the enrolment figures in Wexford town with those in the rest of the county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy means by equating.  The Deputy's supplementary question refers to enrolment trends.  The town of Wexford VEC have one school and enrolments have declined from 571 in September 1987 to 507 in September 1989.  I am aware that there has been an increase in the VTP enrolment but by regulation additional appointments accruing under the VTP fall to be filled in a temporary or part-time capacity.  The Deputy raised the matter of the information technology programme and I will certainly undertake to look into that matter since I would not like to see any danger to the programme.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister to join with me in congratulating the district justice on the professional and humanitarian manner in which he dealt with this case.  The Minister will be aware that the justice was faced with the stark option of putting a 13 year old child into Mountjoy Prison &mdash; with all its implications &mdash; or releasing her because there is no secure detention units available for young girls. Will the Minister agree that instead of it being the responsibility of three Departments &mdash; Justice, Health and Education &mdash; to provide care and security, it would be better to have one agency to service the area, i.e. the Department of Health?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that three Departments dealing in this area causes difficulty and this is the case in many aspects of youth affairs, for that reason the Government decided that an inter-departmental group of senior officials, under the chairmanship of the Minister for Justice, should tackle this problem.  It is accepted that there is a need for action but it is not simply a case of providing physically secure accommodation.  In the case of a 13 year old we must try to provide the kind of services which do not impinge too much on her freedom. Consequently, it is a complicated issue which has been the subject of much consideration over the last number of years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 16, 27, 30, 37, 39 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>In the case of primary schools, the curriculum, as set out in the two volume primary school curriculum handbook, asks schools and teachers to base their work on the child's environment, to provide for the individual differences among the pupils and to aim at a degree of integration of the areas of the curriculum.  It allows a considerable degree of flexibility to schools and teachers in adapting the curriculum to their own situations.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, there would obviously be a difficulty in providing a summary statement of the kind envisaged on a national basis which would accommodate the needs of individual parents. However, schools are strongly urged to develop a school plan covering many areas of the school's activities, including curriculum.  It is possible that information on the curriculum could be provided to parents in the context of the school plan.</P>
      <P>Currently, as Deputies will be aware, the primary school curriculum is being examined by the Primary Curriculum Review Body appointed by me.  It may well be that the Deputies' suggestion would best be considered when the review body's report has been presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the period of compulsory education in post-primary schools there are prescribed syllabi which are published for purchase by interested parties.  This arrangement caters adequately for the demand for such information.  Moreover, schools in general are very anxious to secure the co-operation of parents in the education of their children and, in the <Col N="840" /> normal course, respond willingly to any queries parents might have about the conduct and content of their children's education.  Furthermore, a representative of the National Parents' Council is among the 16 members of the National Council for Curriculum Assessment, one of whose functions is to advise on the curricula at first and second levels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that home/school links constitute one of the crucial factors in determining the success of education?  Is she aware that the recent study undertaken by Alastair Macbeth indicated that, comparatively speaking, Ireland emerged one of the worst countries in Europe in terms of the efficacy of home/school links? Would she agree that this may be due in part to the fact that, traditionally, parents have had very small levels of representation, for example, one representative only on the national curriculum body to which she referred which is totally inadequate?  Would she agree that this assertion should be considered as a matter of urgency by the committee in question so that action can be taken soon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I share many of the Deputy's sentiments that there should be more parental representation on various educational bodies.  I would be prepared to examine the NCCA in the light of that representation.  I have been thinking about it for some time and have received requests on the issue.  With regard to home/school links, I agree these are vital in promoting parental integration in school activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department recently undertook a survey of the disadvantaged scheme, initiated by my predecessor, stipulating that a sum of money be allocated each year to schools in disadvantaged areas. One of the aims of that scheme was to encourage home/school liaison.  The results of that survey clearly show that, while the funds in their entirety have been well spent &mdash; although much more could be spent &mdash; the portion which should be allocated to home/school liaison has not been adequately addressed. <Col N="841" /> I am now reviewing that scheme for disadvantaged areas and its funding to ascertain how it could more adequately address the question of home/school liaison. Obviously if all the partners in education, first, the pupils, then parents, teachers and management, work together it will be for the better dissemination of all knowledge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware &mdash; as I am sure she is &mdash; that teachers in national schools are organising extremely useful meetings for parents at the commencement of each school year?  I should say I speak with experience in this regard. Unfortunately, a written statement of the information conveyed at that meeting is not made available afterwards.  Even if that information imparted orally at a meeting were put in writing and circulated to parents, would the Minister agree that that alone would be extremely useful for parents who are unable to attend and would help others to remember what they have been told at the meeting at the beginning of the year?  Without any measure of compulsion, would the Minister ask schools to ascertain whether that could be arranged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not as young as Deputy Bruton so I do not have first hand knowledge of what takes place in the opening days of the primary school term. I know the Deputy has a young family.  I am aware, of course, that schools are very good at holding these open parental/school discussion evenings at the commencement of the school term, inviting parents and informing them of what will take place in the school year ahead. I will take up with management the question of conveying that information in some written form to parents.  At primary level it would be a matter for management and the unions together.  Without any element of compulsion, I agree it is a suggestion worthy of consideration and one which the schools might well be interested in implementing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether there are any proposals to extend St. Angela's Language and Learning Unit, Scoil Chaitríona, Baggot Street, Dublin 2, and to place the unit with its facilities and resources on a permanent basis to cater for language disordered children in the Southern Greater Dublin area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that official sanction was given to the facility in question only because of the special relationship which had been established between the pupils and teacher, prior to it being recognised by my Department.  I should also mention that three of the four children currently enrolled there came from addresses in the north city which are much nearer to the special class facilities for the language and learning impaired attached to St. Patrick's national school, Drumcondra. In the circumstances, it is not proposed to lift the restriction relating to the enrolment of new pupils.</P>
      <P>Therefore my Department have no proposals at present to extend or make permanent the special class facility for the language and learning impaired at Scoil Chaitríona, Baggot Street, Dublin 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister might take an interest in this question because I am aware that she was taking a personal interest in this whole area.  I am saddened by the reply given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister of State aware that some children attending this unit were being allocated to mentally retarded units prior to its establishment?  Is he aware that, in one case, a child made fantastic progress since the establishment of this unit?  Additionally, is he aware that this is a well recognised problem in both the United Kingdom and the United States? Furthermore, is he aware that the Ursuline Sisters have specialised in this area, incurring considerable expense in <Col N="843" /> training one of their sisters to establish this unit?  Finally, is he aware that the unit in Drumcondra was established after the one in Baggot Street and that it was on the basis of the Baggot Street unit that the Drumcondra one was established?  I would appeal to the Minister and the Minister of State not to allow the Ursuline Sisters services be dispensed with in such a frivolous manner by the closure of this unit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no intention to close this unit; it is simply a question of restricting the enrolement of new pupils. It has to do with the fact that there is adequate provision in St. Patrick's national school, Drumcondra, as indeed there is in a number of other schools throughout the city, for the young pupils concerned.  I agree with Deputy S. Barrett that very good work is being undertaken in this school but so also is there a good work being done in the other schools in question.  I might remind the Deputy that when my predecessor, Deputy Kenny, agreed to the recognition of this school, it was on a strict, temporary basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>

Is he aware that the unit in Drumcondra was established after the proven success of the Baggot Street one?  Is the Minister aware that, in reply to a written question on Wednesday, 1 November in relation to the unit in Drumcondra, this year eight applications were received for enrolment in the current school year, three of which have been selected to fill vacancies?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the agreement reached by the Government with the INTO in negotiations under the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the enrolment figures for appointment and retention of teachers in primary schools will be reduced by one unit at each level of the enrolment schedule with effect from 1 September 1990.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Government</i> provides that a continuing review of the pupil-teacher ratio at primary and post-primary levels will take place in consultation with the central review committee with regard to the feasibility of a further reduction under a new <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
      <P>I should add that I have specifically required the Primary Education Review Body to deal with the question of demographic trends and their implications in preparing their report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is most unsatisfactory.  Would the Minister agree that the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio is causing teaching difficulties as well as enormous disciplinary problems in certain schools in the Dublin area and in some schools that I know of in rural areas?  Would the Minister agree that the increase in the pupil-teacher ratio at post-primary level, particularly in vocational schools, is causing enormous difficulty for practical subject training?  Has the Minister addressed that question in conjunction with the <i>Programme for National Development?</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Mac Giolla that addressing the pupil-teacher ratio is an overriding consideration within the Department of Education and with the Government in <Col N="852" /> general.  Under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> we have already made arrangements, as I outlined in my earlier reply, and under the central review committee arrangements are in place with all the teacher unions whereby these issues can be addressed in a progressive way.  I hope that talks which are due to commence again in the spring will prove satisfactory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister recognises that this is not a matter between the Minister and the teacher unions and that the parents and pupils are involved.  Why is the Minister not addressing them on the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I must put on record that the teachers' unions are not just concerned about themselves, but are also concerned about the pupils in their care.  When they come to meet me or the Government, they constantly speak of the issues concerning pupils.  I constantly meet Deputy Mac Giolla with members of the national parents council at primary and post-primary level.  I also meet with the management bodies of primary schools, and of the vocational sector and the voluntary secondary sector.  I meet regularly with the various bodies concerned with education.  I am of the opinion, as is everybody, that the issue of the pupil-teacher ratio is going to be tackled and we have already started on that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the improved teacher-pupil ratio, as we have 10,000 fewer pupils starting national school this year, has the Minister any plans to make provision for emotionally disturbed children, who are different from remedial pupils and are causing a great many problems in our schools?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a very relevant issue.  Apart from the <Col N="853" /> allocation of extra teachers to what are termed disadvantaged schools and extra remedial teachers there remains the need to meet the problems of the children about whom the Deputy speaks.  I have given the go-ahead to the pilot project for the primary school psychological service. This need should have been addressed many years ago.  Be that as it may, we are making a start now.  The psychological society have advised that what they would like to see is two pilot projects running for three years, with proper monitoring and evaluation.  We would hope at the end of that stage gradually to extend the service.  The areas chosen for the pilot project are west County Dublin, embracing a large area, and also a rural-urban area further down the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that at present teachers feel abandoned by the Department of Education in matters of discipline as they do not seem to have any clear guidelines under which to operate?  I heartily agree with the question which Deputy Mac Giolla tabled on the matter.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio introduced by her on a discriminatory basis against vocational schools has caused particular difficulties in introducing new subjects? Because of the operation of the last in first out principle, a school that gets a new subject teacher, is likely to lose him or her if there is any reduction in numbers at the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of circulars on the code of discipline and the directions issuing from that was tabled as a priority question but it was not reached because of the extensive supplementary questions on the three previous questions. The pupil-teacher ratio in <Col N="854" /> vocational and community-comprehensive schools is to be reviewed in the light of the Government's commitment under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  I would not accept the assertion that the introduction of a subject is militated against because of the present staff structures.  Most schools are innovative and have made great strides in the introduction of new subjects.</P>

      <P>I propose to take <Col N="857" /> Questions Nos. 13, 23, 28, 52, 69, 112, 115 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>For the school year 1988-89, 39 schools received payment from my Department in respect of the introduction of an additional modern continental language into the curriculum.  Payments made were in respect of the employment of part-time teachers necessary to introduce the subject and varied in each case depending on the scale of the additional provision being made.  Appropriate financial aid will be continued to those schools for the current year.  The schools in question were those which responded to my initiative in this area by introducing the additional subject in September 1988.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to provide financial assistance to a number of additional schools where an additional modern language is being introduced into the curriculum for 1989-90.  Applications before my Department are at present being considered. It will not, however, be possible to provide payment for additional part-time hours for the teaching of modern continental languages to every post-primary school in the country.</P>
      <P>The decisions in question will be based on such criteria as the extent to which modern continental languages are provided for at present, the extent of such provision in the immediate area and the demand for the additional language within the school.</P>
      <P>It was noticeable from the operation of the redeployment scheme at post-primary level that many schools were seeking teachers in German.  These teachers would, of course, be employed within quota and would not feature in the present scheme.  I am arranging for the list of schools aided in 1988-89 to be sent to the Deputies, and when the information is to hand, for 1989-90 as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give a little more information as to how the schools are selected?  In view of the fact that her Department's inspectors at post-primary level do not visit schools regularly, how are they capable of deciding on the demand within the school and whether there is a need to give additional <Col N="858" /> resources to one school in a particular town rather than another?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of a letter to all the schools and by public statements, I conveyed what I intend to do.  The schools wrote in with their requirements and we looked at the quota position and the inspectors' reports, many of which were received.  There is a unit in my Department headed by one of the chief inspectors who is monitoring this matter. An interesting factor is that in 1987-88 the number of post-primary schools providing at least two modern continental languages was 269, a very big increase on previous years.  As I have said, another 40 were added to that and I would say the figure will be much higher for 1989-90 as will be seen when the returns which the Department have requested from the various schools are to hand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the Irish educational system in the last two to three years has been bedevilled by the introduction of selective schemes where the Minister has decided to give resources to one school rather than another, and that this leads to invidious comparisons and all sorts of unworthy suggestions of political favouritism being shown?  Even where that may not be the case, the fact that it is possible is unhealthy in terms of educational policy making.</P>

      <P>Nuair a chríochnaigh mé leis an méid a bhí le rá agam roimh lón dúirt mé gur ceann des na laigí is mó bhí ag baint leis an Bhille a bhí os comhair an Tí na nár deineadh aon tagairt dearfa dos na leasuithe atá molta nó atá riachtanach don Bhille bunúsach um Údaras na Gaeltachta 1979.  Maidir leis an méid eile atá le rá agam, ba mhaith liom seans a thabhairt do na Teachtaí eile ar mhiste leo páirt a ghlacadh san díospóireacht seo.  Ba mhaith liom a rá arís go poiblí, mar tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh seo ar chuntas oifigiúil na Dála, an tseachtain seo chugainn beimid ag cur le chéile ballraíocht do Chomhchoiste don Ghaeilge agus beidh liosta daoine ainmnithe dár ndoigh ar fógra don Mháirt nó don Chéadaoin seo chugainn.  Bhí sé de nós agam féin feidhmiú ar an gcoiste seo <Col N="905" /> cúpla uair agus níl mé sásta leanúint ar aghaidh leis sin toisc go bhfuil cur i gcéill chomh mór sin san Teach seo agus san Oireachtas go geinearálta agus san phobal chomh mór san go bhfuil easpa dáiríreachta ag baint le haon iarracht atá á dhéanamh faoi láthair.  Is cuimhin liom mar shampla na tuarascálacha a cuireadh chugat féin, agus bhí tú sásta tacaíocht a thabhairt don chomhchoiste sin ag an am seo, áiseanna cearta a chur ar fáil san Teach seo ar gach leibhéal chun úsáid na Gaeilge a chur ar aghaidh.  Níl tada ann faoi láthair.  Níl aon rud ag tarlú.  Is cuimhin liom &mdash; agus seo sampla beag amháin &mdash; nuair a bhí mé ag obair ar an Chomhchoiste don Ghaeilge san 25ú Dáil ní raibh typist ná duine eile chun na nótaí a thogaint.  D'imigh mé fhéin thíos chun páipéar a léamh ar san an chomhchoiste i gCathair na Gaillimhe do chruinniú cinn bliana agus bhí ar an fhear a bhí ag obair go páirt aimseartha don chomhchoiste an rud a scríobh amach dom le lámhscríbhinn na nótaí a bhí aige.  Agus b'éigean dom mo chuid clodóireachta a dhéanamh as m'acmhainní féin.  Ní foláir dom a rá go bhfuil sé thar am don Teach seo a bheith i ndáiríre faoin nGaeilge agus faoin nGaeltacht.  Faoi láthair, ní aon chabhair í go mbeadh easpa iomlán in Aireacht na Gaeltachta.  Is é an Taoiseach féin Aire na Gaeltachta agus ba chóir go mbeadh sé anseo agus na Gaeltachtaí, an Ghaeilge agus teagasc na Gaeilge ina n-ábhar díospóireachta againn.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith go mbeadh tuiscint ag an Aire Stáit nach raibh cleíreach ar fáil, go lán aimsearthach, do Chomhchoiste na Gaeilge.  Tá mé ag tarraingt anois ar mo thaithí féin mar bhall den Chomhchoiste sin leis na blianta.  Tá tuarascálacha curtha amach againn ar an ábhar seo ach ní bhfuarathas réiteach air go fóill.  Labhraím Gaeilge sa Teach toisc go bhfuil suim agam sa teanga ach tá <Col N="906" /> na coinníolacha ag eirí níos measa gach seachtain.  Nílim sásta leanúint ar aghaidh leis an cur i gcéill.  Dealraítear domsa go bhfuil mo chearta pearsanta mar ionadaí Gaeltachta dá shéanadh.  Tá sé an-deacair obair a dhéanamh leis na Rannaí Stáit seachas Roinn na Gaeltachta; tá sé deacair freisin i gcás na n-Údarás Aitiúil.  Tá fíneáil dá gcur ar dhaoine taoi lathair, toisc nach bhfuair siad leagan Gaeilge d'fhógra ón Údarás áitiúil; is i gContae an Chláir amháin atá an fógra ar fáil trí Ghaeilge.</P>
      <P>Leisciúlacht agus cur i gcéill is cúis leis an bhail seo.  B'shin an fáth gur cuireadh déistean orm nuair a léigh mé faoin gceannródaíocht atá déanta i dtionscail stráitéiseacha agus i gcásanna eile.  Tá an seafóid seo á scaipeadh thart i gcónaí. Tá freagraí dearfa ag teastáil uaim maidir leis na ceisteanna seo leanas: An bhfuil Údarás na Gaeltachta tar éis leasuithe a éileamh ar Roinn na Gaeltachta agus ar Aire na Gaeltachta?  An bhfuil leasuithe do bhun Acht Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979, ceapaithe ag an Aire Stáit nó ag a ionadaí, nó an bhfuil sé i gceist aige iad a cheapadh laistigh de thréimhse na Dála seo?  Má tá sé ar intinn aige a leithéid de leasuithe a dhéanamh, an dtabharfar freagracht d'Údarás na Gaeltachta i leith chúrsaí bóthair, cúrsaí droichid, cúrsaí céibheanna agus go mór mór i leith cúrsaí tithíochta?  An bhfuil sé ar intinn aige moltaí a chur ar aghaidh go n-aistreofaí cumhachtaí ó na comhairlí contae agus ó údaráis áitiúla eile go hÚdarás na Gaeltachta?  Muna bhfuil faoi a leithéid seo a dhéanamh, an ndearbhódh sé go bhfuil sé sásta le réimse cumhachtaí an Údaráis mar a mhaireann faoi láthair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir leis na cumhachtaí seo, thairis sin, cad iad na suimeanna airgid, go beacht, a cuireadh i leataobh do chur chun cinn na teanga sna Gaeltachtaí éagsúla le blianta beaga anuas, agus an mó a caitheadh ar an obair seo?  Nach fíor go bfhuil daoine ceapaithe chun moltaí a chur in eagar ach nach bhfuil an t-airgead ann chun an obair sin a dhéanamh?  Cén stádas faoi láthair atá ag an tuarascail faoi chúrsaí cumarsáide go ginearálta, agus faoi chúrsaí theilifisé sa Ghaeltacht ach go háirithe?  An nglacann an tAire agus <Col N="907" /> an Roinn leis an tuarascáil is deireanaí agus an bhfuil sé ar intinn aige labhairt leis an Teach ina thaobh?  An molfaidh sé go gcuirfear airgead ar fáil do sheirbhís teilifíse Gaeltachta ón gcrannchur náisiúnta nó an n-usáidfear céatadán ar leith d'airgead na gceadúnas teilifíse chun seirbhís teilifíse Gaeltachta a bhunú is a fhorbairt? Cad'na thaobh nár cuireadh moltaí dearfa i leith chúrsaí caidrimh ar aghaidh go dtí an Comhphobal Eorpach?  Maidir le cúrsaí farantóireachta, cad 'na thaobh nár cuireadh moltaí i dtaobh na ceiste seo agus i leith chumarsáid idir-oileánach ar aghaidh go dtí an Eoraip?  Gealladh do mhuintir na n-oileán go mbeadh réiteach ar cheist seo na farantóireachta, toisc scéim a bheith á chur faoi bhráid an Chomhphobail Eorpaigh.  Níor tharla amhlaidh.</P>
    <P>Tá mé féin i bhfábhar an Údaráis cé gur cuimhin liom, nuair a tháinig mé isteach sa Teach seo i 1981 go raibh daoine ann ag an tráth sin a bhí glan ina aghaidh.  Bhí an Teachta Ó Eochaidh ina Thaoiseach ag an am agus bhí an bheirt againn ar aon aigne go mba chóir a leithéid d'Údarás a bheith ann.  Is é atá á éileamh agamsa ar son an Údaráis ná na cumhachtai agus na hacmhainni cuí, chun go mbeadh sé ar a chumas feidhmiú mar Údarás forbartha ar chomhleibhéal le hÚdaráis Fhorbartha eile na tíre.  Tá sé léirithe roimhe seo ag an Teachta Enda Kenny, nach bhfuil Údarás na Gaeltachta ar chomhchéim le SFADCo maidir le deontaisí agus soláthar tacaíochta.</P>
    <P>Ní mór dúinn ach oiread a mheabhrú dúinn féin go bhfuil ráta imirce na limisteár Gaeltachta a dhá nó a trí oiread níos airde ná an meán náisiúnta.  Ní daoine óga faoi bhun cheithre bliana is fiche amháin atá ag imeacht as an nGaeltacht, ach teaghlaigh iomlána.  Easpa fostaíochta agus easpa infheistithe is cúis leis an imirce seo.  Is iontach an rud é go raibh 4,946 duine fostaithe sa Ghaeltacht sa bhliain 1987 agus gur tharla meadú 188 ar líon na bpostanna seo faoi dheireadh na bliana 1988.  Níl brí dá laghad leis an staitistic seo nuair a chuirtear san áireamh líon na ndaoine a bhí ag lorg fostaíochta sa Ghaeltacht le linn na tréimhse sin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="908" /> Bhí mé ag éisteacht leis na ceisteanna faoi chúrsaí oideachais.  Nach iontadh an rud é go bhfuil na coinníollacha is measa sa tír seo beagnach &mdash; b'fhéidir go bhfuil scoil nó dhó sa tír seo níos measa &mdash; i scoil atá ag feidhmiú don dara leibhéal i nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe.  Tá mé ag caint faoi ghairmscoil Cholmchille in Indreabhán, áit a bhfuil na coinníollacha a bhí ar na tuismitheoirí a fhulaing chomh dona le haon dream eile sa tír seo agus ní mór dúinn bheith cúramach faoi na hinstitiúidí agus na háiseanna oideachais atá ag teastáil go géar sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Os rud é go bhfuil Údarás na Gaeltachta chomh maith ag plé leis an saol sna hoileáin éagsúla, nach bhfuil sé scannalach nach bhfuil aon tuarascáil curtha ar fáil ón Ministerial Island Committee don Dáil atá imithe.  Chomh maith leis sin, tá moltaí curtha ar aghaidh ag Comhdháil na nOileán don Taoiseach agus do na hAirí éagsúla agus níl aon mholadh dearfach ag teacht os comhair na Dála seo. Mar cheist deireanach don Aire Stáit an bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Údarás nó ag an Roinn áiseanna chumarsáide a chur ar fáil ar chostas an-bheag ar fad chun go mbeadh siad in ann úsáid a bhaint as an teicneolaíocht nua atá forbartha taobh istigh de na Gaeltachtaí féin ag Tele Gael agus na comhlachtaí eile in iarthar na Gaillimhe.  Tá a lán daoine sa tír seo agus ceapann siad os rud é go bhfuil an tÚdarás ann go bhfuil gach rud ceart leis an Ghaeilge agus gach rud ceart leis an Ghaeltacht.  Chun an fhírinne a rá ceapann a lán daoine, mar shampla, ar Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe os rud é go bhfuil an tÚdarás ann go bhfuil daoine ina gcónaí san Ghaeltacht agus go bhfuil siad ceart go leor, nach bhfuil Údarás ar leith acusan.  An toradh atá ar an scéal ná nach bhfuil Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe ag cur tithe ar fáil i nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe, agus ní dhearna siad sin le fada.  Cuireann siad demountables agus mar sin ar fáil.  Ach níor chuir siad aon scéim de thithíocht poiblí ar fáil le fada.  Agus tá an tuiscint ann go bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta ceart go leor ós rud é go bhfuil a nÚdarás féin acu.  Caithfidh muid tabhairt faoi go mbeidh an ceart ag an Údarás, go mbeidh <Col N="909" /> na cumhachtaí nua acu, agus is cumhachtaí beaga chun an fhírinne a rá, atá i gceist againne an tráthnóna seo.  Ach níl aon seans againn, ón am ar cuireadh do na Tithe seo, mar shampla, an chéad tuarascáil a cuireadh i gcló i leith chúrsaí Gaeltachta, is é sin The Mulcahy report i 1926.  Bhí 600 leathanach ann agus bhí costás faoi bhun £300 ag baint leis.  Bhí a lán tuarascálacha curtha i gcló ón am sin ar aghaidh in 1926 ach bhí na moltaí ann an uair sin, agus caithfidh muid féachaint chuige go mbeidh dream againne, go mbeidh comhlacht againne, go mbeidh Údarás againne a mbeidh na pleananna ag an Údarás, a mbeidh seans acu, a mbeidh scóip acu, a mbeidh feidhmeannaigh acu, a mbeidh cumhachtaí acu.  Agus go mbeadh na heagraisí eile ar nós na comhairlí chontae sásta na cumhachtaí sin a ligint don Údarás agus ina dhiaidh sin le daoine níos díograisí a chur ar fáil. Ní chuireann sé iontas órm féin nuair atá daoine ag caint faoi 1992 agus an Single Market agus cohesion agus mar sin de. Níor cuireadh aon dream ar bun a thabharfadh aire do na Gaeltachtaí amháin fiú amháin ar leibhéal chomhairle a thabhairt. Agus ina dhiaidh sin níor cuireadh moladh ar bith ar aghaidh do na Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>Mar alt eile ar chúrsaí Teilifís Gaeltachta, níl moltaí curtha ar aghaidh ag an Rialtas faoin cheann teidil sin faoi na minority languages.  Cén fáth go bhfuil seo ag tarlú.  A lán den tuairimíocht atá taobh thiar de seo ar fad, ar bhealach baineann sé le leisciúlacht, baineann sé le coimeádachas, baineann sé leis an sórt obair leamh atá ar siúl i leith na Gaeltachta, ach dar ndóigh na daoine atá ag fulaingt as an rud ar fad ná na clainn atá ag cailliúint páistí gach seachtain toisc nach bhfuil fostaíocht ar fáil.  Is féidir a lán a dhéanamh, mar a dúirt an tAire, faoi fhorbairt achmhainní nadúrtha agus mar sin de.  Ach céard is féidir a dhéanamh faoí iascaireacht mar shampla, muna bhfuil na bóithrí ann agus tuigeann na madraí sa tsráid go bhfuil bóithrí Chonamara chomh dona is atá siad.  Agus arís níl aon mholadh dearfa curtha ar aghaidh don chomhphobal ná d'aon áit eile chun aon rud dearfa a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="910" /> Is fada ó thosaigh mé féin mo shuim sa teanga agus sna Gaeltachtaí, ach tá mé ag éirí an-tuirseach ag an bpointe seo, mar mar a dúirt mé an dearcadh i leith na teanga agus i leith na nGaeltachtaí, tá sé níos measa anois fiú amháin sa Teach seo, níos measa anois ar leibhéal áitiúil. Mar shampla, nuair a thosaigh mé polaitaiocht áitiúil sna seachtóidí, bhí sé de nós ag daoine a bhí tofa mar shampla mar mhaor na Gaillimhe cúpla focal a rá i nGaeilge.  Tá sin beagnach imithe glan agus an rud nach bhfuil ag teastáil ón Ghaeilge ná níos mó, mar a thug mé air, den cur i gcéill seo.  Is sórt masla é daíríre, go bhfuil daoine i Roinn na Gaeltachta sásta, teacht ós comhair an Tí seo agus Bille de cúpla línte a chur os ár gcomhair agus a iarraidh orainn, níl ag teastáil uainn ach go rithimíd an cúpla focal seo, an abairt seo, an t-alt siúd, chun an leibhéal a árdú ó £60 milliún go £80 milliún. Má tá siad chun aon stró a chur isteach, tuige nach bhfuil siad in ann féachaint ar an mbun Acht i 1979 agus leasuithe cuimsitheacha foirfe a chur os ár gcomhair ionnas go mbeadh díospóireacht ceart againn.</P>

      <P>Os rud é gurb é seo an chéad uair dom páirt a ghlacadh i ndiospóireacht a bhfuil baint aige leis an nGaeltacht ba mhaith liom, agus cé nach bhfuil an tAire Stáit ag Roinn na Gaeltachta anseo inniu ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh le mo chomh Theachta, Pat the Cope Gallagher, as a phost nua.  Guím gach rath ar féin agus ar a chuid oibre sa phost nua sin.  Tá fhios agam agus táim cinnte go n-oibreoidh sé go dian dícheallach ar son mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus dul chun chinn na Gaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ar ndóigh cuirim fáilte roimh an Bille gairid seo atá os ár gcomhair inniu, a chuirfidh ar chumas an Rialtais £20 milliúin sa bhreis a chur ar fáil d'Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Ó bunaíodh an tÚdrás i 1980 rinne siad obair mhór le gnéithe eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta a fheabhsú agus an Gaeilge a chur chun chinn.  Ní raibh an obair seo furasta ach déanaim comhghairdeas le lucht an Údaráis agus go háirithe leis na hoifigigh a d'obair go <Col N="911" /> crua leis na deacrachtaí a shárú agus a rinne an oiread sin leis an Ghaeltacht a fhorbairt.  Ó 1987 nuair a cuireadh Bille Údarás na Gaeltachta tríd rinneadh a lán dul chun tosaigh go mór mhór gnéithe ard teicneolaíochta, telecumarsáide, feirmeoireacht éisc agus rinneadh méadú mór i gcuid de ceantracha beaga Gaeltachta iad féin a fhorbairt.  Ach mar sin féin tá imní orm faoin mheath atá ag teacht i gcónaí ar labhairt na Gaeilge agus an gá atá le teacht oibrithe don Ghaeltacht.  Tá againn sa tír seo líon mhór de dhaoine óga oilte agus measaim nach bhfuil an tÚdarás agus na húdaráis oideachais uile ag obair go leor le chéile le cúrsaí nua a chur ar fáil dóibh ionnas go mbeidh siad oilte níos fearr don tionsclaíocht nua aimseartha a bheadh oiriúnach don Ghaeltacht.  Sé tá i gceist agam anseo ná níos mó béime a chur ar chúrsaí innealltóireachta agus ríomhaireachta i scoileanna dara leibhéal agus cúrsaí tuairisceoireachta chomh maith le feirmeoireacht éisc a chur ar fáil.  Na tionscail a bhí coitianta don Ghaeltacht le blianta anuas, tá mórán acu seo nach bhfuil ag éirí leo go maith le tamall fada.  Cuid acu atá i dtrioblóid airgid.  Cím seo ag tarlú i mo cheanntar féin i gCill Cártha agus i gCarraig agus i nGleann Cholmcille.  Tá oibreacha beaga sna ceantracha seo ag druid síos, rud a chuirfidh tuilleadh daoine amach as obair, agus tá mórán fáthanna leis seo &mdash; an t-athrú airgid, an structúr tionsclaíochta, margaidh agus rudaí mar sin.  Ach iarraim go ndéanfaí gach iarracht an margadh a fheabhsú don tionscail textile, go mór mhór, agus freisin scéimeanna nua a thabhairt isteach cosúil leis an scéim atá ar siúl i mo cheantair fhéin fosta, i McArthurs i mBuncrana.  Tá i bhfad barraíocht den ábhar olna ar an mhargadh faoi láthair. Mar sin féin tá sé tábhachtach go gcloífidh muid le tionsclaíocht traidisiúnta na Gaeltachta.  D'fhéadfaí sin a dhéanamh trí earraí fáisiúin olna a chur chun cinn. Tá a leithéid seo le feiceáil cheana i siopaí fáisiúin i mBaile Átha Cliath, i bPáras, i London agus i Milan fosta.</P>
    <P>Tá an margadh ansin.  Tá an daoine sa tír seo fosta a bhfuil an cumas acu a <Col N="912" /> leithéid sin de earraí a dhearadh agus ba chóir go dtabharfaí gach cabhair agus uchtach dóibh dul ar aghaidh len a leithéid seo den tionsclaíocht.  Chuir an tionscal fheirmeoireacht eisc, mar a dúirt an Teachta Higgins fosta, tús lena lán oibre do dhaoine san Ghaeltacht, agus is maith an rud é sin.  Ach mar sin féin caithfear a chinntiú go gcoinneófar súil ghéar ar na scéimeanna seo.  Tá contúirt an-mhór ann go ndéanfaidh sé truailliú ar an uisce agus ar na héisc eile atá sna ceantracha ina bhfuil siad.  Sna ceantracha seo sílim gurbh fhearr dá mbeadh an fheirmeoireacht éisc seo i lámha chomhlachtaí beaga de dhaoine áitiúla in áit na comhlachtaí ollmhóra atá ar nós chuma liom faoin timpeallacht agus an truailliú.  Tá forbairt eile gur féidir a dhéanamh sna ceantracha Gaeltachta agus is é sin an gairneoracht agus an talmhaíochta. D'fhéadfaí níos mó foraoiseacha a fhás sna ceantracha sin a chuirfeadh cuma níos fearr ar na háiteacha ó thaobh ábhar tine agus adhmaid sa tír, agus b'fhéidir obair do dhaoine sna ceantracha sin.  I mBaile na Finne faoi láthair tá tionscal den chinéal seo ag proiseáil adhmaid agus mar sin de.  Seo an cineál tionscail ina bhfuil an t-ábhar le fáil go háitiúil agus mar sin tugtar fostaíocht do mhuintir na háite. D'fhéadfadh tionscail eile mar Hi Tech agus ag déanamh chomhpháirteanna le earraí leictreacha gnaithe níos fearr heastáit tionsclaíochta sna Gaeltachtaí. Ach mar a dúirt an Teachta Higgins, tá na bóithre chomh holc sin go mbeadh sé deacair ag na comhlachtaí móra aon bhaint a bheith acu leis na ceantracha beaga sin.  Measaim go gcuideoidh an tAerphort atá againn i gCarraig na Finne, go mórmhór leis an chontae agus leis an eastát tionsclaíochta atá againn sna Doirí Beaga.  Is maith an rud é sin. Ach san am céanna sílim go bhfuil a lán de na ceantracha beaga Gaeltachta agus dá mbeadh corás bóithre, telefóin, uisce, séarachas agus mar sin de níos fearr againn b'fhéidir go dtabharfadh sé uchtach do chomhlachtaí teacht isteach agus obair a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Tá cuid mhór den chineál seo oibre á dhéanamh trí ghrúpaí áitiúla agus trí na comharchumainn atá sna ceantracha <Col N="913" /> beaga sin.  Tá mórán coistí forbartha sa Ghaeltacht atá ag déanamh sár-obair lena gceantracha féin a fheabhsú.  Mar shampla, grúpaí turasóireachta.  Ach ba cheart gach cuidiú a thabhairt dóibh trí dheontas níos mó a chur ar fáil nó b'fhéidir eagras a bhunú mar chabhair don a leithéidí. Ar ndóigh tá coiste amháin i mo cheantar féin á mholadh go mór agus tá súil agam go bhfuil Údarás na Gaeltachta ag eisteacht linn inniu.  Sin an ceann atá ar Oileán Thoraí, oileán atá ar fíorimeall na tíre cinnte.  Le saol an oileáin a chaomhnú tá gearghá le cuidiú ón Údarás.  Tá fadhb mhór ar an oileán sin maidir le taisteal agus tá plean fíormhaith acu go mórmhór faoi ché nua a dhéanamh ansin, rud a chuideoidh go mór leis na daoine féin ar an oileán, le cúrsaí iascaireachta agus go mórmhór le turasóireacht.  Tá pleananna eile acu faoi aerstráice, faoi lár-ionad seirbhíse, agus monarchana beaga a chur ar fáil ar an oileán.  Ba mhaith linn go nglacfaí leis na pleananna seo agus go ndeanfaí caibidil orthu ionas go gcoinneóidh méid beo an saol ar leith seo nach bhfuil a leithéid eile ann.</P>
    <P>An rud a choinnigh an Ghaeltacht mar cheantar ar leith, tá a fhios againn ar ndóigh ná an teanga.  Agus is ábhar imní dúinn uilig meath na teanga.  Caithfidh an Ghaeilge coimeád suas leis na hathruithe nua aimseartha agus teicneolaíochta atá ag teacht isteach i saol na ndaoine má tá siad le maireachtáil.  Le sin a dhéanamh caithfear úsáid a bhaint as an Ghaeilge i ngnaithe ríomhaireachta, go mórmhór, sna scoileanna agus in oifigí gnó.  Caithfear í a úsáid níos mó ar an teilifís agus ar an raidió.  Le seo a dhéanamh tá gá le corás teilifíse don Ghaeltacht.  Rinne Raidio na Gaeltachta obair mhór le cuidiú leis an Ghaeltacht agus tá moladh mór ag dul dóibh sin uilig atá freagrach as bhunú an stáisiúin seo.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios againn, agus tá súil agam go leanfaidh sé ar aghaidh, go bhfuil an Rialtas iontach gníomhach faoi chur chun cinn na teangan.  Tá sé tábhachtach go leanfaidh muid ag cuidiú leis an obair.  Tá súil agam go bhfaighfear an méadú sna meastachaín a chonaic muid inné san Bhille seo.  Agus go mbainfear úsáid as an airgead a chuirfear ar fáil de bharr an <Col N="914" /> Bhille seo chun leanstan leis an fhorbairt atá a dhéanamh sna Gaeltachtaí ionnas go gcoinneofar muintir na Gaeltachta sa bhaile agus iad ábalta saothrú a fháil ina gceantair féin, agus an teanga dhúchais a choinneáil beo sa Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Níl Aire na Gaeltachta le bheith ann ach ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Máire Geoghegan-Quinn. Feicim ar leathanach 37 go bhfuil £300,000 sa bhreis ar scéimeanna sa Ghaeltacht.  Ba mhaith liom focal a rá air sin.  As an £300,000 seo caithfear feabhas a chur ar piers, slipeanna, droichid agus bóithre áise agus go leor bóithre eile.  Tá na bóithre i nGaeltacht Chonamara go huafásach.  Is ceist mhór i gConamara agus san Ghaeltacht na bóithre.  Bhí mé féin agus mo bhean i gCarna cúpla seachtain ó shin.  Chuaigh mo charr isteach i bpoll.  Bhí orainn cúnamh a fháil leis an carr a thógáil amach as an bpoll.  Sin scéal boithrí Chonamara.  Cúpla mí o shin bhíomar ag lorg £390,000 special grant do bhóithrí Chonamara, agus bhí an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Fahey &mdash; tá sé imithe anois, in a aghaidh, agus tá na bacannaí againn go fóill i gConamara, agus sin an scéal leis na bóithrí sa Ghaeltacht ansin. Níl maith ar bith sa £300,000 an bhliain seo.  An bhfuil iontas ar bith go bhfuil rún os comhair Chontae na Gaillimhe ar an 27ú lá den mhí seo.  Is léir go bhfuil na bóithrí i nGaeltacht Chonamara á dtréigint: Abandon the roads of Connemara.</P>
      <P>Na bóithre anseo &mdash; and this item is on the agenda for the Galway County Council meeting on the 27th of this month whereby people from various parts of Connemara have asked that they take charge of the roads themselves where they cannot be done by the county council: Bóthar a haon, 3.9 kilometres, bóthar a dó, 6.89 kilometres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá ceithre bhóthar is fiche ar an liosta seo.  I have brought up that point only to illustrate how frustrated the people of the Gaeltacht areas have become.  I have my file full of letters from Galway County Council which read: Dear Senator McCormack, or Dear Councillor McCormack or Dear Deputy McCormack &mdash;&ldquo;the work you have requested on such and such a road in Connemara is very desirable but unfortunately no funds are available for the carrying out of this work this year&rdquo;.  I have drawn attention to this aspect of the Estimate for Roinn na Gaeltachta because the condition of the roads is affecting the everyday lives of the people in the Connemara area.  As a result of having my file full of that type of letter, last March I was approached by a number of people who said they were very fed up with the letters from Galway County Council saying the work is desirable but unfortunately no money is available for this work.</P>
      <P>I put down a motion at Galway County Council in which I asked what was the procedure for having roads serving a number of houses in villages taken from the county council and made private roads again.  The purpose of the motion is to allow people to repair the roads themselves because there is no future in waiting for the county council or other bodies to carry out repairs as the money is not being provided for this work.  The answer I got to that was:</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to Notice of Motions ... which appear in your name on the Agenda for the Council Meeting on 28 March, 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a legal procedure in the Local Government Act, 1925, for the <Col N="916" /> abandonment of roads under certain conditions.</P>
    <P>The Council whose duty it is to maintain the road may apply to the Minister for the Environment to make an Order declaring that a particular road is to be abandoned.</P>
    <P>When a Council proposes to apply to the Minister for an Order it must give a months public notice of its intention to do so in a local newspaper in each of two successive weeks.</P>
    <P>Before making an Order in respect of any road, the Minister must hold a local enquiry into the expediency of abandoning such a road.  I trust that the foregoing outlines the procedure for you.</P>

On the other hand, it is presumed, nevertheless, that the speaker would not stray too far away, if at all, from what is before us.  Táimid ag plé leis an mBille atá os ar gcomhair anseo as a dtiocfaidh níos mo airgid do Údarás na Gaeltachta.  D'fhéadfá á mholadh cén chaoi go mba cheart an t-airgead sin a chaitheamh nó rud ar bith a bhaineas leis <Col N="917" /> an méid atá ann.  Murach sin bheitheá as ord go mór.

      <P>Not as far as debate and Standing Orders are concerned. The Deputy will accept the &ldquo;illogicality&rdquo;, so to speak, of that.  For instance, if a boatman in Connemara had an accident, you could not talk about him unless there was some provision in the legislation to allow it.  We are providing here for legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The effects of this have driven the people of Connemara to this state.  At every opportunity it will be my duty to bring to the notice of the powers that be matters that affect the people I am elected to represent.  From that point of view I took this opportunity to put this on the record of this House, <Col N="918" /> before it is put on the record of Galway County Council, as it will be later this month.  An t-Aire Stáit, an Teachta Máire Geoghegan-Quinn is here and an t-Aire Stáit, an Teachta Frank Fahey has just left the Chamber.  I ask his assistance in solving the problems in this area which have driven the people to take the extraordinary steps I have outlined.</P>
      <P>No doctors can travel on these roads and school buses are taken off.  People are being injured on these roads, and yet they have no recourse except to try to take back those roads and repair them. That is only the tip of the iceberg, but it illustrates the frustration that has built up in the people of that area.</P>
      <P>Like the Minister of State, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, I represent that area and I am there very often.  We have first hand experience of it.  That is why I am so delighted she has come in when the Minister of State from south Galway had to depart.  She has full knowledge of the problems I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I felt it essential to express my point of view because some lives in Connemara are coming to a stand-still.  Recently at Bothar Kilbeg Upper in Clonbur the priest could not even go up the road.  The road has since been repaired because I put in a notice of motion about it.  The priest had to leave his car at the end of the road and walk one mile with the Blessed Sacrament to attend to old people who lived on that road.  School buses cannot travel some of the roads in Connemara, yet the County Manager tells me &mdash; as an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Máire Geoghegan-Quinn says &mdash; that unfortunately they cannot repair that road because no money is available.  The people wish to do the work themselves but the county manager tells them they cannot do that because if they put a shovelful of sand on that road they will be liable for any accident which might be caused further down the line.  As a result over 500 householders &mdash; and I will supply the maps of all the roads in the Connemara Gaeltacht areas for the benefit of the Minister of State &mdash; have decided to take this course of drastic action.  We will hear a lot more about the <Col N="919" /> frustration which has built up in this area whether it is in this House, outside it, at our clinics or on the streets of Galway.  If I achieve nothing more today than having that matter put on the record, I shall be happy.  I do not apologise for that but I apologise if I have broken the Rules of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy is not going to tell me he took pleasure in doing what he knew was wrong.  That would be a bad way for a maiden speech to start.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into that.  I took satisfaction in getting it on the record of the House to show those people that somebody, somewhere, is willing to speak up for them even if it was not exactly at the appropriate time.  Even if one had to break rules to speak on behalf of those people, so be it.  Many a rule is broken in condemning those people who have to put up with the conditions of the roads.  I know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that you are a visitor to that area and are aware of the conditions about which I speak.  One would really want to travel on the small county roads to understand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Tuigfidh tú anois nuair a deirim go bhfuil áthas orm nach bhfuilim ach ar údarás áitiúil amháin leis an dTeachta McCormack.  Is leor sin.  Nílim chun plé a dhéanamh ar chúrsaí bóithre mar tá a fhios agatsa agus agamsa agus ag an dTeachta McCormack nach bhfuil aon bhaint ná aon chumhacht ag an Údarás maidir le bóithre.  Caithfimid a bheith ag brath ar Roinn na Gaeltachta agus ar an Roinn Comhshaoil le feabhas a chur ar bhóithre.  Creidim go dtiocfaidh an feabhas sin i mbliana, ní hamháin ar bhóithre na Gaeltachta ach ar bhóithre na gcontaethe uile, toisc an plean cúig bliana Eorpach atá againn anois.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom, i dtús báire leithscéal a ghabháil leis an Teach thar ceann Aire Stáit na Gaeltachta, An Teachta Pat The Cope Gallagher toisc nach raibh sé ar a chumas a bheith i láthair chun an Bille seo a chur os comhair na Dála.  Tá notaí glactha agam anseo, agus ag mo chomhleacaí, an tAire Stáit, An Teachta Fahey, de na pointí tábhachtacha a rinne na Teachtaí éagsúla agus cuirfidh mé iad seo faoi bhráid an Aire Stáit ag an am cuí le go ndéanfar breithniú orthu.  Gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí uile a labhair ar an mBille seo.  Is léir gur mór linn uile an Ghaeltacht sa Teach seo agus is í an teanga an seod is luachmhaire den Ghaeltacht.  Is mór linn, freisin an dea-obair atá ar siúl ag Roinn na Gaeltachta agus ag Údarás na Gaeltachta ar mhaithe le forbairt na gceantracha Gaeltachta agus ar son chur chun cinn na teanga. Baineann an Ghaeilge, mar is eol dúinn, linn ar fad agus tá dualgas orainn uile i leith slánú na teanga agus ba chóir dúinn cur chuige le díograis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá an tÚdarás ag brú ar aghaidh go dícheallach, i gcónaí, leis an obair fhorbarthach a bhíonn ar siúl acu.  I mbliana tá cúnamh ceadaithe le haghaidh timpeall <Col N="921" /> 250 scéimeanna tionsclaíochta le sprioc fostaíochta de thart ar mhíle post ach iad a bheith faoi lán seol.  Is dul chun cinn suntasach é seo agus tréaslaím a saothar leis an Údarás.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom gach uile mholadh a thabhairt don Údarás agus d'aidhmeanna an Údaráis, as ucht an dea-obair atá déanta acu.  Is fada an bóthar atá taistealaithe acu ón uair go ndearna Comhrialtas eile iarracht deireadh glan a chur leo &mdash; Comhrialtas a rinne scrios ar an Údarás féin, agus ar bhord an Údaráis, go speisialta. Creidim go dtáinig an tÚdarás slán as na cúinsí sin agus go bhfuil ceannródaíocht déanta aige ar an-chuid cúrsaí tionsclaíochta don tír seo.  Tá an tÚdarás Forbartha Tionscail tar éis glacadh leis an gceannródaíocht bhunúsach seo, agus is amhlaidh freisin i gcás Rialtaisí a tháinig ó shin agus i gcás na hearnála phríomháidigh.  Tá ceannródaíocht déanta acu, cuir i gcás, ar an fheilméireacht éisc agus ar an dtionscal mór atá anois againn sa tír seo a bhfuil tuilleadh forbartha ag teacht air chuile lá den tseachtain, cúrsaí feiliméireacht eisc agus cúrsaí próiseála éisc.  B'shin an tionscal a ndeachaigh an tÚdarás ag plé leis tar éis go ndúirt go leor leor dena maithe móra tionslaíoch san tír nach bhféadfadh go néireodh leis, go raibh sé fíor-chostasach agus go bhféadfaí aon obair mhaith a bhí déanta ann, go bhféadfaí deireadh a chur leis an obair thar oíche dá dtiocfadh, cuir i gcás, stoirm mhór farraige.  Tá ceannródaíocht déanta acu freisin ar chúrsaí theile chumarsáide agus feiceann tú comhlacht bheag ar nós comhlacht Thelemara Teoranta ar an gCeathrú Rua i gConamara atá ag déanamh ceannródaíochta sa tionscal sin ar fud an domhain, atá ag cur seirbhíse ar fáil do chomhlachtaí móra, na comhlachtaí is mó teicneolaíochta is dóiche sa domhan, agus tá siad ag fáil gradaim bliain i ndhiaidh bliana as ucht an tseirbhís sin a chur ar fáil den scoth.  Sin ceannrodaíocht eile atá déanta ag Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá b'fhéidir an ceannródaíocht is suimiúla á dhéanamh faoi láthair ag an Údarás chomh fada is a bhaineann sé leis an tionscal fís-amharc, sin san Chomhlacht Telegael atá ar bun idir iad fhéin agus RTÉ <Col N="922" /> thiar sa Spidéal.  An Teachta Higgins agus mé féin thugamar cuairt ar ard oifigí Telegael agus chonaic muid caighdeán teileachumarsáide agus fís-amharc nua-aoiseach nach bhfuil b'fhéidir ar fáil in go leor áiteanna eile sa tír.  Sin ceannródaíocht eile atá ar bun ag an Údarás, agus is ceannródaíocht é go bhfuil an-suim agamsa ann, mar tá a fhios againn go bhfuil ciste speisialta cumarsáide ag an gComhphobal Eorpach.  Bhí mise mar ceann na hÉireann ag Comhairle na nAirí Buiséad, Dé Máirt an tseachtain seo, agus chuireamar breis airgid ar fáil don chiste chumarsáide sin, agus faigheann an tÚdarás agus Telegael airgead as an gciste sin.  Tá a fhios ag na Teachtaí anseo agus agat féin, a Leas-Cheann Chomhairle, go bhfuil anois béim speisialta curtha ag an Uachtarán Mitterrand as an bhFrainc ar an dtionscal speisialta seo, agus go gcreideann seisean go bhfuil go leor le déanamh ag pobal na hEorpa lena chinntiú nach n-éireoidh leis na Meiriceánaigh nó na Seapánaigh greim dhaingean a fháil nó b'fhéidir greim níos daingne a fháil ná mar atá acu cheana ar na meáin chumarsáide.  Agus mar sin, sin ceannródaíocht eile atá déanta ag an Údarás a bhfuil an chreidiúint ag dul dóibh as ucht é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Cuir an Teachta Higgins roinnt cheisteanna, agus déanfaidh mé iarracht, agus gan an tAire Stáit é fhéin a bheith anseo, freagra a thabhairt orthu sin.  Ar dtús labhair sé faoi Choiste Airí na nOileán. Réitigh an coiste sin tuarascáil tamall ó shin a léirigh na bun riachtanais atá de dhíth ar na hoileáin éagsúla thart ar an gcósta.  Tá na ceisteanna éagsúla a hardaíodh sa tuarascáil sin á meas anois ag na Ranna cuí, Roinn na Gaeltachta san áireamh, féachaint cén chaoi is fearr is féidir teacht ar réiteach na bhfadhbanna atá aitheanta sa tuarascáil, go háirithe i gcomhthéacs aon cúnamh a bheadh le fáil óna Cistí Struchtúrtha de chuid an Comhphobail.</P>
    <P>Is cosúil go bhfuil comhrialtas de shaghas eile ar an taobh seo den Teach. D'iarr an Teachta Higgins freisin cén fáth nach bhfuil an deis á thapú le leasuithe riachtanacha a dhéanamh ar an Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979, san mBille <Col N="923" /> seo atá os ár gcomhair anocht.  Bhuel is é cuspóir an Bhille ghearr seo ná an uasteorann le haghaidh airleacain ón bpríomhchiste a mhéadú, agus is chun na críche sin amháin a dréachtadh é.  Anois maidir le leasuithe a dhéanamh ar an mbun Acht táimse sásta faoi láthair, nach bhfuil gá lena leithéid sin.  Ach creidim go bhfuil dóthain cumhachtaí ann chun a chumasú don Údarás forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur chun chinn, agus caomhnú agus leathnú na Gaeilge mar phríomhmheán cumarsáide sa Ghaeltacht a spreagadh.</P>
    <P>Is féidir mar atá fhios go maith ag an Teachta Higgins le ordú ón Rialtas faoi alt a 9 den Acht &mdash; agus creidim gurb shin é atá ag teastáil uaidh anois &mdash; feidhmeanna breise a thabhairt don Údarás chun forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur chun chinn ó thaobh teanga, ó thaobh cultúir, ó thaobh sóisialachta gnéithiúlacht agus geilleagar. Ach sul ar feídir iarratas mar sin a chur faoí bhráid an Rialtais bheadh sé riachtanach don Údarás fhéin agus do Bhord an Údaráis cás iomlán a leagan amach, na lochtannaí sa gcóras faoi láthair, na bealaí len iad sin a leigheas, an costas a bheadh i gceist agus mar sin de.  Go dtí seo níor leag an tÚdarás cás amach do chomhachtaí breise faoin alt sin.  Níl ciste ar leith le fáil do Údarás na Gaeltachta le haghaidh cur chun cinn na Gaeilge.  Is as airgead reatha an Údaráis, mar atá a fhios againn, a thugtar cabhair le haghaidh cur chun cinn na Gaeilge ar fud na nGaeltachtaí, agus is gnó don Udarás cinneadh a dhéanamh maidir leis an gcoibhneas den airgead sin a chaitheann siad le haghaidh cur chun cinn na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Teachta Kenny faoi ghríosaithe tionsclaíocht an Údaráis, nach raibh siad ar aon dul le gríosaithe an Údaráis Forbartha Tionscail.  Tá gríosaithe tionsclaíochta dóthaineacha, creidimse, ar fáil don Údarás le forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn.  Tá deontais chaipitil acu, deontais oiliúna, deontais taighde agus forbartha, agus deontais fhostaíochta, agus deontais staidéar féidireachta, agus deontais úis.  Ar ndóighe beifear sásta i gcónaí breithniú báúil a dhéanamh ar aon <Col N="924" /> dréacht scéim le haghaidh gríosaithe breise tionsclaíochta má chreideann daoine go bhfuil siad san riachtanach.</P>
    <P>Mar a rinne mé ar dtús, ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh thar ceann an Aire Stáit Gallagher leis na Teachtaí ar fad a ghlac páirt san díospóireacht seo.  Is maith liom a chloisteáil agus a fheiceáil go bhfuil céad faoin gcéad tacaíochta á thabhairt ag na Teachtaí don Údarás féin, go bhfuilimíd sásta leis an obair atá ar siúl agus go bhfuilimíd go léir ag tabhairt spreagtha dóibh leanúint leis an gceannródaíocht atá ar siúl acu.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh agus aontaíodh an cheist.</P>
    <P>Aontaíodh na Céimeanna eile a thógáil inniu.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh an Bille tríd an gCoiste, tuairiscíodh é gan leasú agus ritheadh é.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill, 1988 [Seanad]: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That this Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice regrets that he is unable to be here.  I am taking the Bill on his behalf.  Deputies will recall that this Bill, the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill, 1988, which was passed by Seanad Éireann, had commenced Second Stage when the 25th Dáil was dissolved.  One of the first actions taken by the newly appointed Minister for Justice was to arrange for the restoration of the Bill to the Order Paper. He recognises it as an important piece of reforming legislation not only for women but for the entire community.</P>
      <P>His predecessor had already delivered a speech to this House at Second Stage outlining the details of the Bill.  However, in view of the importance of the legislation and the changes in the Dáil since then it is considered that, not least as a matter of courtesy to the new Members of the House, I should deal in some detail with the main proposals of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rape is a very serious crime and has <Col N="925" /> been recognised as such not only in Ireland but throughout the civilised world.  In this jurisdiction it carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, the most severe sentence that can normally be imposed by our courts.  The Supreme Court itself has stated that it regards rape as a very serious crime which clearly merits a substantial immediate period of detention or imprisonment even when it is committed without violence beyond that constituting the act of rape itself.</P>
    <P>The law provides such a severe sentence not merely because of the physical consequences of the crime but also because rape involves a severe emotional and psychological trauma for the victim. Rape is a violation of a woman's bodily integrity and can leave the victim psychologically scarred for life.  It is one of the most obnoxious and reprehensible crimes known to the law.</P>
    <P>While those guilty of rape must be apprehended and punished &mdash; and, if I may say so, punished severely &mdash; justice demands that we always keep in mind that a person accused of rape may be innocent.  Earlier this year in this country a man was identified by a woman as being the perpetrator of a rape on her but was subsequently shown to be innocent as the result of the new genetic profiling technique.  We must always remember that an accused may not in fact be guilty and ensure that each and every accused obtains a fair and just trial.  I recognise that it is difficult to strike the proper balance as between the accused and the victim but it is our responsibility as legislators to undertake this task.</P>
    <P>Before I go on to discuss the provisions of the Bill itself I am aware that several Deputies in the 25th Dáil raised the question of the treatment of sexual offenders. This is a separate matter and outside the scope of the Bill.  Programmes which are being carefully monitored are already under way in our prisons on the treatment of sexual offenders and, subject to the availability of resources, those which prove successful will be continued and, where appropriate, extended.</P>
    <P>The Bill is confined to reforming the <Col N="926" /> law on sexual assault offences and to provisions which relate to the trials of such offences.  It does not purport to deal with the prevention or detection of such crimes.  These are separate issues.  Deputies will be aware of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Bill, 1989, which has been restored to the Order Paper of the Seanad and which deals with the taking of samples by the Garda for forensic testing, including genetic profiling testing.  That Bill will have important implications for the detection and prosecution of sexual offenders but we will all have a chance to discuss that at another time.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Bill itself.  Briefly it provides for the following changes in the law: it abolishes the rule that in law a husband generally cannot be guilty of raping his wife.  It replaces the offence of indecent assault, which has a maximum sentence of ten years' imprisonment, by two new offences of sexual assault, with a maximum penalty of five years, and aggravated sexual assault with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. It provides that trials for rape and aggravated sexual assault will be tried in the Central Criminal Court and that the public will be excluded.  It extends to all sexual assault victims the procedural, evidential and anonymity provisions which now protect the victim in rape cases.  It abolishes the requirement for a mandatory warning about the dangers of convicting a person on the uncorroborated evidence of a complainant &mdash; leaving the question of a warning to the discretion of the judge.  It abolishes the presumption that a boy under 14 is incapable of committing rape or other crimes involving sexual intercourse.  It makes it clear that lack of physical resistance does not constitute consent to sexual intercourse.</P>
    <P>Turning to the first of these changes, one of the major provisions in the Bill is the proposal to abolish the common law rule that a husband cannot generally be found guilty of raping his wife.  There is general agreement that the marital rape exemption in so far as it existed until now should be abolished.  The Law Reform <Col N="927" /> Commission's provisional recommendation in their consultation paper in favour of abolition was, on the whole, generally welcomed although some misgivings were expressed as to whether it might not lead to fabricated complaints and unwarranted interference in the marriage relationship.</P>
    <P>The interference of the criminal law in the relationship of husband and wife can, of course, be disruptive and can present evidential problems.  However, that possibility has not prevented assault, indecent assault or buggery by a husband on his wife being criminal offences and I do not think that it should prevent the removal of the marital rape exemption. It is difficult to justify that exemption which appears to condone a type of behaviour which, I suggest, is not acceptable to the majority of Irish people.</P>
    <P>Evidential difficulties will arise in marital rape cases but that is not a sufficient reason for maintaining the existing position.</P>
    <P>With the abolition of the marital rape exemption it is possible that spiteful or mischievous complaints against a husband could be made by a wife or even by a third party.  There is a danger that there might be an attempt to initiate a private prosecution.  I think Deputies will agree that that should be guarded against.  For this reason, and because of the evidential difficulties, the Bill provides, as was recommended by the Oireachtas Joint Committee in their fourth Report on Sexual Violence, that prosecutions for marital rape can only be initiated by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  As the law stands, a prosecution for rape could progress as far as the preliminary investigation stage in the District Court without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Another major reform of the existing law is the proposal to establish two new offences, namely, sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault &mdash; in place of the existing offence of indecent assault &mdash; and the extension to all sexual assault victims of the procedural, evidential and <Col N="928" /> anonymity provisions which now protect the victims of rape.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee took the view that the existing law ignores the seriousness of other forms of sexual assault such as forced anal and oral intercourse and that, in so doing, it implies that one form of sexual assault is more serious than another.  The committee also felt that the gravity of forced sexual penetration through the use of objects should be fully recognised.  The committee recommended that the protection at present afforded to rape victims should be extended to victims of these acts.  Finally the committee felt that there was no logic in keeping separate the treatment by the law of offences that reflect a correspondingly degrading level of sexual violence against women.  The solution proposed by the committee was to redefine rape to include these offences.</P>
    <P>The Government agree fully with the committee in their expression of abhorrence of these other forms of sexual assault which can be as distressing and degrading as rape and it is for this very reason that the Bill creates the new offence of aggravated sexual assault which will have the same penalty as rape and which, along with rape, will be tried in the Central Criminal Court.  However, the Government do not agree that equal treatment by the law of these offences necessarily means that the name `rape' should be applied to them.  Indeed in their report the Joint Committee put forward no arguments in support of their proposed solution that the definition of rape should be extended to include the offences in question.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission also considered the question of changing the definition of rape and split three-two on the issue.  The majority of the commission recommended the replacement of the existing definition by a gender neutral offence which would include, in addition to non-consensual intercourse per vaginum, non-consensual oral intercourse and the penetration of a woman's vagina by objects.  The majority's main argument in favour of this recommendation was that rape is a form of sexual assault <Col N="929" /> which is no more distinctive than other similarly serious forms of sexual assault.</P>
    <P>That argument does not stand up to scrutiny.  Rape has been known as a distinctive crime for centuries, and is clearly distinguishable from all other forms of aggravated sexual assault.  The essential ingredient of rape is the absence of consent to an act which in proper circumstances constitutes an expression of human love.  Although in many cases rape will be accompanied by violence the essence of the crime is absence of consent which has to be proved in every case.</P>
    <P>A further distinguishing feature of rape is that, unlike any of the other offences in question, only the act of rape can give rise to pregnancy.  One cannot get away from that fact.</P>
    <P>The only substantive argument that has been advanced in favour of an extended definition of rape is that victims of serious sexual assaults not amounting to rape would suffer less distress psychologically if the experience they have been subjected to were described as rape.  That argument has some validity in the context of the present law where, no matter how serious the assault, the offence charged is indecent assault and the maximum sentence is ten years' imprisonment. However, any psychological reassurance that may be thought to be needed will be supplied by the obvious seriousness with which the Bill as at present drafted treats these serious sexual assaults.  On the other hand, to extend the definition of rape might only serve to reduce the stigma which attaches to the crime of rape and rather than being in aid of women could work against their interests.</P>
    <P>I might add for the information of Deputies that a very recent study in the United Kingdom (Home Office Research Study No. 106) suggests that only in one or two per cent of cases is the victim subject to the aggravated sexual offences in question without also being subject to rape.  In practice, therefore, the perpetrators of these acts will in any event normally be facing a charge of rape.</P>
    <P>Finally on this point, if the Government felt the correct approach would be <Col N="930" /> to extend the definition of rape they would have no hesitation in doing so.  It should be obvious that the objective of this legislation is to afford the best possible protection to both men and women against sexual assault, no matter what form it takes.  Indeed in the international context this Bill is on any view a radical measure.  It must be equally obvious that on the question of the definition of rape there is no consensus that what the majority of the Law Reform Commission propose is the right approach.  The conclusion the Government have come to is that we should retain the existing definition of rape, which has not given rise to any legal difficulties.  The creation of the new offences of sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault, the trial of the latter offence, along with rape, in the Central Criminal Court and the extension to all sexual assault victims of the legal protection at present afforded to rape victims, will, in the Government's considered view meet all the criticisms of the existing law as it pertains to sexual assaults not amounting to rape.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the fact that the Bill provides that in future all rape and aggravated sexual assault cases will be tried in the Central Criminal Court.  I would like to make it clear that this decision is intended to be seen as an expression of the seriousness with which the Government view the crime of rape, and, indeed, the crime of aggravated sexual assault.  It should not in any way be taken as a criticism of the Circuit Court or the judges in that court who have dealt with rape cases.  I might also emphasise that the Government's decision was taken solely with reference to the particular crimes in question and should not be seen as supporting the Law Reform Commission's view that the transfer of rape and aggravated sexual assault trials to the Central Criminal Court should be the beginning of a process of returning a wider criminal jurisdiction to the High Court.  That is a separate matter to be considered on its merits.</P>
    <P>Some concern has been expressed about the impact the proposed change <Col N="931" /> will have on rural circuits and about the possibility of delays in the central Criminal Court.  The figures show that the impact of the provision on rural circuits will be only slight.  On average only just over six rape trials per annum are at present held outside Dublin.  Neither do I envisage this provision leading to any delays in the holding of these trials in the Central Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes, in section 18 (b), that applications for bail in the case of rape and aggravated sexual assault may only be made in the High Court.  It has been represented to me that the present provision on bail applications for these offences should continue to apply, i.e. that applications for bail should continue to be made in the first place to the District Court.  This would be different from the position that applies in the case of offences which are triable only in the Central Criminal Court.  However, procedures for granting bail in rape and serious sexual assault cases in the District Court are well established &mdash; the law is very clear in this area &mdash; and, of course, the preliminary examination of the charges will be taking place in the District Court.  This is a matter to which further consideration will be given between now and Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Deputy Michael D. Higgins has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the need for a statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the position in San Salvador with special regard to the position of Irish citizens, the Sisters of St. Clare and members of the Franciscan Order who are in the area being bombed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank you, Sir, and the Ceann Comhairle for <Col N="932" /> having allowed me raise this matter of great urgency on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>Since I received permission to raise the matter on the Adjournment I have had some information from San Salvador that suggests that, in one of the areas of that city, one of the Irish citizens about whom I spoke, was speaking from a house that was actually being bombarded at the time.</P>
      <P>I am very anxious not to create any anxiety among the relatives of Irish citizens working in San Salvador.  There is nothing to suggest at present that any of them has been injured.  What I want to make clear is this: last night the figures being broadcast on the wire services suggested a figure for San Salvador of 650 people dead and approximately 1,000 injured.  Those figures were made up, I think, of something like 146 troops &mdash; it was suggested &mdash; 50 ordinary civilians and close to 350 guerrillas working for the FMLN.  Unfortunately, the figures that have appeared this morning and later today indicate that the numbers of dead in San Salvador are very likely to have exceeded 1,000.  It is also clear that the number injured has increased.  The present information available to me suggests that in the rest of the country &mdash; that is, outside San Salvador itself &mdash; the level of killings and injuries may be running to such an extent that we may double the figures I have given.  By the time this debate will have concluded, we may be speaking about some 3,000 people in El Salvador who will have lost their lives.</P>
      <P>I might give a little background to events in that country.  It is very important that we express our solidarity with our citizens there.  In the area at the foot of the volcano in San Salvador &mdash; I might add I visited San Salvador in 1981 &mdash; at the back of the Camino Roile Hotel, a poor ghetto to which many migrants go, is where some of our nuns have been offering and operating their mission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present in the area of San Antonia Abad, the area in which the Sisters of St. Clare are working, there is no evidence of killings in their immediate vicinity. What is true is that the hall or the <Col N="933" /> church adjoining that area is at present crowded with women and children, many of whom have been injured.  The information from our citizens working there &mdash; who have shown so much solidarity with the poor of El Salvador for so long &mdash; is that the facility they are making available and which the people are running, is at present without food.</P>
    <P>Equally and far more serious, is the position of some members of the Franciscan Order and others in the general area of Soya Pongo.  There is evidence to suggest that, to date, Soya Pongo is under some assault.  It was that area which was being bombarded some time around 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock this afternoon, Irish time.  In the area where they are there has been no facility for the delivery of medical supplies for even the injured for some time now, and certainly not today.</P>
    <P>It is terribly important that we realise what is happening.  As I have said, I visited El Salvador in 1981.  At that time I was very convinced that conditions did not exist there for the holding of free elections.  I had very definite reasons for saying so.  I was very glad that Ireland did not subscribe to the observation process there.  The electoral register was seriously defective.  Most rural women were deprived of the vote for the simple reason that the requirement to vote carried the need for an identity pass.  I clearly recall the director of elections, Dr. Bustomante, telling me &mdash; when I raised the question of peasant women not having identity cards &mdash;&ldquo;What do they want identity cards for, they are going nowhere?&rdquo;  At that time there were other things wrong.  There was certainly no question of equal access to the parties contesting the election.  It was very clear that the country was being terrorised by the death squads directly responsible to the Arena Party and its leader, Colonel D'Aubisson.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting in this very week when people are being murdered in El Salvador, to note that the Guatemalan President stated on a visit abroad that the Arena Party are in fact organising deaths in Guatemala itself, including seeking to <Col N="934" /> terrorise people from left wing sympathies by gouging out their eyes.  Mind you, this is a declaration by the Head of the Guatemalan State.</P>
    <P>This tragedy has continued in El Salvador since 1979.  I recall many times having being asked to indicate what was the Nicaraguan response to meeting the conditions of Esquipulas 11.  The truth was that, while the Nicaraguans were seeking to meet the conditions of the central American Peace Agremeent, very little pressure was being put on the Salvadorean Government.  The Salvadorean Government receive one million dollars of assistance a day from the United States to its army.  At present that army is using gas to empty homes in the two areas I have mentioned; they are dropping bombs in these areas.  There has been a statement from the State Department, which stinks of hypocrisy, saying that every effort is being made to ensure there will be no civilian casualities. Bombs are being dropped indiscriminately in these areas which are perceived to be held by the guerrilla forces of the FMLN.  In addition, helicopters with externally mounted gun systems, are being used to strafe the areas, hence the high level of civilian casualties which, at the low figure given yesterday, was one of 1,000 injured.</P>
    <P>I am very interested in the Irish response, but also that of the Twelve, to the El Salvadorean component of Esquipulas II.  Very little pressure was exerted on the Salvadorean Government in relation to the military build-up; very little in relation to the question of the much recommended land reform necessary; the whole question of the need for changing the electoral law; the need for normalising the democratic process or on the need for constructive talks with people like Ruban Seomra, Guillermo Ungo and others.  In fact, every single time the Salvadoreans appeared to be solving their problems internally the presence of a large American underwriter for the Salvadorean Army, and for the death squad directly, served as a major obstruction.</P>
    <P>This is a terribly tragic time.  It gives <Col N="935" /> me no pleasure to have to say that the current information in relation to the Jesuit Order &mdash; in that a human life lost anywhere is a human life &mdash; is that there is at present serious concern about four members of the Society of Jesus.  I recall speaking, at that time, to Ambassador Dean Hinton in his home in San Salvador when he moved his finger along the map of EI Salvador and said: &ldquo;There they go; it begins with catechetics; then it becomes co-operatives and the next thing is they are Marxists/Leninists&rdquo;.  As far as he was concerned the Jesuits were people spreading Communism.  It is believed that four members of the Society of Jesus are missing at present.  Of course, the first clerical casualty in San Salvador, or the best known, was the late Archbishop Romero whereas in fact the first was a member of the Society of Jesus, a Fr. Ortiz.  I remember I spoke to his grandmother in 1981 who described the manner in which he had been killed.  She said that, after he had been killed, the wheel of a lorry was backed over his face so that she had difficulty recognising him.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to say any more except that we in Ireland at this time must send whatever solidarity and guarantees we can to those of our citizens who not only are suffering a great deal this week but who have given solidarity to the people of El Salvador, particularly the poorer sections, in their very difficult plight.  I am very interested in hearing the Minister's response and the action Ireland will be recommending in association with the Twelve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  The present situation in El Salvador is indeed a tragedy.  The Government share the Deputy's concern for the people of El Salvador and for the ongoing political problems facing that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy said we need to realise what is happening in the country.  As the Deputy is aware, President Alfredo Cristiani of the Nationalist Republican <Col N="936" /> Alliance who assumed office on 1 June 1989 began exploratory talks in September with the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, FMLN, with a view to the cessation of hostilities.  Further discussion took place in October in Costa Rica when the FMLN proposed the creation of a human rights supervision committee comprising members of the Government, the Church, the armed forces and the FMLN.  However, as the Deputy is aware, following the bombing of a trade union headquarters and the death of ten people the FMLN withdrew from the discussions on 3 November saying that they were doing so until protection could be guaranteed for opposition trade unions.  Since that time violence has intensified in EI Salvador and most of San Salvador's northern and eastern suburbs have been under FMLN control since last Saturday when they launched a nationwide offensive.  The FMLN claim to have closed the northern and eastern approaches to the capital.</P>
    <P>The President of EI Salvador, Mr. Cristiani, has frequently said he wishes to reach a negotiated end to the war in EI Salvador but as Deputy Higgins rightly said he faces resistance within his own Arena party, some extremist sections of which have been linked to the death squads.</P>

We would encourage both sides in EI Salvador to return to the negotiation table as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our immediate concern in relation to the developments I have just spoken of in San Salvador must, of course, be the protection and the welfare of the approximately 12 Irish citizens who are currently in that city.  My Department have made contact with the Sisters of St. Clare here in Ireland who have confirmed that their three Irish born sisters are safe and <Col N="937" /> unharmed and away from the main area of fighting in the city.  Contact has also been made with the provincial office of the Franciscan Order who have informed my Department that six of their eight Irish born priests there are safe and continuing efforts are being made to contact the remaining two.  Deputy Higgins spoke of the Jesuits.  My information is that the one Irish-born Jesuit is not among the casualties.  Deputy Higgins and the House can be assured that the Honorary Consul in San Salvador is closely monitoring the situation and has been asked to submit a full and detailed report as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Joe Doyle has been given permission to raise on the adjournment the question of the proposed sale of the Switzer Group. Deputy Doyle has ten minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply indebted to the Ceann Comhairle for his kindness in allowing me to raise this matter of public concern and importance on the Adjournment this evening.</P>
      <P>The Switzer group which consists of Switzers in Dublin, Cashs in Cork, Todds in Limerick and Moons in Galway have a long and proud trading tradition as departmental stores.  The Switzers which you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and I are more familiar with is situated in Grafton Street.  It is a landmark in the city of Dublin where customers can shop in a most relaxed atmosphere, select from a wide range of goods and enjoy the attention of well trained and courteous staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the House of Fraser indicated their desire to sell the Switzer group earlier this year it initially sent a shock wave throughout the retailing community, especially among the staff of the Switzer group, because it was not clear at that time what the future of Switzers would be.  This anxiety was abated by a press statement which was issued on behalf of the House of Fraser who were negotiating the sale of the Switzer group to <Col N="938" /> Ewart plc. of Belfast.  The press release stated:</P>
    <P>It is the intention of Ewart plc, to continue to run Switzers as a departmental group store while looking to develop the potential of the group, including extending its retail activities in the existing stores, and establishing other retail outlets both in Dublin and in other cities and towns in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The statement went on to say: &ldquo;The terms and conditions of the sale are to remain confidential between the parties but Ewart plc, has given assurances to the House of Fraser that employment and the terms and conditions of employment will be maintained&rdquo;.  That statement was received very well by the public and especially by the staff of Switzers because it was clear from it that in future Switzers would be maintained as a retail department store and the terms and employment of the staff were certainly secured.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately this situation has deteriorated over the past number of weeks. Speculation in the media and in the property columns of the daily newspapers have indicated that Ewart plc. had other intentions for the Switzer group.  Switzers are now facing the prospect of a breakup and huge redundancies.  The first indication of this came in an interview with Mr. John McElroy, the chairman and chief executive of Ewart plc., which was published in <i>Ulster Business</i> in November 1989.  I quote from pages 27 and 28 of that article:</P>
    <P>The price of the Switzer group which comprises the Dublin Store, Cashs in Cork, Todds in Limerick and Moons in Galway remains confidential but is reported to be around £30 million, £18 million to cover the debts of the Group and some £12 million up front.  The attraction says the Ewart chairman and chief executive, Mr. John McElroy, is not the stores themselves &mdash; they have been losing money steadily for years &mdash; but the prime sites they occupy in the Republic's four major cities.  Their aim will be to make better use of the sites occupied by the stores which he <Col N="939" /> described as a very solid property asset. He said they will be looking for retailing expertise and will try to make some clever use of the buildings.  This will probably mean reducing the amount of each stores interior space and the extending of its frontage and the using of the space thus released for the introduction of a new sales unit.</P>
    <P>In last week's <i>Sunday Tribune</i> there was an article entitled &ldquo;1,000 Jobs at Risk in Switzer Group Overhaul&rdquo;.  In the article it was stated that Switzers now faced the prospect of a breakup and huge redundancies if a suitable developer could not be found and it was claimed that one property developer confirmed that he had been asked to join Ewart plc. in a joint venture involving the closure and redevelopment of the store but he refused on the grounds that public reaction would be hostile.</P>
    <P>We can clearly understand the feelings of the staff in the Switzer group to the statement made by the Ewart chief executive and the articles published in the media in recent weeks.  The managing director of Ewart plc., Mr. J.K. Kennedy, wrote to Mr. Hugh Pollock, general secretary of the Irish Distributative and Administrative Trade Union, on 4 October 1989.  He stated in his letter:</P>
    <P>That you for your letter dated 25th September 89.  As indicated in that statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is the statement I referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;Ewart plc. is at this point still in negotiations with the House of Fraser and should the present discussions lead to an acquisition we envisage a positive future for the Switzer Group.  In the event of our acquiring Switzers we would wish to have a positive and open relationship with the staff and their trade union representatives and would envisage meeting you at an early date following the acquisition.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions since then the staff of Switzers, through their unions, have sought meetings with Ewart plc. regarding the future of their members but <Col N="940" /> for some unknown reason, a reason best known to Ewarts, these meetings have been cancelled at very short notice.</P>
    <P>I think I have explained quite clearly to the House the anxieties which have been expressed by the employees of Switzers both as a result of the press speculation and the unavailability of Ewart plc. to meet with the trade unions involved. My main purpose in raising this matter on the Adjournment this evening is to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce not to approve this take-over &mdash; which he has the power to do under the Mergers, Take-Overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, as amended &mdash; unless Ewart plc. can give a copperfastened undertaking that they will honour the settlements stated in their press release, to which I have just referred, and give a guarantee in regard to the future employment of the staff of Switzers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I had an opportunity yesterday to meet some of the employees of the Switzer Group.  I compliment Deputy Doyle on his contribution and I would like to support what he said.  He has given a very fair and succinct summary of what is happening.  There have been two occasions at least when the union were in reasonable expectation of having a meeting.  Both were cancelled. There are 1,000 imployees at the different stores.  What is staring us in the face is another possible example of asset stripping.  I am not saying that about the present deal but I believe the workers are entitled to information.  This highlights something very important.  The workers sought information on their future livelihood. A great many people have spent a long number of years working in these stores, and some of the stores were taken over before.  The workers sought the information in an orderly way through their trade union and the meetings did not take place.  All the workers wanted to know was what was happening to the <Col N="941" /> Switzer Group and whether they would have their jobs.  They are very vulnerable.</P>
      <P>In relation to the elimination of the debts of the group as they stand now, it is very clear that anyone who was interested in the acquisition purely from the point of view of the value of the assets could realise them without giving any commitment to the labour force.  I join with Deputy Doyle in strongly emphasising the importance not only of this case, but of the need for legislation.  Some time ago in the retail section 1,200 people lost their jobs, and the assets of the retail group were recombined in a different way to the great benefit of people who were involved in a purely speculative activity. By and large the jobs were replaced by a large proportion of temporary jobs which are not protected by any of the usual labour legislation.  I join with Deputy Doyle in urging the Minister to seek to investigate deals like these in the short term so as to give some prospect of hope and security to the workers involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the proposed takeover of the Switzer Group, and I would like to inform the House that my Department have already received a notification to this effect under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978. The notification involves a proposal whereby Ewart plc proposes acquiring from Switzer Holdings Limited the entire issued share capital of Switzer and Company Limited.  Switzer Holdings is a wholly owned subsidiary of Harrods (Ireland), which, in turn, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the House of Fraser plc group which is incorporated in Scotland. Ewart is incorporated in Northern Ireland and its core activities are property investment and development.</P>
      <P>As Ewart's main activity is in the property and investment area, its approach to the proposed Switzer Group takeover is to enter into a joint venture arrangement with a retail partner which will be involved in the day to day running of the group's departmental stores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Switzer Group as everyone knows, <Col N="942" /> is one of Ireland's most prestigious retailers of fashion and homeware, employing approximately 800 people at its four department stores consisting of Switzers&mdash;Dublin, Cashs&mdash;Cork, Todds&mdash;Limerick and Moons&mdash;Galway.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of speculation about the future of the Switzer Group so that it does not come as any great surprise that it should now become the target of a takeover proposal by some outside interest who would see it as a good investment opportunity and as creating the conditions for its further development.  In this regard the Minister will be looking closely at the proposed partnership arrangements and I have no doubt that he intends being absolutely satisfied regarding the credentials and potential of this partnership for the future success of the Switzer Group and its employees.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the concerns expressed by the Irish Distributive and Administrative Trade Union and the employees regarding the future job prospects under the proposed takeover, and I want to assure them and this House that he will be paying particular attention to this aspect of the takeover, as he is empowered to do under the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Act.  The Minister will, of course, also be taking into consideration other matters such as the likely effects of the proposed takeover in relation to competition, national policy for regional development, shareholders and partners, interests of employees and of the consumer, when taking a final decision under the Act as to how the proposed takeover would operate in relation to the common good.</P>
    <P>The proposal is currently being considered at official level in the Department and I do not wish to go into any further detail at this stage.  Additional information relating to the proposed take-over has only just come to hand and this is being examined.</P>
    <P>However, I would like to emphasise that the proposed takeover is subject to a decision by the Minister under the Act which provides that any merger or take-over falling within the scope of the Act cannot be concluded until the Minister <Col N="943" /> for Industry and Commerce has stated that he does not propose to prohibit it either absolutely or conditionally, or in the absence of such a statement until a period of three months has elapsed from the date of notification, or from the date of receipt of such further information as the Minister may require.  The Minister does not intend that this takeover should <Col N="944" /> be allowed to proceed without taking a decision, and he intends that every effort will be made to enable such a decision to be taken quickly in the interests of both the group and its employees.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 21 November 1989.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of capital grants paid in <Col N="861" /> respect of buildings, furniture and equipment at Carysfort College was £2.428 million.  The Sisters of Mercy have agreed to pay to the State £1.75 million from the proceeds of the sale and have further agreed to return to the State all educational equipment and Library stock purchased with State funds.  This settlement was agreed with the Sisters of Mercy and, therefore, the new owners were not involved.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any statement made by the Sisters of Mercy in early 1986 in relation to the sale of the college.  I only became aware that the lands and premises at Carysfort were for sale when an advertisement to this effect appeared in the public press on 21 June.  Discussions were ongoing right up to that time about the possibility of securing the continued use of the college, within the third level educational sector.</P>
    <P>It is evident that the investment made by the State in the premises was recognised by the Sisters of Mercy and that it was adequately compensated for in the arrangement set out above.</P>
    <P>Neither I nor my Department had discussions with potential purchasers of Carysfort.  I am not aware of the names of the purchasers of the property nor am I appraised of the plans they may have for its development.  However, a representative of the purchasers approached my Department recently and indicated that the purchasers, who were not named, would be interested in a sale or lease arrangement with educational interests for the buildings and any required land area.  Any proposals made to my Department in this regard will be carefully considered.</P>
    <P>No commitment has been given for any further expenditure either capital or current by the State or any of its agencies in respect of any activities to be carried out in the college.  I could only envisage any such expenditure in circumstances where the State, one of its agencies, or an educational institution with the approval of my Department leased or purchased the premises at some future time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> If a purely private educational institution was to be established in the college at some future date the conditions of access by students whether Irish or not would be a matter over which I would have no control.</P>

      <P>The adult literacy and community education scheme is a countrywide scheme and operates in the counties concerned in these questions.  The scheme is operated by the VECs in their areas and funding is provided to each VEC by my Department.</P>
      <P>The aim of the scheme is to provide literacy and community education free of charge or at nominal cost for those in poor circumstances.  A total of £500,000 was provided by my Department for this scheme in 1989 which was 25 per cent more than the previous year.  The effectiveness of this scheme is under consideration in my Department.</P>
      <P>As indicated by me in reply to a parliamentary question on Tuesday last, 14 November, 1989, the provision under the adult literacy and community education scheme was increased by 25 per cent to £500,000 in 1989.  As also indicated by me in that reply the effectiveness of this scheme is at present under consideration by my Department.  The response necessary to meet the needs of adult literacy in the Dublin area will be part of that consideration.</P>

It is a joint Department of Education-Labour programme operated through FÁS and the vocational education committees.  The programme is structured around two years&mdash;a foundation year to help overcome learning difficulties, develop self-confidence and a <Col N="870" /> range of competence essential for further learning, and a progression year which will provide for more specific development through a range of education, training and work experience options.  Basic skills training, practical work training and general education are features of the programme and there is a strong emphasis on the integration of new technology into all aspects of programme content. Trainees attend on a full time basis and receive a FÁS training allowance.</P>

      <P>The staffing of national schools in a particular school year is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous school year.  This is in accordance with the agreement reached between the Government and the INTO under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  In the case of St. Colmcille's boys' national school there were 505 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1988 which warrants a staff of principal plus 14 assistants for the school year 1989-90.</P>
      <P>The only exceptions that can be made from the agreed staffing arrangements are in the case of developing schools or where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes would be breached. St. Colmcille's boys' national school does not meet the criteria necessary to qualify under either exception, therefore the appointment of an additional assistant in the school is not warranted.</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the financial difficulties for some students in third level education and especially for students from lower income families.  To assist them in pursuing courses of third level education there are a number of schemes operated by my Department under which grants and scholarships are made available.  Despite enormous pressures on exchequer resources, the financial provision of the higher education grants scheme and related student aid schemes have been improved each year since 1985 as follows: the income eligibility limits for, and maintenance element of, grants and scholarships have been increased in line with inflation and the lecture fee element of grants has been increased for each academic year in line with the increase in fees for that academic year.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to give financial assistance to students whose parents' income exceeds the income eligibility limits set out in the higher education or related means tested schemes.</P>
      <P>However, my Department do offer a small number of scholarships to students who achieve high grades in the leaving certificate examination.  The schemes in question are as follows: university scholarships (An Gaeltacht, Trí Ghaeilge and Easter Week Commemoration &mdash; of which 15, 20 and seven respectively are offered annually).  These are awarded on a competitive basis by reference to attainments in the leaving certificate examination. These scholarships are not means tested.  Further details of these schemes may be obtained from my Department.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, commencing this year in VEC third level colleges over 90 per cent of students are grant aided by the European Social Fund.</P>

      <P>where the reckonable income declared appears to be inconsistent with the assets or general lifestyle of the applicant Local Authorities may wish to carry out a more detailed and rigorous examination of the case with a view to satisfying themselves that award of grant is justified.</P>
      <P>Clause 2 (c) (ii) of the higher education grants scheme provides that in</P>
      <P>making a declaration of reckonable income, the candidate or the candidate's parents or guardians shall submit to the Local Authority such information, together with authorities and documentation and make such declaration as may be required by it to determine the amount of reckonable income and the number of dependent children.</P>
      <P>The administration of the scheme is statutorily entrusted to local authorities and it is a matter for local authorities to determine what documentation they require to satisfy themselves about candidates' means and in what cases they may wish to carry out a more detailed and rigorous examination.  In general, local authorities might wish to explore a case in greater detail on the basis of information made available to them.</P>

    <P>The circular in question was framed pursuant to clause 2 (c) (iv) of the higher <Col N="879" /> education grants scheme with particular regard to candidates whose reckonable income is determined, in whole or in part, on the basis of accounts.  However, that does not preclude local authorities from investigating any case where, on the basis of the information supplied, there appears to be an inconsistency between assets/lifestyle and reckonable income declared by the applicant.</P>

This is in accordance with the agreement reached between the Government and the INTO under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  In the case of Gaelscoil Míde there were 203 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1988 which warrants a staff of principal plus six assistants for the current school year, 1989-90.</P>
      <P>The enrolment in the school on 30 September 1987 warranted a staff of principal plus six assistants for the 1988-89 school year; however, due to accommodation difficulties experienced by the school a seventh assistant was allowed in that year as an exceptional matter.  The circumstances under which that exceptional arrangement was made no longer apply, and the normal staffing schedule applies for the current school year.</P>
      <P>The school applied for the retention of the seventh assistant on the grounds that it was a developing school; however the appeal was rejected as the school did not meet the agreed criteria to be classed as a developing school.

On that date the inspector of taxes asked the taxpayer's former employer to verify details of pay and tax deducted.  The details were not verified until 13 November 1989, and it was not possible to authorise a repayment without this information.</P>

    <P>The amended certificate of tax-free allowances which was issued to the taxpayer on 12 October 1989, was issued on a week-one basis to avoid collection of an underpayment.

      <P>This person has not applied for unemployment assistance.  However, it appears from inquiries which the Deputy has already made in this case that what he has in mind is this person's request to sign the unemployment register retrospectively. The position in the case is as follows.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 11 September 1989. As she failed to satisfy the contribution conditions she did not qualify for payment of unemployment benefit.  She was allowed to sign the unemployment register for credited contributions from 11 September 1989.</P>
      <P>A new benefit year commences in January 1990 and in the event of her proving unemployment at that stage, she would qualify for payment of unemployment benefit on the basis of her contribution record in the governing contribution year, 1988-89, if her claim is otherwise in order.</P>
      <P>Representations were made on her behalf for permission to sign the unemployment register retrospectively to May 1986 on the grounds that she has been given incorrect information at the local employment office.  She was requested to state in writing the reasons for failing to sign as unemployed during the period in question.  In her reply, she stated that she contacted the employment office in May 1986, and understood from the information given to her that she needed 26 contributions before she was entitled to sign for credits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local employment office has no record of any inquiry from her regarding her entitlement to unemployment benefit or of any request to sign the unemployment register for the purpose of obtaining credited contributions.  As she had not contacted the office or made <Col N="892" /> inquiries between May 1986 and September 1988 regarding her entitlement to unemployment benefit permission to sign the unemployment register retrospectively was not granted by the deciding officer.</P>

      <P>Following an investigation of his means, the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed from 18 April 1989 on the grounds that by failing to disclose full details of his means, he failed to show that his means did not exceed the statutory limit for receipt of a qualification certificate. He appealed the decision and an appeals officer also decided that he had failed to show that his means did not exceed the statutory limit.</P>
      <P>He made a further claim for unemployment assistance on 17 August 1989. Following a reinvestigation of his circumstances a deciding officer again decided that he had failed to show that his means did not exceed the statutory limit.  To date, he has not appealed against this decision.  The basis of the decisions has been the failure of the person in question to disclose means from self-employment which he is believed to engage in.</P>
      <P>Determination of entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance in this case is a matter for the Eastern Health Board. The community welfare officer dealing with the case cannot be contacted at present but as soon as he is available the position regarding the payment of supplementary welfare allowance will be clarified.  If this has any bearing on the payment of unemployment assistance in this case, the person's entitlement will be reviewed and he will be notified of the outcome.</P>

      <P>I consider that the primary responsibility for the recovery and recycling of chlorofluorocarbons &mdash; CFCs &mdash; should rest with the companies using these substances or marketing products which contain the substances.  I intend, therefore, to contact the companies concerned with a view to pressing them to make appropriate recovery arrangements as soon as possible.  I intend also to ask local authorities to consider how best they can facilitate or assist the process of recovery and recycling of CFCs, particularly from old domestic refrigeration equipment which is being disposed of.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, the only solution to the problems caused by the release of CFCs into the atmosphere is to eliminate their production and consumption entirely. Ireland is participating, in conjunction with our EC partners, in international action under the Montreal Protocol which provides for a 50 per cent reduction in production and consumption by 1998. The protocol is now, however, generally regarded as not going far enough and EC member states have agreed that total elimination of CFCs by the end of this century is required.  I expect that this strategy will be adopted at the second meeting of the contracting parties to the protocol which is due to take place in London next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Youthreach programme and the vocational preparation and training programmes are broadly similar in content and structure, but differ significantly in the target group, and in the methodology of delivery.</P>
      <P>Both programmes are geared to providing participants with the knowledge, skills and attitudes required to make the transition to work and adult life successfully. As such, both programmes have elements in common &mdash; basic skills training, work experience and general education, especially basic numeracy, literacy and communications skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Youthreach is a two year programme aimed at those in the 15-18 year age group who leave the school system with no qualifications at all, who are alienated from the education-formal training system for a variety of social and economic reasons and who have failed to gain any foothold in the labour market.  These young people are deemed to be priority group 1 for <Col N="900" /> the purpose of the social guarantee.  The programme consists of a foundation year to help overcome learning difficulties, develop self-confidence and a range of competences essential for further learning, and a progression year which will provide for more specific development through a range of education, training and work experience options.  The programme is a joint Department of Education-Labour initiative and is provided in centres operated by the vocational education committees and FÁS.</P>
    <P>The vocational preparation and training programme (VPT) operates at three levels: VPT-1, a one year programme for young people who would otherwise leave school after the junior cycle, who want to enter the labour market but recognise the need for basic vocational training; the leaving certificate vocational programme which provides a two year leaving certificate course giving each participant a grounding in a specific technological area &mdash; construction, engineering and technical drawing &mdash; a modern language and work experience-simulation in the chosen employment area; and VPT-2, a one year vocational training programme aimed at young people who have completed senior cycle but have been unable to obtain employment, and those who have completed a VPT-1 course.</P>
    <P>The vocational preparation and training programme operates for the most part in second level schools, vocational, community, comprehensive and secondary schools.  Experience has shown that the target group for the Youthreach programme cannot generally be catered for in the context of traditional training or school premises, and where possible attractive premises outside these institutions are used.</P>
    <P>Counselling, career guidance and assessment leading to certification are features common to both programmes, as is a flexibility of approach to course content which allows individual centres to cater for the specific needs of each group, within the broad course structure.</P>
