      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, Sir, may I ask the Taoiseach if he intends to lay before the House the details of the arrangement into which he apparently has entered with Deputy Foxe, referred to by Deputy Foxe in this House as &ldquo;the best offer that was made to him&rdquo;.  May I also ask the Taoiseach if, in keeping with the precedent on a previous occasion where a Deputy who got an arrangement in that way read the whole matter into the record of the House, it would not be desirable that the House should know? Would he further think that it might be desirable for the North Western Health Board to know what is that arrangement?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say, Sir, if the House is not to have information of that kind I deplore it.  However, there is another matter I would like to raise with the Taoiseach. May I ask the Taoiseach if he will make arrangements during the course of this week to appoint the Committee of Public Accounts and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and if he will consider setting up a special committee &mdash; as was discussed in the last Dáil &mdash; to take the Committee Stage of the child care Bill?</P>

      <P>Given what has happened to mortgage interest rates in the past week &mdash; one building society increased its rates by 1 per cent without consultation or notice &mdash; may I ask the Taoiseach if the Minister for the Environment will be meeting with the building societies to try to reduce this, if possible?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he would consider having a debate &mdash; I suppose after the recess would be the most suitable time &mdash; on the proposed enlargement of the European Community following Austria's application to join in the light of the interesting remarks made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £18,408,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1989, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice, and of certain other services administered by that Office, and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>I propose that all the Votes for which I am responsible be taken together.  In the short time available to me for reply I shall endeavour to answer any questions put to me on any particular Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> The total Estimate for all Votes for which I am responsible is £376,200,000, an increase of £13,208,000 or 3.6 per cent above the expenditure for these Votes in 1988.  The Estimate is made up as follows:</P>
    <P>Vote 19 &mdash; Office of the Minister for Justice £18,408,000;</P>
    <P>Vote 20 &mdash; Garda Síochána £278,634,000;</P>
    <P>Vote 21 &mdash; Prisons £59,573,000;</P>
    <P>Vote 22 &mdash; Courts £11,670,000;</P>
    <P>Vote 23 &mdash; Land Registry and Registry of Deeds £7,806,000;</P>
    <P>Vote 24 &mdash; Charitable Donations and Bequests £109,000.</P>
    <P>Pay and allowances etc., account for 84 per cent of the total estimates and show an increase of 6.8 per cent compared with 1988.</P>
    <P>The net provision for the Garda Síochána Vote for 1989 is £278,634,000.  Salaries, allowances and overtime account for some £211 million of this amount and the superannuation provision is £44.6 million.  The other major items are £9.36 million for travelling, subsistence, compensation and miscellaneous expenses; £6.84 million for Garda transport; £5.12 million for postal and telecommunications services; £3.69 million for the purchase, rental and maintenance of radio, computer, office and other equipment; £3.56 million for station services and £1.75 million for uniforms and accessories.</P>
    <P>The overall financial allocation for the Garda Síochána this year represents an increase of 2 per cent over the 1988 allocation. While some individual subheads show a reduction as compared with last year, I am satisfied that the allocations made are adequate to ensure that the community continues to be provided with an efficient Garda service.  The Garda Síochána will continue to be provided with the resources they need to carry out their task of maintaining law and order which, of course, is of fundamental importance to every law-abiding person <Col N="320" /> who wants to live in an environment of peace and security.  Such an environment is equally important from the point of view of our national economic development.</P>
    <P>Turning to the provisions under the individual subheads of the Vote, the provision for salaries and allowances takes account of the modified way in which the restrictions that apply to public service numbers generally have been applied to the Garda Síochána.  The Government have approved the filling of promotional vacancies that arise in the force on a more generous basis than applies in the public service and the Government have further shown their commitment to ensuring that the Garda Síochána have the resources they need, by their decision, at a time of great financial restraint, to recruit 1,000 Garda trainees over the three-year period 1989 to 1991.</P>
    <P>As has been previously indicated, the intention is that a total of 1,000 appointments will be made up to 1991 from the current recruitment competition.  At least 340 Garda trainees will be recruited during this year.  The first intake of 87 successful candidates commenced training in the Garda College, Templemore at the beginning of April and the second intake commenced training in the last week in June.  Further intakes of 90 or so will be called for training at regular three-monthly intervals.  Because of the new entry procedures which include higher educational qualifications, intelligence testing and a competitive interview, I have every confidence that the trainees taken on from this competition will be of the highest quality and will contribute in a significant way to the performance and good reputation of the force.</P>
    <P>The provision for salaries represents an increase of 2 per cent on the 1988 allocation and takes account of the resumption of Garda recruitment this year.  The provision this year for superannuation also shows an increase over the 1988 allocation, of the order of 7 per cent and this is accounted for by an increase in the number of pensioners, as well as increases in pension rates in line with Garda pay.  Reductions have been <Col N="321" /> made in the provisions for overtime, uniforms and transport.  The provision for overtime shows a reduction of £650,000 on the 1988 allocation and is considered adequate to meet requirements.  The provision for uniforms, £1.75 million, shows a reduction of £500,000 over the 1988 allocation.  This reduction reflects the reduced demand for uniforms now that the period of high expenditure which was necessary to outfit the Garda Síochána in their new uniforms, has passed.  The provision of £6.84 million for Garda transport reflects a reduction of £500,000 for the purchase of vehicles and reduced operating and other expenses, including the abolition of an annual payment to the Department of the Environment in lieu of motor tax.  I am satisfied that these savings can be achieved without any serious effect on Garda operational efficiency.</P>
    <P>The importance of ensuring that the Garda are provided with the benefits of all appropriate technological advances is fully appreciated and provision is made in the Estimates for funding developments in the Garda radio and computer areas.  The radio network is operating very successfully in the 18 Garda divisions outside the Dublin Metropolitan Area, and the DMA system, incorporating a most modern computerised command and control system has been installed and is currently being brought into full use &mdash; it will be fully operational within the coming few weeks.  Further development of the system is planned and financial provision has been made for this.</P>
    <P>The Garda also have other modern computer systems at their disposal which are proving to be of great assistance to them in the investigation of crime, the checking out of stolen or suspect vehicles etc.  All Garda divisional headquarters and other major Garda stations are linked into the Garda computer network and financial provision has been made this year to enable a further number of stations to be linked into the system and also to enable the system to be enhanced by the purchase of some additional computer hardware.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the task that we <Col N="322" /> entrust to the Garda Síochána &mdash; the prevention and detection of crime and how important their success in carrying out that task is, to the wellbeing of each one of us.  We have enjoyed a few years in which levels of reported crime actually decreased but 1988 figures indicate that levels rose again in that year.  Indications so far this year are that crime figures may be going down again but it is not possible at this stage to be sure that this is a definite continuing downward trend.  It is a matter for which we must all take our share of responsibility &mdash; the task of crime prevention is one that, in all fairness, we cannot expect the Garda to carry out on their own.  In addition to the wide range of ordinary crime which they have to deal with, they have to contend also with the extremely serious security situation which continues to affect our country.  It is in everybody's interest that we should assist the Garda in every possible way, with the detection of crime when we can help in any way with Garda inquiries but particularly, I feel, in the area of crime prevention.  A crime prevented does not need to be detected.</P>
    <P>The neighbourhood watch programme provides a means through which the public at large can work in partnership with the Garda in the interest of preventing crime.  This programme has already won widespread acceptance among the general public.  To date there are 783 schemes in operation throughout the whole country involving some 174,000 households.  The Garda authorities consider that these schemes have had a deterrent effect on criminal activity, have improved co-operation and relationships between the public and the Garda, have increased awareness of home security and have helped to a considerable extent to provide reassurance for many people, particularly those living alone, who were experiencing fear and anxiety as a consequence of the crime levels in their locality.</P>
    <P>I want to mention also the community alert scheme which is the rural equivalent of neighbourhood watch.  This scheme was initiated by Muintir na Tíre in co-operation with the Garda Síochána to <Col N="323" /> combat the problem of attacks on the elderly in rural areas.  Again this involves the local community working in close liasion with the Garda to identify elderly people who may be at risk, to visit them and also to be alert to any suspicious happenings in the neighbourhood.  I know the outrage that I feel when I hear of cowardly and often brutal attacks on elderly and isolated members of our society and I know that this outrage is very widespread.  Muintir na Tíre and the Garda have devised an excellent scheme to help elderly people who may be or who feel that they are at risk and I would urge anyone who can do so, to participate in these schemes and help to make our country a safer place for our elderly neighbours.</P>
    <P>Another important community-based initiative has been introduced in recent months in a number of Dublin areas.  This is the community policing scheme.  Such schemes are now operating in eight areas of the Dublin northern division as well as in Leixlip, Bray, Loughlinstown/ Bally-brack and Tallaght, involving 16 stations in all.  These schemes involve the assignment of designated members to full-time patrol duties in a specific area with the intention that these members should become personally identifiable as the local Garda presence in their assigned area.  They are the link between the local community and the Garda Síochána generally, they identify with the local community and help to build up good Garda-community relations in the interest of preventing and controlling local crime and vandalism.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that all of these schemes have the effect of building a strong and valuable partnership between the Garda and the public and are of valuable assistance to the Garda in getting on top of our crime problem.  They embody the idea of partnership between the community and the Garda in the preservation of law and order.  It is an idea which I very heartily welcome and one which I as Minister for Justice intend to positively support.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the Garda Vote I want <Col N="324" /> to say that it includes the costs associated with the dispatch of a Garda contingent to serve with the United Nations Transition Assistance Group in Namibia. Thirty-five members left for Namibia on 14 April and a further 15 will travel there in a few weeks.  I am sure that the Members of the House will join with me in wishing them every success in their mission.  We can be confident that the men and women of the Garda contingent will represent their country with honour and perform their duties in Namibia in a manner which will reflect credit on themselves and on the Force to which they belong.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Prisons Vote.  The total allocation in the 1989 Estimates for salaries, wages and allowances is £41.878 million.  This represents a 10 per cent increase over the Estimate for 1988.  This substantial increase reflects the cost of additional staff required to operate new accommodation at Fort Mitchel, Spike Island and at Wheatfield, Clondalkin as well as additional costs arising in 1989 as a consequence of the public service pay agreement.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that pressure on prison accommodation has not shown any signs of easing off in the recent past. I am glad to inform the House, therefore, that this year's Estimates will enable 210 additional prison places to be brought into use, 50 places in Fort Mitchel and 160 places in Wheatfield.</P>
    <P>The additional accommodation at Fort Mitchel has already been largely occupied. In relation to Wheatfield the House will be aware that this new place of detention was brought into use last month and its operation will be extended on a phased basis over the coming months.</P>
    <P>The opening of Wheatfield will not, however, enable me to close any of our older institutions &mdash; the pressure on accommodation is such that they will simply have to continue in operation and to be maintained and upgraded as necessary. A sum of £4.28 million was allocated for this purpose in 1989 and work related to the upgrading of security and improvement of facilities generally is <Col N="325" /> being undertaken in Mountjoy, Portlaoise, Cork, Arbour Hill, Loughan House and Shanganagh Castle.</P>
    <P>In recent years significant progress has been made in bringing prisons' overtime expenditure under control.  In 1986, the amount spent on overtime was £13.4 million and by last year expenditure was reduced to £6.3 million.  The provision for overtime in the 1989 Estimates allows a similar amount of overtime to be worked as in 1988.</P>
    <P>While the emphasis of what I have said in relation to this Estimate has been on the operation of the prison system, alternatives to imprisonment play a very important role in the overall penal system.  The Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, provides that offenders can be required by the courts to perform a specified number of hours of unpaid work for the benefit of the community.  The work is performed under the general supervision of the probation and welfare service of my Department. The scheme of community service orders is being widely implemented by the courts.  To date, over 4,000 orders have been made in respect of offenders who would &mdash; under the terms of the legislation &mdash; otherwise have received a custodial sentence on conviction.  An allocation of £208,000 is provided in the Estimates in relation to certain expenses incurred in the operation of community service orders.  Again this sum does not include the cost of probation and welfare service staff involved in operating the scheme.</P>
    <P>Another area worthy of mention is the establishment of probation and welfare projects by voluntary committees in association with the probation and welfare service.  Several probation hostels, workshops and resource centres have been set up and are intended to help young people from getting into trouble with the law and to help prisoners on release from prison.  My Department provide grants towards the capital cost of establishing such projects and towards their running costs.  The total provision under this heading in this year's Estimate is £1,385,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> The court system also comes within the scope of the Justice group of Votes.  The Minister for Justice has broad responsibility for providing the services necessary to enable the courts to function effectively.</P>
    <P>My predecessor had occasion in the House last November to talk about District Court venues.  The fact is, that bearing in mind modern means of transport and communication, we must seriously question the need to have as many as 250 locations for district courts throughout the country.  They are expensive to maintain; indeed, so expensive in some cases that local authorities cannot find the money to maintain them.  The result is an array of courthouses whose poor condition is a disgrace.  The high number of venues is also wasteful of judicial and staff time.  If the time spent in some of them were diverted into more central locations I have no doubt that the quality and efficiency of the administration of justice would be greatly improved.  I am, therefore, having a departmental review carried out to help in determining to what extent the number of venues can be reduced.  I expect the review to be completed shortly and I would hope to announce my proposals soon afterwards.</P>
    <P>The 1989 Exchequer provision for the provision of legal services under the scheme of civil legal aid and advice is £1,738 million.  While this allocation will not allow for any expansion of the Legal Aid Board's services in 1989, the board will be able to maintain its existing 12 full-time and 19 part-time law centres in operation throughout the year.  The total cost of running the criminal legal aid scheme in 1989 is estimated to be £2.5 million including value added tax and retention tax, which are recouped to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>On the topic of law reform, because of the limited time and because I want to give more time to it on another occasion, I want only to say that I propose to move the restoration to the Order Paper of a number of Bills that were before the 25th Dáil on its dissolution.  These are the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill, the Prohibition of Incitement to Racial, <Col N="327" /> Religious or National Hatred Bill, the Video Recordings Bill and the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Bill.  Other legislative proposals which I will be bringing forward will be announced by me in the normal way.</P>
    <P>The Estimates include a provision of £204,000 for the first full year of operation of the office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  The office of the commissioner was created under the Data Protection Act, 1988, which seeks to protect the privacy of individuals about whom personal data are kept without excessive regulation or the imposition of undue burdens on industry and business.  The Act is now fully operational.</P>
    <P>On Vote 23 &mdash; Land Registry and Registry of Deeds &mdash; another Vote for which I have responsibility, the continued increase in property transactions combined with the staffing restrictions common to the entire public sector continue to have an impact on the arrears situation in the Land Registry.  There was, nonetheless, only a marginal reduction in output in 1988.  The indication is that 1989 will see a further increase in workload and as an interim measure a number of clerical staff are being assigned immediately to the Land Registry.  Work is also currently under way to identify other staffing needs.  A computerisation programme is in operation and progress is being made in this area.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the services provided by these registries are essential to the public interest and that very serious delays are occurring in the provision of these services.  I intend as a matter of priority to examine the situation fully to see what can be done to remedy it.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Justice group of Votes covers a very wide area. It would not be possible to comment on all of these areas when moving the Votes. Deputies are, of course, free to refer to any of these areas during the debate and consideration will be given to all points mentioned.  In so far as time allows, I will deal with points raised in the course of my reply to the debate.  Otherwise, I will <Col N="328" /> take note of them and act on the points I agree with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment as Minister for Justice and wish him well in the very onerous task facing him for the duration of this Government.  I realise that the Minister does not have any say in what portfolio is offered to him, but I find it difficult to understand that on this occasion in addition to allocating the Ministry of Justice to Deputy Burke, the Taoiseach decided to also offer him the Department of Communications.  If I recall correctly, everytime Deputy Burke moved from one Ministry to another he managed to hawk along Communications with him.  I am beginning to wonder if anybody in Fianna Fáil other than Deputy Burke is capable of dealing with Communications.</P>
      <P>For the last two years I listened to Deputy Gerry Collins as Minister for Justice telling this House that there were many things in the Department that he would like to do, but that because of the onerous duties on his shoulders &mdash; in terms of dealing with security, the prison services, the Garda Síochána, the courts and the day-to-day running of the Department, not to talk about the many areas of law reform that remained untouched &mdash; he was just not physically able to get through the volume of work he faced daily.  It is obvious that the Taoiseach is unaware of the type of work that goes on in the Department of Justice, despite the fact that he was there once himself, when he has allocated these two Ministries to Deputy Burke, whom I wish well.  This is very hard to understand when we have on record the previous Minister for Justice telling us there were many areas of law reform that he would have loved to deal with but that he just had not the time or the staff to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sincerely hope the Opposition will not be muzzled at Question Time as a result of the allocation of two Ministries to Deputy Burke.  If our Priority Question Time is to be divided between Justice and Communications, there will be <Col N="329" /> uproar in this House because there are many areas in Justice that need attention. We do not intend to be silenced because of the Taoiseach's bad judgment allocating two Departments to a Minister who will have his hands full dealing with the Department of Justice.  I sincerely wish the Minister well but it is important that it goes on the record of the House that we in Fine Gael are not happy that such a drastic step has been taken.  This has happened probably for the first time in the history of the State.  The security of the State and the many duties that rest on the Minister for Justice are sufficient for one human being and it is not reasonable to expect him to run two Departments efficiently.</P>
    <P>Since the general election was called many Bills that were before the House will have lapsed.  I was pleased to hear the Minister say that it is his intention to reintroduce these Bills as soon as possible after the resumption of the Dáil.  I refer to such Bills as the Prohibition of Incitement to Racial, Religious or National Hatred Bill, the Video Recordings Bill, which was at Report Stage, the Family Law (Protection of Children and Spouses) (Amendment) Bill and the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill which had just commenced.  I understand also that there were many pieces of legislation in the course of preparation in the Department.  I assure the Minister that he will have the full co-operation of this side of the House in dealing with any legislation which will bring about the necessary reforms in the area of justice.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the re-establishment of the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism.  In case the Minister is unaware, this committee was set up during the 1982-87 Fine Gael/Labour Government at the insistence of the Fianna Fáil Party; yet when they came into office in 1987 they chose not to re-establish that committee.  It is time to correct that error and to recognise that Fianna Fáil, when in Government from 1987 to 1989, made a mistake in not having that committee re-established. Many pieces of legislation could be dealt with in that committee and many positive <Col N="330" /> proposals could come from them.  I would like to see that committee up and running before Christmas 1989.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned that we have not yet seen the official crime statistics for 1988, despite the fact that these figures are available to the Garda Síochána, with the aid of technology, as early as February each year.  I can readily appreciate that, politically, it could be very embarrassing for the Government, because my understanding is that that report shows an increase in crime and that these figures have been increasing steadily since 1987, despite the good work done by the previous Coalition Government from 1982 to 1987.  Any objective observer will have to admit that during that period we succeeded in getting crime figures down but, unfortunately, they have increased steadily since 1987.  I wonder why we have not yet seen that report.  It is not just a question of having the figures from a statistical point of view. The report should indicate the direction we should take in tackling crime so that we can chart a proper course for the future in terms of dealing with the steady increase which has occurred.  All of us have to admit that vicious crimes are being carried out on our streets.</P>
    <P>In addition to the other Bills I mentioned, I sincerely hope that on the resumption of the Dáil in October we will see the immediate introduction of the Bill outlawing firearms and other dangerous weapons.  It is our duty as legislators to ensure that people can walk the streets without being mugged or raped and that they do not live in fear of being attacked by criminals who, unfortunately, nowadays will use any type of implement carrying out their vicious crimes.  I want that legislation introduced into this Chamber as quickly as possible following the resumption of the Dáil in October.</P>
    <P>We realise of course that it is not just a matter of putting more gardaí on the streets or providing more prison places. We recognise there is a reason for the increase in crime.  We are living in an environment where unfortunately there is high unemployment, bad housing and a lack of educational facilities for many <Col N="331" /> of our citizens.  As long as this continues, the resultant problems will fall into the lap of the Minister for Justice.  We will end up spending more and more money on the Garda Síochána and providing prison places if we are not prepared to tackle the root cause of crime.  If we take a look at the unfortunate background of a number of criminals, we will realise that there is and has been a breakdown in respect for the law of the land in communities who feel society is doing nothing for them.  I accept that it is not the sole responsibility of the Minister for Justice to tackle all these social problems, but I hope that he, being a member of the Government, will see to it that many injustices will be eliminated.  Ultimately, this will help those of us who have to deal with the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with extradition and to remind the Minister that the 1987 Amendment Act places a requirement on the Government.  Section 6 of that Act states:</P>
    <P>The Government shall, as soon as may be after the 1st day of January in each year beginning with the year 1989, make a report to each House of the Oireachtas on the operation in the preceding year of Part III of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>The previous Government showed a blatant disregard for both Houses of the Oireachtas in not producing this report. I now call on the new Minister for Justice to see to it that the Government carry out their statutory obligations without any further delay.  I could not stress enough that it is very bad for a Government to show total disregard for the requirements placed on them under the law which states quite categorically what must be done.  This is not being done. Unfortunately, I was removed from the House a couple of months ago when I tried to raise this matter.  At that stage the Ceann Comhairle told me that there may be another day on which I could raise this matter.  I am now doing so. There is no point putting sections into <Col N="332" /> Acts unless we are prepared to adhere to them.</P>
    <P>Another problem I would like to refer to is underage drinking which was dealt with in legislation about 12 months ago. It appears that certain sections of that Act are not being used.  Unscrupulous retailers are still selling alcohol to underage children, and drink parties continue to take place in public places.  The Garda Síochána have powers under the new Act to confiscate liquor from underage people in public places, yet it seems that this section is not being used.  Why pass legislation if we are not going to use the powers in it?  I would like to see those retailers who persist in selling alcohol to 12 year olds, 13 year olds, 14 year olds prosecuted.  It is time we put a stop to this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I intervene to advise Deputy Barrett that he has now some three minutes left of the time allocated to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is farcical that we have only 15 minutes in which to discuss the Estimate for a Department of this size.  I would like to have dealt with the drugs problem but, unfortunately, with only three minutes remaining I cannot do so.  We will soon be taking up the presidency of the EC and I sincerely hope that the Minister will see to it that there is greater co-operation throughout Europe in dealing with this problem.  The removal of the barriers in 1992 will make it easier to bring drugs from one country to another.  There should be some central intelligence agency to deal with this problem, in particular the trafficking of cocaine and the new drug, crack, which we have read about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Garda Síochána, we will be pressing continuously this new Coalition Government to see that they bring about the necessary structural changes in the management and training of the Garda Síochána.  I would like to outline some of these changes for the benefit of the House &mdash; the provision of qualified financial and personnel managers leading to more autonomy for the <Col N="333" /> Garda Commissioner in the spending of funds allocated to the force; a move towards the principle of neighbourhood policing involving more flexible working hours and greater evidence of policemen on the beat; relieving gardaí of much of the paperwork by providing more civilian backup; a Juvenile Justice Bill to modernise the criminal law at present applying to children which would provide a statutory role for juvenile liaison officers; greater use of the Garda training college for in/service training courses; adequate resources for the proper development of the juvenile liaison scheme and a continuation of our support for the neighbourhood watch scheme and other such schemes involving the community in tackling the problem of crime.</P>
    <P>In relation to the prison service, it is an absolute disgrace that we spent almost £60 million in this area without seeing any evidence that the present system of punishment is achieving anything.  It costs the taxpayer approximately £600 a week to keep a person in prison.  As far as I can see, it seems that people go in and out of prison like yo-yos and come out better criminals than they went in.  It is time we looked at alternatives to custody. I would suggest that what is needed, and I have said this before, is greater imagination on the part of the Minister in dealing with the question of punishment.  We cannot introduce alternative methods to custody without first supporting services such as the Probation and Welfare Service and the juvenile liaison officer's scheme.  In fact, we could save money if we used more imagination and did not let some people out of prison when the prisons get overcrowded, to make room for others.  As a result people who should serve their full sentence do not do so, while others, who should not be there at all, find themselves in prison.</P>

I ask the Minister &mdash; I have already done so by way of parliamentary question &mdash; to tell us if he is going to establish a family mediation service on a statutory basis, and if so, will it be put in place immediately.  I ask him to introduce a new Marriage Bill to raise the marriage age from 16 to 18 years.  As the Judicial Separation Act will come into being in October I ask him to provide civil legal aid for those who require help under that Act, and to set up a mediation service and any other services which are necessary to ensure that that Act will mean something&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to advise the House that the Labour Party will be opposing and voting <Col N="335" /> against the set of Estimates presented by the new Minister for Justice who is also, in an unusual development, Minister for Communications.  George Orwell in his book <i>1984</i> referred to the &ldquo;Ministry of Thought Control.&rdquo;  The way to secure thought control in his view was to control the police the prisons, the courts and the airways.  He also included the Army which the present Minister has not yet secured, but no doubt he is working on that.  I regard it as a sinister and dangerous development that Justice and Communications have now been vested in one Minister.  We all know the reason, of course.</P>
    <P>Minister Burke was entrusted by the last Government with the task of ensuring that the public service character of our broadcasting service was removed and that the airwaves were privatised at the fastest possible rate.  He has already made some progress in this task but I understand that the Fianna Fáil organisation at high level have decided that there is one remaining major element of the job to be done.  That is why the Taoiseach has found it necessary to allow Minister Burke to carry the Communications portfolio with him wherever he goes.  That element is the removal of RTE from the airwaves altogether.</P>
    <P>Ever since the election it is common knowledge that top echelons of Fianna Fáil believe that RTE, with their insistence that health was the major issue in the election campaign, cost the party their majority.  Fianna Fáil are determined that that will never happen again. That is why I confidently expect this Minister for Justice to devote a great deal of his time to ensuring that RTE live to regret the independence they showed during the campaign.</P>
    <P>One might hope that the Minister would take some time out from his major task of emasculating RTE to consider at least some of the major problems and commitments in the areas for which he now has added responsibilities.  The first area I want to mention is one in which there is now a major crisis &mdash; that is the area of free legal aid.  Our legal aid system <Col N="336" /> has undergone a period of crisis under Fianna Fáil and there are signs that matters will get worse.  The essential reason is that Fianna Fáil do not care about the provision of free legal aid.  First, there has been no overall increase in the funding of this scheme since 1982.  In fact, in the Estimates we are examining for the Office of the Minister for Justice there is a reduction of 1 per cent in the grant-in-aid to the Legal Aid Board.  This is at a time when the budgets of State legal aid agencies such as the office of the Attorney General and the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions will be increased by 7 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively.</P>
    <P>Secondly, four new centres were opened in 1984 and they are threatened with closure because no provision has been made for Exchequer funding for them.  These are in Tralee, Athlone, Tallaght and Cork.  In the case of the latter this is a second centre.  These centres were opened and financed with money which is now virtually exhausted and no provision has been made by way of Exchequer funding to substitute for this money.  At the end of this year the Legal Aid Board will be confronted with difficult decisions about their future operations. There will be a veritable crisis in the provision of civil legal aid under the scheme.  It seems certain that decisions will have to be taken to close certain centres altogether with, or alternative to, decisions to run down the Legal Aid Board services generally.</P>
    <P>To understand the full impact of this, in the recent past certain of the board's centres have been forced to close their doors to clients so that they could catch up on the backlog of cases which had already been taken on by them.  Even when the centres are open, persons applying for an appointment have to wait for as much as six or eight weeks or longer before they can have a preliminary consultation.  This can have very serious effects in that frequently proceedings have already been instituted and are pending before the court.  This means that quite often barring procedures, for example, have to be adjourned and <Col N="337" /> delayed to allow for legal representation. It is a legal maxim that justice delayed is justice denied.  It is equally clear from any examination of the record of Fianna Fáil in this area that they have little or no interest in the provision of justice for those who cannot afford access to the courts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett made reference to the new area of need for legal aid that will arise under the Judicial Separation Act which is to come into operation in the middle of October next.  I made the point many times during that debate that it was essential that additional legal aid facilities be made available to enable people to avail of the new remedies being provided by that Act, otherwise there was no point in bringing those remedies in at all.  The then Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, gave an indication that he was going to arrange for some additional moneys that would be necessary to give real meaning to the new Judicial Separation Act so that those unfortunate people who need to avail of the new remedies would be able to do so.  Where are the new moneys? They do not appear in this Estimate.  In fact, there is a cutback in respect of the moneys that are needed.  There is no doubt that the new Judicial Separation Act will trigger off a very great deal of new litigation under those new remedies, at least it should but it reflects no credit on this House that remedies becoming available under new laws will in effect apply only to those who can afford them, those who can have up front the £2,000 which the family lawyers charge.  I had hoped that a supplementary or additional estimate would be moved to show that the Government were realistic in making that much needed facility available but I have been disappointed in that regard.</P>
    <P>The new Act sets out as a pre-condition that the parties must avail of a mediation service before they can go before the court to get a judicial separation.  We know the position regarding the mediation service.  Their funding is running out this month, they having been in operation in a very scaled down version from a finance point of view, for the past three years.  This is at a time when the <Col N="338" /> services will be needed all the more. Where is the money for the family mediation services to come from to enable the Judicial Separation Act to operate in a proper manner, as this House which passed it intended it to do?</P>
    <P>The same comments are true of criminal legal aid, which has suffered a drop of 10 per cent in these Estimates.  For as long as Fianna Fáil are content to make those who are most marginalised &mdash; and in this case often most alienated &mdash; carry the burden of fiscal rectitude, they will find the Labour Party in strenuous and vigorous opposition.</P>
    <P>In another area also, these are mean and petty Estimates.  A couple of years ago an organisation was founded called The Irish Association of Victim Support. They were run largely on a voluntary basis and by very reputable people.  They endeavoured to bring a measure of help, often in the form of counselling, to victims of crime.  The association were set up in response to a long felt need.  They have tried bravely to do that valuable work.  For their pains they were rewarded a couple of years ago with a Government grant in the princely sum of £8,000.  That grant has remained unchanged ever since.  It represents a mere token in terms of the service that is needed.  I understand that the association are about to cease operating, if they have not already done so.  Their members simply cannot afford to carry on.  It would not have broken the Exchequer &mdash; it would not even have been noticed &mdash; if this grant had been increased to £30,000 or £40,000.  That would have done a great deal of good.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the allocation to the Garda Complaints Board in the Estimates is grossly inadequate.  We have all heard about the tensions and difficulties within the board because of overwork and understaffing but there has been no response from the Minister that the Government would provide us with any reassurance that this valuable work will be carried on.</P>
    <P>The major area for which the Minister is responsible is, of course, the security of our citizens, particularly the old, the infirm and those living alone.  This task is <Col N="339" /> carried out in the main by our dedicated and hard-working Garda Síochána and I want to pay a tribute to them for the work they do, under-resourced as they are. The Garda have come under appalling increased pressure in recent years largely as a result of Government cutbacks. Between 1988 and 1989 alone the number of gardaí was reduced by 500 and it will be reduced by a further 500 before the end of this year.  To this cutback in personnel must be added the continuing cutbacks in overtime, almost £2.5 million this year, and a draconian cut in the allocation for travelling.  It seems that this Government's intention is to have fewer and fewer members of the Garda and to tie their hands as much as possible.  It is little wonder, in the circumstances, that the number of break-ins to homes has dramatically increased in the past year or so.  My own constituency of Tallaght, for example, has seen a dramatic increase in the number of burglaries and from talking to colleagues I know that the pattern is the same in other parts of the country. For instance, the town of Tralee suffered 49 burglaries in one recent month and the local Garda, there and in my own constituency, simply do not have the resources to respond effectively.</P>
    <P>Another re-emerging phenomenon, which many of us had hoped we had seen the last of, is the curse of what is known as joyriding, youngsters who place their own lives &mdash; and the lives of others &mdash; at risk and who can only be taken off the streets by a Garda force which is adequately manned and equipped.  From my own contacts with the Garda Síochána I know that they are worried, not only by the increase in this brand of dangerous and violent crime, but also by their inability to deal with it effectively.  It is quite clear to me, from talking to many members of the force, that the Garda in general have little trust or confidence in this Government's determination to combat crime effectively.  The record of cutbacks by the Government in this area speaks for itself and can inspire little confidence in any Member of the House.</P>
    <P>I have some experience in the workings <Col N="340" /> of our court system and the growing backlog, insufficient back-up staff and inadequate facilities in much of the system is becoming a major source of scandal.  We urgently need reform in this area but it is the kind of reform which would cost money.  We need to change the way people are treated in front of the courts, to improve the facilities which range in too many cases from the Victorian to the Dickensian.  The system is in chaos and it is simply not good enough for the State to keep turning a blind eye to the conditions until such time as a district justice refuses to work in appalling conditions, which has happened from time to time. Within the last few days a district justice walked out of his court because the security provided by the Garda Síochána was inadequate and he could not sit in the court in security and safety.  We need a crash programme of improvements in several areas.  I call on the Minister to initiate such a programme as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The time has come for this Government to review a decision made by their predecessor to abolish juries in a range of High Court actions.  This was pushed through by the last Government, it was ill-considered, wrong and a serious diminution of the rights of citizens.  Perhaps just as important, at least from the point of view of the Government, the decision was totally ineffective in achieving the aims advocated for it.  Damages awards have not come down, costs have not decreased and, as we have all seen in the last couple of weeks, insurance premia have continued to rise.  The assurance companies lobbied longest and hardest for this change and they have behaved as if the change never occurred.  The Government should now admit that a mistake was made and the law abolishing juries should be repealed.</P>
    <P>Our prison system has been described as &mdash; and it is &mdash; an absolute disgrace. Since 1 January 1988 a total of seven people have died in prison custody in this jurisdiction.  At an inquest held on one of these deaths the jury recommended that staffing levels in Mountjoy be <Col N="341" /> increased.  The Minister spoke approvingly about overtime expenditure being brought under control and substantially reduced.  However, he should have another look at the implications of doing that.  When the question of staffing levels in Mountjoy was raised following that inquest, what was the then Minister's response?  He said that the question of staffing levels in each institution is kept under review in consultation with the various governors and is the subject of regular discussion with staff association representatives.  As has been pointed out it would make a good script for the &ldquo;Yes Minister&rdquo; programme.</P>

      <P>I have a number of other points to make and I agree with Deputy Barrett's remarks on the time limitation. Law reform is very important but it is an area in which we have fallen down very badly.  Quite a number of measures were mentioned by Deputy Barrett and I just want to mention one, the most urgent need to update and reform the law of nullity.  We are operating under &mdash; believe it or not &mdash; an 1870 Act under which the law is based on the rules of the old ecclesiastical courts of the last century.  As has been pointed out, the Oireachtas has the duty under the Constitution to change the law and it has failed lamentably in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join previous speakers in welcoming the Minister to the Department of Justice and to wish him well in his endeavours.  However, I share the concerns not so much influenced by Mr. Orwell's view of the world but more particularly about the capacity of any one <Col N="342" /> person to take on two Departments.  It has been argued for a long time &mdash; and I agree &mdash; that the Department of Justice should be broken down into lesser constituents, one dealing with Home Office-related affairs and the other dealing with matters of security and the prison service. I believe the Minister will find it virtually impossible to manage and to take care of the two portfolios and I ask him, in consultation at Cabinet, to suggest that perhaps a combination, which he carried during the last Government, of Energy and Communications should be considered as a way of dealing with this problem.</P>
      <P>It would be a major source of concern to all who worked so hard in this House in the area of law reform and justice and all the matters of administration running from them to countenance the fact that work would not be undertaken by reason of the non-availability of the Minister.  In this regard, one has to recall that the Minister for Justice is deeply involved in the affairs of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which requires attendance elsewhere than in the House.</P>
      <P>At the outset of my contribution on this Estimate I should like to record unreservedly my condemnation of the outrageous behaviour towards the sanctity of life as perpetrated by the Provisional IRA in the murder of Mr. John McAnulty. He was a man of the community, an innocent person who did not deserve for any reason the brutal and callous taking of his life by the Provisional IRA.  It would be very wrong of the spokespersons on Justice and law and order not to record our unanimous condemnation of that act.  It appears that the Provisionals who have never had a mandate from the Irish people for their campaign of violence had a greatly reduced vote, through Sinn Féin, in recent elections North and South.  Those elections indicated that the small number who were prepared to tolerate their activities in the past is dwindling.  We should condemn their acts and congratulate the Garda Síochána on their successes in their fight against terrorism in this State and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> The Workers' Party will be opposing this Vote for a number of reasons.  It is appreciated, as advised by the Government Chief Whip, that it will be open to each Department to introduce an amending Estimate in the new session of the Dáil some time in October.  Let us be constructive and hope that what is said in the course of the debate on this Vote today will be noted and that we will see an improvement in the activities of the Department when we reassemble in October.  If there are no improvements there will be vehement and unrelenting opposition from The Workers' Party to the Minister's proposals.  The Workers' Party will be opposing the Estimate if for no other reason than the operation of the civil legal aid scheme.  It is an insult to suggest that on a 1 per cent reduction in the allocation to the Legal Aid Board in the coming year the services will be maintained.  The Minister said he was confident that all centres will remain open and that the scheme will continue to operate.</P>
    <P>He said:</P>
    <P>While this allocation will not allow for any expansion of the Legal Aid Board's services in 1989 [That, in itself, is a matter of concern and will lead to inconvenience] the board will be able to maintain its existing 12 full-time and 19 part-time law centres in operation throughout the year.</P>
    <P>That has not been the case in the recent past and the Minister must address it as a matter of urgency.  Other Opposition spokespersons have referred to this problem and expressed their concern about it. The Legal Aid Board, and the centres which exist on paper, spend most of their time behind closed doors trying to deal with the huge backlog of work, leaving queues outside.  Those people must wait months for appointments.  As a result of the embargo on recruitment to the public service vacancies are not being filled. Law centres which prior to this worked with a complement of four solicitors now find themselves down as low as one solicitor and that person is expected to carry <Col N="344" /> on an equal if not an increasing amount of work.  The Minister should deal with the problem in regard to the Coolock Law Centre.  The funding for that centre has been on a haphazard and cap-in-hand basis.</P>
    <P>The second issue of concern to me is the question of district courts.  I note it is the Minister's intention to continue with the review initiated by his predecessor but I should like to express a word of caution in regard to that.  District courts, by definition, are courts of local venue and I am not at all keen on the notion that they should be overly centralised and removed from the districts they are expected to serve.  It is a huge failing of our criminal justice system that an offender from an area removed, for example, from the Dublin city centre is dealt with in the city centre and may be back within his district without any person being aware that a criminal prosecution had been brought against him or a penalty imposed.  The people of the community will not be aware that he had been dealt with by a court.</P>
    <P>Over-centralising will make those courts less relevant and further alienate them from the community they are supposed to serve.  I should like to urge the Minister to think carefully about that matter.  It is clear that what is needed is a massive commitment of resources to the district courts.  The example of two district justices being appointed when questions hung over their appointment indicates a certain matter-of-fact approach to the appointment and maintaining our district justices in their positions.  The fact that a district justice in Kilmainham left the bench because he considered that conditions were impossible in mid-winter and that a district justice left the bench in Bridewell Court No. 6 because there was not order in the court suggests that a major problem exists.  I understand that the Department of Justice have been made aware of the problem by the profession and the President of the District Court on numerous occasions.</P>
    <P>The third issue I wish to raise relates to the Garda Complaints Board.  We have <Col N="345" /> heard reports that suggest there will be resignations from that board by people who cannot do their work.  On the other hand, there are more than 1,000 cases waiting to be determined.  Members of the Garda Síochána are completely demoralised, unsure of their future, unsure of their standing and status within the force.  They are concerned to know if they will be allowed continue with their duties.  The Minister should provide funding for that board as a matter of urgency. I could not find a reference to the Garda Complaints Board in the Estimate.  It may be included under a global heading but, in my view, it deserves a subhead of its own because of its crucial contribution to the rights of people in the community. We should be told the amount of money that is being allocated to the board and if it keeps pace with the requirements of the board.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána have been deservedly applauded by all sides of the House. The Minister has dealt with important areas of the work of the force in the course of his contribution such as community policing and the neighbourhood watch scheme.  Those schemes can only work if the force is given modern equipment to service the demands on it.  Too often we hear complaints by those involved in those schemes that they do not get any response to their reports to the local Garda station.  That occurs because gardaí are over-stretched.  I am concerned that in the Estimate there is a reduction of 11 per cent under the heading &ldquo;Transport&rdquo;.  A transport service is essential if a modern police force is to meet its requirements.  I cannot understand how, if the Minister proposes to recruit more gardaí in the next three years and if he wants to maintain the force as a mobile and efficient unit, he can countenance a reduction of 11 per cent under that heading.  The Minister should have another look at that allocation.</P>
    <P>The JLO scheme, a crucial element of the armoury of the Garda Síochána in dealing with crime, does not operate at weekends because of cutbacks in overtime. JLO officers say that there is a <Col N="346" /> greater need for their services at weekends, when parents are available to meet them and when children are not at school. However, those officers cannot work at weekends.</P>
    <P>The Land Registry is in a shambles and I should like to draw the Minister's attention to a submission by the Law Society suggesting that an independent semi-State organisation be established to run that office.  That is a revenue-earning organisation which provides a crucial service.  It is impacting so seriously on the operation of conveyancing and on other areas of legal work that the Minister should give serious consideration to that proposal which, perhaps, is the only way to break the logjam.  I welcome the decision to take on new personnel as a stop-gap measure to deal with the huge backlog but I have no doubt that when pressure builds up in another section of the Department, or in the public service, those people will be transferred.  That has been the history since the linking of the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds with the Department of Justice.  They should be established on an independent semi-State basis and run in a commercial way and I have no doubt they would give good return in due time.</P>
    <P>With regard to prisons, I note that the medical director has not been appointed, as recommended in the report on prisons compiled by Dr. Whitaker and his group. The Minister should make that appointment as a matter of urgency.  As has been pointed out by a previous speaker, there were seven prison deaths in the last year. That must never be repeated.  Life, though incarcerated, is not cheap and we must ensure that the highest regard is given to all those people who are detained in our prisons, of whom there are too many.  There are almost 2,000 people locked up in prisons.  Some of them should be doing community service and many others should be working in areas of non-custodial penalty.  People who are not able to pay fines or who are unable to pay their debts in civil society should never be sent to prison as a means of securing sanction.  This must be addresssd and dealt with.  It is an outrage in this day <Col N="347" /> and age that the poor go to prison for no reason other than that they are poor.</P>
    <P>The allocation being made in the Estimate to the probation and welfare service and community service schemes is completely inadequate.  On the one hand we are talking about £40 million to £60 million to keep people locked up, and on the other, we are talking about a miserly sum of thousands of pounds to run and develop a scheme which would keep people at some other form of non-custodial penalty.  There is a total and complete imbalance there.</P>
    <P>In that context, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that during the introduction of the Rape (Amendment) Bill &mdash; and I welcome its promised reintroduction &mdash; I wrote to his predecessor drawing his attention to the very well thought out submission of the Probation and Welfare Service to the need to set up schemes for the rehabilitation of rape and sexual offenders in prison.  I asked that that be considered an element in the Rape (Amendment) Bill but I did not even get a reply, and the matter was ignored by the Minister when he introduced that Bill here.  I hope the Minister will look at this.  His staff have suggested that great work can be done in the rehabilitation area within prisons, and I would urge him to consider this.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not going to close any of our existing Victorian institutions.  If he will not do this, he must urgently look at the conditions in Mountjoy where all the people on one landing must use one, two or three latrines to empty their slop buckets after the night and then they wash close by to prepare themselves for the day.  It is an outrage that any person, be he imprisoned or otherwise, should have to do this.  There is no communication system between prisoners and officials in that prison.  Prisoners in Mountjoy must bang on their cell doors to get attention and the windows are constructed in such a way that an unfortunate person can hang himself.  If the Minister <Col N="348" /> is not going to close these Victorian institutions, he must accept responsibility and ensure that conditions are improved.</P>
    <P>The tenth issue of concern to me as spokesperson for The Workers' Party is legal education.  The Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The reform of legal education and the direct involvement of the Minister and the Minister for Education in the administration of the law schools, particularly at Black-hall Place and Kings' Inns, need to be attended to urgently.  I appreciate that there is a lot on the Minister's plate, and other speakers will refer to many issues which must be attended to urgently.  The Minister will receive co-operation from The Worker's Party when work is being done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Firstly, I want to join with other speakers in congratulating the Minister on his appointment.  Like other speakers, I must express some incredulity that the Taoiseach saw fit to appoint Deputy Burke as Minister not only in the Department of Communications, which appears to be his own private preserve, but also in the Department of Justice.  I can only assume that the reason for this multiple appointment arose from the distress experienced by Deputy Burke at being dislodged from the Department of Industry and Commerce by Deputy O'Malley in that Deputy Burke's views of the Progressive Democrats were broadcast very clearly to the nation on the night of the election count, and I presume his views have not greatly changed since.</P>
      <P>I want to confine my comments to the area of law reform.  Previous speakers have had time to deal with other areas but have not always had enough time to come back to this area.  Firstly, I should like to put it on the record that I regard the Estimates being brought before us by the Minister as little short of scandalous in the context of dealing with issues relating to the law reform area.  Indeed, it appears that the Minister is now reneging on commitments made by his predecessor and given to this House during the debate on the Judicial Separation Bill.  I want to mark the Minister's cards on this, and to ensure that it is clear where responsibility lies when, and if, the unfortunate difficulties I anticipate will take place occur next October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill will become <Col N="351" /> operative, and I have no doubt that there will be many hundreds, if not thousands, of estranged spouses who will seek the assistance of mediation services and of the courts in sorting out their marital problems by using legal provisions which are not currently available to them.  We had the commitment given by the previous Minister in this House that mediation services, which for the first time are given a statutory role, would be extended to meet the needs provided under the Bill.  There was no mention by this Minister in his Estimate speech of what is to happen to the pilot mediation scheme which came to the end of its life at the end of July.  They got a phone call or some sort of communication from the Taoiseach's office during the course of the election to indicate that they could continue until the end of the year.  We do not know what the Government's intentions are.  The Minister should clarify whether they intend to abolish the mediation service, the pilot service in Dublin or do they intend to preserve or extend it so that it can be fully utilised by estranged couples who want to avoid the necessity of going to court to resolve their problems.</P>
    <P>We had a pledge from the Minister for Justice in the last Dáil that the legal aid scheme would be provided with the additional solicitors required to meet the needs which will arise under the Judicial Separation Bill.  We have in this Estimate a cutback on the finance made available to the legal aid scheme at a time when most of the law centres only provide free legal assistance on an emergency basis.  The legal aid scheme, the Government law centres, will find it impossible to cope next autumn with the demands which will arise as a result of the Judicial Separation Act unless the Minister provides those centres with additional resources.</P>
    <P>It was clear during the debate on the Judicial Separation Bill that the impact of the Bill would stretch the court system, that there would be a great many people not only seeking help through mediation but who, for the first time, would be able to initiate separation proceedings before <Col N="352" /> the courts to get recognition for the fact that their marriages have broken down and that additional personnel in the courts and additional judges would be required.  I regard it as a matter of considerable disappointment that the Minister had nothing to say about this today. It seems that this Minister like his predecessor who was reluctantly pulled along in this House as a member of a minority Government into accepting the inevitability of the enactment of the Judicial Separation Bill, is avoiding putting in place the necessary administrative and other structures to ensure it works and provides help for those who require it.  I am now putting the Minister on notice in this regard.  There is still time for him to take the necessary action.  Let no one in this House be in doubt as to who will bear responsibility for the difficulties, indeed the chaos that develops if the Government fail to provide the necessary court, administrative structures and mediation services under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I note with some curiosity that under law reform the <i>Programme for Government</i>, the new coalition's programme, proposes the provision of family courts along the lines of those suggested by the Law Reform Commission.  Of course, there has been no detailed report produced by the Law Reform Commission setting out the structures of a new family law court.  There was no mention of that in the Minister's introductory remarks.</P>
    <P>We have already heard today that the agreement on law reform relating to telephone tapping is a matter of some mystery to the Taoiseach.  I wonder is the commitment to provide family courts &mdash; as a separate courts structure &mdash; an equal matter of mystery.  It has been omitted from the Minister's introductory remarks although he indicated that he would tackle some problems in the District Court area.  It appears that the commitment with regard to family courts &mdash; which received publicity last week &mdash; has been thrown away this week once the Government has been formed.  The Minister might clarify his intentions in those areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="353" /> In this context of the law reform proposal perhaps the reason the Minister present is Minister for both Communications and Justice is that the Taoiseach &mdash; who today appeared to be unaware of the commitment given with regard to telephone tapping &mdash; might, if he had thought of it, be of the opinion that it would be easier to introduce a Bill on telephone tapping if there was one man in the Department of Communications and the same man in the Department of Justice, thus obviating any necessity for inter-Departmental documentation flying around to work out the exact parameters of such legislation. The Minister should clarify what is to happen in this area.</P>
    <P>I note, more in sadness than in anger, that the law reform Bills to which the Minister refers &mdash; those before the 25th Dáil on its dissolution and which he is pledging to bring forward &mdash; do not include the Bill on genetic fingerprinting. It was only because the Fine Gael Party brought forward a Private Members' Bill on genetic fingerprinting in the last Dáil that the Government subsequently published their Bill.  The Minister should state for the benefit of the House whether that Bill is now being ditched or genetic fingerprinting will become part of our law.  It is now recognised in a variety of other jurisdictions that the facility extended to a police force to carry out genetic fingerprinting is an essential tool in the investigation of serious crime, in particular in the areas of rape, sexual assault and murder.  Is the Minister now abandoning that legislation?  If he is I will put him on notice; at the first available opportunity Fine Gael will reintroduce their Bill in this area.</P>
    <P>The final area I want to address briefly &mdash; so that I can allow my colleague speak &mdash; is that in relation to legal education. Deputy McCartan referred to that briefly.  It is my personal view that we need to radically reform our system of legal education.  It is not good enough for the Minister for Justice, or indeed the Minister for Education, to wash their hands of legal education as regards the professions.  It is ludicrous that under the <Col N="354" /> Solicitors Acts the law society provide one system of education for solicitors, whereas the Bar Library provide a separate system of education for entry to the Bar.  It is unsatisfactory that law graduates and other university graduates, potential participants in legal education under the aegis of the law society, have, on a number of occasions, in the last 12 months, had to come before the courts and litigate their way into entry to the legal profession.  It is outrageous that that should happen.  One occasion might be an accident but when it happens on two or three occasions &mdash; and there are other law cases pending &mdash; it becomes a scandal. New legislation should be brought before the House to provide for one major law school co-ordinated through the universities, with back-up from both the professional bodies and the Department of Education, and create a coherent system of legal education for entry into the professions.  We do not have that. What we do have is the scandal of well qualified law graduates having to take to the courts to gain entry to a profession that is delimiting its numbers in a way it is not statutorily entitled to do.  To date we have had a Government washing their hands of that issue.  The Taoiseach told us today that, in his role as Taoiseach of the previous Government, he did not think he had given any commitment as regards a new Solicitors Act.  The Minister's predecessor did give such a commitment. I want to know whether the present Minister intends introducing a new Solicitors Act in this House.  I want to know what he intends doing to resolve the extraordinary problems apparent in general legal education.  I want to give way now to my colleague, Deputy Allen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>First I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment. I share the disappointment of other Members who see the role of a Minister for Justice as being not only in the area of security but also in the area of law reform.  Like previous speakers I might <Col N="355" /> express my disappointment at the manner in which the Minister has to divide his energies between the Departments of Communications and Justice. Especially in the area of security and telephone tapping I might express concern that the same Minister should hold the portfolios of Communications and Justice simultaneously.  It is an appointment that causes me some concern &mdash; that this whole area is now under the control of one Minister, especially in the case of a Minister who is a member of a party with a bad history in that area.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Estimate for the Department of Justice I am also disappointed at the Taoiseach's response today on the Order of Business that there were no plans to amend the Solicitors Act, 1954, and that legislation was not promised.  I understood that legislation to amend that Act had been at a very advanced stage even during the term of office of Deputy Dukes in the Department of Justice.  I should like to know what pressures have been exerted on successive administrations to kill the amendment of that Act.  The Solicitors Act, 1954, is in need of urgent reform, as are the courts and the Land Registry which is now a disaster area urgently in need of additional resources so that it can provide the service and earn the revenue it has the potential to do.</P>
      <P>Reverting to the amendment of the Solicitors Act, 1954, the behaviour of the legal profession in recent years has not improved.  All that has improved is their public relations.  The behaviour of a fair percentage of members of the legal profession, to say the least, has been disgraceful. Successive Governments have failed to act on behalf of the people to tighten up that whole area.  We should remind members of the legal profession that the system of justice is not theirs to control for their exclusive use but should be provided as a public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At one stage we were promised the establishment of a complaints tribunal that would have lay involvement.  We were told plans were afoot to have a lay observer monitor the performance <Col N="356" /> of such a complaints tribunal, that the establishment of an arbitration body outside the courts system was being considered to deal with complaints against members of the legal profession.  Yet nothing has happened.  This whole scandal has been allowed to fester.  Indeed I was disappointed that there was very little emphasis placed on that aspect today by previous speakers, members of the legal profession themselves.</P>
    <P>With regard to qualifications for entry into the legal profession the law society must be told that it is not a yacht club that can control the input of its members. I contend that the Incorporated Law Society are keeping numbers down in order to maintain incomes at their present levels.  Indeed the shedding of crocodile tears witnessed in recent days in relation to the shortage of solicitors is sickening, emigration being advanced as the cause.  As legislators we should remember that it is a private body that exercises statutory powers under the 1954 Act without having any corresponding statutory accountability.  Legislation must be introduced to put this right.  At present it is acting in a scandalous manner in branding as failures second class honours law graduates.  It operates in a self-centred manner and the Minister must act sooner rather than later.  I have before me minutes of the Incorporated Law Society council meeting of January 1978 which indicate that it is there to perpetutate its own members and their families.</P>

      <P>I will be delighted to share my time because I will speak only for ten minutes at the most.  I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate our new Minister for Justice.  I feel confident he will approach his new Ministry with great zeal and determination to ensure that we get plenty of reform in this area.  I am not going to speak about law reform, I am going to speak about law and order which is at the heart of the matter in Dublin city.</P>
      <P>I must admit, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that there is great fear in our city at present.  A considerable number of break-ins, robberies and assaults occur and now even tourists are being subjected to this vandalism.  I had some American tourists here a week ago and just ten minutes later in a restaurant in town they had passports, travellers cheques and everything taken from them.  It is a bad reflection on our people and our city that this can happen.  We find that the habitual criminal element is still very much involved in this work.  It is the same criminal element that is involved throughout our city.  I feel that our justices should be a little more severe on some of them because as long as we give them the impression that we will treat them with kid gloves this is what will continue to happen in our cities.  I was one of the great liberals who believed we should consider that they all came from deprived homes and should be given every advantage but, of course, they have taken over in our city.  There is very little hope for the people unless we let them know that this criminal element will not prosper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a criminal has been convicted and where after incarceration for a certain time he shows progress, good conduct and has a genuine intention not to <Col N="358" /> pursue a life of crime, we should be prepared to offer him a helping hand.  I hope the Minister would have the good sense to offer him a chance, especially where there would be an opportunity of work. He might be offered a day release, a weekend release and then perhaps a regular release.  I feel this is what we must try to do for these people.  It is very important especially for those who realise, even after a short time, the futility of their cause and who are prepared to lead a normal life and conform to normal behaviour that we are prepared to offer them a helping hand.</P>
    <P>I am very impressed by the figures I have seen in relation to the community service Act.  While there are 4,000 orders, I would like to know what kind of work is being undertaken by them.  Certainly, I have seen no evidence in areas which I represent of community service orders being implemented.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on it or at some other time offer us an opportunity to see the work being done, how effective it is, how these people respond and if the community itself is responding.  I must confess I have no first-hand evidence of the work or the results.  Almost £250,000 is provided in the Estimate for this work.  The idea behind it is wonderful but I would like to know exactly how it is succeeding in practice.</P>
    <P>I am also much impressed by the community policing.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us if it is his intention to extend this policing.  It is being carried out on the northside and in areas such as Tallaght and some of the southern suburbs. I would like to know exactly how he intends to extend it.  I believe one of the answers to our crime problem is that the Garda become more involved with the community and become part of that community. In this way they will have greater control over crime in the area.</P>
    <P>Another sector we should look at is the courts.  The courts are cumbersome bodies.  Garda witnesses pose serious problems for the force because the gardaí are away from the barracks and are involved in the court work, having to wait in the District Courts for many hours.  As <Col N="359" /> a result this poses serious problems for policing in areas because the Garda are not there.  While we are told that a Garda barracks has a sufficient number of gardaí &mdash; in theory it has &mdash; many are involved in court work, in having to appear as witnesses.  The situation is not the same on the ground as it is in theory.  Perhaps the Minister could have a look at this area to see if written evidence from the garda might be accepted by the courts instead of his attendance being required. In this way we would allow the Garda to carry out their normal work which is the work of policing in the community.  Their involvement in court work imposes serious strains on the Garda and this is an area we must look at very seriously and very quickly.</P>
    <P>I had occasion a few years ago to visit Mountjoy Prison.  It was a revelation.  As Members of this House we should be given the opportunity &mdash; and perhaps the Minister might look favourably on this suggestion &mdash; to visit the prison in groups to see the facilities there and even to see the over-crowding and to see what can be done about it so that the Minister's work would be made much easier in getting the necessary support for improvements in our prisons.  It would be a good initiative on the part of the Minister to encourage us to visit the prisons to see what goes on.  It could be done even when the Dáil is in session.  We might visit it in groups and see the work that is being done.  I believe good work is being done there.  I know the prison staff do a very good job.  However, prison is a soul-destroying place and we do not have enough workshop facilities for the prisoners. When they leave prison the followup service is not as good as is required. Unless we can get these people placed in jobs, it is as good as telling them that the only way is to carry on a life of crime and inevitably return to prison.</P>
    <P>We have got to make a big effort to improve the lot of these people when they are discharged from prison.  That is where we are not doing enough and we are not able to provide the resources for them.  They are still branded when they <Col N="360" /> leave prison.  They are still stigmatised. It is very difficult for them to get jobs in normal times but at present because of the high unemployment level they are relegated to the lowest level.  Some special effort must be made to rehabilitate them in our society.  Only if we can get these people rehabilitated in society will we reduce crime in our society.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Deputy O'Connell for the opportunity he has given me to say a few words on this Estimate.  I would like also to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Ray Burke, on his new appointment.  He lives relatively near me and I am sure he will understand if I am parochial in the very limited time I have to make my contribution.</P>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention &mdash; although I am sure he is fully aware of it &mdash; to the appalling crime that occurred around my county over the weekend in which an unfortunate man was taken from a licensed premises near where I live in County Louth and whose body was found this morning in the Border area. I ask the Minister to give priority to curtailing and restricting this most appalling gang of criminals who have besmirched Ireland's name &mdash; that is the Provisional IRA.  I ask the Minister to consider proscribing the infamous organisation &mdash; an organisation that shamed Ireland's name internationally and brought my native town of Dundalk to the brink of despair because of the activities they have engaged in along the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a weakness in a democracy that allows an organisation such as this to exist <Col N="361" /> and, indeed, to allow Mr. Gerry Adams, the Irish Dr. Mengeles, the Angel of Death, to go about his gruesome activities and to seek election to the House of Parliament.  The British and Irish Governments should have the courage to recognise this evil organisation for what they are and to proscribe and put them outside the bounds of acceptable practice in this country or in Britain.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw to the Minister's attention the unacceptable number of fatal accidents in County Louth. Year after year we head the fatal statistics list.  Only last Sunday afternoon a fatal crash occurred in which six people were burned to death. Sadly, this featured a North of Ireland car.  In the Border areas one of our problems is the unusually high incidence of accidents &mdash; many of them fatal &mdash; involving people from the Six Counties.  Last August two teenage girls, one of whom was to get married four days later, lost their lives on the Newry Road, Dundalk. The speedometer of the car involved in that accident stopped at 100 miles per hour.  Yet the Director of Public Prosecutions, in his wisdom, saw fit to serve no charges on the young man driving that car.  He was allowed to walk away from the accident in which two teenage girls lost their lives.  I deplore that.  I also deplore the ridiculous system that allows people from the North of Ireland who face serious charges where people lost their lives to get bail for the derisory sum of £50 or £100.  I do not believe they should get bail; however, if they do get bail, it should be for a substantial sum. In another case a young man was deliberately mowed down by a driver who is now in Canada, but was not brought to justice.  There is a loophole in the law and I ask the Minister to look at legislation in this area and to prevent such an unacceptable situation occurring again.</P>
    <P>The IRA's activities have to be curbed if we are to have any type of society in this country.  I ask the Minister to consider providing more manpower along the Border, and specifically to introduce an under cover surveillance taskforce to keep these animals at bay and to prevent <Col N="362" /> any more atrocities in our part of the country.</P>
    <P>Another area which the Minister should examine is the tighter control of under-age drinking.  Statistics show that young people are starting to drink as young as 12½ years.  This is totally unacceptable. Many of these young people are lulled into drinking by the glamorous and seductive TV advertising which are beamed directly into their homes every ten minutes.  These advertisements should be curbed because in many cases they are more harmful to families than cigarette advertisements.  I believe that the price of drinking in social terms is very high and constitutes a greater danger to society than smoking.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately my time is very limited and I see the Leas-Cheann Comhairle appealing to me to finish.  Therefore, I will end on that note.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for responding to the appeal, I now call on Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan who will make his maiden speech.  I am sorry to tell the Deputy he has a maximum of five minutes because we must accommodate other Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and wish him well in his term of office.  He has a very difficult brief and I look forward to seeing him introduce legislation which I hope will not only improve the community at large but the whole nation.</P>
      <P>I will deal with one aspect that was raised in the Minister's speech &mdash; the community policing programme.  The Minister indicated that the community policing has worked very well in the Dublin area.  I am sure it is working very well there and in other areas but there is a desperate shortage of resources for this type of policing activity, which I believe is of immense importance to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a nation, we seem to rely on voluntary efforts at all times and while this is good and indicates that the community are interested in the well being of each and every member of society, we can go <Col N="363" /> too far.  We must provide resources for the community policing programme. Unfortunately, the Minister has not said what he intends doing, but I hope that in the coming months he will spell out very clearly the resources he will put into this programme.  This is an area where we can get to grips with crime and where vandalism can be stamped out.</P>
    <P>I would also like to comment on the courts.  The Minister said he wishes to centralise the courts.  The last Government had a fairly good record in decentralisation and I would not like to see centralisation of our court procedures.  It is important that each district has its own courts.  It is very important also that the courthouse property should be the responsibility of the Minister, and not the responsibility of the local authorities, who are at present so hard pressed for money that they cannot maintain these courthouses throughout the country.  The Minister should take the responsibility of maintaining courthouses away from local authorities who should never have been responsible for them in the first place.</P>
    <P>The last point I wish to make relates to the area of wandering animals.  The Minister for the Environment indicated to me already that this matter is not his responsibility.  Therefore, it must be that of the Department of Justice.  I ask this Minister, in his term of office, to consider very closely the menace of wandering animals on our roads and the indiscriminate parking of wagons and trailers with seemingly no restriction on them.  I ask the Minister to consider modernising and updating the legislation which deals with this type of menace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank everybody who has co-operated so well in this short debate.  I would like to join in congratulating the Minister for Justice and for Communications.  I know that even on this first occasion in this ministry, from the response to this short debate he will realise how much work he has taken on. I venture to say that because of the way in which we deal with law reform in this House not alone should there be a <Col N="364" /> Department of Justice but there should also be a department for law reform.  The demands on the Department of Justice regarding security and so on are almost in conflict with, and sometimes take priority over, law reform which is of the utmost importance and urgency.</P>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister a few quick questions.  We all welcome the recruitment of 1,000 garda trainees over the three year period 1989-91 and the training they will get which will prepare them for the difficulties of our violent society.  In his speech the Minister said that 340 garda trainees will be recruited during this year and that 87 successful candidates have commenced training already.  Has the Minister any idea how many female and male trainees have been recruited? There is a huge imbalance with regard to the recruitment of male and female gardaí.  The Joint Committee on Women's Rights, and indeed I personally pointed out to the former Minister that he should take the opportunity, without interfering with any interview process or anything else, of ensuring &mdash; indeed a section in the Employment Equality Act allows &mdash; that positive action be taken to correct that imbalance by recruiting a higher number of women.  I wonder if the Minister has any figures regarding the first phase of recruitment or how positive it has been regarding women.</P>
      <P>I also note from the Minister's speech that this year's Estimate will enable 210 additional prison places to be brought into use, 160 of them at Wheatfield.  Can the Minister give us a breakdown of the prisoners: are they juveniles or are there special facilities there for women?  As we know, the facilities for women in prison at present are not alone medieval but barbarous at times.  In the drafting of the Wheatfield project it was intended to provide proper facilities for women.  I wonder how many places have been allocated to women in that first intake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome, as we all do, the fact that the rape Bill will be introduced as quickly as possible.  I want to make a point some other Deputies have referred to.  It would be impossible to bring in any kind of effective Bill to deal with rape, which <Col N="365" /> would do justice to the victims of rape and sexual assault, if we do not allow for an extention of resources to the work begun in prisons by the probation and welfare officers, taking into account counselling and therapy groups.  It is a matter of grave concern to women in particular, the people who are most affected by this, when a rapist having completed his statutory sentence is released without any regard for his further mental or psychological well-being or what he may do to women when he is released.  Only today we heard an horrific account of such an event.  There is no way we can bring in an effective rape Bill to deal with this matter unless we integrate the treatment of sex offenders while they are in prison and make a statutory demand that they continue with community treatment when on parole.</P>
    <P>I will come back to that matter again. We have to give the most positive and urgent consideration to this matter and bring in legislation to deal with it immediately. The work that has been carried out on a voluntary basis by the probation and welfare officers has been wonderful.  It has shown their commitment and also the response of sex offenders to this kind of therapy and its importance.</P>
    <P>I was struck by the disappointment and disillusionment caused by the dismantling of, and indeed the lack of support for free civil legal aid centres, particularly when we take into consideration the desperate circumstances in which they were set up.  I want to place on the record of this House the personal courage of a woman in Cork called Josie Lynch who, out of desperation, wrote to Europe who responded and embarrassed this State by demanding that we give free civil legal aid particularly to women who are financially dependent and sometimes in fear of their lives.  It is a scandal and a shame that even having had to accept the demand from Europe that we give free civil legal aid, we have not provided the resources for vulnerable victims who desperately need support.  I ask the Minister to consider providing resources for mediation services, free civil legal aid services and the education of people about their basic <Col N="366" /> civil rights.  That would go a long way towards saving money on the hospitalisation and treatment of victims of such violence and institutionalising the people who perpetrate such violence. The system is crazy, inhuman, dehumanising and, above all, is unjust.  At a time when we are proud to be part of a Republic celebrating equality brought about by a revolution in France 200 years ago, we cannot afford to even raise our heads in Europe much less proclaim that we have a republican spirit and republican support for the civil rights of people, for the justice that this State must support.</P>

      <P>First, I would like to thank all the Deputies who have contributed to this unfortunately brief debate.  I share the concern of Deputy Barrett and others that in all of our contributions we were limited in the range of subjects we were able to cover because of the time available to us. I very much welcome the debate even though it was only of two hours duration. I welcome it at such an early stage in my Ministry in Justice because it has given me the opportunity to hear the concerns and views of Members of the House.  I can assure them I have taken careful note of the points raised in the debate and I will act on the various suggestions as far as I possibly can and as rapidly as possible.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies mentioned the murder of Mr. McAnulty.  I wish to express on my behalf and on behalf of the Government our revulsion at Mr. McAnulty's death.  The House can be assured that the Garda will leave no stone unturned in their search for his killers. I discussed the matter with the Garda Commissioner this morning and he is as aware as I am of the urgency of the need to bring the perpetrators of this atrocity to justice as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to touch on a number of points and Deputies will excuse me if in the limited time I am not able to get to every point but I assure them I have taken careful note of them.  On Deputy Barrett's suggestion that the Committee on <Col N="367" /> Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism should be re-established, I will bring this to the attention of the Chief Whip and have it considered.  Deputy Barrett was also concerned about the Commissioner's report on crime, 1988.  I want to tell him that that report will be published in the next few days.  The Deputy also mentioned the question of extradition and the report of the Oireachtas under section 6 of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.  I will bring it to the Government shortly and present it to each House of the Oireachtas at the earliest available opportunity.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies mentioned the question of the legal aid system and law centres generally.  Due to the general economic difficulties since the scheme was introduced in 1980 it has not been possible to develop the level of services available under the scheme as rapidly as had been hoped for initially.  This has meant that the board find it necessary from time to time to restrict the rate at which new clients can be taken on at various law centres because of pressure of the very limited staff resources.  However, I am advised that the board's solicitors in law centres have always been able to see immediately all eligible applicants whose cases require urgent emergency intervention, for example, cases of marital violence.  I am not saying this situation is perfect; it is anything but perfect.  As I have already indicated in my brief opening remarks, the position is under active review and I intend to take whatever action is necessary to minimise the difficulties faced by the Free Legal Aid Board in the matter generally.  I share the House's concern in relation to this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor mentioned the Garda Complaints Board.  Four new posts have now been agreed for the board and it is hoped the staff will be assigned shortly. That should solve some of the problems outlined by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>On Deputy McCartan's question in relation to the point I made about trying to rationalise the District Court, I share his view about the very local nature of the District Court system and that it is an <Col N="368" /> essential feature of the District Court.  I assure the Deputy I will take these aspects into account in the course of the review of the operation of the District Court.  I am aware that in Dublin the level of courthouse accommodation has been improved substantially in recent years and that measures are in train to improve it even further, but I can tell the Deputy and other Deputies who mentioned it that in the review I will take into account the points they raised.</P>
    <P>I will also take the Land Registry into account in the context of the urgent examination of the situation which I propose to undertake and which I mentioned in my introductory remarks.</P>
    <P>Deputy John O'Connell mentioned the genuine need for reform, not just in the law reform area but in the law and order situation in the city.  He mentioned the question of tourists.  We all abhor our tourists being in any way interfered with. I am glad to be able to report to the House what many Members have already seen, that in one case which was well publicised in the last number of days, the theft of a mini-van from four UK residents, the van and most of their goods have been returned to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell suggested that an opportunity be given to Members of the House to inspect some of the work being done under the Community Services Order.  I take the point, and I will be delighted to make the necessary arrangements to have this type of work inspected by Deputies in the period ahead.  As regards the need for an offer of a helping hand on a day, weekend or work release basis, I assure the Deputy I am taking careful note of the points made.</P>
    <P>Other very important matters were raised by Deputy Shatter, Deputy Allen, Deputy McGahon, Deputy O'Sullivan in his maiden speech, on which I compliment him, and Deputy Barnes.  I have taken note of all the points raised and I will be responding to them in the course of my period in Justice.  I welcome an early opportunity to hear the views of the House and the obvious deep concern of Members of the House about law reform in crime, vandalism and other areas.  I <Col N="369" /> appreciate it at such an early stage of my ministry.  I also appreciate very much the concern expressed by Members of the House that I might be overworked having to carry the two burdens of Justice and Communications.  I am delighted to be able to say to Members that they need have no fears that I might be overworked. I will be well able to look after both Departments efficiently and effectively and I assure them that Communications will get very special attention just as the Department of Justice will.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £577,619,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1989, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Environment, including grants to Local Authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, and miscellaneous schemes, subsidies and grants including certain grants-in-aid.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The revised Environment Estimate before the House is for over £577 million &mdash; a substantial sum having regard to the continuing large Exchequer borrowing <Col N="373" /> requirement.  This year, the Estimate is dominated by two major expenditure areas, namely increased funding for works qualifying for assistance under the EC Structural Funds and increased provision for expenditure on environmental matters.</P>
    <P>Expenditure by my Department and local authorities in 1989 will amount to some £1,288 million.  This is a very large amount of expenditure representing about 6 per cent of GNP.  Local authorities' own receipts will amount to over £566 million in respect of commercial rates and for the provision of various goods and services.</P>
    <P>A notable feature of this year's Estimate is the additional funding arising from the national development plan for EC Structural Funds.  The first objective of the plan is to remedy the severe structural deficiencies in the Irish economy which restrict our economic efficiency and competitiveness.  My Department have primary responsibility for two of the operational programmes aimed at meeting this objective &mdash; roads and sanitary services &mdash; accounting for nearly a quarter of total ERDF-aided expenditure proposed in the plan.  As a first step, expenditure in 1989 on these two services is being increased by more than 25 per cent compared to last year's outturn, and this high level of expenditure will be maintained so that we can meet the challenges of 1992.</P>
    <P>I submitted a detailed operational programme for roads to the EC Commission in support of the roads element in the national plan in March 1989.  Over the period of the plan, the Government intend to undertake a major road development programme involving Exchequer expenditure of £755 million on the improvement of national roads and the access routes to our principal ports and airports and £230 million on non-national roads.  When account is taken of State grants for road maintenance and local authority expenditure financed from their own resources, overall roads expenditure in the period 1989-1993 should reach £1.8 billion.</P>
    <P>Work on the new programme is now <Col N="374" /> well underway.  The provision for road improvements in 1989 is £164 million which represents an increase of one-third in real terms over the 1988 provision.  Of this sum, £113 million will be spent on the improvement of national roads.  Seven of the schemes scheduled to start this year have already started while work will start on the remaining five schemes by September.</P>
    <P>I also expect to obtain private funding through toll franchises.  On 21 March last, my Department issued an invitation to private interests to consider further toll based investment in the Dublin Ring Road, and we received four proposals in response.  These are being examined in the Department and I am confident that we will be able to conclude a satisfactory investment agreement.</P>
    <P>Within the overall provisions for road improvement and maintenance, I have allocated £61.1 million to local authorities for works on non-national roads. These grants include £47.4 million which has been allocated to county councils in discretionary grants for regional and county roads.  This compares with £33.4 million in 1988.  The Government recognise that these roads are of importance for all aspects of rural development, including tourism, especially agri-tourism, industry, agriculture and forestry. It is in recognition of this fact that the Government agreed, at my initiative, to a three year programme costing £150 million for works on regional and county roads.</P>
    <P>The Estimates provide £40,000 to meet the general expenses of the National Roads Authority in 1989.  I intend to have a Bill to establish the authority on a statutory basis brought before the House in the autumn.</P>
    <P>Since taking office, I have given environmental matters a high priority. This year's Estimates include new environmental measures and provide for additional expenditure on existing schemes.  I arranged in the Estimates to include all environmental expenditure in one subhead for ease of reference and also to demonstrate that there is a commitment to provide funds specifically for <Col N="375" /> environmental matters.  Deputies will see that the Estimate for Subhead G is £5.469 million as against slightly over £1 million last year.  This provision is, of course, additional to existing major programmes such as sanitary services which have an important environmental dimension.</P>
    <P>The smoke problem in Dublin is the most serious recurring environmental problem facing the capital.  We must solve it.  The 1989 Estimate for smoke control measures is £1 million.  It will fund the grant scheme introduced when the first special control area order was confirmed for Ballyfermot.  Dublin Corporation have submitted for confirmation further orders for other parts of Ballyfermot while Dublin County Council have submitted an order for Neilstown. An oral hearing has recently been held into the second order for Ballyfermot and I understand that both Dublin authorities are at an advanced stage in preparing further orders.</P>
    <P>I arranged a major publicity campaign on radio and television last winter to encourage the voluntary use of non-polluting fuels and I intend that a similar campaign will be continued next winter. I want to pay tribute to those local community organisations which have campaigned for a voluntary switch over to smokeless fuels in their own localities. Such initiatives are commendable.</P>
    <P>My Department continue to conduct a campaign to promote the wider use and availability of unleaded petrol in the interests of public health and a cleaner environment.  The oil companies and the motor trade are playing their part in expanding the network of outlets retailing unleaded petrol.</P>
    <P>The further excise duty concession in the 1989 budget enables unleaded petrol to retail at 5 pence less per gallon than the top grades of leaded petrol.  The number of outlets for unleaded now stands at over 500 compared to 36 when the campaign was officially launched last October.  Sales of unleaded at the end of May were 5 per cent of total petrol sales and I expect this percentage to continue to increase.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> One of the significant environmental expenditure areas this year is the new programme of environmental works to improve our major beaches on which £500,000 will be spent.  I have allocated grants for 21 beaches and examples of works being carried out are the provision of car parking facilities and beach access, beach conservation works, and the provision of picnic areas.</P>
    <P>I am providing £450,000 in the Estimate for waste disposal services. Included in this amount is a sum of £250,000 to provide a major boost to waste recycling which is an important element of waste management.  Grants are available for recycling facilities provided by local authorities, local voluntary bodies and other interests.</P>
    <P>Ireland has ratified the Montreal Protocol which came into force on 1 January 1989 and provides for a 50 per cent reduction over 1986 levels of CFC use by 1 July 1998.  However, that target is now seen as inadequate in the light of recent scientific evidence.  The EC Council of Ministers agreed in March &mdash; on a proposal which I put forward &mdash; that there should be an 85 per cent reduction in CFC production and use as soon as possible with a view to the total elimination of these substances by the end of the century.  The new Community policy will be influential in the review of the Montreal Protocol provisions which is due to be completed by early next year.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department have held discussions with industry representatives with a view to getting voluntary agreement on reducing CFC use in Ireland as quickly as possible and I will be bringing forward proposals to go further in this direction as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Bill, 1989, which has passed all Stages in the Seanad, forms a key element in the Government's programme to combat water pollution and will, I hope, be restored shortly to the Dáil Order Paper.  The Bill will substantially increase the penalties for polluters and strengthen the powers of local <Col N="377" /> authorities, fishery boards and indeed the ordinary citizen to deal with water pollution.</P>
    <P>The farm surveys carried out in 1988 by multi-disciplinary task forces in each county proved very successful both in identifying farms posing a pollution risk and in increasing co-operation between local authority, fishery board and farm development services staff.  Some months ago, I asked each local authority to consider the need for further farm surveys in 1989 and I intend that this type of activity will be continued and intensified.  In this regard, it is discouraging to note that, while there was a dramatic drop in fish kills in 1988 compared to 1987, the number of incidents is again on the increase.  This shows the need for continuing attention to this problem. Farmers generally have played their part in the fight against pollution and many have availed of the grants scheme operated by the Department of Agriculture and Food to install facilities to prevent pollution.</P>

      <P>The urban renewal scheme, which is designed to attract and encourage private investment in selected locations, has had considerable success in many of the 15 centres already designated. Since 1986, the scheme has generated redevelopment work to a total value of some £220 million with £20 million of this representing work completed, £80 million work in progress and £120 million work at planning stage.  I intend to build on this achievement by finalising shortly an extension of urban renewal designation to eight new provincial towns as well as to further areas in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A greater development interest from the private sector could be generated by a selective upgrading of the urban environment by the local authorities concerned. I have, therefore, allocated a sum of £2 million in 1989 for expenditure by local authorities in designated areas on works to upgrade the general environment and to complement and provide <Col N="378" /> linkages with private sector development already generated.  This amount will be supplemented by contributions from local authorities' own resources and possibly from private developers.  Preliminary notification of grant allocations has now been given to nearly all of the local authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>In the area of planning, the main initiatives over the past year relate to legislation for planning compensation and derelict sites.  I will not delay on these subjects now as Bills on both subject matters have been discussed already in the House and as I hope to have both Bills restored to the Order Paper at an early date.</P>
    <P>Output in the construction industry is dependent on domestic economic activity and is a valid indicator of trends and the state of the economy.  I am happy to see that for the first time since 1981, overall output for the industry is forecast to increase by over 6 per cent in 1989 and this will result in an additional 3,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>This resurgence in the industry's fortunes is linked with the Government's successful management of the economy. Along with improving the Exchequer finances, the Government have also introduced specific measures to promote the regeneration of the industry through astute use of public incentives in areas where development would not otherwise have taken off.  In particular, I refer to the Custom House Docks development project, the urban renewal scheme and the section 23 type incentives for the provision of private rented residential accommodation.</P>
    <P>The result is a noticeable increase in new housing output, in commercial/retail development and in major refurbishment work &mdash; much of it on sites that have lain dormant for many years.  Favourable trends which emerged in 1988 are accelerating in 1989 with cement sales up by perhaps 15 per cent, and registrations under the house building guarantee scheme up 45 per cent for the first six months of this year.</P>
    <P>Competition in the home market in recent times has encouraged the industry to pursue overseas markets for services, <Col N="379" /> contracting and products.  This has benefited export trade and will help to prepare the industry for the internal market. The importance of being aware of EC developments cannot be stressed enough. The various proposals coming from Europe for building standards and products, and the realities of trading in such a vast market, are just two aspects of the 1992 challenge.  The construction industry must be ready to compete in Europe and to face increased competition on the home market if it is to prosper in the new climate.</P>
    <P>Deputies are well aware of the changed circumstances of the local authority housing programme.  Since 1980, over 47,000 new local authority dwellings have been provided at a total capital cost of almost £1,300 million.  In the same period over 83,000 first time lettings were made.  The numbers of approved applicants have been reduced by over 40 per cent since 1982 with waiting periods almost halved. Contrary to some claims, the housing needs position continued to improve in 1988 with a further fall in the numbers on the approved waiting lists.  Approximately 7,200 households were housed by local authorities last year and the number of approved applicants on waiting lists at end 1988 was down to under 17,700.</P>
    <P>The 1989 provision for local authority housing construction is £21 million which will allow approximately 900 new local authority dwellings to be completed and a similar number of new &ldquo;starts&rdquo;.  I expect this level of new work, together with vacancies becoming available for reletting from the existing housing stock, to yield about 4,500 new lettings during 1989.</P>
    <P>I am providing £15 million this year in respect of remedial works.  This is an increase of two-thirds on the 1988 outturn and represents a significant commitment by Government to upgrading older and substandard local authority housing.  This year's allocation to Dublin Corporation is being increased by almost 100 per cent to £4.4 million and represents 29 per cent <Col N="380" /> of the total allocation.  In all, the programme will cover works in some 80 housing estates countrywide.</P>
    <P>In November 1988 my Department issued comprehensive guidelines to housing authorities on the operation of the provisions of the Housing Act, 1988 regarding homeless persons.  I have asked the housing authorities to adopt a flexible and sympathetic approach in implementing their new powers which came into effect from 1 January this year.  My Department will recoup 80 per cent of reasonable payments incurred by housing authorities in securing accommodation for homeless persons other than in their own rented stock and I have provided £0.5 million for this purpose in the 1989 Estimates.</P>
    <P>The Environment Estimate covers a very wide span of activities, which I could not hope to cover in the limited time available.  However, I am satisfied that public awareness is increasing on the importance of the various departmental functions whether they relate to physical infrastructural programmes or environmental matters such as the quality of our waters, air, etc.  The Estimate before the House will enable my Department to carry out their functions and responsibilities in an efficient and effective manner this year and to develop and improve further the services provided to the public.</P>

      <P>At the outset, may I congratulate Deputy Flynn on his reappointment as Minister for the Environment?  It is rumoured around the House, although we have to wait to see what will happen, that he is to be joined in that Department by Deputy Harney as junior Minister.  I hope the Minister will not be put out by my congratulating her on her appointment, if the rumour is correct. I may not get an opportunity to so congratulate her after today.  I also wish <Col N="381" /> Deputy Connolly well in whatever reshuffle is taking place and trust he will get a position he will be happy with. He has always been an extremely co-operative and helpful junior Minister and I wish him well.</P>
      <P>The congratulations I am offering the Minister, however, are somewhat qualified. I hope the environmental rainbow coalition which apparently we are going to have in the Department of the Environment will prove more effective in tackling our many urgent environmental problems than Deputy Flynn was during the past two and a half years.  The programme for Government agreed between the coalition parties, the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats, is instructive not only for an insight into what action the new Government have in mind but also as a public confirmation of the appalling failure of the previous Government, when Deputy Flynn was Minister for the Environment, to tackle with urgency a variety of important environmental issues.</P>
      <P>When one pulls back the veil of the daily public relations hand-out which emerged from the Department of the Environment it is clear that little of substance was achieved during the past two and a half years at the initiative of that Department.  It is the fear of Members on this side of the House that this will remain the position under this new Administration.  In particular in the areas of environmental and pollution matters, the record of the previous Government was one of appalling ineptitude and neglect.  Fianna Fáil abolished An Foras Forbartha but they have now recognised their mistake in this area and have agreed with the Progressive Democrats to establish an independent environmental agency similar to the one Fine Gael proposed in their environmental programme published shortly after the general election campaign commenced.  I acknowledge with thanks former Deputy Geraldine O'Kennedy's acknowledgement of Fine Gael's contribution to this joint Government programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When will this environmental agency be established?  It was not referred to <Col N="382" /> by the Minister in his speech.  Is he a reluctant supporter of this environmental agency?  Will we see it this year?  Will we see it next year?  Will it have a statutory base or will it simply be a non-statutory creature of the Department of the Environment? In what way will it differ from An Foras Forbartha?  In what way will its independence be guaranteed, or is it a shibboleth, a bit like other parts of the agreement which we saw unravelling earlier today when the Minister for Justice appeared to know nothing about promises given on family courts and when the Taoiseach knew nothing about reform of the solicitors' legislation?  If Deputy Harney is to be the new junior Minister in this Department she may have some battles to fight to ensure that her side of the deal which was done to form this coalition Government is actually implemented as opposed to being merely a written commitment which is tossed around and debated in this House for two or three years without seeing the light of day.</P>
    <P>The new junior Minister, be it Deputy Harney or somebody else, is being given according to the programme for Government special responsibility for pollution matters.  The Minister has made much of his concern and worries about pollution, be it water or air pollution, but his performance in these areas during the past two and a half years was less than effective. Without amending the Water Pollution Act, 1977, Fianna Fáil effectively abolished the Water Pollution Advisory Council by failing to reappoint members to it when the life of the former council expired prior to the change of Government in 1987.</P>
    <P>In January of this year the Minister published a seriously defective Water Pollution Bill.  While he expresses worries about pollution, we have seen more fish kills in the first seven months of this year than during the entire last year.  While the Minister dithers, our rivers and lakes continue to be polluted.  I want to know from him if the Water Pollution Bill is to be published in exactly the same form as the original Bill put before this House <Col N="383" /> before the last Dáil collapsed and an election was called.  Is the Water Pollution Advisory Council to be revived or will the independent environmental agency that this programme envisages take over the job of the Water Pollution Advisory Council?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the smog problems in Dublin.  I now predict that Dublin will again be choked by smog this coming winter because in reality nothing has happened in the Minister's Department for some months in tackling this area.  Last autumn Fine Gael offered support to the Minister to amend the Air Pollution Act to enable him to make an order to the effect that the entire city and county of Dublin would become a smoke control zone.  The Minister did not bring forward any new legislation.  Even the first designated smoke control zone covering 800 houses in Ballyfermot is not operating properly.  The Minister has extended until September next his order bringing it into force.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot make up his mind about the full burning fire.  He cannot make up his mind whether it should be included as an appropriate means of reducing smog despite the fact that a report has now been produced which makes it very clear that the full burning fire may be part of the problem rather than a solution to the problem.  The Minister has totally failed to confront the problem of smog in Dublin and there is nothing in his speech this evening which indicates a more active approach.  Those suffering from respiratory problems and asthma and the elderly will again suffer illnesses next year and some may die due to the Minister's failure to adopt a dynamic approach and to take the necessary urgent action.</P>
    <P>Last October we had a new Planning Bill published which at that time I described more as a developer's or speculator's charter than as a protection for the community.  Meanwhile, Dublin County Council have had to pay out over £2 million to Grange Developments and are now at risk of having to pay a similar sum <Col N="384" /> to another developer who is making a similar claim.</P>
    <P>In the meantime there are reports, which have not yet been confirmed in this House, that there is a Garda investigation into a planning bribes scandal involving An Bord Pleanála, a member or members of at least one local authority and, I am advised, possibly a Member of this House.  I want the Minister to explain to this House what steps have been taken to date in this investigation.  Is it still ongoing?  Which local authority are involved?  Are An Bord Pleanála or any of their personnel, past or present, under investigation?  Is any elected representative of either a local authority or of this House under investigation or being interviewed?  I want the Minister to clarify what is happening as regards the reported investigation into an alleged bribes scandal affecting our whole planning process.  A cloud now hangs over our planning system.  Its integrity is at risk.  The Minister should tell us what stage the investigation has reached and when it will be completed.  He should indicate whether at this moment a prosecution or prosecutions are contemplated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>To date, there is no court proceeding of any nature of which I am aware.  If all the rumours are untrue, the Minister has an obligation to Members of this House, to those employed by An Bord Pleanála and to the members of local authorities who may be under suspicion, to tell the House that the rumours are untrue, that no such investigation is taking place and that there is no cause for concern.  He should clarify the matter. I shall say no more than that.  It is appropriate that this matter be clarified for Members of this House before we adjourn for the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also should tell us when we shall have a proper planning Bill.  Will <Col N="385" /> the Bill be the same as that brought before the House before the election? Will it be a new Bill incorporating the various amendments the Minister circulated as a result of criticisms of the previous Bill made by Members of this House?  How soon will we have it?  The longer the Minister delays, the more compensation claims of an unjustified nature will be made and the greater will be the sum of money that the general public will have to meet through the Exchequer to pay these speculators.  If the Minister intends to recirculate the old Bill together with the amendments he circulated previously, I would suggest that he consider the establishment of a special committee of this House in September to process Committee Stage of the Bill and to ensure that the necessary amendments are fully and properly made, so that the Bill can complete its passage through the House by October next.  If the Minister intends to do that, the necessary resolution will have to be passed in this House before Thursday evening and he will have full co-operation from this side if he does so.  If he does not intend to do so, he has an obligation to explain his reasons for not doing so.</P>
    <P>The Minister says there is no problem in the area of housing.  There are approximately 20,000 people currently approved on the housing waiting lists for local authority houses, as opposed to the position in December 1988.  The Minister confirms that there will be in the region of 750 new local authority dwellings built this year.  That does not sound like an attempt to solve a problem.  The figures given by the Minister today are not accurate. Certainly, they are not accurate in so far as they predict how many people will be housed by local authorities.  Even on the Minister's predictions, a substantial number of those currently on the housing waiting lists will be there this time next year and this time two years.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes no reference to local government restructuring and financing.  He told this House over two years that he was considering the position and that we would have proposals.  The only proposal we now have is for a Dáil <Col N="386" /> or Oireachtas Committee as part of the Government programme.  When will the motion come before this House to establish that committee?  Is this a serious attempt to reform local government or merely a proposal to paper over the cracks that exist within the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; some Members of whom favour the reintroduction of rates and some oppose it and the Progressive Democrats oppose that reintroduction also.  Is this merely a diplomatic exercise or will it be a serious committee?</P>
    <P>There are many other issues that I would like to have raised but there is not time to deal with them in detail &mdash; such as the ongoing pollution of the Irish Sea and the need to take a major initiative in this country with regard to the use of CFCs.  I put the House on notice that if the Minister will not bring forward a Bill to abolish the use of CFCs within the next few months, such a Bill will be brought forward by the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>We proposed during the course of the last Dáil that it should be possible in Estimates debates to vary moneys and transfer them either within Estimates or from one Estimate to another.  That proposal was rejected by this House on two occasions.  We shall be voting against this Estimate this evening.  We are doing so because of the appalling record of this Minister in tackling the problems of pollution, of planning compensation, of dereliction and a whole series of other failures in the area of the environment. We are putting down a marker that we do not believe that this Minister and this Government are up to tackling these problems.  We are putting down a marker as to our serious intent for the Minister and for whoever happens to be appointed as his junior Minister, that we in the Fine Gael Party take very seriously the need to protect the environment and that we will monitor very closely and carefully the performance of this Government and will seek to ensure that those parts of the Government programme that we support are implemented and are not merely a public relations exercise to enable the coalition parties to form a Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to start by congratulating the new coalition Minister for the Environment on his appointment. I sincerely hope that his performance in this reincarnation as a coalition Minister will be remarkably better than his lamentable record as Minister for the Environment for the last two years.  It is appropriate that I should refer to the fact that the coalition programme, of which I presume he is aware, certainly in more detail than is the Taoiseach, proposes to re-establish one of the offices that he abolished, indicating at least a Damascus turning point, if not a complete conversion. I am referring to the decision of the Government to establish an office for the environment under the control of a separate Minister of State and also some kind of environmental protection agency.  I use my words advisedly because we have absolutely no information as to what that agency might do.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that almost a week has elapsed since this Government were appointed, it is clear that they have not the slightest idea of what they are going to do.  If they had, the Estimates speech being prepared for the Minister could have been rewritten and we would at least have had some reference in it to the provision of moneys in the course of this year.  This Estimate and the voting exercise in which we will be engaged tonight are already redundant in that the Minister and the Government &mdash; if they are to be true to their word &mdash; will have to bring in a substantially revised Estimate between now and the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the environmental protection agency and the purported role of a Minister of State with responsibility for environmental affairs, the Minister will not be taken seriously by the Labour Party unless an order is made by Cabinet transferring legal responsibility to that Minister of State conferring the legal power and autonomy to do the things for which he or she will have responsibility. Therefore, the credibility of the Government programme, in so far as it relates to the role of the Minister of State, will be subject to the acid test of the transfer of effective powers.  Can anybody think <Col N="388" /> of the work done by the other Departments set up just over two and a half years ago?  Their list of achievements is not very long.  I refer to science and technology and An Bord Glas and how they were supposed to help in the growing of vegetables.  Little or nothing happened because the senior Minister refused to transfer effective power to the junior Minister.  There was no subhead under the control of junior Ministers who did not have effective control of their own budgets.  The same fate will befall any junior Minister who takes on this task and it will be in a much higher profile area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, as I have had experience in this area, I am pointing out a minefield of which the future incumbent should be aware.  It is my duty to do so and I hope she is listening carefully to what I said.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have to move much more effectively in regard to smog in Dublin.  I share Deputy Shatter's view that it is hard to envisage it in weather like this but there will be a massive smog crisis in our capital city next winter unless radical changes are proposed and implemented by the Minister.  The proposals to date from the Department of the Environment in relation to the experimental area in Ballyfermot are totally inadequate.  We should not be taken by surprise by smog and during the summer the Minister should take on board the proposals made by the Labour Party and others to deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister appears to suggest in his Estimates speech that there is no housing crisis and that local authorities have enough money on the capital programme side to meet housing demand.  I do not know what world the Minister is living in, perhaps he is suffering from the same lack of communication which the Taoiseach had in relation to health cuts.  I would hate to think that the Minister <Col N="389" /> would find himself on a radio programme in a couple of years' time, facing the electorate, being forced to admit &mdash; like the Taoiseach &mdash; that he did not realise the situation was so bad.  There are over 20,000 people on the approved housing waiting list and it has now become increasingly difficult for many people to get on to this list because of a bureaucratic cutback by the local authorities to artificially reduce the numbers so that the extent of the housing crisis is distorted.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation, who have the largest single population of any local authority outside Dublin county and whose housing need is perhaps more acute, have no plans to build houses anywhere at present, the first time this has happened since the early twenties.  They are currently, on the direction of the Department of the Environment, disposing of land previously acquired for housing purposes.  If the Minister for the Environment and his backbench colleagues are not aware of the fact that there is a housing crisis, I am now formally telling them.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to what he is doing about roads and said that the operational programme submitted to Brussels would dramatically increase the amount of money that could &mdash; or may be &mdash; available for the roads programme.  He also referred to the National Roads Authority. However, the only effective and concrete proposal set out in the pre-coalition Fianna Fáil Government manifesto in 1987 was for the establishment of a National Roads Authority.  It is significant that of all the legislation, some aborted, some incomplete and some, such as the Local Government (Multi-Storey Buildings) Act on the Statute Book but which cannot be operated, the legislation for the National Roads Authority never got past first base.  We will be a long time waiting for it partly because the Minister cannot effectively resolve the problems in his own Department and with local authorities on the drafting of the legislation.  The Minister has had over two years to draft it.  Legislation was introduced in other areas which was not relevant or needed and which was badly <Col N="390" /> drafted.  However, the Minister said this legislation will be introduced in the autumn.</P>
    <P>Much of the finance for infrastructure which is necessary for our economy to function competitively in terms of 1992 cannot be put properly in place unless the National Roads Authority are firmly established in law.  The Minister should be criticised for his total failure to date to advance that legislation.  The Labour Party support the idea of a National Roads Authority but know full well that in their present limbo status, the Authority are powerless to deal with a single local authority, let alone the Department.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the question of EC Structural Funds because it is hard to reconcile the figures in the public capital programme and the current account Estimates with the figures in the Minister's speech.  It is difficult to see from where the 25 per cent increase will come unless the Minister is making presumptions in regard to private sector investment.  If that is the case they are nothing more than presumptions and we can only hope that the Minister will be successful in attracting finance into these areas.  As far back as 25 January in a written parliamentary reply to me, the Minister identified four areas that might be attractive for private sector investment. According to the Minister's speech, proposals were received on 31 March this year and are still being evaluated. It is totally misleading to suggest that private sector funds will transform our roads network.  That is an illusion to create the impression that there are large volumes of private sector funds in the economy for toll road development.  The Minister knows that is not the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have to come back to this House some time in the future to indicate that the situation is as I predicted.  In the meantime he is misleading the House in a political sense by creating the impression that the massive capital programme needed for roads <Col N="391" /> will be solved by an EC hand out or private sector investment.  That is not the case and the Department and those in the construction industry generally will confirm that to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister has consistently refused to introduce regulations which would enable a tenant in private rented accommodation to get a receipt for rent.  If a person buys a bar of chocolate in a supermarket he gets a receipt.  A receipt is necessary so that a person can show he has paid rent if he is looking for a rent allowance.  In some cases people cannot get such an allowance in private flats because they cannot prove to the community welfare officer that they are paying rent.  The reason given by the Minister is that he does not want to upset the private sector interests who are investing in housing and who might be put off if they were obliged as landlords to give receipts for rent.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that the massive inducements he has given for private sector investment in the construction industry are not being matched by a response from local authorities in regard to the administration of their planning departments. The delays in An Bord Pleanála will be compounded by the Estimate because it shows a reduction in the amount of cash being made available this year to that body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, and his colleagues in the new Coalition Government, are referring to the various incentives and inducements they are giving from taxpayers' money for private sector investment but the services which are essential to oversee and implement those developments are being reduced.  The result is that there are unacceptable delays and bottlenecks.  At the end of the day the weak and vulnerable sections in our society will suffer.  When one takes the capital and current side of the Estimate into account and looks at what is happening in areas where there is a need for urban renewal and effective maintenance &mdash; I am not referring to a figure of £4 million which the Minister is providing &mdash; one will see that there is not <Col N="392" /> the right focus or set of priorities in it.  The Labour Party consider that the amount of money allocated is inadequate and the internal allocation of the money unacceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in the words of congratulation to Deputy Flynn on his appointment as Minister for the Environment.  Like the previous speakers, I look forward to an improved performance during his occupancy of the Custom House.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on his speech, a remarkable one in that not once in the many pages he delivered did he mention that the Estimate showed a cut in environmental spending of 6 per cent in money terms and 9 per cent in real terms. The Minister did mention that the Estimate represents 6 per cent of GNP but he did not tell us that last year the Estimate for the Department of the Environment represented 7.7 per cent of GNP or that in the previous year it represented 10.5 per cent of GNP.  At this rate I am afraid that the environment will have to protect itself.</P>
      <P>The Estimate shows just how shallow are some of the commitments in the programme for government which was circulated last week.  That programme, and the Minister's speech, are strong on concern for the environment in much the same way as we have become accustomed to politicians expressing concern for the Irish language.  The new Ministry for Environmental Protection is welcome but is it going to be anything more than a sop to a perceived new electoral pressure in much the same way as the now defunct Ministries of women's affairs and youth were responses to what was then seen as the flavour of the month?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed independent environment monitoring agency is, of course, the reincarnation of An Foras Forbartha and that must prove, even to the Government, what a tragedy it was to abolish that body in the first place.  The problem facing the Minister is that he has to do a humpty-dumpty exercise and it will take years to reassemble the skills and the professionalism which characterised An <Col N="393" /> Foras Forbartha.  What a loss for this country that so many of the finest environmental scientists are now protecting the environment in Australia and other countries precisely because the last Government were so short-sighted and stubborn in abolishing An Foras Forbartha.</P>
    <P>Of course, all the agencies and ministries do not substitute for resources and neither do the kind of high profile initiatives which the Minister mentioned this evening even if, with some juggling of the figures, they come to £5 million.  The Estimate represents a real cut of 9 per cent over 1988 and the 1988 figure, in turn, was down 31 per cent on the 1987 figure although it will be argued that that was due to changes resulting from loan repayments.  The Government's alleged concern for the environment is nothing more than a public relations stunt, a fob-off to the environmental lobby.  It is remarkable that in the Minister's speech not once did he mention the rates support grants for local authorities, the largest environmental spending agencies in the country.  The Minister did not mention the fact that the rates support grant to those authorities has been cut by 7 per cent in the Estimate or by more than 10 per cent in real terms.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that the Minister would not mention this because in 1978, following the abolition of rates, the Fianna Fáil Government undertook to maintain the real value of local authority rates through the rates support grant.  Of course, that was not done.  Indeed, the income to local authorities has fallen seriously behind not only with regard to the potential income from rates but also with regard to inflation.  In 1978 the total allocated to local authorities was £81 million in lieu of domestic rates.  Adjusted for inflation alone that would now be £225 million but in the Estimate before us we have £160 million, a £65 million shortfall taking inflation into account.  To that must be added the shortfall resulting from the grant in lieu of agricultural rates which in 1977 was £70 million and, adjusted for inflation, would now be £200 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> In addition one must add the amount which would have accrued as a result of increased housing development. Nowhere is that more clear than in the Dublin County Council area, the population of which is greater than the city administrative area.  In fact, it is the fastest growing urban area in Europe.  If the rates support grant had kept pace with the potential from rates the income to Dublin County Council would be £80 million by way of rates support grant but it is only £18 million.  All that means is that local services are being decimated. How many libraries are closed this month?  One only has to look at the amount of grass on our roadsides.  Any residents' association will be able to list the essential work they would like to see done whether it is the erection of a set of traffic lights, the improvement of a footpath or other minor works.  Local authority tenants are in a position to highlight how long is takes to have essential repairs carried out, much less major refurbishment.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, directly across the road from the Blackrock Clinic, there is a little housing estate built by the British in the last century but those houses do not have any bathrooms and only one water tap.  Many of them are in need of essential repairs.  What a shame, after 70 years since the meeting of the First Dáil, and what a shame for the Estimate before us which does not offer any relief to those people.</P>
    <P>At the same time as local services are being slashed, tax-paying householders are being harassed into paying unacceptable service and water charges.  The Fianna Fáil Party in the 1985 local elections, and again in the 1987 general election, promised to abolish those charges. Instead of abolition we have local authority managements sending out their staff to cut off water and, in one county at least, to mark refuse sacks for collection by their refuse collection service.  That is a shame.  It represents an attack on law-abiding people whose taxes have increased.  For example, since the abolition of domestic rates the total take from PAYE tax has gone up by 429 per cent, <Col N="395" /> six times the rate of increase to local authorities in that period.</P>
    <P>However, it is in the area of housing that the Estimate stands condemned.  In the Estimate we find that the grants for the provision and improvement of local authority housing and so on are down 19 per cent; grants for new homes are down 28 per cent; grants for improvements to houses are down 60 per cent and other housing grants and subsidies are down 15 per cent.  What do we see in the programme for government in relation to housing?  Four lines represent the new Government's entire programme on housing.  Is it any wonder that many people on local authority housing lists, and young families who are trying to set up home, are in a state of despair?  This is remarkable particularly when it comes from a party which pride themselves as the party of the construction industry.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister state that he had plans to put 3,000 construction workers back to work but, unfortunately, that is an empty promise.  The fact of life in the construction industry is that for every six people employed in that type of work there are four such workers out of work. The money allocated by Governments for housing construction since 1982 has been cut in real terms by more than 65 per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not know where the Minister got his information that the numbers on the housing lists are dropping.  I find it remarkable that he mentioned a figure of 900 new housing starts.  It would take nearly that many houses to take the number of applicants in my constituency alone off the housing waiting list.  In the Borough of Dún Laoghaire there are 450 applicants on the waiting list, many of them living in rat infested, Rachman-owned type private accommodation, paying extraordinary rents and being subsidised by the State because they have not been allocated local authority accommodation. It is not that the corporation have not made any efforts &mdash; they have and I am sure other local authorities have too &mdash; to try to extract commitments from <Col N="396" /> the Department and the Government to have housing schemes started.</P>
    <P>In February 1987 Dún Laoghaire Corporation asked the Department of the Environment to accept the lowest tender for 50 houses in Loughlinstown.  We are still waiting for an answer.  In October 1987 we asked the Department to approve the tender for development works on a further 105 houses but we are still waiting for an answer.  In May 1988 preliminary proposals and a cost plan were submitted for 14 houses in Monks-town but we are still waiting for a reply from the Department of the Environment. Every local authority have submitted proposals to the Minister's Department but they are awaiting approval.  In the meantime large numbers of people are waiting for housing accommodation.</P>
    <P>Great play has been made by the Minister of some areas of his Estimate.  For example, he made reference to the efforts he is making to contribute to the protection of the ozone layer but the only mention of the ozone layer in the Estimates is the Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer to which £3,000 is being allocated and the Geneva Convention on Long Range Transboundary Pollution to which £7,000 is being allocated.  These are pathetic sums if the Minister is serious about contributing to the international efforts on environmental protection.</P>
    <P>The much lauded £5 million he quoted under Subhead G in the Estimate is again a very small sum for a very essential area of environmental protection.  A sum of £20,000 is being provided for pollution control but how much pollution can one control for £20,000, especially at a time when the money to local authorities who in turn are the agencies responsible for the control of pollution in their own areas, is being slashed?  Reference has been made to smog.  It was much commented on during the course of the year that the moneys allocated by the Government to deal with this area were totally inadequate.  Again the sum allocated in the Estimate this year, £1 million, is inadequate to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="397" /> For all those reasons The Workers' Party will be opposing the Estimate.  If we want to translate the kind of verbal concern for the environment that we have heard so much of in this House and elsewhere it will have to be translated into resources, in particular resources for local authorities who are in the front line in relation to the protection of the environment.</P>

      <P>I, too, congratulate the Minister for the Environment on his well deserved reappointment.  Deputy Quinn, who is not here now, was most unfair to the Minister, leaving myself aside altogether. I had special responsibility for urban renewal in housing and other relevant areas and the Minister for the Environment never interfered or stopped me from making a decision on any matter for which I was responsible. In fact, it was the other way round; he was most co-operative and helpful.  He fought the case of any issue for which I was responsible and which had to be brought to the Government.</P>
      <P>I want to say also in regard to roads that before we came into office the Coalition Government at the time had allocated £5 million only for repairs to county roads. When we came into office we immediately increased that to £10 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a lot of jobs. I have been a long time in this House and I have seen a lot of comers and goers, too.</P>
      <P>Deputies referred also to what was done in the past two and a half years by the Department of the Environment.  In recent times that Department have had five Bills before the Dáil.  They were the Building Societies Bill, the Planning Bill, the Derelict Sites Bill, the Air Pollution Bill and the building controls Bill.  Those were major Bills.</P>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to urban renewal. After I came to the Department of the Environment this scheme was extened to nine other towns.  I am glad to say that the scheme is getting off the ground and major works are being undertaken by private developers and with private finance. I want to thank all concerned in that development.  It is now realised and appreciated that many major construction companies are working six and seven days a week.  That is the position now obtaining compared with that when we assumed office.  I want the House to be very clear in that respect.  Everybody now realises that there is a pick-up occurring in the construction industry and indeed that there will be further improvements. That is the reality.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise that, within the constraints of the moneys available to us over the past two and a half years, we have seen a very good programme implemented.  I have no doubt that the programme of urban renewal will continue under the aegis of the Department of the Environment.  I have given the House the relevant facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members should not forget that there is not a Government Department that could not do with additional finance.  I <Col N="400" /> am not saying that the Department of the Environment should not be allocated more moneys but such allocation is dependent on the resources available to us.  Indeed, many Members advocated in this House that public expenditure should be curtailed.  They should remember that one cannot have it both ways.  If they want the necessary moneys allocated they know how to go about it and do not need me to tell them.  I have no doubt that the Minister would very much like to allocate more money for many programmes to be implemented by his Department.  I am confident that, as our national finances have improved &mdash; so that we can now dictate the finances required for running our country &mdash; more finance will be made available to the Department of the Environment to ensure that further improvements are effected nationwide.</P>

      <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to congratulate the Minister on his reappointment.  Looking at his introductory remarks it would appear to me that he is shellshocked by the events of the last week or ten days. If Johnston Mooney and O'Brien were still in existence they would have cleared all their debts with the amount of humble pie that had to be eaten by certain Members of this House over the past ten days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make a few points in regard to this important Estimate for the Department of the Environment.  I will begin by posing some questions with regard to the Structural Funds and the emphasis the Minister placed on those funds with regard to our application lodged in Brussels.  I am led to believe &mdash; and I should like the Minister to confirm to the House &mdash; that in the case of a substantial number of applications submitted to Brussels for road works and <Col N="401" /> improvements the relevant work had already commenced, rendering those applications ineligible for grant aid under the Structural Funds.  If this is the case there is a strong possibility that between £450 million and £500 million worth of grant aid that we had hoped would be forthcoming will not be made available to us because the relevant work had been started.  That matter should be cleared up.  Information emanating from Brussels is to the effect that that is the case.  We have witnessed also the extraordinary hype devoted by the Minister and his junior colleague to the extraordinary amounts of money made available for county roads.  Members accept that they doubled the amount of money required for county roads from £5 million to £10 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>From £5 million to £47.5 million.  They should thank us for having done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the previous Coalition Government who made a special case and allocation for county roads. Before that no Minister had made a special allocation to local authorities to be spent for that purpose.  Now we hear that for the year 1989 there is to be a remarkable one-third to two-thirds increase in the overall amount of money to be made available.  In this respect I must make the point that in a substantial number of counties the reduction that had taken place in the Estimates over a two year period and effected by the present Minister means that we are merely back to where we were in 1986. It will be readily appreciated that there are no bouquets to be given for the extra allocation being made this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made specific substantial reference to pollution in the course of his introductory remarks, in particular to the fact that the Water Pollution Bill had been passed by the Seanad.  It must be said that a number of serious problems with regard to pollution remain throughout the country.  I would also make the point that many industries and local authorities are greater polluters than farmers, <Col N="402" /> although it has been stated on a number of occasions that the farming community are totally to blame.  That is not the case. Indeed, the Minister accepted that there had been many improvements effected by the farming community in co-operation with the farming organisations.  It must also be pointed out that the non-availability of grants required to help farmers resolve their serious problems in this area has been a major factor in this respect.  The Minister should speak to his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, to ensure that such grants are not held in abeyance until, say, September or October when the weather may worsen and there will be greater difficulties encountered in having the necessary work implemented.</P>
    <P>The Minister's colleague, Deputy Connolly, referred to the excellent work done in the area of urban renewal.  Anywhere such urban renewal has been implemented it has brought attendant investment and prosperity to the town involved.  I asked a parliamentary question within the past four or five months whether the town of Navan would be considered for urban renewal purposes when I was told not in the immediate future.  Bearing in mind the number of people unemployed there I would ask that the town of Navan be included in the eight additional provincial towns to be considered for urban renewal purposes. Over the past two and a half years there have been seven national representatives from our constituency &mdash; three Deputies, three Senators and one MEP, who became known as the silent seven &mdash; who were unable to deliver any share of the national cake or convince any Minister to give sufficient funds or even an amount equal to that being allocated to other constituencies for that purpose.  I am pleading with the Minister this evening to include the town of Navan in the additional eight to be considered in case other Members in the parliamentary party may not be heard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few points in regard to local authority housing.  The Minister and his Minister of State have told us that approximately 7,200 households were housed by the local authority last year.  The Minister will have to accept that the majority of the houses allocated were houses for people who left and emigrated.  So far as it concerns the number of houses constructed and completed in our constituency last year, we completed one in a county with a population of 100,000.  I take this opportunity to invite the Minister to come down during the summer recess to formally open that house because it is a milestone for any Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>The facts are, so far as local authority housing is concerned, that we require a large increase in the number of local authority houses built.  There are on the Minister's desk in the Department of the Environment substantial numbers of applications for isolated cottages from my county and I am sure from every other county throughout the country for the building of those houses.  There are increased waiting lists and we have not built such cottages for a number of years. The Minister of State advocated that more of those type of houses should be built but we cannot build them without money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make a point in connection with environmental matters, the proposed new department which is to be set up and the assigning of responsibility to a Minister of State &mdash; be it Deputy Harney or whoever.  I honestly believe <Col N="404" /> that without giving full responsibility to whatever Minister is involved in this area progress will not be made.  We have serious problems in so far as pollution on the east coast is concerned.  We all know and we have seen in recent days people and representatives from this city going to England to object to proposals for a further nuclear plant.  We heard members of the Fianna Fáil Party, while in Opposition, talking about what they would do with Sellafield but, lo and behold, it all fell on deaf ears and no real progress was made in this regard.  Certainly it is a threat and the people on the east coast would like to see some major advance in negotiations to stop any further development that will affect people on the coast.</P>
    <P>Another area where we have seen and will see a substantial change in the actual allocation of funds is in regard to national lottery funds.  We are told in the proposed plan that certain new measures will be accepted or that the all-party proposals will be accepted; that will be a welcome relief to this House.  All anybody in this House would ask for is that a fair share of those funds be allocated to the different constituencies.  To date that has not happened. If it is dealt with in all-party committee then we are sure there will be a fair distribution of the funds.  I trust that if Deputy Harney accompanies the Minister for the Environment to run the Department we will see a major change in the way those funds are allocated. There is no one who would not accept that changes must be made.</P>
    <P>Finally, the matter of the Structural Funds is most important.  If particular decisions have been taken and if some of the proposals which have been submitted have been rejected because work had commenced then I think we have misled the nation by the amounts of allocations which we thought we would get from the European funds.</P>

      <P>In the few minutes left of Deputy Farrelly's time I want to put down a few markers because I understand we will have an opportunity later in the year to debate at greater length the Department of the Environment when a token Estimate is brought before the House.  Before doing that I would like to take the opportunity to wish the Minister well in his reappointment as Minister and I hope the Minister of State will either be back at that Department or in some other Department.  Despite the form he may be in this evening he has always been a very courteous Member of the House. When I was my party's spokesman on urban renewal I found it a great pleasure to deal with him and I wish him every success.</P>
      <P>I want to mention very briefly some matters which are of concern to me.  The Minister pointed out that there was not, in his view, the scale of difficulty with the housing waiting lists as indicated by other Members of the House.  The reason for that is that the Minister's statistics do not take into account the numbers of Irish people who are on the housing waiting lists in Islington, Hammersmith, Hackney and other such places.  A very serious situation is developing.  At present there are about 10,000 people, between the transfer list and the allocations list of Dublin Corporation, who will be on the list on 1 November next.  Many of them are already on the list.  It seems to me that the problem for a number of people on the transfer list could be dealt with very satisfactorily if instead of undertaking a massive house building programme in the inner city where there is not enough space, the Minister were to heed the suggestions I have been making in this House, month in, month out, for the past two or three years about the need to refurbish the inner city flats.  I am surprised no other Member of the House has mentioned it here tonight.  The Minister touched on it very briefly in his speech but did not come to terms with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have about 16,000 flats: 1,000 of those are senior citizen flats and are generally in good condition but <Col N="406" /> of the remaining 15,000 about 10,000, or two-thirds of the flats, are in an environmental condition that makes them not fit for human habitation.  It may well be that the Minister technically can say they qualify under the various Health Acts but would we, or anybody in this House, aspire to live in the conditions that we ask some of the tenants of Dublin Corporation &mdash; and I am sure other local authorities around the country &mdash; to live? If instead of spending £50,000 per unit building houses in the inner city the Minister spent £10,000 per unit he would have a very good job done in our city flats.  If he spent £20,000 he would have done an absolutely luxurious job.  The reality is that those flats which were built largely in the thirties and forties are in need of major refurbishment.  I challenge the Minister &mdash; if he does not believe me &mdash; to take a look around some of the inner city flat complexes; they are appalling. Before we talk about the whole need to look at Temple Bar&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will not see much of this in his own constituency. Let me make the point in the few minutes at my disposal.  The reality is that people are being asked to live in conditions which are absolutely appalling, in which none of us in this House would aspire to for ourselves or our families.  It can be sorted out for a relatively small amount of money.  I set out in a policy document which I launched last year how it can be funded.  I am not even asking the Minister to find the funding, I set out how it can be funded.  What is wrong with the Minister or those who are advising him that they have failed to heed the voice of Dublin Corporation?  We have had special council meetings, special housing committee meetings, I have raised it in <Col N="407" /> this House on the Estimates, by way of parliamentary questions and on the Adjournment but nothing is coming out of that Department to deal with the appalling situation in which people live. In addition, there are 2,000 tenants of Dublin Corporation, this year of millennium plus one, who still do not have a bathroom.  How many times have I raised that matter in this House and there has not been one mention of it in the Minister's speech?</P>
      <P>We are concerned about the environment of Temple Bar, the Georgian buildings and the general environment, which I think is a very worthy cause, but if we make the living conditions of the people in the inner city acceptable and take away the terrible squalor which exists in some of our inner city flats those people will ensure that the other environmental problems which are there will not be allowed to continue because they will have a commitment to the area.  I urge the Minister, for Heaven's sake, to address the question of the inner city flat complexes and the whole question of bathrooms before the situation gets completely out of hand.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle and colleagues, first I would like to congratulate the Minister on his reappointment and I look forward to a lot of good work over the coming years.  It has been acknowledged by the most senior of the public representatives in this House that an election campaign gives each one of us an opportunity of meeting people and listening to them.  It is important for Members to bring the views and concerns of people at large to the House.  I can accept that the Minister, or indeed the <Col N="408" /> Minister of State may not like to hear what we are saying but it is up to Members to bring the public's views to this Chamber in order to try to influence the direction of policy.</P>
      <P>In Dublin, particularly in County Dublin, local authority housing has reached a crisis.  I will offer to bring the Minister or the Minister of State around my constituency, or indeed any constituency in the greater Dublin area to see the extent of the problems on the ground.  People are living in rat infested conditions.  Young couples trying to make a start are living in draught ridden conditions or in mobile homes where the condensation is streaming from the ceiling when they get up in the morning. All the public representatives know that people living in these conditions face saturated sheets when they get up in the morning.  These unfortunate people, who cannot look after their own needs, cannot get the normal health services to which they are entitled.  For example, in Swords there are over 170 applicants on the housing list.  They do not want to know that the list has been reduced by 40 per cent since 1982.  As other Deputies have mentioned, much of this had been brought about by the policies of other Governments, who had a definite commitment to provide housing for people in need &mdash; indeed the Estimates from 1982 to 1985 show that &mdash; and it was not until 1987-1989 that there was a reduction in the finance for local authority housing. Because of the large number of applications from people in Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush and Lusk the housing lists are becoming longer and longer.  However, I hope when replying to the Estimate this evening the Minister will give some joy to the people in the greater Dublin area by sanctioning the Castlegrange scheme which has been awaiting sanction in his Department for the past 18 months.  I hope the Minister might do that this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen no reference to unfinished estates.  During the previous general election, when Fianna Fáil were going around the constituency they gave a commitment that something would be done about this <Col N="409" /> problem but nothing had come on stream in the two and a half years they were in Government.  In fact, in Balbriggan people in the Braemor estate have waited 14 years to have their estate taken in charge.  A new generation has grown up without open spaces.  I accept that I cannot put the blame entirely on the Minister or indeed on any Minister, but the necessary legislation has to come from this House.  Unfortunately, the county council do not have the power to act in this area and we have to do something about this.</P>
    <P>I now wish to deal with planning compensation and the lack of progress in this respect.  At a time when the local authorities have not sufficient money to provide additional public lighting in certain areas we take issue that we, the people of Dublin, are asked to pay £2 million compensation to a developer.  The people take issue with this because the developer in question left nothing but a trail of unfinished estates across the county.  Yet the proposed legislation before the last Dáil did not deal with this issue.  That is part of the problem.  I live in the parish of Donabate.  The most recent compensation claim now with the arbitrator is for another £2 million.  When one considers that this company is not registered in this country &mdash; they are registered in the Isle of Man &mdash; and yet they expect the ordinary people to pay anything up to £2 million compensation, it is time to call a halt.  The people have told the Taoiseach and the Minister that enough is enough.  The message about the health services was very clear and the people are giving us a very clear message about planning compensation.  They are saying that this scandal has to be dealt with.  I hope the proposed legislation will introduce a retrospective element.  He should listen to the views from all sides of the House thus ensuring that the legislation will be dealt with once and for all.</P>
    <P>I thank you a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to express my views.  I now wish to deal with water pollution.  In Balbriggan we have a defective sewerage system.  Commitments were made more than two years ago to <Col N="410" /> provide a modern treatment plant for the gown, but what did we get?  We were told that it was sufficient to extend the existing pipe into the Irish Sea, thus piping raw sewage into the Irish Sea.  That is not good enough and we want proper treatment plants in all our towns, particularly on the coast.</P>
    <P>On the basis of my contribution I hope the Minister and the Minister of State will take on board what I have said and I hope that we will have a response as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no wish to delay and I will make some brief comments which are important to the area I represent.</P>
      <P>I join in the good wishes extended to the Minister, although I must say I was disappointed with his performance over the past two years and three months, particularly in his contribution to rural Ireland.  During the period of the last Government there was massive city based expenditure.  It is unfair that there is not a fair spread of the available resources throughout the country.  I see that the Minister of State agrees with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is plain for anybody to see that there has been major expenditure on ring roads and toll roads, yet for a fraction of that money wonderful improvements could have been made to the county roads and the rural roads of Ireland.  I have been highlighting that here for the past two and a half years but it has fallen on deaf ears.  Nothing has been done irrespective of what the Minister or the Minister of State has said with regard to the increased contributions to local authorities who are literally starved <Col N="411" /> of cash.  They have not got the resources. It is sad to see the conditions which small farmers and rural dwellers, the backbone of this country, have to endure when travelling to and from their homes daily. I have heard city Deputies express fear about air pollution and smog in the city and I am not taking from their case.  I support them but let them remember we have to put up with the condition of the roads all year round and I would like their support also.  I sympathise with them although sympathy is not what we want. We want action.  I ask the Minister to take a serious view of our county roads because they are deplorable.  I invite him to come down to my area over the summer to see for himself the conditions that have to be endured.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not but the Minister must not be aware of what is happening. Obviously he lives on the side of a major county road and not on a by-road where the vast population lives.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some day I must take a drive to see where the Minister is living. Obviously he is not aware of the problems that exist.  I am serious about this matter and I will keep coming back to it later in the year when we have more time to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to housing, to say here that the housing problem has been solved is far from reality.  There are major problems with regard to the provision of rural cottages.  Many people still want to live in rural Ireland although some people here seem to think otherwise.  I submit a list of applications regularly to the county manager for the provision of rural cottages but we have not got the finance.  An application was made to the Department eight years ago for a scheme of 15 houses in a small town called Ballyconnell in Cavan, just on the Border but we are still awaiting sanction.  I am asking the <Col N="412" /> Minister to make provision for this scheme and let us get on with the work there.  People are still anxious to live in that part of the country.  We are looking forward to 1992 when there may be light at the end of the tunnel and hope for people in that area.</P>
    <P>Housing repairs are another major problem.  When people are anxious to keep their homes in order it is bad policy to allow them to be run down for the sake of spending perhaps £20,000, £40,000 or £50,000 per annum.  Slates may be blown off houses, windows cracked or whatever. That amount of money is a small provision to make annually to ensure that we keep our stock of houses in reasonable repair.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Structural Funds, that was the greatest political gimmick ever exercised in this country.  Has anything factual been sent to Brussels in relation to the Structural Funds?  Have any of the proposals which were made at the regional meetings been submitted? My information is that they have not. The chairman in my area told me he has received many applications which have not even been opened yet.  That is wrong and is sad.  People believed this was an opportunity for business development and they sat down, put pen to paper and made proposals but they have heard nothing since, not even an acknowledgement in some cases.  That is wrong because when people are led to believe there is something to be achieved and suddenly it falls apart, they get very disillusioned and lose heart.  I believe the outline of a plan has been submitted to Brussels.  For God's sake, put a bit of beef on the bones.  I know from the MEP in my area that there is good will.  The plan should be submitted so that we can get the finance that is available.</P>
    <P>With regard to urban renewal, the Minister of State specifically mentioned programmes in this regard.  I make no apology for saying that towns in the Border region are totally dilapidated and need a face-life.  When talking about North-South relations, it is not very encouraging for people to travel further South when they see derelict towns and <Col N="413" /> villages.  This is not the fault of the residents who have simply gone out of business. I could name the towns and villages but I will not take up time doing so now: I will submit them to the Minister.  Villages such as Butler's Bridge, Redhills, Ballyhaise, and towns such as Ballyconnell, Swanlinbar, and Blacklion are in need of renewal immediately.</P>
    <P>Pollution is a major problem.  I refer to Lough Sheelin in my own county which was one of the most famous trout fishing lakes in Europe but unfortunately pollution destroyed the fishing there.  Great effort was made to deal with the problem and a scheme was set up to remove slurry and spread it outside the catchment area. That was an excellent success but unfortunately I believe that the lake has again started to deteriorate.  An announcement was made by, I think, the Minister for Tourism and Transport &mdash; if I am wrong I will accept it but certainly some senior Minister in the Cabinet made a major announcement &mdash; about an effort that was made in regard to a development for the recycling of the waste in that area. Over eight or nine months ago a grandiose announcement was made, there was a major press statement and guests were invited but to date we have heard nothing with regard to the progress that has been made or whether there has been any breakthrough.  Are we again building up people's hopes about something that will not be a reality?  There is not a line in this statement by the Minister in relation to that development.  It certainly warrants a progress report as it is one of the most important lakes in the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Bill, the Minister stated that it will be on the Order Paper again but I hope it will not appear in its original form because that was a draconian measure.  You will not drive people into making necessary improvements; you must encourage them.  By introducing that measure the Minister would be waving the big stick unnecessarily.  It was proposed to impose fines of £25,000 which is sufficient to put <Col N="414" /> a small farmer out of business and bankrupt him.  He should be given a reasonable grant and shown how the work should be done.  The Minister tells me that the grants are available.  They are available if the farmer can get the go-ahead from the farm development office to do the work.  The people have made their applications but they cannot get the go-ahead because the officers in the farm development service are not allowed to visit the farms due to non-availability of money for expenses.  People are anxious to do the work and grants are available but they cannot get the sanction.</P>

Perhaps the previous Government were fully aware of what was happening but we will keep spelling it out and drawing it to their attention.  I am not coming in here to try to raise hares or get carried away about issues that are not factual.  These are factual issues that are affecting the people and I am asking the Minister to take cognisance of them.  He should take another look at that Bill before he reintroduces it.  If it is properly presented it will have our support, but if not it will not have our support. I wanted to refer to other items but I take it that other speakers want to contribute.  I ask the Minister to take serious note of what I have said.  Again, I wish him well and I hope for an improved performance over the next couple of years.</P>

      <P>All the major parties have used their allocation of time.  The Workers' Party have had 15 minutes out of a possible two hours and they will appreciate that is the maximum time we can allow them.  The Labour Party have used their allocation as have <Col N="415" /> Fine Gael.  Bearing in mind that the Minister has to be allowed in at 8.40 p.m., I think we should give five minutes each to the two Independent Members who have had no time yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for your indulgence in giving me five minutes.  We read last week in the programme for government that a new office for the protection and improvement of the environment is being set up as well as an independent environmental monitoring agency.  It is most disappointing that there is nothing whatever in the Minister's speech regarding either of these two new departures.</P>
      <P>The new office for the protection and improvement of the environment is certainly welcome but it is no substitute for a Department of the Environment which would be limited solely and strictly to environmental matters, which of course is not the case at present.  This would be a simpler and more direct solution.  It is recognised by all parties that there is a need to give a much higher degree of priority to the environment than hitherto.</P>
      <P>It is very important that the new, independent environmental monitoring authority be completely independent of the Government and the Department of the Environment.  This was not so with An Foras Forbartha who were really under the control of the Department of the Environment and were not a totally free agent.  I hope the Minister will take note of this comment.  I want to be constructive about this.  I know one of the new authority's main tasks will be to carry out studies and publish reports and I trust these reports will be readily available to interested members of the public.  Freedom of information on environmental matters is absolutely essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the biggest problems facing Dublin is the appalling atmospheric conditions prevailing on many days in winter time.  It is well known that smog causes many unnecessary deaths each winter. The prevarication by the Minister is notorious.  He seems to be totally in the pocket of the coal lobby represented by <Col N="416" /> Coal Information Services.  This is well illustrated by the pathetic faith the Minister has in the full burning fire being marketed by Coal Distributors Limited. CDL claim a rate of efficiency of 80 per cent whereas the Eolas report records that 17 per cent efficiency would be nearer the mark.  Section 39 of the Air Pollution Act was inserted specifically at the request of Coal Information Services. This was admitted by the Minister during the Dáil debate on the Bill.  This section was to give the coal industry the right to object to any proposed smoke control area thus delaying the implementation of these very necessary control orders.  It is outrageous that the Government should have caved in in such a supine way to this pressure group.  This pandering to the coal lobby will have to cease.  I wonder how much CDL contributed to the Fianna Fáil Party funds.  Action is needed before the winter.  This matter must be dealt with and grants should be made immediately for closed appliances which, of course, are much more energy efficient.  Also, incentives should be introduced immediately for the use of smokeless fuel.  We should go further; we should prevent by law the sale of household coal.  Make it illegal and get on with it.  The whole of Dublin city should be the subject of a smoke control order.  This was done in London in 1955 but 34 years on we are not prepared to do it for Dublin.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will do something about the scandal of the proposed Merrell Dow factory in east Cork.  I appeal to him to find some way of stopping this crazy project.</P>
    <P>The next problem is the Water Pollution Bill which is inadequate in many respects.  Will the Minister come out from behind the officialese and say whether this Bill will be put before the Dáil before the recess?  Saying it will be put on the Order Paper does not make sense to the ordinary person in the street.  We have heard a number of references in the House tonight to fish kills, water pollution is a contributory factor to this problem.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the Sellafield issue all we <Col N="417" /> get is another burst of verbal environmentalism, such waffle as that the new Government will examine all legal options under the EURATOM Treaty. The Minister has had two and a half years to consider these options.  For example, in 1987 and 1988 the Irish delegation to the Paris Commission called for the closing of Sellafield.  In June of this year the Commission met in Dublin but this time the Irish delegation failed to make a similar demand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. Foxe Mr. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for allowing me time to speak.  I would like to compliment and congratulate Deputy Flynn on his appointment to the position of Minister for the Environment.  I note with interest that his Department have instituted certain surveys of our waterways, both rivers and lakes, to find out the source of pollution.  Be it individual farms, factory farms, town councils or county councils, it is most desirable that the source be found.  While penalties are desirable it is more important to have the people responsible for causing the pollution educated in manners and ways of preventing further pollution.  It is the prevention of pollution we are interested in, not penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the ambition of our new Government apparently &mdash; the stated ambition anyhow &mdash; to have all cattle housed in winter.  That is desirable and fast may the day roll on when it is achieved.  However, with that will come certain problems of keeping animals in confined spaces and, needless to say, one big problem facing us again will be pollution.  We all enjoy a <Col N="418" /> good clean, healthy environment and we should not leave it up to the farmers to be the sole protectors of that environment. We may bear in mind that up to 70 per cent of farmers have incomes of less than £5,000 annually, equivalent to £100 a week, and then we ask those very people to spend in the region of £7,000 to £10,000 on tanks or pits to collect the effluent which causes the pollution. It is unrealistic on our part to expect that.</P>
    <P>One way of overcoming the problem would be to make more finance available in this area.  In certain parts of the country the rate of grant for these tanks is 15 per cent, in other parts 25 per cent.  By way of encouraging people to build such tanks and prevent pollution from silage effluent and other farm waste we should increase the rate of grant to 100 per cent.  It is ironic that when the Government's stated policy is the preservation of the farming family the agricultural advisory body who provide information to the farmers on the most effective and efficient way of running their farms, preventing pollution and so on, are being decimated in their numbers.  If we are serious about preserving farming families and about decreasing pollution from farming, instead of reducing the numbers in Teagasc, we should be increasing them. Silage effluent in itself is not a poisonous substance; it is fed to animals in other countries as well as here, but it absorbs oxygen in the water with the result that fish die of oxygen starvation.  They are not poisoned.  A little incentive to the agricultural scientists to investigate ways and means of using silage effluent rather than containing it first and then spreading it over the ground so that it eventually finds its way through to the waterways might be one option to bear in mind.</P>

      <P>It would be impossible, of course, to deal in any comprehensive way with the major matters raised here.  As is the case every time an Environment Estimate is discussed, one could be here for hours discussing matters which are of great concern to everybody.  However, I shall just hit on a few of the items that seem to cause recurring difficulties and which have been raised by a number of speakers.</P>
      <P>First, let me tell Deputy Garland that the Water Pollution Bill will be restored to the Order Paper and everybody else will have an opportunity to consider aspects of that Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I have outlined in my speech several areas where progress had been made. Deputy Shatter made the first contribution of the evening.  I cannot understand where the Deputy has been for the past couple of years as he has not recognised some of these areas of progress.  We have been dealing successfully with the matter of unleaded petrol.  The Air Pollution Act was the first legislation introduced by the last Government.  We are taking continuing action regarding smog in Dublin. We have increased environmental awareness amongst the public as a result of the environmental awareness campaign last year.  The Water Pollution Bill has been passed by the Seanad and will be reintroduced here shortly.  We have introduced a Derelict Sites Bill and we have a major programme of urban renewal which has brought considerable advances in job creation and an enhancement of our cities and larger towns.  There have also been major advances regarding waste management.  We have dealt with the beaches.  I had a major input both nationally and internationally on the question of the ozone layer and the control of manufacture and distribution of CFCs.  The question of recycling was also given an impetus.  The list is quite long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="420" /> It should at least have been recognised that a major amount of work was undertaken by the Minister for the Environment during the past two and a half years.  I would go so far as to say that it was the first time ever that a Minister for the Environment was attached to any Government since the foundation of the State.  Even if I have to say it myself, I will put it on the record that more was done for the natural environment in the past couple of years than had ever even been contemplated by any Minister or any Government in the past 60 years.</P>

I will not waste the time of the House by referring to all the inaccuracies, except to say that Bus Éireann buses run on diesel and to suggest in the document that they should be converted to take unleaded petrol in order to reduce emissions is some indication of the lack of understanding on the part of Deputy Shatter and his party.</P>

      <P>I would take issue with Deputy Quinn regarding private investment in roads. We tentatively estimated that the money available would be between £50 million and £100 million in the period 1990 to 1994.  The roads programme will continue to be funded for the most part by the Exchequer with EC assistance.  Deputy Quinn will be pleased when he realises the interest among the private sector with regard to tolling franchises.  There is an interested party in regard to the Dublin ring road and when a full examination of the matter is public knowledge Deputy Quinn will be the first to agree that it is quite a successful initiative.</P>

      <P>Regarding Deputy Gilmore's point about the drop in the percentage of GNP, the reason is the change in the funding arrangements for local authorities in the recent past.  He would not be expected to know about it at this stage.  The Local Loans Fund Act, 1987, ended circular payments to local authorities. The end of those circular payments removed about £300 million from the Estimate in 1988.  There will be a cumulative increase each year.  Perhaps that is the reason the Deputy misunderstood this point.  It is not correct to say that our contribution to international organisations, particularly those involved in the environment, is an indication of <Col N="423" /> our interest.  Our contributions to the United Nations environmental programme, the Paris Convention, the Vienna Convention and the Geneva Convention are set down in the international arrangements.  We make our full commitment in all those areas.</P>
      <P>Many other matters were referred to but the Leas-Cheann Comhairle prohibits me from making a more substantial response.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla sought to raise on the Adjournment the dispute at the Semperit Tyre Factory in Ballyfermot and the matter is in order.  We have lost a little time, so the Deputy will have about 18 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  This is a matter of great importance to very many people in Ballyfermot, Walkinstown, Crumlin, Drimnagh and Inchicore from where there are 600 people employed in Ballyfermot.  These people have seen very many industries shut down over recent years.  Neither the people of the area nor the workforce want to see another shutdown.</P>
      <P>In 1986 there was a similar threat of  shutdown in Semperit and this caused an enormous scare in the area. The workforce were looking for compensation for changes in work practices and so on, but as a result of the threat of closure they accepted everything the company suggested. They had no option at that time. They accepted a major restructuring deal which meant job losses, changed work practices and changed working conditions at the plant.  The workforce understood that if they carried out the programme schedule set down by the management, the company would be safe and that they would have a secure future. They kept their part of the bargain and increased productivity by an unprecedented 25 per cent in two years.  For that increased productivity the workforce got nothing although the company had a huge gain in profits, sales and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In February of this year the Tánaiste, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who is a Deputy <Col N="427" /> for the area, at a reception and press conference in Semperit, announced on behalf of Semperit the great news for the workers in that company and also for the people of Ballyfermot, that an expansion in investment would lead to the creation of an additional 152 jobs by the end of this year.  The funding for this expansion plan was to be from the company itself, the IDA and Fóir Teoranta but we were not told how much each contributor would put in.  The investment was to be about £25 million.  All we were made aware of was that the IDA were to contribute approximately £7 million.  We were not told of any other conditions attaching to this expansion programme. Since then the board of the parent company of Semperit have sought major changes in the working conditions of those employed at the plant in Ballyfermot. Under the plan, production at the plant would increase from 50,000 to 85,000 tyres per week.  To achieve this the workers would have to change from a three-cycle shift system over five days to a four-cycle shift system over seven days.  That would make enormous changes in the lives of workers not alone because they would be working at night but because they would be working at weekends, on Sundays and so on.  This would mean a change of lifestyle for the whole family.</P>
    <P>Despite reports to the contrary in the media, especially the reports being hyped up by the IDA that the employees refused to accept the new shift system, I would emphasise that the workers did not refuse to accept the need for a new shift system.  They understood the proposal and what it would do for the company and they were prepared to negotiate this new shift system.  They simply sought adequate compensation for the enormous disruption that such a fundamental change would cause to them and their families, having got no compensation for previous changes in work practices which led to a 25 per cent increase in productivity. The original compensation offered by the company was a lump sum of £75, a sum that would probably not <Col N="428" /> pay for the average lunch for a couple of Semperit executives.  The negotiations proceeded and the matter went to the Labour Court which effectively acknowledged that the company's offer was totally inadequate.  The Labour Court recommended major improvements on the company's offer.  The workers felt that the Labour Court recommendation was a significant advance, but they thought that it did not go far enough for them.  In particular they sought an increase in the shift premium of up to 11.25 per cent to compensate them for the disruption and changes that would be caused in their lives and for the huge increase in productivity which would arise from these changes in practices.</P>
    <P>Up to this, the normal industrial relations process had operated.  In recent months there were numerous meetings of the workers, unions and management. At all times the workforce knew what was happening and they were aware of what management were offering.  The company were seeking major changes in work practices and the workers were looking for adequate compensation for the changes sought.  This is a process that is gone through in scores of companies all over the country every day of the week, month and year.  It is normal practice to look for compensation when changes are sought in work practices and productivity.</P>
    <P>However, the position deteriorated prior to last weekend when the company resorted to what I can only describe as the gun to the head school of industrial relations which has developed in recent years in many companies around the country &mdash; the threat of closure when workers look for anything &mdash; but this was the second time it happened in this company.  The threat was accept our offer or not only will the development plan not go ahead, but it is likely that the whole plant will be closed down and the existing workforce of 600 workers will lose their jobs.  This was an unnecessary threat and a response out of proportion to the matters still in dispute.  It was unhelpful that the threat was made just as the workers were about to go on their holidays.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> Another unhelpful development over the weekend was the extraordinary intervention of the IDA into what is an industrial dispute.  The IDA admitted that it was virtually unprecedented for them to intervene in an industrial dispute, yet despite this, the authority's chief executive, Mr. Padraic White, barged in with a series of partisan statements that can only be described as crudely pro management and hostile to the workers. Industrial relations is an incredibly delicate area and Mr. White has no competence or expertise in this area as his statements most clearly show.  There was a time not too long ago when the IDA seemed to recognise the advantage of an organised workforce and the positive role the trade union movement could play when dealing with multinational companies setting up here.  They have played a tremendous role in many of those companies over many years and those companies are very happy with the role the trade union movement and their workforce have played in enormously increasing their profits which they are now repatriating at increasing rates.  At present almost £2 billion is repatriated each year and this figure is expected to reach £4 billion during the coming five to six years.</P>
    <P>It seems that there has been a big shift in the IDA's attitude to the trade unions. They have now adopted an anti-trade union position.  Certainly if Mr. White wanted to antagonise the workforce he could not have done better.  All his criticism was directed at the workers.  There was not a word of censure for the threat made by the chairman of Semperit (Ireland), Dr. Klaus Roeker, who said that if the company did not get its way it would stop every penny from Germany. He is also quoted as saying that if the workforce want to kill their jobs, okay, this is it.  I know, and the IDA should know as should Dr. Roeker, that the workers do not want to kill their jobs &mdash; far from it.  They have no intention of killing their jobs.  They want to maintain them.  It is only Dr. Roeker who spoke about killing the jobs and the closure of the factory.  What the workers want is <Col N="430" /> secure, reasonably paid jobs for themselves and for as many others as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the doomsday scenario painted by some sections of the media is accurate.  The parties are not that far apart.  The Labour Court recommendation with some adjustments could provide the basis for a solution.  Unfortunately, however, the matter is now deadlocked.  The workforce are on holiday and the management have gone back to the parent company in Hanover from where the statements about the killing off of jobs were issued.  Their more recent statement indicated that they were placing their offer on hold.  That was a very welcome development and should be capitalised on.  I presume this means that it is okay until the workforce return from their holidays and can deal with the trade unions and that there is no immediate threat of closure.</P>
    <P>Now is the time for the Minister for Labour, who has shown his skill in a series of major political negotiations in recent weeks that must have seemed far more daunting to him than the Semperit dispute, to intervene.  I think his presence at this stage is absolutely essential.  With a little give and take on both sides I believe the dispute can be settled, the future of the plant secured and the jobs of the workers guaranteed.  I can assure the company that their profits can also be guaranteed.  They have an outstanding workforce who will return five-fold any investment put into the plant.  All they require, all they have been negotiating for and all they have been working for in recent months is a reasonable return for the extra work and productivity they will achieve and from which the company will gain an enormous increase in profits &mdash; an increase from the current production of 50,000 tyres per week to 85,000 tyres per week.  Out of those profits the workers want a reasonable rate of return for themselves.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to intervene and to bring the sides together to commence further discussions.  I am confident a solution can be found because they are not far apart.  The Labour Court recommendation could provide the basis for a <Col N="431" /> solution.  I ask the Minister to ask his colleague to whom Mr. Padraic White of the IDA is answerable to call him off. Let him stick to the job he is paid to do. He should be told never to intervene in an industrial dispute because all he has done is to hype it up to the stage where it could have disastrous consequences for the workers and the plant in Ballyfermot. I ask the Minister to ensure that Mr. White never intervenes again in an industrial dispute.  I appeal to the Minister for Labour who has shown his expertise in finding solutions in other disputes in the past to exercise his mind on this one and to intervene as early as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Mac Giolla for raising this issue and giving us an opportunity to have some discussions on it prior to the Dáil recess.</P>
      <P>First, I wish to express my grave concern that this major and important investment and expansion programme planned for the factory is now under threat.  It appears also that should the planned investment not take place the future of the existing operation, as Deputy Mac Giolla has said, will also be placed in jeopardy.  I need hardly emphasise the disastrous consequences, particularly in terms of the employment implications of such an eventuality, which none of us would like to see happening.  Deputy Mac Giolla has given an outline of the case with which I would not disagree on factual matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into any great detail, other than to say that early in the year an investment expansion plan was announced involving the investment of £25 million and the creation of a very welcome 152 additional jobs.  The plan would increase the output from 50,000 tyres to 85,000 tyres a week involving a change from a three-cycle shift system over five days to a four-cycle shift over seven days.  The proposed change in the shift system was resisted initially by the workers because of the disruptive effect on their social life.  I would agree with <Col N="432" /> the comments made by the Deputy that that is disruptive of people's social life.</P>
    <P>The initial decision to reject the new system was revised in the second ballot following on the announcement that the investment plans would be dropped and the plans scaled down, but the arrangements were not implemented.  The acceptance in principle of the four-shift system enabled negotiations to begin on the terms for its introduction.  It is now accepted on all sides that if the investment plan is to go ahead it will be necessary to switch from a three-cycle shift to a four-cycle continuous system and the problems which have arisen some people think are with regard to the cycle, as Deputy Mac Giolla said, but it centres around the offer to the workforce in return for agreement to the introduction of the new system.</P>
    <P>The dispute over the terms for the introduction of the new system has been investigated by the Labour Court which issued its recommendations on 11 July. The recommendation which made a number of improvements on the company's offer was rejected in a ballot by the workforce.</P>
    <P>For the information of the House, the recommendation of the Labour Court was as follows:</P>
    <P>The Court has considered the submissions made by the parties, and in the light of the urgency with which a decision is needed recommends the following terms of settlement on the issues still outstanding.</P>
    <P>In the first instance the Court is satisfied that the overall offer made by the company, in terms of impact upon its production costs, is very close to the maximum sustainable by it, for the time being.  The Court therefore recommends:</P>
    <P>(1)  Payment of the 38 hour week to be the same as for 40 hours, i.e. the hourly rate to be adjusted by 5.26 per cent.</P>
    <P>(2)  An increase of holidays by 2 additional days.</P>
    <P>(3)  Shut-down holidays to be 3 <Col N="433" /> weeks subject to detailed agreement on implementation.</P>
    <P>(4)  Service days to be paid at 12 hours.</P>
    <P>(5)  The introduction of a sick pay scheme from July, 1991.</P>
    <P>(6)  The Court further recommends that the Company amend its offer on shift premium to provide for an increase of 6.5 per cent to be introduced as follows:</P>
    <P>Phase 1:4 per cent from the commencement of 4 shift working.</P>
    <P>Phase 2: 2.5 per cent after 9 months.</P>
    <P>(7)  As a final amendment to the Company's proposals, the Court recommends that the lump sum offer be increased to £150.</P>
    <P>The Court at this stage does not recommend any further changes in conditions but takes the view that when the first stages of the changes arising from the proposed investment programme have been completed that a further review of overall conditions should take place, such a review to be considered an integral part of this recommendation, and subject if necessary to a further investigation and recommendation by the Court.  This review should commence in September, 1990 and should incorporate an undertaking by the Company to consolidate a sum of not less than £5 of the 27th Round flat increase into the basic rate at a date not later than 1st February, 1991 as an earnest of their willingness to share the benefits accruing from the changes which will take place.</P>
    <P>The Court acknowledges that such a delay in obtaining these benefits may not be as attractive as further immediate improvements in income and conditions but does urge all concerned to take account of the other undoubted advantages deriving from the Company's proposal such as the enhanced security of employment, the additional employment made available, as well <Col N="434" /> as the likely long term direct benefits which will accrue.</P>
    <P>Following a meeting of the board of the parent company at the weekend it was announced by management that the terms recommended by the court would remain on offer to the workforce until after the workers' return from their annual holidays on 8 August.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Mac Giolla and the other Deputies who have remained on in the House for this debate &mdash; Deputies Rabbitte, O'Sullivan, Ryan and my colleague, Deputy Lawlor &mdash; I would urge both sides to use this intervening period to re-open discussions with a view to securing agreement so that this major investment programme, which all of us in this House do not want to lose, can proceed as planned.  I accept that Deputy Mac Giolla and the other Deputies are not only interested in what is there but in additional jobs as quickly as possible coming on stream.  I assure the Deputies, and Deputy Mac Giolla in particular, that the services of the Labour Court are available now and will continue to be available and I am prepared to have discussions at any stage.  The officers of the court will also be available if their services are required.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Mac Giolla has said, that nobody wishes to be emotive, that we are all in the job of trying to see the creation of extra employment and that sanity will prevail in matters of industrial relations.  I welcome the all-party support which I always received in this House.  Industrial relations are a delicate matter, not one for shouting over the rooftops.  In this House for years industrial relations have been treated on that delicate basis.  I appreciate that Deputy Mac Giolla has reiterated the grounds which we follow.  On that basis I would take this opportunity of emphasising, in particular, the Labour Court's recommendations that when the first stages of the changes arising from the proposed investment programme have been completed, a further review of overall conditions should then take place.  That would be in September 1990.  This review <Col N="435" /> gives the parties the chance to evaluate the situation in just over a year from now.</P>
    <P>There, I believe, lies the solution to and the grounds for the commencement of discussions and a homing in on the point which the court has raised about this new plan being very close to what is viable for the company but, equally, on the point of the disruptive effect for the workforce.  Matters should be allowed to proceed on the basis of the court's recommendations and at the end of the first phase there should be a further review.  With the support of the House I would ask both sides between now and 8 <Col N="436" /> August &mdash; and sooner rather than later &mdash; to recommence discussions.  The senior officers of the court are available to assist at whatever hour or day it is wished that discussions be commenced.  There should not be any delay.  There is not a big difference involved.  There are grounds within the recommendations for negotiation, and that opportunity should be used.  This debate tonight has been useful in allowing us to appeal to all involved.  I thank the Deputies who have remained to listen to this debate and ask both sides to consider what we are saying.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the reason a person (details supplied) in County Offaly is being taxed at the top rate of 56 per cent in 1989-90 in respect of an ESB pension previously taxed at the rate of 35 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that, on the basis of the information available to the inspector of taxes, the taxpayer's total estimated income for the current year, 1989-90, is likely to exceed the relevant exemption threshold of £6,000.  Consequently, he is not entitled to exemption from tax. However, as his estimated income does not greatly exceed the threshold, he is entitled to a measure of marginal relief. Marginal relief ensures that the tax payable in respect of the taxpayer's total income is no more than 60 per cent of the excess of his total income over the appropriate exemption limit.  In every case in which it applies, it is more favourable to a taxpayer than taxation under the normal system of applying the 32 per cent rate to his taxable income, i.e. income less personal allowances and reliefs; this is because, although the rate of tax is higher, the amount of income to which it is applied is considerably less.</P>
      <P>In order to facilitate the operation of the marginal relief system, the taxpayer has been granted higher tax-free allowances based on the £6,000 exemption limit.

      <P>The Value-Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 13) Order, 1980, provides for repayment of the value-added tax charged in respect of a new road motor vehicle which has been specially constructed or adapted for the use of a disabled person as driver.  A condition of the relief is that the person must have obtained remission of the motor vehicle licence duty under section 43 of the Finance Act, 1968, in respect of the vehicle. Section 43 stipulates that, to qualify for a remission of motor vehicle licence duty, a disabled driver must be wholly or almost wholly without the use of each of his legs.  In recognition of the fact that this medical criterion is unduly restrictive, provision has now been made in section 92 of the Finance Act, 1989, for a new and broader scheme of tax concessions to disabled persons to replace <Col N="260" /> the existing reliefs.  The detailed regulations under which the new scheme will operate are at present in course of preparation, in consultation with the Ministers for Health and the Environment.</P>

      <P>The position in regard to redundancy payments is that on various dates during April and May 1989, 42 of the employees of the company concerned submitted claims to my Department for payment of redundancy lump sums from the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund. It transpired, however, that the amounts of entitlements of all the employees were in dispute with the company and that appeals had been lodged with the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  Accordingly, payments could not be made by my Department pending the outcome of the appeals before the tribunal.</P>
      <P>I understand that the appeals were heard by the tribunal on 30 May 1989, and that a decision covering all the appeals is expected to be issued this week.  When the tribunal decision becomes available, each employee should complete the appropriate form of application for payment of redundancy lump sum from the fund (Form RP 14) and forward it directly to the redundancy payments section of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department have not received any application for payment of minimum notice entitlements from any employee of the firm concerned.  I understand, however, that these entitlements are also covered in the employees' appeals to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  On the basis of the tribunal decision, any <Col N="268" /> employee found to have an entitlement to a minimum notice award should complete Form IP2 and forward it to the receiver of the company concerned.  The receiver, if he cannot meet the payments due, should in turn apply to the insolvency payments section of my Department for funds to discharge the employees' awards.</P>
    <P>The application forms mentioned will be sent to the employees with notice of the tribunal decision.  My Department will deal with completed applications and issue the payments due with a minimum of delay.</P>

      <P>Alleviation payments were introduced under temporary measures in November 1986 to assist persons who suffered reductions in payment as a consequence of the new dependency arrangements brought into force at that time by the EC Equality Directive.</P>
      <P>These payments were due to expire in mid-November 1987.  However, the Government have decided that they should be phased out gradually in view of the hardship that would be caused to persons involved by the abrupt cessation of these payments.  Payment continued at the full rate until July 1988 and the forthcoming reduction will coincide with the budgetary increase of 3 per cent on basic entitlements.</P>
      <P>In this case, the person concerned is in receipt of an old age contributory pension at the weekly personal rate of £54.10 plus an alleviation payment in respect of his dependent wife of £18.  In line with the budgetary arrangements his personal rate of £54.10 will increase to £55.70 and the £18 payment will be reduced by £2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> There are no other alleviating payments for couples in the circumstances mentioned.

      <P>Under Regulations made in 1988, reduced-rate old age contributory pensions, effective from 14 October 1988, were awarded to persons who had previously failed to qualify for pension due to gaps in their insurance record incurred by the intermittent increases in the insurance limit from 1953 to April 1974, when the insurance limit was abolished. (Contributions paid prior to 1953 may not be used in calculating the yearly average for old age contributory pension purposes).</P>
      <P>The Regulations conferred entitlement to pension to those people who had re-entered insurance on 1 April 1974 provided their total number of contributions averaged between five and 19 per year. Inadvertently, the Regulations also enabled people, such as the person concerned, who had re-entered insurance at a modified rate on 1 April 1974 to qualify for this pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amending Regulations were brought into effect from 2 February 1989 which confined entitlement to this pension to those who had re-entered insurance in April 1974 at the full rate of insurance only.  Claimants who had re-entered insurance in April 1974 at a modified rate and who had submitted their pension applications prior to the effective date of <Col N="273" /> the amending Regulations were awarded pension up to the date those Regulations came into effect.</P>
    <P>In the case of the person concerned, he was awarded pension for the period 14 October 1988 to 2 February 1989 at the weekly rate of £13.10.  Arrears amounting to £218.12 were issued to him in April 1989.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for the old age non-contributory pension on 7 April 1989.  Following investigation into her means by the local social welfare officer, it was decided that she was entitled to this pension at the weekly rate of £22.50.</P>
      <P>The spouse of the person concerned is currently in receipt of an invalidity pension which includes an allowance of £32.40 in respect of his wife.  As the rate of this allowance is higher than the rate of the old age non-contributory pension, it was considered to be of more financial benefit to the person concerned to allow her to remain in receipt of the adult dependant increase on her husband's invalidity pension.  Consequently her claim to the old age non-contributory pension was regarded as being withdrawn and she has been notified accordingly.</P>

      <P>
        <Col N="274" />Retirement or old age contributory pension is awarded to persons who satisfy statutory qualifying conditions, one of which requires that an applicant has a yearly average of 24 reckonable contributions for the retirement pension and 20 for the old age contributory pension.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has a total of 729 reckonable contributions recorded in respect of him by the Department which is equivalent to a yearly average of 19 for both retirement and old age contributory pension purposes.  This is insufficient to entitle him to either pension.  A further 159 reckonable contributions are required for retirement pension purposes and 31 for old age contributory pension purposes which may be gained by resuming reckonable insurable employment.</P>
      <P>Should the person concerned fail to qualify for either of these pensions on reaching the qualifying age, he may then apply for an old age non-contributory pension which is based on a means test.</P>

      <P>According to the records of the Department the person concerned last claimed disability benefit from 14 March 1988 to 19 March 1988.  The information supplied in connection with his claim indicated that he was a married man who was separated from his wife to whom he paid maintenance and that he resided with his common law wife and their four dependent children.</P>
      <P>Payment of disability benefit was authorised from 17 March 1988 fourth day of incapacity at the weekly rate of £108.20, which was the maximum rate payable at that time to a married man with an adult dependant and four child dependants. Article 21 (1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, provides that only one adult dependant allowance is payable to a disability benefit claimant.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that on receipt of an application for a land certificate the application is forwarded to the records section for processing.  That section requisitions the relevant folio from the filing section.  On receipt of the folio the application proceeds as follows.</P>
      <P>Particulars of the application are checked.  If found not to be in order a query is raised with the applicant.  If the application is found to be in order details are entered in a record book.  The land certificate is then associated with a photocopy of the relevant folio and impressed with the official seal.  The particulars of the issue of the certificate are entered in the original folio and the certificate is then checked, signed and issued.  If, however, the folio is unavailable &mdash; as it can be if in use in relation to another, prior, application &mdash; this procedure must await until the folio becomes available.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that an application for a land certificate is handled by four officials in the records section of the registry and that the average time taken to issue a certificate is at present four months where the application is in order and the folio is available.  In cases where queries have to be raised and the folio is unavailable the average delay is at present of the order of six months.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="278" /> As regards the cost to the applicant, the fee for a land certificate is £10 in accordance with the Land Registration Fees Order, 1983.</P>
    <P>The administrative procedures to be followed in the registry are a matter for the statutory discretion of the Registrar of Titles.  I am informed that these procedures are regarded as appropriate. However, I am not satisfied with the time scale involved in the issue of such certificates. The delay involved is due partly to the pressure of work generally and to the shortage of staff in the Land Registry. I have already undertaken a full review of the operations of the registry with a view to improving the service to the public.  As part of this exercise my Department is having discussions with the Department of Finance concerning the urgent provision of additional staff for the Land Registry.</P>

      <P>As the public roads in question would generally be non-national roads, responsibility for their improvement rests with the local authorities concerned. Under existing arrangements, the cost of works on these roads falls to be financed by a combination of local authority resources and State road grants.  The extent to which local authority resources <Col N="279" /> are used for road works is a matter for determination by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>Because of my concern about the condition of non-national public roads, I have made substantial increases in the levels of road grant funding for them since 1987.  The 1989 discretionary road grants allocations notified for regional and county roads to county councils amount to £47.4 million, compared with £33.4 million in 1988 and £23.0 million in 1986.  The £47.4 million is the first instalment of the three year programme of works on regional and county roads which I announced earlier this year.  The programme, covering the period 1989 to 1991, will cost £150 million in discretionary State road grants.</P>
      <P>The 1989 discretionary road grant allocations notified to Cavan County Council and Monaghan County Council for regional and county roads amount to £1.528 million and £1.299 million, respectively.  The development of proposals for expenditure of these grants is primarily a matter for the local authorities concerned.</P>
      <P>As regards other access ways to lakes and rivers, this work is appropriate to the amenity grants scheme.  However, all available funds have already been allocated.</P>

The level of funding that can be provided for future phases of this work will depend on the annual amount of capital available and the competing demands of authorities.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will outline the circumstances whereby his Department requested Dublin County Council to add a main sewer pipe to the Kinsealy-Feltrim scheme across property known as Abbeville to service a group of cottages which already has a perfectly adequate scheme in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts in relation to the Feltrim/Kinsealy sewerage scheme are as follows:</P>
      <P>It has been the policy of Dublin County Council for over ten years to provide modern sewage treatment facilities for clusters of houses throughout their county.  As part of their overall programme, the county council submitted to the Department in 1979 plans for a sewerage scheme to serve houses in the Feltrim/Kinsealy area.  The scope of the scheme was extended by the council in 1981 and the extended scheme was approved by the Department in that year. In October 1985 the council sought approval to borrow over £1 million to finance the scheme.  In view of the restrictions on the overall amount of capital available for sanitary services schemes and the number of other high priority schemes competing for the available capital, it was not possible to commit finance to the scheme at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the scheme came up for consideration during 1987, it was decided to ask the county council to have their proposals re-examined with a view to having the scheme extended to provide for the disposal of sewage from the Baskin cottages and, possibly, other <Col N="283" /> existing houses in the area.  This decision took account of the following facts:</P>
    <P>(a) that capacity was then available in the new Malahide sewage treatment works (to which the Feltrim scheme was to be connected); (b) that the proposed sewage pipelines would pass very close to the outfall from the Baskin cottages scheme; (c) that when the Baskin scheme was being considered in 1974, the technical advice available was that very small dilutions were available in the stream to which the effluent was to discharge; (d) that, at minimum flows, the discharge to the stream would be just tolerable; and (e) that it was the general practice of the county council, where possible, to connect to a main sewer and thereby eliminate small treatment works, communal septic tanks, etc., when the opportunity arises.</P>
    <P>It appeared, therefore, that there would be advantage in connecting the sewage from the Baskin cottages to the new scheme, a view which was subsequently endorsed by the county manager in the light of water pollution considerations and the operational savings which would ensue, The county manager also indicated that the treatment works at the Baskin had its limitations, especially in terms of capacity.</P>
    <P>In May 1988 Dublin County Council sought approval to the original scheme with an extension costing £78,000 to serve the Baskin cottages.  Approval for the complete scheme, then estimated to cost £1.1 million, issued to the county council in June 1988.  This approval was not, however, the end of the matter since it was for the elected members of Dubin County Council to decide (when the matter was brought before them by the manager under section 2 (7) of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955) whether the scheme should go ahead.  I understand that the scheme was, in fact, considered at a meeting of the Fingal Committee (to which the relevant functions of the council have been delegated) on 1 May 1989 and that the committee approved the Manager's proposal that it should go ahead.  Dublin County <Col N="284" /> Council have sought approval to the acceptance of a tender in the amount of £720,786 for the civil works part of the scheme and approval was conveyed to the council on 2 May 1989.</P>

With regard to the instances referred to by the Deputy, the Southern Health Board have confirmed that the private ambulance company was called upon to deal with two calls &mdash; on 5 and 8 July 1989 &mdash; as the board's own ambulances were committed to other calls at the time.  The Cork City Fire Brigade ambulance, which the board normally call upon as back-up in these circumstances, was out of service and consequently the private service was used.</P>

      <P>The average class size in each school is obtained by dividing the number of pupils by the number of class teachers, i.e. excluding walking principals, remedials, etc.  The average class size in these schools in 1988/89 ranged from 30 to 36.8.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As explained previously in this House, the Government decided in July 1987 that proposals for the extension of DART should not be proceeded with, because of the costs of such extension and the state of the public finances.  CIE were accordingly instructed to prepare transport investment plans for the Dublin area involving bus-based options and diesel services on existing rail lines.</P>
      <P>The investment plans which have since been submitted by the chairman of CIE contain a number of proposals designed to improve public transport services for the residents of Tallaght, including feeder bus services from Tallaght to the proposed diesel rail commuter service from Clondalkin to the city, the extension of the Tallaght localink bus services and the inclusion of Tallaght in the proposed new peripheral bus routes.  These proposals have been included in the National Development Plan 1989-1993 submitted to the European Commission for consideration for assistance from EC Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>I am most anxious to secure the provision of better transport facilities for Tallaght and I believe that the implementation of the CIE proposals would bring about significant improvements.  I will, therefore, be pressing vigorously for the necessary financial allocations to ensure that these proposals go ahead as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The range and level of fares offered by an airline on routes <Col N="301" /> between Ireland and the UK are primarily a matter for each airline to determine by reference to its own costs, the demands of the market and the general competitive environment.  All fares are, however, required to be filed with my Department and under the memorandum of understanding between the aeronautical authorities of Ireland and of the United Kingdom, such fares are considered approved, unless they are disapproved by the aeronautical authorities of both countries.  Either side may, however, unilaterally disapprove fares of its own airlines which it considers to be either excessive or anti-competitive. Within these parameters there have been <Col N="302" /> occasions when it has been deemed necessary to disapprove certain fares increases filed by Irish airlines where these were considered to be excessive, having particular regard to the then current inflation levels and the need to promote tourism.</P>
      <P>There is a very extensive network of air services connecting Dublin, Cork and Shannon with numerous points in the UK, operated by both Irish and British airlines, and there is a wide range of alternative fares, with varying conditions, available on each route.  If the Deputy wishes to obtain details concerning fares on any particular route, I will be happy to provide the information.</P>
