    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Order of Business has been presented to the House by the Taoiseach, my understanding is that the University of Limerick Bill, as amended, as set out in the Order of Business seems to suggest that it will go through a clear five Stage process whereas, in the case of No. 4, the Dublin City University Bill, all Stages will be taken together.  There clearly will not be an opportunity for putting down amendments between Second and Committee Stage.  It seems to be suggested that the procedure for dealing with that Bill is affected by the previous one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not as I have suggested, it means that there will be a simple repetition of all amendments on No. 4 which were tabled for No. 3.  This is not a matter for the Whips; it relates to the orderly procedure of the legislation and getting it through in time in a way that will satisfy all Members of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise two matters on the Order of Business and I anticipate that the first may result in some hilarity from Deputies opposite, but we should get clarification of the matter.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach whether it is intended next week to take the Committee Stage of the Planning Bill which has been languishing in this House since last autumn.  The second matter of concern that I should like to raise is the following, in the unlikely event of an election being called today, could the Taoiseach indicate to the House whether he will make time to make a statement to the House as to whether he has sought advice, and if so what that advice is, from the Attorney General as to the likelihood of the results in individual Dáil constituencies being challenged if an election takes place.</P>

Will the Taoiseach give us advance notice of the statement?</P>

      <P>I submitted an amendment which sought the deletion of this section but I understand from the General Office that it has been ruled out of order.  Section 1 rejects what has been described in the Explanatory Memorandum as a defect in section 12 of the 1985 Act.  The section seeks to extend to unmarried couples certain provisions applying to married couples.  The Minister, instead of complying with the decision of the courts in the Hyland case and providing that married couples should be treated equally, is depriving unmarried couples of the right to full unemployment and social assistance.  It seems to me that that represents a dramatic shift from the position as expresed by the Minister when in Opposition. When in Opposition, in October 1986, a leaflet was issued under the signature of <Col N="1209" /> Dr. Michael Woods and circulated in the Dublin North-East area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been considering the Bill and, in particular, this section.  I want to responsibly and strongly raise with the Minister a serious concern I have with regard to this section. I am convinced there is very strong evidence to suggest that this section is unconstitutional.  If one studies the decision of the Supreme Court in the Hyland case I believe the view I am expressing will be borne out.</P>
      <P>The effect of this section will be that the position of married couples and couples of the opposite sex who are living together under one roof will be equalised. However, now we will have the situation where two people of the same sex who are living together, whether in a sexual relationship or otherwise, will be entitled to two separate rates of payment and, consequently, a higher overall total.  If one studies Article 41 of the Constitution and the various cases which have been taken thereunder one will see that there is at least a <i>prima facie</i> case to suggest that the court will find this further discrimination unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the basic point we must focus on is whether we should permit our laws to develop whereby two people of the same sex &mdash; two men living together, <Col N="1212" /> a father and son or two brothers or two friends, having a sexual relationship or otherwise &mdash; can receive a greater income by way of two separate payments as opposed to that received by married couples or unmarried men and women living together.  Is that unconstitutional? I believe there is at least a strong case which can be made to suggest that it is. On that basis, there is a duty on this House to ensure as far as is possible, that the laws we enact comply with the terms of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There are other topical questions at the moment in the context of Bills which have not been enacted but sin ceist eile. However, when there is a Bill before the House and there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that constitutional parameters have been breached the Constitution provides a way to resolve this problem.  This involves a reference by the President to the Supreme Court.  I appreciate that the President acts in that situation after consultation with the Council of State but obviously he takes note of the views which are expressed in this House.  I want to raise with the Minister my concerns that this Bill may not be constitutional.  If it is not constitutional there will be another series of cases before the courts which will involve further expense for the litigants involved and, of course, for the State.  In addition, this will lead to further uncertainty about our social welfare code.  I believe strongly that there should be a recommendation from this House for the Bill to be referred by the President to the Supreme Court for adjudication on its constitutionality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear to the Deputy that in the course of the discussions on this case, which only relates to a very specific area &mdash; the Hyland case, which is cited in relation to this legislation &mdash; the court were dealing with a very specific area.  In the course of the discussions relating to that case the court said that one cannot compare the situation of a man and wife with that of two people who are entirely separate, for example, two single people, because obviously there will be differences.  I <Col N="1213" /> accept that the point Deputy O'Keeffe raised is relevant but it is not one the court feels is unconstitutional.  It is common for the law of other countries to recognise that there is a difference between the situation of a married or cohabiting couple and that of single persons. Nevertheless this is the aspect we want the review group to look at in regard to the question of a household and how we should deal with that question in future.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned earlier, it is possible for somebody to challenge the giving of a fuel allowance or some other allowance to one person in a household.  At present it is accepted practice that only one fuel allowance is given for a household.  For instance, where two single unemployed brothers live together in a household up to this they did not qualify for a fuel allowance but because of a change I recently made in the scheme from October they will be entitled to have one allowance between the two of them, in other words, one allowance per household. Of course they are delighted with that provision.  Nobody is challenging which of them should receive the allowance as long as there is an allowance given to the household.  At some stage somebody could ask: why should one person get the allowance and not the other even though it is in respect of the same household?  In a sense that indicates the type of problem presented <i>vis-à-vis</i> a household.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy need have no concern about the constitutionality of this Bill. This Bill is entirely constitutional and satisfactory. I think what the Deputy is really asking is if there are not other questions which need to be examined as well.  That is why the Government are setting up the review group, particularly to examine the household issue.  The whole objective of the Government in relation to the establishment of this review group is to be progressive, fair and reasonable.  Indeed, the provisions of this Bill are reasonable, responsible <Col N="1214" /> and fair.  We are addressing the immediate anomaly and, at the same time, tackling the wider implications in a calm, considered way, in what must be accepted to be an urgent manner because we are doing so in the context of the next budget, which must be seen to be fair in every sense.  In this way the Oireachtas will be afforded an opportunity to consider the full implications of the outcome of the review and make any necessary provisions for changes in the social welfare code.  Therefore, it will be seen that we are tackling both issues at the same time.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this section are designed to meet the requirements set out and they do so in relation to circumstances which arose <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Supreme Court judgment on section 12 (4) of the 1985 Act.  It effects an adjustment to section 12 (4) and also to section 12 (1).  Section 12 (1) and (4) of the Equal Treatment Act, 1985, provided that married couples would not receive two personal rates of payment where both spouses were entitled to unemployment assistance, and where one was entitled to assistance and the other to a benefit or pension.  Section 12 (1) provided that, where both spouses were entitled to unemployment assistance, the overall amount payable would be limited to what they would receive if one of them only claimed and received an increase for the other as an adult dependant.  The Act provided that each of the spouses would receive half of the amount payable.</P>
    <P>Section 12 (4) dealt with the circumstances in which one spouse was entitled to benefit or pension and the other unemployment assistance.  In those circumstances the overall amount payable to the couple could not exceed that which would be payable if only the spouse entitled to the benefit or pension claimed and received an increase for an adult dependant.  In these circumstances the Act provided that the payment to the spouse entitled to assistance would be reduced in order to remain within the limitation.  The recent Supreme Court judgment concerns section 12 (4) only <Col N="1215" /> but, as section 12 (1) affects the entitlements of married couples in exactly the same way, this subsection also must be regarded as defective.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of this Bill remedies these defects by extending the provisions of section 12 (1) and (4) of the 1985 Act to unmarried couples who are cohabiting as man and wife.  Section 1 (a) deals with the circumstances in which both spouses are entitled to unemployment assistance and section 1 (b) deals with the cirsumstances in which one of them only is entitled to assistance and the other to benefit or pension.  However, the manner in which the limitation is to be applied, where one of them is entitled to a benefit or pension, is being changed.  Under the provisions of the 1985 Act the amount payable to the couple in these circumstances was limited to the married rate of the higher social insurance payment.</P>
    <P>Following on the increases granted in this year's budget, which are to become effective from July next, the long-term rate of unemployment assistance will exceed the basic rate of unemployment and disability benefit.  Section 1 (b) of this Bill, therefore, provides that, in future, a claimant will have the benefit of whichever is the higher rate, either the married rate of benefit or pension or the married rate unemployment assistance.  The limit provided for in section 1 of the Bill will apply only where one or both of the married or cohabiting couple is entitled to unemployment assistance.  It will not apply where each of the couple is entitled to social insurance payment in their own right.  It is important that that be clear &mdash; that where each is entitled to insurance, then of course each will receive their insurance payment in accordance with their PRSI contributions.</P>
    <P>These arrangements apply only to means-tested assistance schemes related to need.  In these circumstances each of a couple will continue to receive the full personal rate of payment.  This reflects the basic objective of the unemployment assistance scheme which is to provide a level of financial support related to the <Col N="1216" /> needs of the household.  It is widely acknowledged that the needs of two persons living together are less than those for two persons living in separate households. This stands to reason as there is a sharing of basic resources/overheads such as accommodation, heating, lighting and other household goods.  The latest household budget survey estimated that expenditure in these areas accounted for almost 80 per cent of all household expenditure for one and two person households.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of research conducted into this issue in other countries which is referred to formally as equivalent scales analysis.  As far back as the Beveridge report in the United Kingdom in 1942 the estimate used for the needs of a couple was 1.6 times the rate for a single person.  More recent research conducted in the United Kingdom and in the United States indicates that an equivalent scale of the order of 1.6 is not unreasonable.  Estimates can be obtained using different approaches, depending on price régimes and consumption patterns in different countries.  That will lead to some minor variations in estimates of adult equivalent scales in the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, research on adult equivalent scales has not been carried out in this country.  However, the ESRI have undertaken work on child equivalent scales.  The principle applied here is the same, that is, that economies of scale apply also to family size although some allowance must be made for the ages of the children involved.  Based on available international data the Commission on Social Welfare recommended that the appropriate rate for a couple was 1.6 times the personal rate.  They accepted the rationale of an equivalent scale, that two persons living together are financially interdependent.</P>
    <P>In relation to unmarried couples, the Commission on Social Welfare stated that where two people, not legally married, are living together effectively as husband and wife and sharing resources, they should be treated in a similar manner to a married couple for social welfare <Col N="1217" /> purposes.  That is what is happening <i>vis-à-vis</i> the provisions of this Bill &mdash; that in fact they will be treated in a similar manner.  For reasons of both equity and efficiency the payment structures of assistance schemes must take account of the effect of the operation of economies of scale in a household.  This is done explicitly in the payment of a personal rate and an adult dependant allowance to a couple.  This approach ensures that the level of assistance payable is related to the needs of the claimants' household. Section 1 of this Bill maintains that principle. It is essential to the equitable distribution of resources and ensures that available resources are directed to those in greatest need.</P>
    <P>I should point out that, when this House decides on amounts to be allocated to couples, it does so in relation to the resources available at the time.  As I pointed out on Second Stage, considerable extra resources have been allocated to families.  There has been strong focus on families in both last year's and this year's budgets.  The effects of that will become operative from July next.  I should stress that the increases announced in the budget will all come into effect.  I see headlines in the press about cuts in respect of married couples and all sorts of people.  The fact of the matter is that there will be increases effective from July next and everybody knows that to be the case.  For example, the rates will be increased for a husband and wife on long-term unemployment assistance to £76 per week; where there are three children the relevant payment will be £107 a week; where there are five children it will be £127 a week and, where there are eight children, the payment will be £157 a week.  That would not have happened heretofore because there is now a standard £10 allowable for each child in a family.  That is why I went so far as to mention families with eight children &mdash; which of course there are &mdash; in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>There will be very considerable increases which will come into operation in July.  The effect of the section which we are dealing with here is that the increases <Col N="1218" /> and levels of payment will be the same for married couples and for couples who are cohabiting.  That is the basic position. In relation to the review I would like to stress that so far as the Government is concerned, it is dealing with the immediate question.  It is dealing with more than was addressed directly by the Supreme Court.  It is dealing with section 12 (1) and (4) of the 1985 Act and it is also tackling for the first time the question of the household.  The review group will be considering the matter between now and the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that the Government's approach to the review is one of being fair, reasonable and equitable because it is a very important review which will provide the basis for the future development of the social welfare code.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I am convinced that before this review is complete the Department will find themselves in the courts many times being tested on this issue.  The constitutionality of this matter leaves a lot of doubt in my mind.  Where there is reasonable doubt of cohabitation, who will get the benefit of the doubt?  This will happen very often.  On Second Stage I asked where it has been established that there is cohabiting, a person can go to the community welfare officer having lost their unemployment assistance.  I think the Minister contradicted this when he said it did not arise at this stage.  A person can go to a community welfare officer for assistance if he or she has lost their unemployment assistance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not lose the unemployment assistance.  They get a different rate, the same as the married person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>But if there is a loss of income people have a right to go to the community welfare officer.  Perhaps the Minister would give a positive response to these two points &mdash; if there is doubt about cohabitation who gets the benefit of the doubt and my second point relates to the community welfare officers who will be very much involved in this whole matter.</P>

      <P>There is very little I can say.  The Deputy is not talking about somebody losing their payment, but about the payment being the same as for a married couple.  The Deputy is suggesting that in future when someone comes to make a claim the amount they would get would be the same as a married couple. Presumably, the Deputy thinks they should get two single rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Cohabitation is a feature not only for our social welfare code but of social welfare codes generally.  We discussed this matter, to some extent, on Second Stage and I mentioned the other cases where cohabitation is involved.  In Ireland the number of cases in a year would be very few.  This is not something which is as widespread as people appear to suggest.  What happens in effect is that if people are cohabiting &mdash; the Deputy is suggesting that there might be a reasonable doubt about this &mdash; the Department would have to be satisfied that they were cohabiting.  The basis for being satisifed is tied into certain circumstances.  Obviously, co-residence is the first indication. Then there is the question of sharing finances or the family issuing.  These are questions which show clearcut cohabitation. The Department have to be satisfied that there is cohabitation.  Where there is any doubt these questions would not arise.  The Department have to be able to stand over the decision made on <Col N="1220" /> cohabitation.  They have to live within the law in that sense.</P>
      <P>I went through the different criteria &mdash; yesterday the Deputy quoted criteria used in Britain &mdash; which show that a couple are living together as man and wife.  These are reasonably tangible criteria but, in any event, what would happen is that when people are making a claim for unemployment assistance, just as at present one has to declare whether one is a married person or not, one would have to declare whether one is cohabiting.  At that stage the vast majority of cases would be claiming on that basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, the Minister has not dealt with the point I raised in regard to discrimination.  It seems clear that the Minister is discriminating in favour of single sex relationships.  I want to ask the Minister directly about this.  What is the position of two homosexual men cohabiting, living together under one roof as opposed to a husband and wife and as opposed to an unmarried man and woman in similar circumstances?  As I see it, the household of the homosexual pair &mdash; both drawing social welfare benefit &mdash; will be getting £14 a week more than either the married couple or the unmarried man and woman.  Surely this is introducing further discrimination into our social welfare code.  It will be a matter of Fianna Fáil Government policy as to whether the Minister wants to discriminate against men and women, by they married or otherwise, as opposed to homosexuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister can justify Government policy if he feels so inclined.  However, the constitutional aspect of the issue is more important.  Again, with respect to the Minister, it is all very well for him <Col N="1221" /> to talk about such laws and regulations being common in other countries, but other countries do not have a Constitution such as we have.  Article 41 of our Constitution prescribes the constitutional parameters within which we must operate.  It seems clear that this obvious and blatant discrimination will arise as a consequence of passing this legislation.  Two men in a homosexual relationship or, indeed, two women in a lesbian relationship, who are cohabiting will receive £14 a week more than a married couple or an unmarried man and woman who are cohabiting.  The Minister has not answered this point and it is on that basis that there is a duty on this House to tease it out and to make a recommendation that this Bill be referred to the Supreme Court.  The Minister has given no answer on this point so I think he accepts by default that this Bill is unconstitutional.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised the question of other categories in the social welfare code.  The Supreme Court in its decision has recognised the position of cohabiting couples.  It has put its stamp on the cohabiting couple so let no one suggest to me that they do not exist so far as the law is concerned.  The situation exists, but was not dealt with in the 1985 Act.  It is being dealt with in this legislation and there will be equal treatment for couples in both of those cases.</P>
      <P>As I have said, the Government are providing a review of other implications in relation to single people, whatever their status, in the same household.  We have asked the review group to examine the concept of household generally and to advise us on equivalence rates that should apply in the further development of the social welfare code.  We know, for example, that social assistance &mdash; we are talking about social assistance and we want to relate it to need &mdash; in the United Kingdom, Germany and Belgium is paid on a household basis.  The review group will examine the question of households and the designation of the head of households and how the system should deal with this question in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said to the Deputy at an earlier stage, I recognise that there are other questions to be looked at but these other couplings that the Deputy has referred to are not recognised by the law at present. We are dealing with the situation as it exists and we will further examine the question of single people living in the same household.  At present people sharing flats or whatever have to make special arrangements in relation to supplementary welfare.  We have to examine the future guidelines for supplementary welfare where a number of single people are living together and claiming supplementary welfare.  This question has not been analysed or examined in detail. The Commission on Social Welfare set out certain criteria: the criterion of need, the 1.6 rate for couples, and other criteria. However, the review group will go <Col N="1223" /> beyond that and will make an indepth analysis of social welfare.  They will examine the whole question of households and the concept of the household in the future development of the social welfare code.  It is intended that the review group will carry out a progressive examination which would lead to progressive developments in the social welfare code.  It is envisaged that they would tackle the problems the Deputies have foreseen to the extent that they are relevant.</P>

      <P>I do not know what I am allowed to say at this point after my previous abortive attempt &mdash; though I do not know whether abortive is a constitutional word, given the referendum we had some years ago.</P>
      <P>May I ask the Minister to clarify whether he believes the current Bill contravenes the European Directive from which the 1985 Act arose.  With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I would like to quote from the <i>Official Journal of the European Communities</i> the Council Directive of 19 December 1978 on the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women on matters of social security. Article 4 states:</P>
      <P>1.  The principle of equal treatment means that there should be no discrimination whatsoever on ground of sex either directly, or indirectly by reference in particular to marital or family status, in particular as concerns:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the scope of the schemes....</P>
      <P>&mdash;the obligation to contribute....</P>
      <P>&mdash;the calculation of benefits etc....</P>
      <P>2.  The principle of equal treatment shall be without prejudice to the provisions relating to the protection of women on the grounds of maternity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take into account that the vast <Col N="1224" /> majority of adult dependants in marriage are women and in the case of unmarried couples cohabiting, the vast majority of adult dependants would be women, the procedure that the Minister is proposing to adopt is simply aggravating the discrimination which existed in the 1985 Act &mdash; which provides for a lesser amount of money for a woman in a marriage.  This is now being applied to unmarried cohabiting couples.  I would draw the Minister's attention to the debate on the 1985 Bill, column 291 of the Official Report for 3 July 1985 where, in response to questions that I raised with the then Minister, Deputy Desmond he replied as follows:</P>
    <P>We have consulted our legal advisers on the issue and the restriction on the amount payable to a married couple <i>vis-à-vis</i> an unmarried couple is not discriminatory in terms of the directive because marital status is not being used as a means of discriminating indirectly on the basis of sex.  A lot of work has been done in this area both at interdepartmental level and in consultation with successive Attorneys General.</P>
    <P>Am I not correct in saying that the Supreme Court in the Hyland case has found that statement to be incorrect and that this is the reason the 1985 Act had had to be amended?  Unfortunately the Minister is amending the Act in such a way as to extend the discrimination against married couples to unmarried couples.  This is in direct contravention of the Council Directive on equality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supreme Court found the 1985 Act defective by reference to our Constitution and not by reference to any EC directive.  We have to deal with both matters.</P>

      <P>I would like to clarify that point.  I accept what the Supreme Court has found in relation to the Constitution but surely as a member of the EC we accept the rulings of the European Court as well.  They have said that no domestic law may be enacted which contravenes European law and <Col N="1225" /> that directives made by the European Council are accepted by us as legally binding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic point the Deputy is raising is that in the case of dependency it is an adult dependant who is in question and therefore whether it is a male or a female dependant, equitable treatment is given.  I think what the Deputy is saying is that in practice there would tend to be more female than male dependants and therefore it could be seen that the dependency clause applies more to women than it does to men but that is not an argument for equal treatment.  The fact of the matter is that the treatment is equal.  As the Deputy knows, there is a trend for more male dependants and dependent spouses being male.  That is the basic point &mdash; it is the dependency the clause is based on and as long as the word &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; applies equally to men and women, which it does, there is equal treatment in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all satisfied with the Minister's reply to my question.  This is going to be a very important matter from now on because there will always be some doubt.  I asked the Minister in the event of there being reasonable doubt, who gets the benefit of the doubt. In any court of law the accused will always get the benefit of the doubt but the Minister did not tell me the answer to my question.  I know that in every case that will be brought before the welfare officer there will be some doubt and something positive should be established in that regard.  Where there is doubt it is either the unfortunate person who gets the benefit of it or the Department.  This will have to be clarified because I am not at all satisfied with the reply the Minister gave.  I think he is being evasive on this matter.  The question of the benefit of the doubt is very important because in all cases there will be doubt about cohabitation and I want to know who will get the benefit of the doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Deputy Wyse is quite an important one. <Col N="1226" /> The difficulty arises in finding a definition of cohabitation, finding any reference in the Statute Book to it, more importantly, finding within the Department written guidelines on it and ultimately how it will be worked on the ground.  The problem is that it is quite unclear as to what constitutes cohabitation.  As Deputy Wyse pointed out, it is also very unclear as to what evidence will be required to prove cohabitation.  Finally there is the question of who gets the benefit of the doubt in the event of there being reasonable doubt.</P>
      <P>If we take the world &ldquo;cohabitation&rdquo;, its Latin root is probably the world &ldquo;habitaire&rdquo; which, according to the Oxford Dictionary, is to dwell frequently.  How can we enforce legislation under which social welfare officers are to be expected to come to reasonable and fair decisions as whether people are dwelling frequently or not?  For example, somebody might perhaps be in a household for two days a week.  Is that dwelling frequently or not?  A person might be missing for months, might be back in the house for weeks and then be missing for months again.  Is that cohabitation?  By merely referring to cohabiting as man and wife is not sufficient because a man and wife may have arrangements whereby they are not living together all the time either &mdash; for example, my own position whereby I am living in Dublin for the middle of nearly every week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no clear view as to exactly what constitutes cohabitation.  There is no statutory definition and there are no written guidelines.  In that regard, Deputy Wyse is very much on the button. Where there is doubt, who gets the benefit of it?  On whom lies the onus of proof? Is it a matter for the applicants to prove that they are not cohabiting or is it a matter for the official to prove that they are?  That is the kind of legal morass we are descending into as a result of the fact that there is neither a statutory definition nor a clear departmental guideline.  It is clear we are not going to get a statutory definition at this stage and it may be some time before there are clear departmental guidelines.  The very minimum we should <Col N="1227" /> get is a clear and unequivocal undertaking from the Minister that in the implementation of this section the benefit of the doubt will be given to the applicant and, furthermore, that the onus of proof as to cohabitation or lack of it will lie with the Department rather than with the applicant.  I could envisage, on the latter point, applicants experiencing extreme difficulty in having to produce the kind of proof that might be required by Department officials.  We all know the difficulties people face in establishing that they are genuinely available for work. They have to traipse around the country to produce letters in their efforts to find work and so on.  What sort of letters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa has given a helpful suggestion.  What sort of letters will these people be required to produce to prove cohabitation or otherwise? I think the Minister has a duty to the House to clarify the question of proof and in particular to clarify the point raised by Deputy Wyse in regard to the benefit of the doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The claim form is the basic document.  Perhaps Deputies will be surprised to discover that most people are honest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on the claim form that that matter will be set out.  In relation to the question of there being an allegation or a suspicion of cohabiting, a social welfare officer has to establish the position to his or her own satisfaction.  They have to satisfy themselves that there is a case of cohabitation.  The Department's policy is always to give the benefit of the doubt to the client.  The officer, in the first instance, has to establish to his or her own satisfaction that there is a case of cohabitation.  The officer makes a report <Col N="1228" /> then to a deciding officer.  The social welfare officer is only preparing the report to satisfy himself or herself that there is a case in the view of the social welfare officer.  The report is given to the deciding officer who has to make a decision.  If there is disagreement about that decision the appeals process comes into operation, and an appeals process follows.  This is all part of the Department's operation of the social welfare code at present, and it is a normal part of the operation of social welfare codes in other countries.</P>
      <P>The Foley case was taken on cohabitation. A widow was found to be cohabiting and a case was taken to the High Court.  Giving the judgment on that case, the judge said there was no difficulty in understanding the expression &ldquo;cohabiting as man and wife&rdquo; as meaning living together as though a married couple when not married.  The evidence presented in the case would indicate the applicant and the man concerned shared the same house and household amenities and lived in such a way as to be reasonably similar to a married couple.</P>
      <P>The meaning of section 92 (3) of the Social Welfare Act, 1981, which disqualifies a woman from receipt of the widow's contributory pension when she and any other person are cohabiting as man and wife is clear and unambiguous. It is not the function of the court to inquire into the purpose of or the motives for the cohabitation condition.  The appeals officer had sufficient evidence to support the decision he made.  That case went right through the courts, and that is the judgment.  The system is easily politically derided and people can turn a phrase for it very easily, but the Department of Social Welfare on behalf of the Oireachtas have to implement the legislation, and this is part of legislation which is a very normal part of the operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under all our other schemes, only between 20 and 25 cases per year are disallowed at present.  There may be other cases where there is an indication or evidence to suggest there may be cohabitation, but unless the departmental officers can be satisfied that that <Col N="1229" /> is the case, no action is taken.  The suggestions in the papers and elsewhere and going out from this House and from Deputies outside the House are very wide of the practical, real situation and they do a disservice to the House.</P>
    <P>The Bill is intended to achieve two objectives.  The first is to remove the defect contained in the 1985 Equal Treatment Act which has been identified by the Supreme Court.  The second is to deal with the major budgetary implications of the Supreme Court judgment.  As I pointed out, there are widespread financial repercussions which are important in a budgetary context, and we want to have the review group look at them to see in what way the code should develop.  We are very conscious of the wider implications of the Supreme Court judgment and for this reason we set up an expert review group to examine these implications.</P>
    <P>The function of the group will be to examine the social welfare code as a whole in so far as it affects households in relation to the payment of assistance. This will require an examination of needs based assistance schemes as they apply to different households, having particular regard to the provisions of the EC Directive on equal treatment, the assessment of means for social welfare assistance schemes as they apply in different household situations and the limitations on payments as reflecting the needs of different types of household.  In the light of this examination of the current arrangements, the review group will have to consider the changes required in the present system so as to reflect changing household patterns and patterns of dependency.</P>
    <P>I have already advised the chairman of the group, Mr. John Curry, that it is necessary that the review be completed within six months to enable the Government to consider whatever changes are required in the context of next year's budget.  This review affords us the ideal opportunity to reform the entire structure of social welfare payments so as to bring about greater consistency in the treatment of households with similar <Col N="1230" /> needs.  While I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the review, I suspect it may be necessary for us to follow the trends in other countries and return in some shape or form to the head of household concept which existed prior to 1985, but it would have to be a head of household concept with equal treatment.  In some countries that is applied by offering people the opportunity to opt for whoever is to be the head of the household. Regardless of the outcome of the review. I have no doubt it will lead to a radical reform of the existing social welfare structure.  I look forward to that review. Again I stress that in this whole matter the Government want to be fair, reasonable and progressive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I am becoming more and more doubtful of getting a reply to the question I asked.  The Minister mentioned the review about six times this morning.  We all welcome the review. There is no point repeating that.  The Minister said the deciding officer, after getting the information from the social welfare officer, will say there is reasonable doubt.  The words &ldquo;reasonable doubt&rdquo; apply to the deciding officer.  Let the Minister keep that in mind.  That is the basis of this whole Bill.  I want to ensure no injustice is done to anybody. The departmental official comes to the people concerned saying he has heard there is cohabitation there.  The person may say the other person involved is a cousin or a boyfriend or something like that and there is no cohabitation.  Then the official says there is reasonable doubt and he fills in his report for the deciding officer.  Let me emphasise this because the Minister mentioned it; the report to the deciding officer says that there is reasonable doubt in this case.  To whom does the deciding offier give the benefit of reasonable doubt, to the official or to the applicant?  This is very important because this whole Bill will be based on doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not interested in the number of cases which will be affected.  If there is an infringement of the constitutional rights of even one person, we have a duty <Col N="1231" /> to defend that person.  We are talking about the fundamental rights of people who are accused of certain things but where doubt exists.  If the deciding officer has reasonable doubt, to whom does he give the benefit?  I must get this reply otherwise I will have to vote against this provision.</P>

      <P>I have spelled it out very clearly.  There is reasonable doubt in quite a large number of cases and these cases are not pursued.  That is the reality. I told the Deputy what the Department's policy is and that only between 20 and 25 cases per year are disallowed.  The courts have said that the system is reasonable and operated in a fair way.  Beyond that all I can say is that a report is prepared by a social welfare officer, a deciding officer makes a decision but if there is any doubt there will be no decision.</P>

      <P>I am seeking clarity on a few points.  The Minister talks about the benefit of the doubt.  Is it the claimant who has to establish for the welfare officer that a doubt exists?  Presumably an investigation will take place only where the social welfare officer, or the deciding officer on the report of the social welfare officer, has reason to believe that cohabitation is taking place.  How does the claimant establish doubt in the mind of the social welfare officer or the deciding officer?  Can the Minister give an assurance that the question of a sexual relationship does not arise in the review of a claimant's case?  Can we have an assurance that the social welfare officers or deciding officers will not have to seek access to bedrooms etc?  Can we be assured that the question of cohabitation is simply a question of two people living <Col N="1232" /> together in the same residence, that it is only a matter of co-residence, the sharing of expenses, etc?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa made reference to a number of points I had intended to raise.  I said during the Second Stage debate that this section is based on legislation operating in the UK. The principle is drawn from that legislation, as I checked last night.  It is time we started to enact legislation without depending on the British Department of Health and Social Security.  If a proper investigation has been done, it would have been clearly established that the legislation is not working in the UK.  I was there last weekend and discussed this whole question.  Many Irish people in the UK are being caught up in this.  Young emigrants, and some not so young, paying £70 or £80 rent for one room have been forced to share their rooms with partners, male or female.</P>
      <P>If two males decide to live together in one room and to sleep in the one bed, will they be deemed to be cohabiting?  I am not saying there would be a very substantial number of people in that category. I repeat the question.  If two single men live together in one room and sleep in the one bed are they deemed to be cohabiting if they are keeping company with each other?  This is the kind of question which could be raised in the courts. I am not suggesting that we should encourage it.  Those of us who have to run daily and weekly clinics will have to know the answer to this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation in the UK is rightly referred to as the snooper's charter. People virtually have the right of entry to see what is happening in a person's bedroom.  Are we providing that a social welfare officer has the right to enter a house without a search warrant, which would be required even by the Special Branch, and demand to see the domestic circumstances of two people he believes are cohabiting?  Many complaints in this regard are made in a mischievous way against neighbours.  They contact the local labour exchange and say that a certain person is sleeping with somebody's <Col N="1233" /> else wife.  All sorts of problems can be created for people who are residing in the one house but not necessarily sleeping in the one bed.  Is the Minister giving in this legislation, or by ministerial order under this Bill, the right to a social welfare officer to walk in the door and inspect all activity day or night?  Will this happen only from 9 o'clock in the morning to 5 o'clock in the afternoon or will the social welfare officer have the right to call at 11 p.m. to see if the two are sleeping together?  Can he get them out of bed at 4 a.m. to see if they are cohabiting?  How will he establish during the day that people are cohabiting?</P>
    <P>This is another instance in the social welfare code where a person may be deemed guilty until proved innocent.  A person may be told that his or her benefit has been cut because he or she has been deemed to be cohabiting.  That means that the person is convicted there and then and gets a reduced amount of money or no money at all.  Then she has to prove herself innocent.  This is happening throughout the social welfare code and is another aspect that will be challenged in the High Court or the Supreme Court. This assembly of Dáil Éireann will have egg on its face if this obnoxious legislation is put on the Statute Books.</P>
    <P>I apologise for being a few minutes late; my car broke down.  I would ask the Minister to inform the House what the appeals procedure is to be.  Normally a person whose benefit is reduced or who is refused benefit can fill in an application for appeal which is sent to the local employment exchange manager and six or eight weeks later the appeal is heard. How is the appeal now going to be conducted? For example, what witness can the person who is accused bring?  If it is a disability benefit appeal he can bring in a specialist in whatever field he wishes, provided he can pay him the £135 for attending, of which the Department pays him £35.  Leaving that aside, in this situation what kind of witness can the person have?  Can she bring a private detective to swear on oath that she is not cohabiting with another person, that <Col N="1234" /> they are not sleeping together, that they are not having a sexual relationship, that they do not have any family?  Does the person have to bring in a gynaecologist to give evidence as to the sexual activity of the parties and what condition the woman is in?  These are the types of questions that have to be answered.  How otherwise are people whose benefit is being withdrawn on a flimsy complaint from someone to the local exchange or to the Department by telephone call or by anonymous letter, to defend themselves? How are they to prove that they are not cohabiting?  There is no definition anywhere in this Bill of what constitutes cohabiting.  There is no definition of the term in the Minister's opening speech or in any social welfare Bill that I am aware of.  I would like the Minister to state if there is such a definition, and if so to spell it out here and put it on the record of the House.</P>

I would emphasise that in all systems which involve cohabitation there are only between 20 and 25 cases a year disallowed at present.  I know that any case that is disallowed gets a lot of publicity so that it sounds as if the problem is widespread.</P>

    <P>The judgment in the Foley case related to the Department's operation on cohabitation. In the judgment the judge said he had no difficulty in understanding the expression &ldquo;cohabiting as man and wife&rdquo; as meaning living together as though a married couple when not married; that the evidence presented in the case would indicate the applicant and the man concerned shared the same house and household amenities and lived in such a way as to be reasonably similar to that of a married couple; that the meaning of section 92 (3) of the Social Welfare Act 1981 which disqualifies a woman from receipt of a widow's contributory pension when she and any other person are cohabiting as man and wife was clear and unambiguous; that it was not the function <Col N="1236" /> of the court to inquire into the purpose of or motives for the cohabitation condition. The appeals officer had sufficient evidence to support the decision he made.</P>
    <P>In relation to the future development, I stressed earlier that the Government want to be fair, reasonable and progressive in this.  That is why we have asked the review group to look particularly at the whole household situation, at the question of head of household and the direction we should go in the future, to do that urgently to have it for the end of this year so it can be taken into account in the budgetary arrangements and the associated social welfare Bill next year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy raised the question of access.  Access is normally provided to the house.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the elements that is internationally accepted.  There is also the financial situation, whether there is a sharing of finances and of residence is obviously a factor.  In relation to the questions about a sexual relationship, obviously if there are children it is clear that there is a sexual relationship. However, it is only one element.</P>

      <P>In the case of two brothers whose parents have died and who are living in the same house, both <Col N="1237" /> on unemployment assistance, and both sharing the expenses of the household, to all intents and purposes they could qualify as cohabiting except for the fact that there is no sexual relationship there. When we strip away all of the layers of language from this issue what we are talking about is the social welfare officer's belief that a sexual relationship exists between the man and woman.  In that case how does a couple prove otherwise?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but we have to consider how to develop in future.  I tried to show in the preamble that there is a difference between the two cases and that when a man and woman are living together as husband and wife there are shared things which lead to these equivalent scales which are agreed.  These things are not quite the same for single people in a similar situation.  Some aspects are obviously similar.  For instance, a fuel allowance to either a married couple or two single people should be the same, as it would be required to heat one house in both cases.  Up to this year where two brothers, for instance, were on unemployment assistance, one excluded the other and there was no fuel allowance.  From autumn, one of the two brothers will get an allowance to heat the house.  Those are the kinds of problems that need to be addressed.  One of the two brothers could say he had fallen out with the other and dispute the fact that the other brother was getting the allowance. We have to have a means of dealing with that.  One solution would be to ensure that one of them was listed as the head of the household and he would get the fuel allowance or other extra supplements related to the household needs.</P>

      <P>This is a very technical Bill and someone with a legal mind should really be sitting in here discussing it.  In my contribution on Second Stage I mentioned having a criteria relating to cohabitation. In any court of law if a person was accused of cohabitation for instance, a judge would have to follow some sort of criterion set down by the Minister.  The criterion in Britain and in other European countries is that there must be a common household, There must be stability in the relationship, financial support, a sexual relationship, children, and a public acknowledgement of the relationship.  So far, this Bill does not give any criteria or direction to either the Department or to the courts.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Minister is putting this question to the review committee for a definition but in the meantime decisions will be taken by social welfare officers.  The review committee could take three months, six months or a year before defining cohabitation.  What will happen in the meantime where social welfare officers can decide what is going to happen without guidelines by which to work?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to sharing expenses it has been assumed in legislation that a married couple share expenses.  The Supreme Court decision is that both people should be treated equally, so we are forced to treat married couples and cohabiting couples equally. The Supreme Court in its decision recognised the cohabiting couple just as the married couple have been recognised all along.  We are now treating the cohabiting couple in the same way as we are treating married couples, but we are recognising also that the expenses of the household should be taken into account. That is why we want the review group to <Col N="1239" /> look at the wider aspects of the household, for the future.  The review could be quite radical in relation to the development of our social welfare code.  All the other arrangements already in place stay as they are pending the outcome of the review group.  Then we will look at the various repercussions which will occur throughout the social welfare code from the Supreme Court decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment <Col N="1243" /> briefly on this section.  Any claims for unemployment assistance made after the date of the Supreme Court judgment will be payable in accordance with the provisions of the amended section 12. However, unmarried couples cohabiting as man and wife to whom the limitation is now to be applied may already have been paid at the higher rate and section 3 provides that any amounts properly paid before the passing of this Bill which, by virtue of the provisions of section 2 would be recoverable, shall not be recoverable. In other words, the section provides that the terms of the Bill will apply to claims from this time onwards and there will be no question of trying to recover money.</P>

      <P>Apart from section 4, this is the only other section in the Bill which I will not be opposing for the very good reason that it is the only attempt by the Minister and the Government to avoid creating hardship for people affected by the 1985 equality legislation. There is no doubt that the application of the other sections of the Bill will create hardship.  There is no doubt also that in many respects the sections of the Bill generally do not comply with the decision in the Hyland case.  I am seriously concerned that the Bill is in breach of the equality directive which was the basis for the 1985 Act in the first place.  I am not opposing this section but I will be opposing the Bill in total.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this section finds favour with all members of the Opposition but I suggest to the Minister that he should consider one further aspect which needs to be looked at in the context of hardship that may result from this Bill, that is, transitional payments or some kind of bridging finance through the supplementary welfare system which should be made available to unmarried couples who will be affected by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that those who will have their payments reduced as a consequence of this Bill will find their standard of living thereby affected and will have great difficulty in adjusting to a reduced standard <Col N="1244" /> of living.  Unfortunately, we are flying blind on this issue to some degree and we have no idea at all as to the numbers involved.  The Minister has been unable to give us any indication as to how many people will be involved but we can be sure, whether it is ten, 100 or 1,000, that some will be affected.  The consequence of this Bill is that those people will suffer a drop in their standard of living and they will have considerable difficulty in adjusting to that.  The minimum the Minister should be prepared to do is to make provision through the supplementary welfare system to ease that adjustment. I believe that could be easily done and I should like an assurance from the Minister that steps will be taken to ensure it is done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome section 3.  At the outset of my contribution on Second Stage I said that it was of vital importance for the Minister and his officials to carefully monitor the Bill to ensure that no hardship would be inflicted on people.  It is a new Bill, there are a lot of technical provisions in it and, therefore, it is important for everybody concerned to ensure that it is carefully monitored and no hardship is inflicted on anybody.  I agreed with Deputy O'Keeffe that some social assistance should be available in cases of hardship, and this is why I welcome section 3.  I believe the section will be welcomed by all Deputies in the House. However, I want to emphasise that it is a very technical section.  The constitutionality of the Bill is another day's work but I ask the Minister to ensure that every defect found in the Bill will be rectified so that the review body will have a proper basis on which to base their findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put it on the record that my party will not be opposing this section.  However, in saying that I do not want it to go abroad that we are in any way in favour of this Bill.  Quite frankly, section 3 is the same as cutting a person's throat and then giving him a bandage. Essentially all the Government are saying in this section is &ldquo;we will reduce your <Col N="1245" /> benefit but it will not be reduced retrospectively&rdquo;. The fact that section 3 is included in the Bill makes the point very clearly that there is hardship involved. This section has been included to avoid the Department having to penalise people, sums of £11 and £14 have been mentioned.  The fact that this will not be done retrospectively means nothing because this obnoxious Bill will continue in force only until such time as there is amending legislation to nullify it.  We will not be opposing this section.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister gets in on this Stage I want to express, as I did on Second Stage, the abhorrence my party feel at what the Fianna Fáil Government are doing in relation to the equality legislation which was introduced in 1985 &mdash; and let it be said, introduced defectively.  I argued very strongly at that time with Ministers &mdash; this is in the context of the section the Minister is now amending, that section 12 would create a situation where married couples would be treated less favourably as a result of the 1985 Act than couples who were living together and unmarried.  At that time the Minister for Social Welfare said he was satisfied that everything was in order, was legal and in accordance with <Col N="1246" /> the EC Directive.  Clearly the Irish courts have now said that it is not legal.</P>
      <P>Instead of giving married couples their rights, as was clearly the intention of the court, the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Government have turned round and deprived unmarried couples of what they had already been in receipt.  That is not a fair or just way to deal with people on social welfare.  We must remember that we are not dealing with people with large incomes or people who have a lot of money or disposable assets they can realise in order to survive.  By and large, we are talking about people in receipt of the lowest income generally available to people in this State.</P>
      <P>Therefore, for the Minister to argue that there will be increases effective in July next and that families will benefit therefrom is not a sufficient argument because all families on social welfare, not merely those on unemployment assistance, will benefit from those increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words which relate more to Report Stage.  The approach adopted in this Bill is the only responsible and reasonable one that could be adopted in present circumstances. We will treat married and cohabitating couples equally by paying unemployment assistance to them on the basis which reflects their factual position and which treats households with similar needs in a similar manner.  We are arranging for a review of all circumstances in which people share a common household so that we can devise a system fair to all applicants.  We are dealing immediately with the need for equal treatment of married and cohabitating households.  At the same time we are providing that nobody who received the higher payment prior to the Supreme Court decision, will be under any obligation to repay such amounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall the Bill constitutes a reasonable approach.  I believe that the Government are being fair, equitable, reasonable and responsible in so providing. Henceforth cohabiting couples <Col N="1247" /> will be treated in the same way as married couples and will not have an advantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> social assistance schemes.  At the same time, we will be urgently looking at the development of the overall social welfare code.</P>
    <P>I thank those Deputies who have supported the passage of the Bill through the House.</P>

      <P>I will not speak much longer on the matter.  In my view this Bill constitutes a very narrow interpretation of the equality directive passed by the EC back in December 1978 and is simply being applied in a very niggardly way.  That approach is not confined to the present Government; it was adopted by the previous Government also.  What precisely this and previous Governments have done in regard to fulfilling their obligations under this directive needs to be addressed.  If, as seems likely, this Bill will be passed, then I have already made it clear that we, as a party, will lodge a complaint with the European Commission with regard to that action, contending that we are not satisfied that the equality Directive is being fully or properly implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might make a couple of further points.  I am not satisfied that the Minister has explained fully or assured us that the question of a sexual relationship between couples is the final determinant on which a social welfare officer will make a decision.  I have drawn the analogy between two brothers living in the one house, sharing the accommodation, household expenses and so on, who will receive the full unemployment assistance to which they are entitled whereas a man and woman, married or unmarried, in the same circumstances will not receive it.  In the later case, the assumption will be that cohabitation is taking place, that there is a sexual relationship involved.  In those circumstances a couple will have to prove that that is not the case.  Clearly they cannot prove that co-residence or sharing of expenditure and so on is not taking place.  Therefore, the only redress left to them will be to disprove cohabitation, to <Col N="1248" /> disprove that there is a sexual relationship involved.  I am not satisfied that the Minister has given me the assurance I requested, which is that people's private lives will not be pried into unduly as a result of the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, this Bill constitutes an entirely unsatisfactory way of dealing with the problem left by the Coalition Government.  In relation to the 1985 Act the Minister could have approached the issue in a generous manner &mdash; when I say the Minister I am referring in reality to the Government &mdash; and given married couples what the court found they were entitled to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I might make a final plea to the Minister on the point I raised in regard to the constitutionality of this Bill.  It is now clear that a homosexual couple, cohabating, will received £14 per week more than a man and wife or man and woman living together in a common law relationship.  Surely that constitutes obvious discrimination?  It seems so blatant that there is at least a <i>prima facie</i> case that it contravenes Article 41 of the Constitution dealing with the rights of the family.</P>
      <P>There is a duty on all of us in this House to ensure, as far as possible, that legislation passed complies with the Constitution. I view with alarm emerging evidence that this Government are prepared to treat the Constitution with contempt. After all, the Constitution is our last line of defence between a dictatorship and democracy.  I believe that all elected representatives have a duty to comply with the provisions of the Constitution, both as to its letter and spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not indicated whether the point I raised has been discussed with his legal advisers, whether their opinion has been sought and, if so, what is their opinion; in itself that may tell a tale.  In these circumstances, the proper course for this House is to recommend that this Bill be referred to the Supreme Court for a decision as to its constitutionality. There is a provision in the Constitution itself for such a course to be adopted by the President on the advice of the Council <Col N="1249" /> of State.  I have no doubt that the fact that this House would make such a recommendation would at least carry considerable weight with the President in considering whether such action should be taken.</P>
    <P>I make a final plea to the Minister to follow that course of action so that we can all be clear in our minds that we are operating within constitutional parameters and, more importantly, that circumstances will not evolve &mdash; which I clearly envisage &mdash; that litigation will be dragged through the courts for months and years on end following the passage of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>In the final hours of this 25th Dáil this Bill reminds me somewhat of the rod licence legislation having been rammed through at the eleventh hour. Everybody is now aware of the problems created by that legislation which remains with the party that put it through.  I have no doubt at all that we have not heard the last of this Bill which has been dealt with in the same manner as the rod licence issue.</P>
      <P>I join my colleague in Fine Gael, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, in suggesting that this Bill &mdash; I say this as a layman but somebody with some knowledge of social welfare matters &mdash; appears to be riddled with possible illegalities.  I suggest publicly that anyone who is affected by this case should consider putting their case to the courts.  I have no doubt &mdash; whatever Government are in power &mdash; that it will be overturned either by our own domestic courts or by the European Court.  I suggest that Deputy O'Keeffe and indeed my colleague had a glorious opportunity this morning, in the dying hours of this 25th Dáil to join with the Labour Party and The Workers' Party in defeating the Bill.  That would have taken care of all the problems to which Deputy O'Keeffe referred when recommending a course of action to the President or the Council of State.  We do not have to do that.</P>

      <P>Up to 1.30 p.m. today we on the Opposition benches have the right to put this Bill away by a vote.  That is the way to deal with it, and that is how we are trying to deal with it but, unfortunately, we are not getting the necessary support.  However, everyone must make up his own mind.  It must be recorded that the Government are changing the law to reduce social welfare payments to unemployed couples, living as man and wife, by £14 per week.  That is the factual position.  Nothing that can be said by the Minister, or anybody else, will change that.  That will be the situation so long as this Bill is on the Statute Book.  If we have the opportunity in the 26th Dáil I want to place on record and give a public pledge that the Labour Party will commit themselves to repeal this innocuous piece of legislation which should never have come before the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Final Stage of the Bill I should like to say that section 1 is the most important part of the Bill.  I placed much emphasis on the words &ldquo;reasonable doubt&rdquo; and I think the Minister has clarified the position.  It is of vital importance that there are no dragging of feet in bringing the report of the review group to fruition.  This can be done without delay because the basis has been set by the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  The basic principles are there and it is only a matter of trying to simplify the social welfare structure and to remove any complications that exist.  I know the Department have done everything in their power to try to make social welfare more simple and to try to avoid unnecessary delays.  The review body is of vital importance.  The Minister has a tremendous opportunity to ensure that in that review all the impediments in social welfare will be removed forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has accepted what I said about ensuring that the working of the Bill is monitored very carefully. I know innocent people will suffer.  The constitutionality of the Bill is another day's work.  It is the responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare to keep a watchful eye on the workings of this Bill <Col N="1251" /> to ensure that nobody is victimised because there will be doubts.  I know of no case &mdash; and I am sure the Minister will agree with me &mdash; where there will not be some doubt expressed by his officials or by some legal adviser.  It is for that reason that I place so much emphasis on the words &ldquo;reasonable doubt&rdquo;.  That is the basis of the Bill.  I thank the Minister for co-operating with us today.</P>

The review will be an urgent one.  Deputies will have an opportunity afterwards to look at the wider developments which should take place within the social welfare code.</P>

This case finished on 23 May, judgment was given on that date and the order was made.  The Government are now seeking clarification of the order because on the face of it this judgment <Col N="1260" /> says the constituencies as currently constituted are unconstitutional.  This is simply a clarification of something that is already over, and, with respect, I submit to you it cannot therefore be described as <i>sub judice.</i>  In any event, the clarification procedure will not take more than half an hour or so, presumably.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to bring forward these two Bills &mdash; the Dublin City University Bill, 1989, and the University of Limerick Bill, 1989.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a long and proud tradition in the area of education.  Our educational system, to a large degree, has withstood the test of time and the standards it has achieved at all levels are the result of the dedication of successive Governments and the investment of time and effort by parents and those who work within the education system devoted to teaching, research and, in general, to the advancement and dissemination of knowledge.</P>
      <P>It can be argued that the monasteries of Ireland were the precursors of the mediaeval university as seats of learning and scholarship.  However, the university at Bologna, established in the 12th century, and, then, Paris are generally regarded as the first of the mediaeval universities.  It was not surprising, therefore that attempts were made to establish a university of scholars in Dublin during the early part of the 14th century.  The inchoate University of St. Patrick was established by Papal Bull of Pope Clement Vth in the following terms:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1263" />  By our apostolic authority we decide that in the same city of Dublin... there should be a university of scholars and...in every lawful science and faculty...in which masters may have liberty to teach and students to hear lectures in the same faculties.</P>
    <P>There is evidence that lectures were given and that there was a formal conferring of degrees on teachers and on students who had been educated elsewhere. However there seems to be little evidence of activity by the university after 1320.  In 1465 a parliament held in Drogheda, presided over by Thomas, the eighth Earl of Desmond, passed an Act to the effect: &ldquo;...that there be a University in the town of Drogheda in which may be made Bachelors, Masters and Doctors in all sciences and faculties ...&rdquo;.  Nothing came of the project, however. I hope nobody looks for that university now.</P>
    <P>In 1475 a further attempt was made to establish a university in Dublin.  Pope Sixtus IVth by Papal Bull of 27 April established a &ldquo;university of theology and the liberal arts necessary for the knowledge thereof&rdquo;.  Again, this project failed to develop further.  Finally, in 1568 an attempt was made to revive the University of St. Patrick; this attempt also failed.</P>
    <P>University education in Ireland has a distinguished history, notwithstanding these early unsuccessful attempts.  This extraordinarily learned and successful history formally commenced with the granting of the charter to the University of Dublin, Trinity College Dublin, in 1592.</P>
    <P>Further university colleges were established in the middle of the 19th century; these included the Queen's Colleges in Cork, Galway, Belfast and the Catholic University in Dublin 1854.  In 1908 the National University was constituted, comprised of University Colleges in Dublin, Cork and Galway; in 1910 St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, which had been established in the final years of the <Col N="1264" /> 18th century, became a recognised college of the National University of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The other long established sector of Ireland's higher education system and of general education &mdash; the vocational education committee system of colleges &mdash; can trace its roots to the 19th century.  It was given an added impetus and developed particularly strongly following on the passing of the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  The colleges of technology of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee &mdash; now the Dublin Institute of Technology &mdash; for instance, developed from trade schools to institutions offering programmes over a broad range of disciplines from apprentice, to technician, degree and professional level.</P>
    <P>The sixties saw a major thrust towards the development of technical education following the publication of <i>Investment in Education</i>, 1962, <i>Training of Technicians in Ireland</i>, 1964, and the report of the Steering Committee on Technicians in Ireland, 1964, and the report of the Steering Committee on Technical Education on the Regional Technical Colleges, 1967.  The latter report forms the basis for the establishment of a network of regional technical colleges complementing the existing colleges of technology in Dublin in providing technical/technological manpower to meet the needs of an evolving industrialised economy.</P>
    <P>The Robbins Committee in the United Kingdom during the sixties identified, <i>inter alia</i>, a major missing dimension in the United Kingdom higher education system, namely, the absence of a sufficiently strong emphasis on technological education at university level.  This missing dimension was also evident in Ireland. NIHE Limerick developed in the early seventies following the announcement in 1969 of the intent to establish it.  The Minister for Education of the day, Deputy Brian Lenihan, spoke of his vision for the NIHE and his expectation that it would be a new initiative, of which the country would be proud.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1265" /> NIHE Limerick enrolled its first students in autumn 1972 on programmes in business, engineering, humanities and science.  Indeed, I recall the enthusiasm with which the Limerick University Project Committee pursued its goal in the sixties which led to the decision to establish the first NIHE in Limerick.</P>
    <P>In fact in the mid-19th century the then Mayor of Limerick, Pierce Shannon, led a delegation to Westminster to present their case for a university for Limerick. The demand and thrust for a university in Limerick has been fairly constant since that time.</P>
    <P>The establishment of NIHE Dublin was embodied in a set of decisions made and promulgated in 1974 by the then Government regarding the restructuring of the higher education system.  Specifically, it was stated that NIHE Dublin &ldquo;should be a recognised College of the National University of Ireland with a capacity to evolve into a constituent college or to become an autonomous degree awarding institution&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As a result of the 1974 Government decisions the NIHE Limerick was established as a recognised college of the National University of Ireland in March 1976.  The first degrees were awarded by the Chancellor of the University. However, the Government subsequently decided to establish the NIHEs as independent statutory bodies under the Higher Education Authority and also introduced legislation providing the National Council for Educational Awards with the degree-awarding function.</P>
    <P>The National Institutes, established in Limerick and then in Dublin, were challenged to develop programmes of teaching and research at international standards equivalent to those of the established universities, while giving special attention to Ireland's emerging needs in the fields of science, technology and business.</P>
    <P>The Government, on the advice of the Higher Education Authority, wished to ensure that there would also be a significant element of the humanities present, and from the outset programmes <Col N="1266" /> of study commenced, not only in science, engineering and business, but also in the arts.  Indeed, Ireland's first arts degree in European studies commenced in Limerick in 1972.  Degree programmes in communications and in languages and a postgraduate programme in journalism were developed in the NIHE Dublin. This development in Ireland paralleled the growth of new universities, some of them formally named technological universities, throughout Europe.  The two institutes were established on a statutory basis under the NIHE, Limerick, Act, 1980, and the NIHE, Dublin, Act, 1980. Degrees, diplomas and certificates are awarded by the National Council for Educational Awards under its Act of 1979.</P>
    <P>It is now 16 years since the first students were admitted to the National Institute in Limerick, and nine years since they were admitted to the National Institute in Dublin.  Since then both bodies have emerged as institutions of high standing, both nationally and internationally.  Time has permitted their graduates to demonstrate their abilities in a wide range of disciplines from the arts to the sciences, and at the highest academic level up to and including the doctorate.</P>
    <P>The recognition of the achievements of the NIHEs is well known to parents and students and is reflected in the high level of competition for admission, the high quality of those students admitted and by the high demand for graduates.  The breadth and depth of their academic standing is also attested to by the success with which they pursue postgraduate study at other universities, both within European Community countries and further afield.</P>
    <P>The NIHEs have played their anticipated role in stimulating economic development, introducing educational innovation and, indeed, have been both directly and indirectly responsible for a wide range of new enterprises which have been attracted to this country, or been created by their graduates.</P>
    <P>Some years ago it was proposed to Government that they should consider conferring a more appropriate title and <Col N="1267" /> granting the right to award degrees to the NIHEs, clearly defining the university level standing of the NIHEs internationally. In order rigorously to establish the justification for such a proposal, a distinguished panel of national and international experts was invited to examine the standing of both NIHEs and to advise the Government on the proposal to combine both NIHEs into a national technological university.  The group's unambiguous findings have established that both NIHEs clearly operate at university level, whether viewed from a national or an international perspective and fully justify the conferring of university status.  Furthermore, the international team recognised that the range of activities within both NIHEs encompassed not only the sciences, technology and business, but also the arts, and concluded that the national technological university title would not adequately reflect this comprehensive range.  The team also advised that it would be more appropriate to establish each NIHE as an independent university with the power to award degrees and with the normal functions of a university.</P>
    <P>When the Government decision was announced last January to set up the two NIHEs as universities the activities of the technological commission may not have got the attention which they warrant by the nature of their work and their findings. It was the previous Government who decided to set up the technological commission, composed of people internationally recognised and renowned in the field of study.  The commission worked speedily and reported to the then Minister, Deputy Cooney.  When I came into office the report was formally presented to me.</P>
    <P>I make this point in a deliberate fashion because it may emerge from subsequent contributions to the debate that there may not be on the part of other persons a full commitment to the idea of establishing these two colleges as universities. The Government of the day, foreseeing that it was such an important issue, took <Col N="1268" /> the advice of an international body of experts.  The Government gave them their brief.  They studied it and it was submitted to me.  The group's unambiguous findings have established that both NIHEs clearly operate at university level whether viewed from a national or international perspective and fully justify the conferring of university status.</P>
    <P>During the past year the recommendation has been given careful consideration culminating in the Government's decision to confer full university status on both NIHE, Limerick, and NIHE, Dublin, with power to award degrees, diplomas and certificates and undertake the normal functions of universities, <i>inter alia</i>, including research towards the advancement of knowledge and research and development in the interests of business, industrial and national development.</P>
    <P>The Government are deeply conscious of the historic nature of these proposals in view of the fact that these two new universities will be the first to be established since the foundation of the State. Government are also conscious of the clear benefits which will derive from the enactment of this legislation.  It will convey to the international community Ireland's seriousness regarding industrial and business development in an increasingly competitive world; it will serve to emphasise the importance which Ireland attaches to excellence in learning and it will highlight the capability of Ireland's higher education sector.  The establishment of the new universities represents a further underlining of Government commitment to industrial development.  It is also a vote of confidence in and will be a significant help to the development of the communities in which the new universities are located.</P>
    <P>The legislation will enhance the NIHEs ability to develop research and academic links with European and other foreign universities, will enhance their access to research support from international sources, will increase the number and extent of student exchange programmes, a matter of considerable relevance with the <Col N="1269" /> prospect of the single market in 1992 and will enhance the development of credit transfer arrangements and joint teaching programmes with EC and other universities.</P>
    <P>What is proposed, therefore, is minor amending legislation in respect of the NIHE, Limerick, Act, 1980, and the NIHE, Dublin, Act, 1980 in order to: change the titles of the institutes to universities, to change the titles of the directors to presidents, to confer the power to award degrees, diplomas and certificates on the new universities, to amplify the definitions of the functions of the universities, to give the governing bodies the authority to extend the functions of the universities, with the approval of the Minister for Education, and to extend the functions of the academic councils to make recommendations to the governing bodies on the conferment of degrees, diplomas and certificates.</P>
    <P>The authorities of the institutes and the Irish Federation of University Teachers have been consulted and they concur with the proposal to introduce the amending legislation.</P>
    <P>It is right that I pay due and proper tribute to the National Council for Educational Awards under whose aegis the NIHEs have developed.  The acknowledgement of excellence which is the basis for this legislation is, at the same time, an endorsement of the quality and standing of the National Council for Educational Awards, its processes, its awards at all levels &mdash; certificate, diploma and degree &mdash; and also of the colleges and institutions which are designated institutions of NCEA.</P>
    <P>As I have been at pains to do in any of the fora in which the development of the universities has been discussed, I want to pay formal tribute to the NCEA on their strong commitment and work with the NIHEs in their formative stages of growth.  I have consulted also with the NCEA and they have many imaginative ideas on moving forward within their various areas of work.  Should the occasion arise in the future to amend the NCEA Act to allow them to amplify their functions in whatever way is deemed to be <Col N="1270" /> proper by the Government of the day, they will be willingly listened to and their needs addressed by all concerned.</P>
    <P>Given the historic nature of these proposals and the important development they represent for the third level education system of the country, I am sure the House will welcome the Government's initiative in introducing these Bills.</P>
    <P>I welcome the broad agreement which emerged about these decisions when they were announced publicly last January in Limerick and Dublin by the representatives of the various parties who freely acknowledged the wisdom of the decisions and said they would participate in the passage of the legislation but would not seek to unduly hinder it because they saw the need for it and the dynamism of the action being taken.</P>
    <P>I want to also put on record my acknowledgement of that generosity of spirit with which the news was greeted and the further generosity of all the parties in the House in facilitating us when we sought to have the legislation brought to the House this week.  There were many reasons for that.  Deputy Birmingham, the spokesman for the main Opposition Party, has been asking since January when it was introduced, when we would be bringing it to the House so that the young people being conferred in the autumn would be conferred from whatever would be the title of the two new universities.  I pay tribute to the Deputy's tenacity in asking about that so many times.  In the meantime, I was beavering away in my Department to produce the finished product.  Deputy O'Malley also asked in the House on many occasions when the Bill was to be progressed, as did Deputy Higgins and Deputy De Rossa.</P>
    <P>I make these points not in a placatory sense but to show that there are occasions when legislation is right for the time. From my discussions with the interested groups and the various political parties it seems there is agreement.  I hope that will not preclude a lively and informed debate on the review and scrutiny of the amendments before us and the various <Col N="1271" /> other suggestions which may come forward in the Second Stage debate and into the Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on record my thanks for that generosity of spirit and my appreciation of the speed with which everybody, not least my own Department, the Attorney General's Office and the draftspeople concerned, got their work done. This was not a decision plucked out of the sky.  It was a very carefully considered decision.  The NIHEs have evolved over a very long time.  They have won their spurs.  They have shown what they can do.  They have far outstripped their brief. As is the way with all educational institutions particularly the ones who want to prove themselves, they went beyond their brief in many cases to the chagrin perhaps of other establishments and the Department of Education who would have noted that they had roamed far and wide.  In doing so they have won the admiration and respect of the country.</P>
    <P>I want to lay to rest that this is in any way detrimental to any other university. It seems that frissons have emerged in the debate on the role of NIHEs and their academic standing.  I will go no further than to say that by their fruits one should know them and certainly the fruits of the NIHEs have proved them.  They have travelled a long road since the idea was introduced 20 years ago following on various reports in the sixties.  We had very wide expert technological advice from the expert committee set up by the previous Government and it has shown unequivocally that the NIHEs have established themselves not just in technological, science and allied areas but in the arts, the humanities, research and development and in all the areas which are proper to universities and to the pursuit of advancement of knowledge.</P>
    <P>The Chair may think I have laboured these points.  There will be time to return to them later in the debate.  It was necessary to make these points.  The Government see the setting up of these universities as part of a pattern of evolving third level university education, a pattern which will also arise from the <Col N="1272" /> technological commission relating to the colleges Bill for the whole of the country.</P>
    <P>I am greatly privileged and honoured that it falls on me to bring forward and to steer successfully through the House a Bill to create the new universities for this country.  The titles proposed for the new universities are Ollscoil Chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath, Dublin City University and Ollscoil Luimnigh, University of Limerick. I commend these Bills to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give 15 minutes to Deputy FitzGerald.</P>
      <P>This is probably the last occasion on which I will be speaking in the House as an Opposition spokesman on education in this Dáil.  I hope I will not be playing that role in the next.  I take the opportunity now to thank the Minister for the courtesy which she and her officials extended to me during the period in which I have held that role.  I thank particularly the people in her private office and her excellent private secretary whose promotion came through recently, a promotion which was long overdue.</P>
      <P>By any standards this is a fairly curious debate.  In a matter of hours we are putting through the Dáil legislation to create two new universities, the first new universities to be created in the history of the State.  The fact that there should be such a degree of co-operation nails the lie about any suggestion by the Taoiseach or anyone else that the Government are not facilitated in passing legislation through the House.  It is hard to see what Government in any parliament could expect that degree of co-operation from Opposition parties.  As the Minister has generously acknowledged, that co-operation was not just on the basis that a dissolution is imminent but was offered shortly after the decision was announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because we have so little time we <Col N="1274" /> cannot address many of the questions which we would normally have addressed in a Bill such as this.  It means that we have not got ample time to find out from the Government their thinking on the report of the commission chaired by Dr. Hardiman.  That commission was on technological education in Ireland.  There is a popular view that it was established to consider whether or not the NIHEs should acquire the status of universities. Its brief went well beyond that and they carried out a much more extensive examination and presented 20 recommendations. We would be interested to know the Government's thinking in relation to these.  While it is true that this legislation has emerged without undue delay, once the decision was taken, which took long enough, the Government have been remarkably dilatory in responding to the other recommendations, many of them of considerable importance.  There are recommendations about the role of the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges. What do the Government think about that?  What is the Government response to the suggestion that those colleges have established the case for a specific statutory base?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather suspect that Deputy O'Rourke will be asking questions about it, but that remains to be seen.  This legislation clearly has indications for the way in which we organise higher education.  What is the Government's thinking on that?  How do the Government see the role of the National University of Ireland?  Do they see it remaining as a federal structure?  Do they see the individual colleges acquiring independence? Do they see perhaps a loosening of the federal bonds and what do they see happening in relation to Maynooth? One might have expected all of these questions to have been addressed, because they arise directly from the legislation before the House.  That has not happened and the time limit we have means that it is unlikely that we will get <Col N="1275" /> the answers during the course of the afternoon.</P>
      <P>I welcome these Bills for which I have been pressing, both before the Government's decision in January and since.  The Minister pointed out that even if we are allocating only a brief time today, it is in fact the end of a very long road.  The Minister mentioned the fact that the demand for a university in Limerick goes back to 1845 with the visit to London by the mayor of the day.  I recall the first Fine Gael Ard-Fheis I attended in 1970 which was particularly noteworthy because it took place around the time of the dismissal of Deputy Haughey for suspected gun running by the Taoiseach of the day.  I recall the contribution at that Ard-Fheis of the then Senator&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">

I invite the Deputy, who indicated earlier that he did not have much to contribute, to at least give us the benefit of what he has to say and to let us proceed with the business.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should address himself to the legislation before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  I was simply making the point that the demand for university status goes back a long way and indicated that I recall the contribution by the then Lord Mayor of Limerick, Senator Ted Russell, at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis in 1970 when he addressed this subject with very great passion.  Since 1970, when the first 100 students were enrolled, much has happened, first in Limerick and more recently in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister when she says that both colleges have fulfilled their mandates and have established themselves as centres of scholarship and excellence particularly, in the technological and applied science areas, but in no sense exclusively, because their contributions in the humanities are of considerable note.  I note the developments which have taken place in Dublin.  There are now courses on international marketing which, it is fair to say, lead the way for many of the more traditional universities. I also note their considerable success in forging a relationship with the business community and with industry.  Again, it is fair to say that the more traditional colleges were not as quick to do this.  We have seen the considerable success of the co-operative programme under which young undergraduates are given an opportunity to experience the world of industry, either at home or abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The colleges have shown themselves to be worthy of the confidence placed in them by the then Government in 1970, and which has continued to be placed in them by successive Governments.  The Minister began her speech by saying it gave her great pleasure to introduce this legislation.  I am sure it did, but I am sure it was increased by the fact that her brother, the Tánaiste, played a prominent role in bringing forward the original legislation.  May I take this opportunity to say to her that all of us in the House, <Col N="1277" /> as my party leader commented, are very pleased that the operation went as well as it did.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>We are pleased with the legislation.  When in Government we were approached by the colleges.  The whole world knew that there was a vigorous campaign to have this status conferred on the colleges.  We were determined that there would be no quick response, that it would not simply be a matter of saying that they could have university status and no one should think that university status was being allocated as a political sop or anything of that nature.  We felt in fairness to the institutions and to university education that it was important that the appropriateness of the decision should be publicly validated. That is why we felt it appropriate to establish a commission of international standing.  That is what we did and it was chaired by Dr. Hardiman with experts from the United States, Europe and Britain.</P>
      <P>Their recommendation was clear and unambiguous and it was that, as these two colleges had firmly established themselves as centres of scholarship, they were properly entitled to university status. Accordingly, we were keen that the legislation should emerge as quickly as possible. I made clear that time was of the essence.  I stated repeatedly in this House that it was appropriate that legislation be brought forward to benefit those sitting exams this summer.  In saying this I knew there would be a downside.  I knew it meant that the legislation would be less comprehensive than it might otherwise be, but it seemed that the best should not be allowed to become the enemy of the good.  It was imperative that legislation be brought before the House expeditiously and this justified producing legislation which was essentially minimalist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That said, a number of aspects of this legislation cause us some concern.  Even <Col N="1278" /> with the short time that will be available on Committee Stage we would hope to address them.  We are concerned about the structures of the new universities. Essentially, the Bill maintains in place the governing structures of the existing NIHEs and elaborates in some respects on the academic council.  In doing this the Minister has gone some way towards meeting the anxieties of the Irish Federation of University Teachers and others.  I welcome such a move but I wish to see her go further.  The position is that the governing bodies of the NIHEs, as provided for in the existing legislation, contain a very large number of ministerial nominees and only a very small number of representatives of the academic community in the colleges.  This is undesirable and it is our intention on Committee Stage to move amendments to assert the principle of independence within a university and to do so by way of reducing the number of ministerial appointments on the governing body and increasing the number of academic appointments.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will say that this is a difficulty more apparent than real, but we are also concerned about the Minister's role under the NIHE Acts in relation to staffing.  The position is that the Minister for Education, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, is given an interventionist role in relation to staffing appointments.  The Minister for Education is required to give her consent on the number of appointments and the way in which appointments are made. There can be no problem with the number of appointments.  Clearly in this day and age no legislation would do other than suggest that there would be financial control and control over the number of appointments.  For a Minister to have even the theoretic ability to refuse the appointment of an individual on the basis of ministerial judgment of the individual's fitness for office is wholly inappropriate.</P>
    <P>Let us give an example which might conceivably arise.  Let us suppose in one of the humanities faculties that a professor comes forward who is seen to have <Col N="1279" /> revisionist views on the national question, can we be sure that there would never be a Minister who would say no to that appointment?  It seems inappropriate, given the ancient and traditional nature of a university, that any Minister for Education should have that role in relation to appointments.  I have no quarrel with a Minister having a role in relation to the number of appointments, but I do quarrel with a Minister having a role in relation to individual appointments.</P>
    <P>The technological commission, while saying clearly that the two colleges are fully entitled to university status, indicated areas where they expected and looked for further development.  They expressed concern about library facilities. I would like the Minister to tell us what is being done to meet those concerns. They also expressed a desire for the colleges to develop in the area of social science.  I would also like the Minister to tell us what is being done to meet this desire.</P>
    <P>This legislation is welcome.  I hope we can improve it somewhat.  We will be tabling amendments to focus attention on areas of concern rather than to obstruct or impede.  On the day the Minister travelled from Limerick to Dublin to announce the decision, I indicated on behalf of my party that we would do everything to expedite passage of the legislation and to do nothing to obstruct its passage.  That is the attitude we will be adopting between now and 7 p.m.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>Dublin, like other European airports, is experiencing a phenomenal growth in traffic.  The increased traffic is most welcome even though, as throughout Europe, it strains the present capacity of the ATC system.</P>
      <P>Though we will be making every effort to minimise delays, because of the traffic volumes and lack of system capacity, delays may occur.  Major investment in manpower and equipment is required to extend the capacity of ATC, not just in Ireland but throughout Europe.</P>
      <P>My Department are well advanced on major investments in equipment, facilities and staff.  These include a £30 million programme for new communications, radar, instrument landing systems and other navigational aids, as well as £34 million for a new runway and State services complex at Dublin Airport.  As the House is aware, I recently authorised an increase of more than 10 per cent in air traffic control staffing through the provision of 27 additional staff.  Last week I placed a contract for the replacement of the radar systems at State airports which will provide modern state of the art equipment at Dublin, Shannon and Cork. The total value of this contract is £13.2 million and it will be fully installed in 1990-91 but at Dublin by the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as Dublin is concerned one of <Col N="1281" /> the most modern, custom built, air traffic control centres in Europe will, I hope, be operational by the end of this year.  The new centre will have a full range of completely modern facilities such as communications systems, primary and secondary surveillance radar.  Pending the move to the new centre, a temporary secondary surveillance radar facility will be available to controllers in the existing centre within the next fortnight.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, so far as Ireland is concerned, we are making the necessary investment in the infrastructure that is required by present and projected air traffic levels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the traffic control facilities at Dublin Airport are adequate in terms of dealing with the volume of traffic going in and out and that there are no potential safety hazards arising out of the way the system is operated at present?  In relation to the expenditure he announced for various improvements, can he give us some idea when the programme will be completed and when the improved facilities will be operational?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I replied to the latter part of the Deputy's supplementary in my reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand that.  I assure the Deputy that there is no danger in regard to safety as a result of the facilities provided at Dublin Airport.  It is important to stress that the Airline Pilots' Association and the air traffic controllers agree that there is no problem in regard to safety.  The £30 million programme is already under way, the approval for the 10 per cent increase in staff has already been given and we expect that the new recruits will start within the next couple of weeks.  I also indicated in the course of my reply that pending the move to the new centre a temporary secondary surveillance radar facility will be available within two weeks at Dublin Airport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that, notwithstanding the fact that no safety factor is involved, there is a delay factor?  Will he agree that an air traffic control representative indicated recently that despite the promised air traffic control facilities, there will be an inordinate delay in having it implemented and that it will be well into the nineties before any improvement can be expected at Dublin Airport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As the secondary surveillance radar will be operating within two weeks from now, no sane person could claim it was an inordinate delay. The major installation will be in place in Dublin Airport in 1989 and not even the wildest propagandist could claim &mdash; as it is the state of the art equipment which is being installed &mdash; that it was an inordinate delay.  I do not know the source of that statement but it was an inaccurate account of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement was widely publicised in the newspapers and I am surprised that the Minister is not aware of it.  Notwithstanding the commitment he has given here, he has failed to persuade the Irish Airline Pilots' Association and the air traffic controllers of the improvement at Dublin Airport.  They are expecting a long hot summer with inordinate delays for passengers using Dublin Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>A statement was made by the Irish Airline Pilots' Association but, unfortunately, it was prepared at the time the two pilots were killed in the United States and it was postponed for a week. In the meantime I had signed the contract for equipment costing £13.2 million to be installed at Dublin Airport.  One event crossed the other.  The Deputy can be assured that (a) we are right on the ball as far as the provision of the equipment is concerned, (b) that there is no problem in regard to safety and (c) that the equipment to be installed is of the very highest quality.  There is no better equipment available in the world market.</P>

In view of what was indicated by the Minister, can he assure us that there will not be industrial actions leading to delays for passengers to and from Dublin Airport and elsewhere?  Will the Minister reconcile &mdash; for me and many members of the public who will be looking to air traffic as a means of transport in the coming months &mdash; or explain how he, his Department and the Irish Airline Pilots' Association are in agreement that the system is &mdash; to quote his Department and the association &mdash; inadequate, in some respect grossly inadequate?  How can we be sure that there is no element of lack of safety involved?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is observant, I am sure he has noticed that my approach is non-confrontational.  Any problems that exist in the industrial relations field will be subjected to the most careful analysis and negotiation. That is the road down which we intend to travel in the Department.  I am convinced that the people involved are committed to the same philosophy and, that being so, I cannot say that I see any grave dangers.  The fact of the matter is that over the last few years there has been a huge increase in travellers by air in all European countries.  I am fully aware of the problems because I am current president of EUROCONTROL.  Delays have occurred at airports in Ireland that sourced elsewhere.  In particular, the flow control in Heathrow has caused delays and, consequently, has caused us problems but it is important to stress that the problems did not originate here.  Likewise, Frankfurt is very much under pressure. There is a network of very busy airlines and, consequently, a network of problems but we are confident that as far as Dublin, Cork and Shannon are concerned, we are equipping ourselves fully to deal with such problems.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if the Government endorse the Framework Development Plan for Irish Tourism, published by Bord Fáilte in April, 1989; the steps the Government intend to take to help achieve the targets in the plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The development plan referred to was produced and published by Bord Fáilte as part of their statutory responsibilities for encouraging the promotion and development of tourist traffic in and to the State.  It outlines a new framework for the development of Irish tourism to support a doubling of tourism in the period 1988-92.</P>
      <P>This is one of the targets set for the sector in the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which includes a strategy for achieving these targets, involving: better and cheaper access; improved marketing and increased investment in tourism development.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte, as the executive agency with responsibility for tourism development, have provided in their document an outline for the industry on what they consider to be the development and investment priorities for achieving the Government's targets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree with the views of the Director General of Bord Fáilte that 1989 will be a crucial year in the five year development programme for tourism?  Will he agree also that the indications are, taking into account the fall-off in American tourist traffic, that the programme will not achieve its jobs target?  Will the Minister accept that the plan is, if anything, in tatters at this stage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Far from being in tatters, the plan is on target.  We are very confident that we will deliver on the original targets in the five year plan.  With regard to the Deputy's reference to the US market I should like to say that it is true that there was a certain softness in that <Col N="1287" /> market.  Some of the carriers took steps recently to counteract that and those steps have been proving successful.  The Deputy will be aware that the dollar has strengthened very considerably and our tourism prospects as a result should improve, even from the United States. When the dollar was exceptionally strong before there was a huge increase in the number of tourists from the United States to Ireland.  However, we tend to focus too much on the United States and I should like to tell the House that the percentage increases from the continent of Europe, particularly from France and Germany, are very encouraging.  We are confident that we will meet our targets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said he is well on target to meet the objectives of the five year plan but I should like to know if he is aware of the controversy about what constitutes a &ldquo;tourist&rdquo;.  A report on the number of UK tourists to Ireland indicated that of the 1.5 million people described as visitors only 10 per cent could be classified as visitors because the others were returning emigrants. That should be borne in mind in the context of the claim that the targets are being achieved.  Will the Minister accept, in relation to the UK market, that access fares have been relatively low in the last two years.  Where will he get further growth in that traffic from because I do not think access fares can continue to decrease?  In relation to the American market, will the Minister agree that petrol prices and car hire costs continue to be one of our major disadvantages? Has the Minister any plans to introduce petrol vouchers for American tourists or to do anything to alleviate the high car hire costs in the coming season?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a little bit of woolly thinking with regard to visitors from the UK.  If the House paid attention to the editorial work of <i>The Irish Post</i> over a number of years it will have noted that the editor was conducting a campaign, somewhat hostile to Bord Fáilte at times, about the neglect of the Irish <Col N="1288" /> ethnic person in Britain.  On examination of the position it was very clear to me that Ireland is in competition with Spain, southern France and Italy for the holidays of those people.  This is something we should keep in mind because the highly geared sales campaigns are all for Torremolinos, Malaga, Marbella and so on. We must be able to compete with those areas and attract people here.  That is why Bord Fáilte have put on a very strong programme in the UK.  As a result of that campaign visitors are coming here from the UK who would not have come otherwise. We must compete; competitiveness is very important.  I should like to emphasise that point because some of the visitors who choose to come back to their own country are rather annoyed when people say they are not tourists but our own people coming back.  We should appreciate the fact that they are coming back here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a great deal of correspondence indicating resentment to that attitude.  I agree with the wisdom of the campaign conducted which targeted on that area of Britain so as to attract as many holidaymakers as possible, whether ethnic or non-ethnic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's second point related to assess fares.  It is difficult to assess these fares.  I agree with the Deputy that there is <i>ne plus ultra or infra</i> so far as the fares are concerned, there is a limit below which they cannot go and work commercially. British Midlands have taken a <Col N="1289" /> six flight per week slot this year.  The belief by hard headed business people that there is still room in that market for development, cutting prices and providing competitive prices is still there.  I take the Deputy's point that there must be a lower limit, but we are not dependent merely on access fares.  High access fares were a big inhibiting factor to getting people into this country, but it was not the only aspect we targeted.  We targeted activity holidays and we have brought out a set of brochures which I believe would challenge, in terms of quality, the brochures brought out by any tourism organisations in the world.  These brochures highlight our golfing, equestrian, fishing, rambling, touring, yachting, sailing and cruising activities.  I believe this will impact heavily, particularly, on the Continent, and the percentage increase we are getting from these countries can be attributed to clever activity holiday targeting.</P>
    <P>The final point related to the price of petrol.  The price of petrol and the cost of hiring cars is very high but this has to be seen in a broader context.  Come 1992, we have to resolve a whole lot of problems in regard to excise duties &mdash; excise duties on cars, the fuel etc.  This is a broader question than the Minister for Tourism and Transport can solve.  It is mainly in the financial area and no doubt the House has read some of the recent statements made by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, on this matter.</P>
    <P>In the past we provided, with mixed success, for a period of the year petrol vouchers for people from the United States.  It is the visitors from the United States who tended to hire cars, and they find the cost very high.  In a table of costs, our costs are very much higher than those in the United States.  We are not the highest in Europe by any means, and one country which is helped very much by a system which lets car hire companies off paying excise duties is still higher than we are so far as charges are concerned. This area has been given a great deal of study and is one to which we will have to pay more attention.</P>

The business from foot passengers has gone down but from information available to me the increase in the number of cars using the ferry is very pleasing.

      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the negative.  A warning in this matter was conveyed directly to Aer Rianta who took immediate precautionary steps to deal with the situation.</P>
      <P>I would prefer not to go into any further details because, as I have told the House before &mdash; and I am sure the House in its wisdom will understand this &mdash; policy has always been to give no details of specific security initiatives.

That is an attitude that has been well rehearsed and used by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Defence, and leads to the annoyance of Members of this House.  Have the Department or airport authorities expended any moneys on buying new equipment &mdash; I am not asking the type of equipment &mdash; but have steps of a concrete nature been taken to deal with what is now a very new, lethal and worrying dimension of terrorism in the air?  Could the Minister give us some assurance that such steps have been taken?

They got information about the &ldquo;marzipan&rdquo; danger and took immediate steps to counteract it.  In pressing me to give the House more details the Deputy is putting me in a false light.  I would be more than anxious to reveal security measures to the House if I thought it was in the interests of security at airports but I cannot go further than ask the Deputy to accept that Aer Rianta, with their known and proven capacity as an airport operator, took steps necessary to deal with the information when they received it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the disadvantages inherent in the Irish haulage industry including those mentioned in the Deputies' question.  The Government are anxious that all competitive disparities be reduced.  Many of the operating costs involved for hauliers &mdash; port and sea freight charges, insurance and vehicle taxes &mdash; are outside the scope of my remit as Minister for Tourism and Transport.</P>
      <P>The Government, however, have recognised the vital role of transport in the economy and the necessity that it be provided with the resources required to be ready for 1992.</P>
      <P>For this reason the National Development Plan recently submitted to Brussels points out that a significant reason for high transport costs in the Republic is the deficient state of the national roads and access roads to the principal ports and airports.  The plan contains proposals that expenditure on the development of main Irish commercial ports will be concentrated on Dublin, Cork, Rosslare and Waterford and will amount to approximately £72 million over the period of the plan.  In addition, the provision in the plan for the improvement of national roads and access roads is £755 million.</P>
      <P>These improvements when implemented, will result in the transport industry being in an enhanced competitive position <i>vis-à-vis</i> our European counterparts as we have in-built disadvantages.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that there are certain fiscal cost differences between Irish and Northern Ireland hauliers for which there are no easy solutions.  I would have to point out, however, that in the area of road tax, hauliers in the South fare much better than their Northern Ireland colleagues. For example, the road tax on a 38-tonne truck is approximately IR£900 per annum in contrast with up to IR£3,700 per annum in Northern Ireland, depending on the axle configuration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the lorry weights situation, Ireland and the UK secured a <Col N="1295" /> derogation to retain a national limit of 38 tonnes on 5-axle vehicles because of the need to improve the roads infrastructure &mdash; notably bridges to carry heavier lorries. The other EC member states have accepted our difficulties on this issue and the Council are now engaged in deciding on the date of termination of the derogation. Ireland has indicated that 31 December 1996 can be accepted as the terminal date for the derogation, on condition that the necessary infrastructural costs would qualify for EC grant aid at the maximum rate.  In fact, in so far as competitiveness is concerned, in the heavier vehicle categories, mostly used for international carriage, i.e. 5 or 6-axle combined vehicles, Ireland's limit is more favourable at 38 tonnes and 4-axle vehicles at 35 tonnes, while the Northern Ireland limit is 32.5 tonnes &mdash; so we have a weight advantage there.  In all other categories we operate similar weight limits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to this question, the first being in relation to the Northern Ireland hauliers.  Does the Minister accept that there is an enormous differential in costs as between Northern Ireland hauliers and domestic ones, that the consequence now is that hauliers from Northern Ireland are getting many contracts in the Republic, including, I am told, from public bodies such as Donegal County Council?  Would the Minister accept that there is a great need &mdash; from the point of view of tax harmonisation, leading to the same cost of trucks and equipment &mdash; for urgent action from that point of view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second aspect is in relation to the differential in weights as between ourselves and the Continent.  Is the Minister aware of the kind of practical difficulty that arises here when a 40 tonne container is landed at Rosslare to be picked up by an Irish haulier who legally cannot carry more than 38 tonnes?  He cannot break the seal on the container to remove two tonnes.  Therefore, he has two options open to him, one, either to leave it there or, second, break the law.  Would the <Col N="1296" /> Minister accept that that kind situation is ludicrous, apart from the broader weight problem, and requires urgent attention?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the Deputy that costs, particularly vehicle costs and excise duty on vehicles, is comparatively very high here.  The same is true of fuel costs.  As I mentioned already, all of this area &mdash; as the Deputy will be aware from newspaper reports &mdash; is under active consideration by the Ministers for Finance in the European Economic Council.  Our Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, made a very strong statement on the matter quite recently.  It is quite obvious that a lot of hard work, bargaining and negotiating must take place between now and 1992 to resolve the very serious difficulties that do exist and to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>In regard to the other point the Deputy raised, I should say, first, that if something arrives at Rosslare from Britain&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;from the Continent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if it comes from the Continent, yes.  But until the date mentioned &mdash; if that is the final decision &mdash; that final decision will be taken at the Council meetings on 5 and 6 June next. Until the Council decide and issue a directive there is no way that a haulier from the Continent would bring a 40 tonne container into Rosslare because it would be illegal for him to do so until at the very earliest, 31 December 1996. Conditional on the money being available to strengthen bridges already examined and selected by the Department of the Environment, the position to which the Deputy refers could apply from 31 December 1996, seven years away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that my understanding from hauliers is that, in practical terms, this problem exists now, that 40 tonne containers are arriving by ferry, being dropped into Rosslare for collection by Irish hauliers; that the Irish haulier is then placed in a <Col N="1297" /> position in which he either has to break the law or leave the container there being unable to open the seal on it to off load two tonnes because 40 into 38 will not go?  I am advised by hauliers that this practical difficulty now exists and they look to the Government &mdash; for how long they may be here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The only solution I could have to the case the Deputy instances is for the people who are ordering the freight from the Continent to point out what the law is in this country.  I am sure the French people would be as anxious as we are to abide by the laws of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently officials of my Department met a deputation from the Independent Hauliers Association.  At that meeting <Col N="1298" /> the deputation raised, <i>inter alia</i>, the question of delays in granting carriers licences and certificates of competence.  It was explained to the deputation that apart from the large volume of applications received, in most cases the applications were not properly completed; neither was all the necessary back-up documentation supplied.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that my Department are making every effort to finalise applications received as soon as possible.  Since it appears that a difficulty exists in completing forms, I propose to have included in any future courses leading to the examination for certificates of competence, a practical exercise on completion of applications forms.  Indeed because of the difficulty being experienced with the completion of forms, an official of my Department attended the recent intensive course held in Rathmines College of Commerce and dealt with issues relating to the completion of such forms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested to hear the Minister say that some improvement will be made in the completion of forms because I understand that is one of the major difficulties that the independent road hauliers have.  I also understand that there seems to be a bureaucratic approach to the problems which the independent hauliers are confronted with.  They are advised as to how the forms should be filled out.  Having got that advice they go away and fill them out but inevitably when they come back something is wrong.  I am not saying that is necessarily the fault of the individuals in the Department dealing with it; I know the forms are relatively complex.  They also inform me that there are delays because they cannot get tax clearance certificates on time.  They may have to wait for very long periods for tax clearance certificates and consequently that holds up the issuing of certificates of competence or, indeed, hauliers licences.  The quality of bank references required are of a very high standard.  Some of the hauliers have difficulty in complying with those kinds of requests.  The Minister has acknowledged that there is a delay.  He <Col N="1299" /> has also acknowledged that there is some difficulty in completion of forms.  I accept that he intends making improvements in that area, but would he also check whether the requirements being imposed are too heavy on the applicants and, perhaps, with the co-operation of the officials in the Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The three demands, as the Deputy is aware, are for evidence of sound financial standing, good repute and also professional competence.  We have found that some of the hauliers &mdash; excellent people in their own way and well able to run their own businesses &mdash; are not good at the form filling exercise.  We are trying to remedy that and to build into the Chartered Institute of Transport study a section which will help them.  In regard to the tax on the banks, that is not my domain.  If it would be of any help I will ask somebody in my Department to indicate to the Revenue Commissioners that this causes difficulties and that some special arrangement might be made for people whose livelihood depends on the haulage industry.  With regard to the banks I think they are a law unto themselves. I would not be 100 per cent sure that I would be able to get that kind of document from my own bank.</P>

Does the Minister accept that the figures he has announced indicate a significant increase on the numbers from previous years?  It appears that the trend is upward and markedly so.  Can the Minister indicate why this should be the case? Would he not accept that it indicates that there are some gaps or deficiencies in what he has described as a comprehensive <Col N="1302" /> system?

I would not be complacent about this.  Even one death is too many on the railway.

I am not certain of that fact, but certainly some people who have an interest in the railways indicated this to me some time ago.

I am aware of press reports regarding possible industrial action by air traffic control staff but neither I nor my Department have been officially notified of such action.</P>
      <P>Over the past two to three years there have been continuing discussions with the UPTCS regarding issues in the air traffic control service.  The discussions initially centred on the facilities and staffing arrangements in the air traffic control service, particularly in the light of the very welcome and substantial increase in air traffic.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, a major investment programme aimed at the complete renewal of the country's ATC and air navigation equipment is currently under way and due for completion in 1991-92. Last week, as part of that £30 million investment programme, I signed a contract for an integrated radar system for the three airports.  In all this project will cost £13.2 million and will be completed by 1991.</P>
      <P>In the first phase of the contract new secondary surveillance radar will be installed at Dublin Airport by the end of this year.  Pending the completion of that installation interim arrangements are being made &mdash; I mentioned this already &mdash; to give Dublin Airport secondary surveillance radar facilities for the coming summer.</P>
      <P>I fully recognise that, in addition to investment in equipment, there must also be investment in manpower.  As the House will recall, some weeks ago I announced the recruitment of 27 additional staff for the air traffic control Service.  These new staff, representing an addition of over 12 per cent in staffing, will begin to take up duty as and from Monday next.</P>

The matter is therefore, not <i>sub judice</i> any more and I strongly urge, that being the case and the only reason you have ruled it out of order, that you would accede to Deputy Mitchell's request, adjourn the House for 20 minutes so that you yourself, Sir, can check on the veracity of what we are saying.

      <P>I wish to raise a point of order.  Less than 25 minutes ago, the Ceann Comhairle made a ruling in relation to a request I made this morning in writing for an emergency debate under Standing Order 30, which allows for urgent debates on matters of specific and urgent public importance.  In his statement of 25 minutes ago, the Ceann Comhairle said the matter was <i>sub judice</i> because he had been officially informed that it was before the High Court.  We have asked the Ceann Comhairle to confirm our information that the High Court case has now been disposed of but that the constitutional question has not been disposed of.  We are very anxious to ensure that the people are fully informed, in the general election that will ensue, of the mess the Taoiseach has made of calling this general election and the constitutional implications involved. <Col N="1336" /> Accordingly, could we again request the debate which was earlier refused?</P>

Accordingly, I am now requesting a review of that decision to allow a debate to highlight the gubu nature of this Government.  Are you prepared to facilitate my request?</P>

      <P>With great respect, Sir, I feel I must make this remark.  The Chair has unnecessarily put itself in a position of being in conflict with Deputies on this side of the House and I cannot see why. Deputy Mitchell has made a request for an urgent debate in conformity with Standing Order 30 of the Standing Orders of this House.  The Ceann Comhairle gave a ruling under which he decided he would not allow the debate on the grounds that the matter was <i>sub judice.</i> The matter has been disposed of.  The matter was disposed of before the Ceann Comhairle made a ruling on this at 3.25 p.m.  We asked the Ceann Comhairle before he left the House if he would reconsider his ruling because factually and objectively the ground he gave for that ruling is wrong.  I wish, therefore, to ask you again &mdash; and if you feel you can do this in your capacity as Leas-Cheann Comhairle I will be more than happy to go along with you &mdash; to consider Deputy Mitchell's request since the matter is urgent, to allow the debate to go ahead or, with great respect, if you feel you cannot do that, to ask the Ceann Comhairle to come in here so that we can dispose of the matter in a proper and orderly way.</P>

It was made before the commencement of public business.  The reason it has been refused is not valid.  The court has already pronounced.  The matter remains one of public importance.  If I may advise the Chair, the Chair would be well advised to allow that debate to go ahead.  Now the Chair is getting itself into conflict with this side of the House over a matter that does not really concern the Chair.  The Chair is getting itself into conflict with this side of the House which wants simply to expose the ineptitude of this Government who dithered for a year trying to make up their mind whether to have an election.

      <P>On a point of order, I am fully aware that when we pointed out to the Ceann Comhairle that this matter was of such gravity and urgency that the Government felt it necessary to take it to the courts, he then agreed, under pressure from this side of the House and in response to a request from me, to reconsider his position.  Following that reconsideration he came back, and under a misapprehension that the matter was still before the court, he decided it was <i>sub judice.</i>  That is no longer true and his reconsideration of it on the other grounds I and others put forward is still an open question.  I would like to raise a point with you, Sir, under the rules of precedent these matters must be of such a nature that delay in discussing them might prevent effective action being taken, and this is obviously applicable, they must be <i>prima facie</i> urgent and raised without delay &mdash; that was done. They must be within the executive <Col N="1340" /> responsibility of Government or a Minister; clearly it is the Taoiseach's responsibility to dissolve the Dáil.  As to the grounds on which it has been refused in the past, none of these is applicable, such debates have been allowed for matters such as post office strikes and flood damage in Kilkenny which, with all due respect, are less important than the question of the dissolution of the Dáil.</P>

I am making this point because I want the discussion on the legislation to proceed without delay. I would like to make it perfectly clear that the arrangement that Deputy O'Malley and I acceded to before lunch &mdash; and Deputy FitzGerald is not resuming as he has not yet commenced his speech &mdash; was that the time could be shared.  We did not agree that the spokemanship rotation should be changed.  It was clearly established that the Minister would speak first followed by the Fine Gael spokesperson on Education followed by Deputy O'Malley, followed by me.

      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>While not commanding the total attention of the entire House, I welcome this Bill.  We should recognise, however, that in the process of accelerated legislation on which we are all agreed, there is a downside as well as an upside.  It has not been possible for the Government for reasons we fully understand to introduce the kind of Bill which would have been desirable, making adequate and due provision for the structure and organisation of the two universities. In that respect the Bill is defective.  I will make some suggestions in my brief remarks as to how that defect could be partially remedied within the tight time scale and by a very small amendment to the existing text.</P>
      <P>With regard to the principle of the Bill, it may have been a mistake to have two rather than one university from the point of view of destabilishing the rest of our structure.  It would be unfortunate if we end up with seven universities.  It would diminish the credibility of our university system by having a university for every 500,000 people.  I hope that will not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, we accept these two universities.  Our job now is to establish them in such a way as to ensure their credibility, their strength and capacity to do the job we are asking them to do. Two things are required for a university, starting from scratch, to achieve credibility. There must be independence of its structures and of the body which governs it.  It must be independent, above all, of the State.  Secondly, the university should be adequately endowed in order to have within the range of its curriculum the basic sciences and subjects upon which it has to draw for the purpose of its teaching and to have sufficient resources to undertake research in these areas, rather than being confined narrowly to teaching alone.  An institution which only functions to teach without any provision for <Col N="1358" /> research in the basic sciences upon which it has to draw is one which could have difficulty in establishing itself adequately in the academic world here and outside our borders.</P>
    <P>These are the two things with which I am concerned.  The second concern is one we cannot deal with here.  I merely appeal to the Minister to make sure the resources available are adequate to the universities in question to build up in the way any university must have a range of disciplines, such that nobody can challenge its universality, and the resources necessary to undertake the research to back up its teaching.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of the independence of the body, there is something we can do.  Because the proposal put forward only involves a change of the name and no attempt has been made to change the structure set out previously in the 1980 Act, we are left with universities whose basic structures are not appropriate to a university.  All the members of the governing body are to be appointed by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister.  I know of no precedent in these islands, or even in the US where independent academic institutions exist free of State interference, for this procedure.  Such a provision would make it unnecessarily difficult for these universities to establish themselves. On Committee Stage I will propose a brief amendment of four or five words which will achieve the necessary result. There is no reason why the Minister or the Government should have this function except in relation to the members they appoint directly.  By deleting a couple of words the formality introduced in the 1980 Act of the Government doing the appointing will be removed.  All of the other appointments are made following nomination or an election by various bodies.  Let this be made crystal clear by removing the Government element from the appointments which are elective or made by outside bodies.  The Government should certainly appoint their own members, whatever number it should be. I shall come back to this point in a few moments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1359" /> I would like to point out that the National University of Ireland, established in 1908 following agreement between the Irish Parliament Party and the British Liberal Party &mdash; one party totally departed and the other somewhat diminished in status &mdash; and the Irish hierarchy &mdash; quite undiminished in status &mdash; made a number of provisions.  For example, provision was made for the academic staff to be represented on a reasonable scale.  Indeed, it has to be said that in the Senate of the National University apart from the four Government nominees out of a total membership of 35 there are no other nominees from outside the system itself.  All of the others come from within the system.</P>
    <P>What is now being proposed is that this university be left with a structure under which 17 of the 23 members would not come from within the institution but be imposed from outside by the Government or various outside bodies.  That is extraordinary retrogression, unintentional I accept because I am sure the Minister would have wished to have a more appropriate structure.  What I am suggesting is that we make a gesture and remove the Government role in appointments, other than in relation to the ones they make themselves, and modify the ratio of Government appointments to academic appointments.</P>
    <P>I am proposing, therefore, an amendment that the number of Government appointments be reduced to four, which was regarded as adequate by the British Government in 1908 for the National University of Ireland, from a figure of nine at present and that the number of academic appointments be increased to eight.  Eight out of 23 is a very low ratio. No one in 1908 would have thought this number adequate.</P>
    <P>I do not want to attempt to disturb the structure too much or start unnecessary arguments.  A number of bodies have nominating powers.  If one were to raise that issue now we would never get finished. Therefore, I am confining myself to proposing two amendments, the first <Col N="1360" /> of which proposes that we remove the role of the Government in relation to appointments other than in relation to the appointment of their own nominees. Secondly, I ask the Minister to consider a change in the ratio between Government nominees and the academic nominees to bring it nearer what it should be for a modern institution in the 20th century.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider these two amendments.  They are quite simple and would, I think, be greeted with enthusiasm in the universities in question and by the whole university sector.  They would bring things a little nearer to what they might be.  We will have to leave to future legislation an adequate university structure which we cannot hope to deal with in this brief debate today.  I hope the Minister will take account of these two modest amendments which I hope have been circulated by now, neither of which would disturb the overall structure of the Bill in question.</P>
    <P>Let me give another example to show how this legislation is a step backwards. Reference has been made to the 1980 legislation but in 1908 the British Government thought it appropriate to say that one of the Government nominees should be a woman.  In 1980 a Fianna Fáil Government were not even prepared to make that concession.  This shows how far back we had gone in 72 years. However, this is a matter which can be dealt with pending the introduction of an adequate structure.  I will be very surprised if the Minister does not appoint at least one woman when she comes to making her appointments.  Therefore, I doubt if the defect in the legislation to which I am referring would have any great practical effect.  I think we can rely on the Minister to ensure this.  Nevertheless, I urge that she should not allow this matter to be put on one side.</P>
    <P>Having created the universities, modified the structures so that they are seen to be independent by people outside this country, having seen to it that the Government have only an appropriate limited role and not a total role in the appointments as it would appear <i>prima facie</i> to people outside from the 1980 <Col N="1361" /> legislation, and having modified the ratio between academic and Government appointments, I hope she will come back to this subject and bring in legislation to establish appropriate structures for these two universities.  They deserve it.  The work they have done and the stage they have reached is such that they do not need tutelage by Government which was thought appropriate in 1980.  Even at that time I thought it excessive but I will not go back over that matter now.  To have a university whose entire governing body would be appointed by the Government would lack a certain credibility.  I hope the Minister will be able to take those two points on board.  I do not want to detain the House any longer.  The less time we take the more we can get through today.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to take part in this debate which I regard as a very historic one.  It is 81 years since a new university was established.  This is of great significance. It is a great pity that we cannot have a full debate on these Bills, on university education generally and on the place of the universities and third level education.  There are only 55 minutes left and we are speaking under the shadow of a general election which may or may not take place.  We are speaking in the middle of a constitutional crisis which a number of Members of this House quite properly tried to raise here but they were unable to do so.  Today the Government went to the High Court virtually asking for permission to hold a general election. They were told by the High Court that &ldquo;we have nothing to add to what we have already said&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, therefore, a great pity that there should be such an attenuated debate in which few, if any, Members of this House can have any interest because of what is going on about us and because of the constitutional chaos in which we have now been put.  I emphasise the 81 years because it is an extraordinary interval to elapse before the establishment of only <Col N="1362" /> the second and third universities this century. For that reason it is of enormous significance.</P>
    <P>It is with great personal satisfaction that I see the NIHE in Limerick being transformed by this legislation into a university. I have memories of it from the start.  Indeed, one of my first political activities on my own behalf as opposed to on behalf of others was to appear at meetings during my own by-election in 1968 to try to defend the concept of the NIHE which was then being proposed. I was young and timorous and, I must confess, frightened because I found myself at many of those large meetings almost in a minority of one.  Virtually nobody would agree with me on what was wanted.  It was believed to be what was known at that time as a traditional university. I recall one lady upbraiding me that nothing was worthwhile unless it had the only three faculties which counted. When I asked her what these were she told me they were medicine, law and dentistry.  Anyone who did anything else was not a gentleman and she would not have her sons going to a glorified technical school as proposed at that time by Deputy Brian Lenihan.</P>

      <P>I found it difficult at times to sustain the volume of opposition but I am delighted to stand in this House 21 years later precisely to say there is now universal acceptance, not just in Limerick and Dublin but throughout the country, of the wisdom of this concept. There is universal admiration for the way it has worked and a recognition of the valuable contribution it has made, not just regionally but nationally and internationally. What is happening today is a proper consummation of the process and I am very happy to see it come about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new university was kind enough to send to Deputies within the past week or so details of their present courses and on recent developments.  While I was aware of most of them, nevertheless it is valuable to have them set out in this fashion. <Col N="1363" /> When we look at the relevance of the courses on the list one is struck by how valuable and how useful it is.  When they describe what they call the new developments in 1989 we see how valuable they are.  The new developments this year are the introduction of a master's degree in Japanese studies and a bachelor's degree in aircraft engineering.  We are now heading into a period when the Pacific Basin &mdash; probably within the next 20 or 30 years &mdash; will outstrip Europe and the Atlantic Basin as the more important centre of the world, economically at least; it is great to see a third level institution responding to that and to the importance of Japan and Japanese studies as regularly as the NIHE in Limerick have.</P>
    <P>It is good to see that a chair in aircraft engineering has been sponsored this year by GPA who are now one of the most important Irish companies and the world leader in their field.  It is indicative of the good relationship which has first been achieved in Limerick &mdash; and hopefully will be achieved elsewhere &mdash; between industry and the academic world.  I have not seen it achieved more successfully anywhere in Ireland &mdash; and perhaps few places in Europe &mdash; than in Limerick. The campus there is an outstanding example of what we want towards the end of the 20th century.  It is a magnificent campus of 500 or 600 acres on which there is a vast technological industry in which approaching 7,000 people are employed either in academic or industrial pursuits. The combination is very valuable.  The site is beautiful, indeed magnificent, and the envy of many universities throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The College of Engineering and Science there is the largest in the country and the College of Business is the second largest and hugely important.  The graduates are in extraordinary demand, even at a time of high unemployment, which is the case at present, and 97 per cent of them are placed within six months of their graduation.  Indeed as a Deputy for Limerick I have had, several times, the <Col N="1364" /> difficulty of trying to persuade undergraudate students who were on co-operative education in factories in different parts of the country to return to their studies and to graduate because they were so well thought of, even in their second and third years as undergraduates, they were offered very large and &mdash; to an undergraduate &mdash; tempting sums of money to stay in permanent employment where they were and not to finish their studies.  The eagerness with which they have been snapped up both at home and abroad is something that marks this institution and much the same can be said of the Dublin institution.</P>
    <P>Great credit is due to those who have brought the institution of Limerick to the standing it has nationally and internationally today, which has directly led to the recommendations of the commission and to this Bill.  One of course has to particularly identify Dr. Edward Walsh, the director, and now the incoming president of the university, who has been there from the start and who has shown enormous dedication, determination, skill and ability of lift the institution to the heights which it has achieved.  The same applies to many other members of the staff who have been there since its opening day.</P>
    <P>On a personal note, it is a happy coincidence that the Bill was introduced today by the Minister for Education because it was her brother, about whom we are happily hearing good news, who started it all off as Minister for Education back in 1968.  Just after he had succeeded in that office he and a certain celebrated relative of mine &mdash; I recall meeting the two of them in Limerick when Donogh was Minister for Education &mdash; were trying to sell the concept of this kind of education.  I recall in particular an incident where Donogh brought Brian Lenihan into the Brazen Head in Limerick for what is called in the best circles light refreshments.  They approached the counter, Brian produced a ten shilling note and Donogh informed the barman that it was not legal tender as Lenihan had been trying to buy a drink for five years with the same ten shilling note.</P>

      <P>If he can hear me in Rochester, Minnesota, I am sure he will enjoy the story and if Donogh can hear me somewhere else I am sure he will too. Those days of the late sixties remind me of the last efforts made to rationalise university education here, particularly in the city of Dublin.  Unfortunately, nothing has come of that in the last 20 years and it is time to draw attention to the amount of duplication which still exists.  A certain amount was done in the late sixties but nothing has been done in that direction since.  The need to do it because of Exchequer constraints is huge, the need in particular to rationalise faculties where there is a huge surplus of graduates in areas where they will not have any scope whatever within this country is obvious and I would love to see that done.  In this city there are three medical schools which produce perhaps 300 more doctors per annum than we need, and I wonder how one justifies that. There is a large number of law schools, university and professional, producing huge numbers of people who are surplus to our needs.  Unfortunately there has not been a great tradition in this country of qualified lawyers not practising, which is a great pity.  There is now an outlet for them in London, even though they are not qualified there, but the demand is so high that they are able to walk into jobs at £30,000 a year which of course was quite impossible up to even two or three years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should look at these matters.  It is a pity in one way that these two institutions have to be taken in isolation but in another way I am very glad that they are because if we got into trying to update the whole NUI legislation and university legislation generally here, we would be at it for years and it would never be done. I fully approve of the manner in which these two Bills were brought forward. They are minimalist Bills and that is the <Col N="1366" /> right approach.  It is certainly the appropriate approach given the huge constitutional cloud under which we are lingering at the moment and the fact that this House &mdash; we are told &mdash; will have expired within an hour or two of the very moment at which I speak.</P>
    <P>One of the things I should briefly draw attention to is that, as far back as 1978, 11 years ago, a constitutional referendum was passed to enable all universities and third level institutions to be put on an equal and common footing in regard to one matter in particular, voting in Seanad elections.  I do not think that voting in a Seanad election is very important as I am not a great admirer of the Seanad. However, it is indicative of the inability to make progress over the past 11 years that no legislation has been brought forward on that topic.  More importantly, until today, no legislation has been brought forward, in regard to third level institutions.  I do not think the existing National University set-up should be retained.  I do not think it is satisfactory. The colleges within the NUI should be given an option as to what they want to do.  When the Act I referred to was passed there were very small Queens Colleges scattered around the country but they are now very substantial universities in themselves.  I do not think the NUI structure is important any longer.</P>
    <P>One would like to have the opportunity to talk on university and third level financing.  For example, one would like to have the opportunity to talk on the fee structure and the grant structure which gives rise to huge difficulties.  One would like to have the opportunity to promote, as I would wish, the idea of loans to students within third level institutions in order to try to take some of the burden from the State while, at the same time, making some more money, which is so badly needed, available to third level institutions.</P>
    <P>I listened to what Deputy FitzGerald had to say about the governing bodies of these institutions and I agree with him but I am not going to get involved in amendments today.  This is the type of <Col N="1367" /> Bill that one either takes or leaves.  Obviously, as Deputy FitzGerald pointed out, it is not desirable that virtually all the members of the governing bodies of the two new universities should be appointed by the Government.  There should be some reasonable academic representation and some reasonable degree of independence in these respects.</P>
    <P>Apart from whatever reservations one might have about details, it is nonetheless an outstanding day for my city. It is an outstanding day for Irish education. This Dáil has been an unusual Dáil.  It has done things that no other Dáil could have attempted.  It has, for example, consistently produced majorities well in excess of 100 for the Government of the day who were only elected on the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle and, subsequently, lost the support of two of the Members who voted for them.  They were the most minority Government of all time with the greatest majority of all time.  It was a very up and down Dáil.</P>

I am delighted to lend my support to the Bill, to express my confidence that it will pass through the House today and that it will pass through the Seanad next week.  I am delighted it will be signed by the President the week after and what has been dreamed of by many generations will have been achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the other speakers.  As the spokesperson for the Labour Party on Education I welcome <Col N="1368" /> the two Bills.  In welcoming them I congratulate the students of both institutions, all the staff who worked in any capacity in them, the parents and the communities they serve.  I should like to congratulate those who have led the battle for recognition which these Bills represent.  The order of the people I congratulated was not accidental.  Universities belong in society.  Their primary function is to serve their society well.</P>
      <P>The very definition of university, <i>universitas</i>, raises a number of issues of itself. For example, there is the inevitable implication of the continuity of thought, the pedagogic tradition and the necessity for research.  There is another criterion, that of relevance to a sector of the economy. On Committee Stage I will be moving amendments one of which will seek to correct what I feel is a limitation on the university.  One amendment will relate to the word &ldquo;business&rdquo;, an unfortunate usage on page three of the Bill setting up the University of Limerick. The word &ldquo;economy&rdquo; is not used.  One is not talking about the larger world of industry in using the word &ldquo;business&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest I be misconstrued, I should like to declare that I welcome the two Bills and congratulate everybody associated with them on what the Bills will make possible.  I disagree with Deputy Fitz-Gerald's statement that the universities were &ldquo;starting&rdquo;.  I would not have used the word &ldquo;starting&rdquo;.  The institutions have evolved, they have passed a level of achievement which is being called something else today.  It is wrong to see them as starting.  They have made their case on the basis of very considerable achievements. I want these universities to be full universities in the best and broadest sense.  I want them, therefore, to be untrammelled by any kind of inhibition which a university in its fullest sense might acquire.  It is in that sense that I have tabled an amendment dealing with the status of the academic council.  In any university the role of the academic council is crucial.  As I read the Bill I see it as deriving itself from the governing body but if we are to speak about a university being a community of scholarship <Col N="1369" /> then it must be derived generically.  I am supported in my view about the academic council by the international review group which spoke of that council as the second most important institution within the university.</P>
    <P>The next point is a very important one to me.  As a person who has worked in four universities &mdash; one in Ireland, two in the United States and one in England &mdash; I am convinced that universities have at the end of the 20th century to be more democratically structured.  In that regard I agree in a minor way with what Deputy O'Malley had to say.  Is there any case for excluding the representation of students? Of course there is not.  A university should be a community of intellectual activity, a community of relationships, of practical work and so on.</P>
    <P>My next point is an important one in relation to the definition of these universities because they are not the same. I have looked at them very carefully.  I should like to thank the new University of Limerick for the facts sheet they sent me.  The historical review they gave, which was invaluable, was fascinating.  It is their right to be proud of the history of achievement, of the struggle to come to this point.  However, I note from the document a rather proud assertion of lack of dependence on the State.  That is where Deputy O'Malley and I differ.  A university has to be in a critical relationship to its society.  We had useful lists on history today from the Minister and in the facts sheet from Limerick.  In my view the universities have not served any fashion or fetish of the day.  They have all perished in the historical review in that they have served a declining elite. In that regard I was very interested to compare the structures proposed for these universities with the developments that have taken place at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  One of the most significant developments that has taken place there in the last five years has been that it has recognised the social sciences as full sciences and, in the case of its applied sciences, it is teaching both the history of science and the philosophy and logic of science.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1370" /> This makes a very important point in regard to a comment made by the Minister. Anybody who would argue that universities should serve in a narrow neoutilitarian way, having a simple relationship with business and avoiding at all costs any concept of State funding, is to my mind ploughing a narrow and very limited furrow in relation to the future of the university tradition.  I make this observation as a friend of the new University of Limerick and as somebody who wishes it well.  As I said, this is referred to in two lines in three documents, which I appreciate.  Indeed, the documents I referred to cover an enormous range of issues.</P>
    <P>There is another side to my argument. Does this mean that an academic critical ability can be construed as some kind of licence for irrelevancy?  Of course it cannot and should not be construed as such and should not be practised as such either.  What I am saying is that the good side of the argument is that many new, innovative and relevant things are included in this list.  These are impressive and obviously the students are being taught by dedicated staff and supported by even more dedicated people who make universities possible.</P>
    <P>I am coming to the end of my 20th year in a university and I want to say that it is when I have experienced élitism that I have found universities to be at their worst.  As a university lecturer who founded the teaching section of the Federated Workers' Union of Ireland I, as a working intellectual, was proud to be in the same trade union as the people who cut the grass, cleaned the university and worked in the laboratories, and that is still my view.</P>
    <P>I have some more comments to make concerning the entire concept of universities. I wish I had more time &mdash; I hope I will have it if events, constitutional and neo-constitutional, take place &mdash; to develop some other aspects.  From my experience in this House and in the Seanad, when people speak of the history of education they speak of educational institutions sometimes almost as a substitute for the history of learning.  These <Col N="1371" /> are not the same.  It is a very limited view to regard an institution of learning as learning itself.  I welcome these two Bills and I look forward to some Minister in the future introducing something we should have had long ago, a university of the air or a university of the skies &mdash; the development and extension of education, second chance education and so forth. I am sure Members on all sides would welcome such developments.</P>
    <P>I believe universities are judged in terms of their contribution to the overall developmental capacity of students.  I looked through the list in this historic review and took detailed notes of the Minister's speech.  As I listened to the evolution of the institutions, I reflected on the institutions which were named. Institutions like anything else, no matter what status they have, are caught in a nexus between science and technology and society.  That interconnection is not accidental.  Anybody half literate in the history of science knows that at the end of the 19th century there was an immense battle as to who should control the Royal Institute &mdash; whether it should be the approving landowners or the new business class.  The issue of power in society affected both science and technology and still affects them at a global level.</P>
    <P>This raises the further question whether institutions can serve one master only.  Institutions which have the status of universities have an enormous responsibility to society as a whole and their responsibility should be to the developmental capacity of every child. It would be a very serious diminution, should it happen in the future in any institution &mdash; and I am not referring only to the two institutions which are being discussed here today &mdash; if the day came when these institutions were privatised to the point Deputy O'Malley seems to want, where what went on became defined as the university rather than their contribution to society as a whole.  The scandal is that the PAYE worker has the opportunity, in a wonderful democratic fashion, of paying somewhere between 75 and 80 per cent of all taxes but has <Col N="1372" /> only one-thirty-seventh of the chance of a professional person of seeing his child complete a university education.  There has been enough élitism in third level education and what we need in future is more, and not less, State support for universities so that they can be moved to serve what we are supposed to serve in a place which calls itself a republic, as many people as possible who will have access to an institution which is as genuinely democratic as possible.</P>
    <P>I often ask myself what are we trying to encourage in third level institutions. Is it to unleash some kind of individual ambition?  What is excellence after all?  I have read as much as anybody on the history of universities.  There was a time when excellence included a social component rather than being defined as individual, aggressive, acquisitive, narrow greed.  This is a lecture I would hope to give when we are discussing the National University of Ireland.  As has been said, this is minimalist legislation.  I welcome it but I do not want it to have to carry the burden of larger arguments which I hope to make in the future, and which I have made publicly.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day there is &mdash; and it is time people stopped apologising for this &mdash; a big debate going on about the philosophy of education.  What are we about in education?  We are divided on this and a very large number of people support a philosophy of meritocratic individualism. These are like tawny frogs &mdash; why do those poor creatures which swim around in the mud in a pond put up with their existence just because one day one of their number will find his jaws distended, leap to land and become a frog? That is meritocratic individualism.  There are many of us who believe in the opposite, egalitarianism.  In the history of ecucation there is not a whit of proof to suggest that the people who worked within an egalitarian philosophy did not achieve more.  Historically they contributed more, changed societies, built genuine republics and democratic institutions. The meritocratic individualists and their offspring were the tyrants, including the new commercial tyrants <Col N="1373" /> which we speak of.  Let us not fudge this issue.</P>
    <P>I wish these institutions well within an ethos of egalitarianism rather than within the barren, hopeless shores of meritocratic individualism and servitude to one aspect of performance in society.  For that reason I will be insisting that my amendment which slaps the word &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; alongside the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; will be accepted on Committee Stage.  This will make us realise, as the Government have realised, that the performance of people in an economy and the world of work involves the organised workers, the Government and the private business sector.  If people want to use the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; they will have to use the words &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; and the other words also. They could have chosen the word &ldquo;economic&rdquo; but they did not and we have to rectify this.</P>
    <P>At one stage I was indirectly involved in the case of the Limerick institute which I knew better than Dublin but with which I have become more familiar in recent years.  I am delighted that Limerick has achieved university status.  The International Study Group, established in 1985, which reported in 1987, advanced unanswerable arguments.  I am delighted there has not been too much delay in responding to those arguments.  When the Minister approached me about the suggestion that we have this quick legislation so as to enable people to benefit from the new status I told her immediately that she would have the co-operation of myself and my party in that regard.</P>
    <P>I wanted to make these points because I believe they are important.  However, I shall conclude because I think there are other speakers who may want to make a few points.  However, I will list some points which are very important.  I have said already that there are questions which have to be answered in the Minister's reply.  One is: what now happens to the National Council of Education Awards and what are the knock-on effects in terms of the relationship of the council to the RTCs and to the different VEC colleges?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> There is also the question of the inner structure of the new university.  The point has been made, and I support it, that number seven in my test of university is its internal democracy, the question of the independence of the academic council. Here it would appear to me there is a flaw in the drafting of the Bill in relation to functions in that, on page 3 there are a number of different purposes specified. This is in relation to section 3 which we can look at again.  For example, section 3 (a) stresses the pursuit of learning as a main objective.  I ask: why are these objectives not separated from the functions which follow?  Then again, one may well ask: what is the relationship of these functions to the enabling provision which succeeds it farther down the page?  There is great difficulty in relation to that.</P>
    <P>Finally there is the overall issue of consultation and participation within the university itself.  It seems that the question is not only about the academic council. There is also the question of distance from ministerial authority.  That point has already been made.  The Minister may say &mdash; and it has been said &mdash; that no Minister who was sensible would interfere with an appointment.  If that is the case, the power is redundant or eliminated. If it is not redundant, is the abuse not possible?</P>
    <P>I shall have an opportunity on Committee Stage of going into some detail in relation to a number of the points I wish to make.  I hope these universities will continue to function well.  I wish them every success.  I hope the remarks I have made will instigate a debate, not in these two institutions, but I am merely availing of this occasion to say I hope we shall have a fuller opportunity of debating third level education in general very shortly after the events of the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>The Workers' Party totally support this Bill although being somewhat disappointed with the title.  I would not like to see DCU, UCD and DU all over Dublin.  Surely something better could have been thought of, such as, for example, the New University of Leinster or something different from Dublin City University.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed also that the legislation is absolutely minimal.  It merely creates two universities and does not address third-level education at all or any other important issues Deputies have raised in relation to higher education. There is no difficulty in creating two universities. That is merely a <i>de jure</i> recognition of a <i>de facto</i> situation.  The academic standards of both institutions are high both in regard to teaching and research which places in them in very high demand.  Few would argue that they are not of university standard, that is apart from some of the people in the older universities and the excellent Nuala O'Faoláin who wrote a brilliant article in relation to that matter.  Nonetheless I do not think there is any serious argument to the effect that they are not of university standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since inception both colleges have moved some distance from their original purpose, the college in Limerick devoting their activities to certificate, diploma and degree level courses while Dublin was originally conceived as devoting its activities to the higher level work of the Dublin VEC colleges.  The Dublin Institute of <Col N="1377" /> Technology and the RTCs are carrying out most of this work extremely well. But, in terms of finance, facilities, space, equipment, library accommodation and so on, they are a very poor relation in the higher education area.</P>
    <P>I should like to make the point about the Dublin Institute of Technology and the RTCs, that they do undertake some degree level and post-graduate work but their statutory and administrative bases are essentially oriented toward second level which causes them great difficulty in pursuing research and consultancy activities.  Perhaps some legislation could be introduced to amend that position. Having said that, it is crucial that the Dublin Institute of Technology and the RTCs do not drift away from their primary purpose merely for the sake of the prestige of having degree level courses. In the Dublin area in particular, the Clancy report made it very clear that there is a crying need for short cycle courses at third level.  I do not need to remind the House of the findings of the Clancy report &mdash; that Dublin, with 19.9 per cent, has the distinction of having the lowest rate of admissions of any county in Ireland despite having far more third level places than elsewhere in the country.  Indeed I believe the grants available constitute a significant factor in that low level of admission rates in Dublin.  I would remind the Minister of a statement she made in reply to a question from me on 15 February last &mdash; Official Report, Column 340 &mdash; in which she said:</P>
    <P>The level of grant applicable is another factor and there has been growing concern at the preponderance of children of self-employed people receiving third level grants to the alleged detriment of PAYE workers' children.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of this fact and I think it is essential to sort that out.</P>
    <P>I do not think other third level institutions should measure themselves by how close they come to being universities. They should do their own thing, pursue excellence in their own right and on their own terms do the job they were <Col N="1378" /> intended to do and be properly funded to allow them to do this.  The last point I would like to make is that we should now congratulate all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is a happy and historic occasion, not only for Limerick and the mid-west but also for education in general.  I welcome the Bill before this House.  The five Deputies from Limerick East and, indeed, all the Deputies from the mid-west are fortunate to be public representatives at this time because when the time comes to write the story of the long and sometimes lonely mission to establish a university in Limerick, today's contribution &mdash; the latter part particularly &mdash; will find a place in our history <Col N="1379" /> books.  It is important that we establish that from the outset.</P>
      <P>It is a long time ago since a deputation left Limerick in 1845 led by the Mayor of the city to go to see Sir Robert Peel in London and to request that one of the new proposed Queen's colleges, to be established at that time, would be established in Limerick.  Unfortunately, the request was not granted and Queen's colleges were then set up in Cork, Galway and Belfast.  But the demand for a university for Limerick did not founder and continued on for more than a century. After 100 years or so, in 1959 the Limerick University project committee was set up in that city.  The rest of the story is modern and is known to most Deputies in this House.  As it has already been touched on by other contributors to the debate it would be very weary and repetitive of me to go over that ground so I will skip it.</P>
      <P>The choice of location of Plassey House, beside the River Shannon, was an ideal and excellent location as Deputy O'Malley has said.  We are fortunate that Plassey House was not burned down by some of our so-called patriots who burned down Mountshannon House, the Hermitage at Castleconnell and, indeed, many other fine houses in County Limerick close to Plassey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>NIHE was then created as a technological institution with a national as well as a regional perspective.  Its establishment followed changes in the economy with a move towards free trade and a more open economy.  These changes were also a boost towards our entry into the European Economic Community. This also led to the setting up of AnCO &mdash; later to be known as FAS &mdash; in the regional technical colleges.  These changes in our education and training were brought about by the changed economic climate which needed workers to prepare themselves for the increased skills demanded in the workplace in the new conditions.  There is no mystery whatsoever or no miracle about the setting up of NIHE.  It was done for good economic reasons.  A technological education <Col N="1380" /> should give a full and broad knowledge of the most modern, relevant, scientific and commercial principles.  I emphasise the words &ldquo;full and broad&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, I do not have time to give a detailed analysis of all the courses which are available in NIHE.  I would like to talk about them at length but I will have to skip that part also.</P>
    <P>As I live in Limerick I am well aware of the good solid results achieved by NIHE over the years but a university for the future must do even better than the past. One of the objectives of technological education should be to solve problems, human and industrial, in our society. NIHE's record is quite good in finding employment at home and abroad for graduates in native Irish companies and in multinational companies but this achievement is not good enough.  The new university much have broader and more ambitious objectives.  It must begin to help solve the problems of unemployment, emigration and poverty which are so rampant in our society.</P>
    <P>Not enough money is being spent &mdash; I think everyone in this House would agree &mdash; by companies, Irish and multinational, in technology in terms of research and development.  That is an area in which the university could play a key role.  With the help and encouragement of the Minister and the Government there is no reason it should not do so.  If only a fraction of the money which is going out of the country by way of the so called black hole &mdash; the profits of multinationals &mdash; was spent on research and development what a transformation could be brought about in employment and job creation in this country.  As I have said I welcome the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just one other point and I will finish then.  I would like to sound a few warning notes.  The University of Limerick must be a properly instituted university and not some sort of second class institution.  It has also been <Col N="1381" /> said by some people that many universities polish stones and dull diamonds. I would hope that our new university in Limerick would not be one of those, that it will turn out to be a different kind of institution.  The new university must have no Government or ministerial intervention. It must be internally democratic and the Limerick staff and other staff concerned and the students must be allowed to play a full part in the decision making of the university.</P>
      <P>I intended saying much more but I will confine myself to saying that I hope also the the new university will not re-enforce social inequalities in our society but that it will play a greater role in Limerick life.  I would also like to see the workers' education centre restored there.  I wish I had more time to speak on this Bill.  I am sorry I have had to truncate my remarks to a rather garbled short account.  I welcome the Bill and I hope it transforms education in technology not only in Limerick and the mid-west but in the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>As I have only two and a half minutes I must be brief.  I unreservedly welcome this very necessary legislation.  Deputy O'Malley made the point that the time given for the debate is short but if the time is short, in the context of what is happening, at least this legislation represents the culmination of a campaign of respectable antiquity which began, apparently, in 1845.  As Deputy Kemmy, Deputy O'Malley and others have said, this is a proud day for Limerick.  In saying that I do not grudge our friends in Dublin what they have achieved but I am here today to speak more specifically for Limerick.  I thank the Minister for the tenacity and the determination she has displayed in getting this matter through the Civil Service and through the Cabinet, bringing it into this House and ensuring that it became law within the lifetime of this Dáil.</P>
      <P>We could not have arrived at the position we are at today without the sheer determination, the doggedness, the political astuteness and knowhow of one man and that is the President of the new University of Limerick, Dr. Edward Walsh.  Dr. Walsh was supported by a very able team.  I should like to mention in particular a former member of the Oireachtas, Professor Noel Mulcahy, Dean of Science and Engineering who with others, from humble beginnings, in 1972 when the first 100 students were taken into the campus, built the college of engineering to be the largest college of engineering in the country and, if I may say so, the most successful also.  I will not insult the Minister if I say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The legislation is not only in the interest of <Col N="1383" /> Limerick and the mid-west region but of the country as a whole.  From humble beginnings in 1972, the college has arrived at this stage and I know the University of Limerick will go from strength to strength.</P>

I know that you, Sir, join with me in congratulating the Minister because both of us represent the constituency where the NIHE, Glasnevin, is located.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister because from the outset she showed a tremendous interest in achieving what she has achieved today &mdash; that the status of university would be conferred on the NIHE in Glasnevin. In particular, I would like to thank Dr. Danny O'Hare the director of NIHE because he has done a tremendous amount of work for the students and for the college.  Indeed, the pressure that Dr. O'Hare put on us meant that we, in turn, put pressure on the Minister.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the courtesy and co-operation she has shown to me when I was making representations to her and indeed on the occasion she invited me to her office to discuss the matter.  I am delighted for Dr. O'Hare and his staff and, indeed, for the students.  I know that all the people of the area are delighted that we have a university.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I thank the Minister for giving me the two minutes.  I welcome the establishment of <Col N="1384" /> the University of Limerick.  I thank the Minister for bringing this matter to a conclusion, but I think I should note also the work done by her predecessors, Deputy Cooney and Deputy Hussey, who did all the preparatory work, putting the international validation committee in place which recommended university status for the college, when they were Ministers for Education.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay tribute to the staff of the college and in particular to the president, Dr. Walsh, to the chairman and members of the board who not only presided over the growth of the college but have established a university which already has a very good national and international reputation.  I must declare my interest &mdash; my eldest daughter is a student at the University of Limerick.  I am sure that people in the region and nationally will remember this day, and not because the Dáil was dissolved thus starting the general election campaign. When the hussle and bustle of the hustings is behind us, this day will be remembered in Limerick as the day on which the University of Limerick was founded.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to have a look at the position of Thomond College at some future time.  Thomond College and the University of Limerick share the same campus and a situation is emerging where there are two boards of management, two chairpersons, two bureaucracies and there will be two validation procedures all on the one campus.  The demographic projections for the nineties suggest that fewer teachers will be trained in the physical education, metalwork or in the rural science divisions of Thomond College and it seems to me that Thomond College will have decreasing numbers.  I think the Minister should at some future date &mdash; I know she cannot do it today &mdash; consider opening discussions with a view to integrating Thomond College, as a separate department, within the remit of the University of Limerick&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>First, may I thank you, Sir, for your indulgence and the way in which you permitted the debate to develop beyond the time appointed.  It was in keeping with the topic.  It seems to me that I will have to get a university in Athlone &mdash; it is very much up our side. That is how it should be.  Everybody feels very proud, particularly the Deputies who represent the constituencies where the new universities are sited.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who have contributed, Deputy Birmingham representing the Fine Gael Party and Deputy Garret FitzGerald, Deputy Des O'Malley for the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Michael D. Higgins for the Labour Pary and Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla representing The Workers' Party, Deputy Jim Kemmy representing his inimitable self and his party.  Deputy O'Dea from Limerick spoke, representing himself and, of course Fianna Fáil as well as Deputy Michael Barrett from the constituency where the Dublin City University is situated and Deputy Michael Noonan from the constituency of Limerick.  I think it augurs well for the tenor of the debate that so many people took part and indeed were obviously brimming over with more to say than they were able to say in the time allotted to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with some of the matters that arose in the course of Second Stage debate.  Deputy Birmingham gave it a very fine welcome and in the course of his contribution other ideas were opened up as to the role and status of the remaining recommendations of the report on the Technological Commission.  As I have said many times in the House, the <Col N="1386" /> Government will engage their attention in the future deliberations of that report and indeed we have made much progress in the preparation of legislation in my Department.  As Deputies may know, there is an interdepartmental committee sitting on the question of third level institutions, which was mooted previously, and we are awaiting the views of that committee.  However, I am also working on forthcoming legislation for the colleges.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased with Deputy Fitz-Gerald's welcome.  He spoke of the wider points of legislation which perhaps will arise in the NUI legislation.  As I have said publicly on many occasions, I await with great interest the deliberations of the NUI on their future role.  Coincidentally I had a meeting today with the NUI on a completely different matter between 2.30 p.m. and 3.30 p.m.  This meeting was arranged some four weeks ago, not to coincide with this debate but it just happened that way.  I was most interested to hear that they had given some perfunctory and early consideration to their own position with regard to future legislation and they were considering the various avenues along which they might travel.  Quite obviously they are thinking on this and perhaps the enactment of this legislation will facilitate fertile debate which I hope will end in much fruitful work.  Whether it will be myself or some other person, I am sure the Minister will look forward to hearing the NUI's views on how they might fit into the overall structures of university education.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald commented on the members of the governing body being Government appointments on the recommendation of the Minister.  Under section 5 as it stands, ten of the 23 ordinary members of the governing body to be appointed by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister are, in fact, nominated by interests outside the Government.  As the Deputy may know, you accept the nominees put forward by those nominating bodies and I have never heard of anybody interfering with the nominations</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to this point in the amendment but I am just making a passing reference to it.  Deputy Des O'Malley has long connections with Limerick and with education.  He spoke in a most passionate and warm way about Limerick and the need for a university in Limerick, about where it is going, and how it had gone about its business.  I thank him for his support.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins spoke, as is his wont, with great feeling about the whole concept of a university and what it should mean to people, to life, to social structures and to the philosophy of education. I would have welcomed a much longer contribution from him but time did not allow it.  He expressed his enthusiasm for the idea and asked particularly about the role of the NCEA in relation to the RTCs and the DIT.  It will not be affected by this legislation.  It will continue in its present role under the NCEA legislation in regard to the validation of courses and the awarding of degrees, diplomas and certificates to students in all the VEC colleges.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla welcomed the Bill and spoke of how each third level institution develops it own ethos and role.  He did not want to see the new universities as in some way conforming with or aping another institution but rather developing their own rules and guidelines as regards what they teach and the courses of their work and disciplines.  I share many of these ideas.  He praised the role of the VEC third level sector and what they have done in this regard, and nobody would quarrel with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kemmy spoke of his long connections with the city on the Shannon. He welcomed the Bill in general and what had been done in particular.  He hoped that one of the tenets of this university would be work for the elimination of inequality.  Deputy O'Dea, who has always been to the forefront in requesting this legislation, welcomed it in a very broad and open way, as did Deputy Michael Barrett.  Both Deputies, and <Col N="1388" /> others, pursued me from time to time about this legislation and wanted to know when it would be introduced.  Deputy Michael Noonan likewise contributed.</P>
    <P>It is curious but very correct that democracy, as expressed by the people who sit in this House representing the cities and areas where these new institutions are to be set up, was at work in this case also.  The Deputies who have spoken in the main represent these constituencies and through them to the voice of the people working in these institutions and the areas they represent, has found its way to the floor of the House.  If we were looking for lessons in democracy and seeking to have the old precepts applied in a real sense, we have it here in the voices of the people who have spoken on this Bill.  I too would like to speak for so much longer.  I welcome the contributions to date.  I thank the Members of the House and you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for your indulgence in these matters.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 3, to delete &ldquo;business, professional, cultural&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;educational, business, professional, trade union, cultural&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for moving this amendment is that I am unhappy with the entire wording in terms of its drafting.  I will deal with the section in general later.  There is a fundamental problem in the objective of this paragraph having an unspecified relationship with the functions which follow.  In moving this amendment, it is perhaps the least unsatisfactory way out of listing the objectives.  In that sense it is very appropriate to put the word &ldquo;educational&rdquo; first and then if you want <Col N="1389" /> to retain the words &ldquo;business, professional&rdquo; and so on that is fine.  In the spirit of corporatism and tripartism which is now prevailing in this country, the words &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; should also be included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I anticipate that in the case of a number of the amendments the Minister will say she has gone as far as she can go at this stage while she may not close her mind to the idea of moving further in the future.  This is one amendment the Minister should be in a position to accept at this stage.  There is nothing offensive in it and there are implications that require consideration.  I will briefly explain what is involved here.</P>
      <P>This section provides that the role of the two new universities is the pursuit of learning and the advancement of knowledge. It then goes on to say how they are to do those things.  One of the ways is by co-operation with various outside bodies.  The Bill prescribes that they should co-operate with business and professional bodies and so on, and Deputy Higgins and I seek to add educational bodies and trade unions.  The case for cooperating with other educational bodies seems to be obvious.</P>
      <P>In relation to the trade unions, they are already playing a valuable role in third level education.  For example, there are a number of Chairs in the colleges which are now wholly or partly funded by the trade unions.  It would seem that, given the very close links that these universities have had with the world of industry and its work in the past, it would be entirely proper that the co-operation should extend to that area as well.</P>

I am glad to tell the House I have no difficulty whatsoever in accepting it and in extending the bodies with which the new universities would collaborate to include educational and trade union bodies.  Accordingly, I accept the amendment proposed by the two Deputies.</P>

      <P>This is self-evident.  It is perhaps only a drafting error.  Quite frankly, the use of the word &ldquo;Ard&rdquo; separated from the word &ldquo;Oideachas&rdquo;&mdash; without a hyphen &mdash; has an alternative instruction other than the combined &ldquo;Ard-Oideachas&rdquo;.  It is suggested simply for drafting elegance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>That has caused some anxiety within the NCEA and in circles close to it.  I would like the Minister to take the opportunity of reassuring people on this.  My understanding of what is envisaged is that there would be no bar to the sort of relationship that, say, Trinity has with some of the DIT colleges and some of the teacher training colleges. I would like the Minister to confirm that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Deputy's intervention.  The merit of the Committee Stage is that we can have a comprehensive debate and points can be cleared up.  There has been a degree of unease within the NCEA at what they saw as a deletion of their duties.  As the Deputy knows, any university &mdash; and we have looked into this very carefully &mdash; is enabled and empowered to seek linkages with other colleges and to confer degrees. What we envisage here is no more and no less than, as the Deputy said, the relationship between Trinity and DIT in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that everything be done to ensure the status of these institutions.  In no way should they be differentiated from or their status diminished <i>vis-à-vis</i> other universities in this State.  In the 1908 Act establishing the National University of Ireland the key clause about the powers of the university was: &ldquo;The university shall have powers&rdquo; to do certain things.  The first was to establish faculties in all such departments of knowledge as the university might from time to time be able to equip and maintain in such a manner as would encourage original research, promote scholarship and spread learning throughout the land.  The language is antique and perhaps orotund in the last phrase, but the crucial element in a university is encouraging research and promoting scholarship.  It is not a training institution, and I am afraid that in section 3 we have fallen into bad times.  There is no mention of research in the subheads. <Col N="1392" /> It is, of course, mentioned in the pursuit of learning and advancement of knowledge at the beginning through teaching research and so on.  When you come to the functions, to provide courses of study and instruction in such fields as the governing body may deem appropriate, there is a marked contrast between the NUI's position and that of the two new universities.</P>
      <P>I am not proposing amendments because we cannot get involved in that at this late stage.  However, I urge the Minister when she is creating the equivalent of a charter for these new universities to give to them the same status, the same role in the encouragement of research and promotion of scholarship as the NUI has, and not by the wording of their terms of reference in some way narrow them down to the mere business of giving courses of study and instruction as if they were some kind of glorified technical school.  The wording is unfortunate. Perhaps a lack of imagination somewhere in the Department is at fault. The Minister could do worse than look back to some of the inspiration that lay behind the 1908 Act and at least in due course, when she comes to bringing in new legislation in this respect and others, put the universities on a par with the NUI and, of course, with Dublin University.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the powers of the NUI is to institute professorships, and lectureships and any offices required by the university and to appoint and remove holders and so on, to appoint and remove presidents, professors and lecturers to the constituent colleges.  The power of the university to institute professorships and appoint people to them is crucial.  It is not a university if it does not have that power.  We are giving these bodies the name of universities; we are not giving them the powers essential to a university. I know and understand why and I am not blaming the Minister.  It is important to get this through now, but they must be put on a par with other universities and given the power to institute their own offices, subject to the control of this House, because the statutes of the NUI <Col N="1393" /> instituting professorships and lectureships have to be approved by this House.  I am not objecting to that, but the power to institute them and the power to appoint must be clearly in the hands of the university itself.  I urge, when we come to the final legislation, that reference be made to the 1908 Act.  It is not perfect.  I am sure it needs to be amended and there will be proposals to the NUI Senate for amendments to it in due course, but I hope we will not be amending away the good parts that give it the status of a genuine university with worldwide acceptance.  That is what we want for these two new universities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy FitzGerald.  This section is crucial.  Those of us who say we are in favour of university status want it to be full university status.  If that is so the questions mentioned here are very important.</P>
      <P>Let me deal with the drafting point first.  The opening paragraph says that &ldquo;the university shall have the following functions,&rdquo; and then it lists them.  Deputy FitzGerald has suggested the listing of the fields is narrow.  There should be at least a saving general clause to enable the university as a community of learning to establish its own realms of learning.  That would have helped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a problem in relation to the governing body.  Here again I am worried about the role of the academic council in coming to the conclusion, for example, that there is some matter it should want to move.  Then, how in the name of goodness does the last part of the section fit? It provides that &ldquo;The Minister may on the recommendation of the Governing Body after consultation with an tÚdarás Um Bórd Oideachas by order assign to the Institute such additional functions as the Minister thinks fit.&rdquo;  That is a very serious limitation.  It is limited twice over. It is limited four fold.  It is limited in relation to the range of matters specified and in relation to the governing body.  It is limited in terms of ministerial approval. Then there is this notion about these autonomous &mdash; and after today rightly very confident &mdash; university institutions <Col N="1394" /> that a Minister of the day may add a function.  It is not an answer to say no Minister will add something without the greatest consultation and all the rest of it. If you have confidence in the institutions you let them off in exactly the same way as the basic Acts of the universities.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy FitzGerald that our contribution to this debate establishes a basis of co-operation.  We want the best of the NUI and much more to be available to these universities.  The basic universities have provided something that is often forgotten by people who put in a list that is narrow and narrowly technological.  There is no technology without science and no science without a basic knowledge.  Basic knowledge has been provided by the NUI for a very long time, and I am thankful that today is one of the rare days that I did not hear the university sector, so-called, being criticised because it is traditional, which meant it provided the very bedrock knowledge which produced the scientists who produced the engineers who produced the applied knowledge and are modernising this economy.  That point is too often forgotten.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had here a certain indulgence into our connection, remote or immediate, with the two great universities here proposed.  As a founder-governor of NIHE Glasnevin and a constant admirer of NIHE, Limerick, I join in the joy.  I know of the limitations imposed on me in respect of being in order here in this House, accordingly I must be careful that I do not stray at all from what is proposed in section 3.  All I wish to express is my absolute confidence in the respective authorities that education will not be demeaned by equating it with a new form of capitalism, that what is regarded as relevant education will not be equated <Col N="1395" /> with something as a result of which one must earn a living.</P>
    <P>If we had more time I would make the point, referring to this section, that you could argue that the more irrelevant education is in the round the more beneficial it might be.  It is not a question of the preparation of a continuing line of people who as a result of their having savoured this great experience will now obtain for themselves what is commonly called a job.  Naturally, one must be very conscious that as a result of their educational pursuits they will have a special contribution to make, one facet of which will be the discharge of professional duties which will help them contribute to the lifestyle and the betterment of the people around them and whose money causes them to have such education.</P>
    <P>In short, on this section and in deference to what has been expressed by An Teachta Micheál O Higín and Deputy Garret FitzGerald faoí seo, I would like to sound a word of warning.  The whole <i>raison d'être</i> of education must not be lost in the perpetual challenges to make it productive of technology which can lead to the accumulation of wealth.  We should retain as far as possible that concept of education which is as old as the hills and which is most beneficial.  If there is any form of education which is perpetually relevant, it is to be found in the humanities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their interest and their response to this section.  Many of us here are humanities graduates of the NUI and we are <i>ad idem</i> with what has been said.  Because of the breadth of disciplines within the existing NIHEs the commission did not see it as <Col N="1396" /> appropriate that they should be called technological universities.  They thought the title should be much broader, as befitted the work and research being carried out within those institutions.  That was one of the points in their recommendations. To narrow the title down to &ldquo;technological&rdquo; would have been completely wrong in view of the scope and comprehensive nature of the disciplines within the colleges.</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald quoted the 1908 Act, including the words &ldquo;spread learning throughout the land&rdquo;.  He thought the language might seem flowery or archaic, but it is not.  The function of universities is to spread learning throughout the land and to other lands as well.</P>
      <P>Regarding the appointment of staff, the control of staff resting with the Minister relates only to numbers and grades, not to individuals.  That would be abhorrent and not at all acceptable.  Section 4 (1) (b) of the 1980 Act still stands and provides that the institutions may engage in research in such fields as the governing body would deem appropriate.  The NIHEs have a very proud record in this respect.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not reply on the issue of the academic council. She referred to the international review body who recommended that the academic council should be a parallel body.  There is the issue as to whether it has derived authority from the governing body and whether it is an academic council in the proper sense.  Will the Minister give an assurance that the academic council will be generally reflective of the academic workers within the institution?</P>

      <P>The Minister says her power is limited to numbers and grades, but that is precisely the matter which should be in the competence of the university.  Of course if it institutes posts it may require approval, or under the NUI system the approval of this House. The initiative must be a matter for the <Col N="1397" /> universities.  Of course there must be financial controls but the Minister might be more encouraging about the future autonomy of these bodies and putting them on a par with the existing universities.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2a:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;Section 5 of the Act of 1980 is hereby amended&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in subsection (4), by the deletion of the words &lsquo;the Government on the recommendation of&rsquo;;</P>
      <P>(b)  in paragraph (a) of subsection (4)&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  by the deletion of &lsquo;nine&rsquo; and the substitution therefor of &lsquo;four&rsquo;, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  by the deletion of &lsquo;on the recommendation of&rsquo; and the substitution therefor of &lsquo;by&rsquo;; and</P>
      <P>(c)  in paragraph (b) of subsection (4), by the deletion of &lsquo;three&rsquo; and the substitution therefor of &lsquo;eight&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment encapsulates two different concepts and I would have been happier if they had been kept separate.  I do not want to tie the Minister down by linking the two.  The separate concepts are that the role of the Government and the Minister should be confined to the direct appointments being made on the recommendation of the Minister and that the other appointments, whether by way of election or nomination by bodies, should be made directly.  The practical difference is small.  It would appear that the Minister would have to accept the appointments resulting from elections and nominations by certain bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this university is to have the full acceptance of institutions elsewhere it is <Col N="1398" /> very important that the Government's role should not appear to be greater than it is.  There is nothing to be gained by interposing the Minister and the Government between the bodies which elect and nominate and the actual legal implementation. It is in the old Act for reasons which I never understood.  The deletions proposed in my amendment would produce a wording which would have the same practical effect as that in the original Act, but from the point of view of anybody concerned about the role of the Government in this institution the position would become very much better.  It would provide that there would be 23 members and that the first members would be appointed by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister. After the expiration of the term of office of the first members of the governing body, the 23 ordinary members of that body would be appointed in the following manner: nine of them would be appointed by the Minister in accordance with the provisions of the section.  Three would be chosen by the academic staff. The Minister and the Government are taken out of the other appointments.  The Minister has no role.  If three people are elected by the academic staff the Minister has not the power to nominate them. What is the point of including the Minister and giving an impression of Government interference which does not exist?</P>
    <P>The two small changes I am suggesting to eliminate a few words would solve the whole problem.  I would ask the Minister to take a look at this.  Her officials may devise a more elegant way but this seems the simplest way to achieve the objective of creating a body which will be reasonably similar to other universities, where the Minister has power to appoint some members and the others are chosen by other means.</P>
    <P>A separate point which has been incorporated into a single amendment, which was not my original intention, is designed to modify the relative proportions nominated by the Minister and elected by the academic staff.  The proportions as proposed are totally out of line with what one would expect in any university.  In <Col N="1399" /> the NUI Senate there are four members nominated by the Government, one of whom shall be a woman &mdash; there were far-sighted legislators in 1908.  Then there are nominations coming from a number of sources, from graduates and from the academic council, of whom a certain minimum must be members of the academic staff.  The result is that in the NUI Senate there are no nominations by any outside body other than the Minister, thus giving the university clear autonomy. In this case the vast bulk of the nominations come from the Minister or outside bodies.  It should be looked at again.</P>
    <P>We should not treat universities as if they must be under such tutelage that outside bodies must nominate so many members.  This does not happen in the NUI.  Even in Queen's University, Belfast, in 1908 there were only two provisions for outside nominations by some curious bodies I never heard of before.  I suppose they must still exist for the purpose of nominating.  In the National University there were none.  I know we cannot go into this since the Minister is not changing the whole structure.  The one change she could make, as clear evidence of a will to demonstrate the autonomy of this body, her confidence in the academic staff and in its capacity to contribute to its own running, would be to modify the number of membership so the number she appointed would be the same as in the NUI.  Why does she need more control of these universities or more involvement in the NUI and of the academic staff.  Three out of 23 appointments is ludicrous; it would be ludicrous even in a second level institution and if they were governors of a school or something one would do better than that. I am only raising it to eight &mdash; I think the figure should be greater &mdash; because I do not want to suggest to the Minister that she should reduce her appointments to lower than the figure in the NUI which is a reasonable figure of four, and that the residue of those then are transferred over to the academic staff.  What emerges from that is not satisfactory.  It is not the kind <Col N="1400" /> of governing body a university should have, but we cannot do better than that today.  It is no good trying to play around with the thing any more than that.  This is a very small change.  If the Minister could bring herself to make it she would at least demonstrate to the two institutions concerned that she has the confidence and trust in them which the Government have in the NUI.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has similar appointments in Dublin University but that is a more antique body; at least she would put these universities on a par with the NUI.  I would suggest these two separate points.  They are incorporated in one amendment.  I am quite prepared to accept it if the Minister takes them separately.  If she is of a mind to accept one and not the other then on Report Stage a bit of redrafting would achieve that but I would hope she would accept both of them as a demonstration of her concern to give these bodies the kind of status they should have, a status equivalent to that of the NUI and Dublin University.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot agree entirely with Deputy FitzGerald on this, <i>tempora mutanter.</i>  What would have been relevant at the beginning of the century might not necessarily be relevant now in circumstances where the complete funding of university education comes from the taxpayer and I do not see why we should continue to speak of a university having to be autonomous, even immune from normal regulations that might apply.  The great thing about an education if one has it, is that one uses conversation for revelation and not concealment. I say what I believe, and while it might have been appropriate years ago that Governments and nobody else were allowed trespass into the domain of third level education, I do not think they should fear any such trespass because in so far as they are changed with responsibility and accountability in respect of the vast sums that are spent, I do not see at all why we should make any apologies for having the Minister of the day have the power that is envisaged here.  For my part</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1401" /> I would be reluctant to agree that there should be any movement back towards the time when universities were funded in their entirety almost from private moneys and could obviously do what the people funding them wanted.  I am in favour of what is proposed here in the section rather than the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we should clear up a matter.  At the outset I said that this legislation was of a minimalist nature.  Each of the official spokespersons who responded accepted that point with varying degrees of regret but all in the knowledge that what we wanted to do was to give university status to the two current NIHEs.  That was accepted in a spirit of co-operation.  Each speaker then expressed the view that this would lead to a wider debate on the NUI and the changes thereto and on the wider subject of third level education.  We are now confusing the two issues, with respect to Deputy FitzGerald.  In regard to the legislation which set up the NIHEs the governing bodies are remaining in those offices until 1992 having been set up in 1987 for a span of five years.  I do not intend to interfere with that process.  In 1992 their tenure of office as governing bodies ends and at that point and in the light of events or other legislation and debates which will have occurred between now and then it will be right and proper to view the body in charge of the then Dublin City University and University of Limerick to see what changes should be made.  I accept the spirit of what Deputy FitzGerald said and the philosophy behind what he is putting forward but because of the limited nature of the legislation and because we intend to deal with it in that way, to wander into changing the make up of the governing body would go against the spirit of the legislation we have put forward today.</P>

      <P>I accept that the governing bodies are there until 1992.  My <Col N="1402" /> amendment does not refer to the initial appointments.  What I am suggesting is that these minimal changes would have the effect of demonstrating to the universities and to those looking in from outside that there is a gesture there that would be helpful to them in establishing themselves between now and 1992.  If the Minister agrees with the general thrust of what I am saying I would hope that she could, on Report Stage, accept them.  If they are in the right direction, what is the harm of putting them in?  The benefit is obvious.</P>

      <P>The proposed amendment and the support given to it reflects the position adopted voluntarily by some institutions in making presidential appointments for a fixed period.  Section 9(2) of the 1980 Act leaves the governing bodies free to do this if they so wish.  I prefer to leave this matter to their discretion. As the legislation goes on sometimes people want me to be interventionist and sometimes not according as the mood strikes them.  I would prefer to leave this matter to the discretion of the governing bodies leaving them free to order their affairs.  There can surely be nothing very wrong with that.  In fact it shows me to be remarkably non-interventionist in this matter that the governing bodies are free to order their own affairs and carry out their own duties.</P>

      <P>As the mover of the amendment let me not get involved in the question of when is a time for intervention and when is a time for non-intervention. The fact of the matter is that there are no contractual implications involved because it does not affect the two distinguished incumbents of the posts at present.  It merely is a legislative support for what may be internal statutes but I warn the Minister that if she decides not to take this move she is then leaving it to the internal statutes to achieve something that is a progressive practice, that has been accepted in other universities, and I do urge her in this case to give statutory support in the Bill to what may be an internal statutory adjustment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>4. In page 4, between lines 1 and 2, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) the substitution for subsection (1)  of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(1) There shall be an Academic Council to assist the Governing Body in the planning, co-ordination, development and overseeing of the educational work of the Institute.&rsquo;,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The area of greatest concern to me relates to student representation.  I do not deny the importance of the more general points raised in the earlier amendments to the section.  It is entirely appropriate that the legislation should give greater clarity to the role of the academic council. The drafting will be improved by the amendments.  It has been made clear for example that the academic appointments in question have to be academic appointments within the university, something that was left open by the Government drafting.  I will leave Deputy Higgins to make his and my case on those points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to press the argument for student representation on the academic council.  The NIHE Acts provided for student representation on the governing bodies.  That legislation did not address the question of whether students should be represented on academic councils. Both colleges have voluntarily adopted the practice of having student representation. In one case they have two students and in another instance they have six students.  In doing that they have given the lead to some older institutions. I am anxious that as the House, when it passed the NIHE legislation in the seventies gave its impetus to student representation, so today we should take the <Col N="1405" /> opportunity to encourage the development that took place and to provide for student representation as of right.  In a sense, my amendment is arbitrary in that I have suggested three students.  One of the colleges already provides for greater representation.  All that we provide for is a minimum representation of three students. I invite the Minister to accept that amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Birminghan's case in relation to student representation. Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are the core of the Bill.  This is where the international review body is entirely in parallel with what we are suggesting in these amendments.  It suggests a status for the academic council which will clearly establish the question of a university ethos.  It enables us to resolve the difficulty I mentioned as to whether academic authority is derived from a governing body or whether it is generic, that it is coming from a community of scholarship.  I most strongly urge the Government to accede to these amendments. They are in the best interests of both institutions for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to student representation, I am pleased to go along with that amendment.  In relation to Deputy Higgins' point, in line with the spirit of democracy in both of those colleges, they already have a number of student representatives, Deputy Higgins' amendment with regard to the make-up of the academic council would confine membership of it to those holding academic appointments.  This is not in accordance with the present practice in the two institutions and would limit the scope of the governing body to appoint persons from business and industry to the academic council so that they could have a say in the design and development of appropriate programme of study, which indeed is one of the functions of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 as drafted merely reflects the reality that exists in the two institutions. The majority of the members are holders of academic appointments, appointed <Col N="1406" /> under regulations made by the governing bodies for a period of three years and they may be reappointed.  The director under Schedule II of the Act of 1980 is an <i>ex officio</i> member of the academic council.  The Deputy's amendment would confine membership of the academic council to the holders of academic appointments.  This would limit the scope of the governing body.  I urge the Deputy to bear my point of view in mind.  The colleges have succeeded dramatically because their academic council has a wider brief.  To insist upon this amendment would dilute much of the comprehensive nature of the academic council.</P>

      <P>I am concerned at the extent to which staffing appointments are subject to the control of the Minister for Education with the consent and <Col N="1407" /> approval of the Minister for Finance.  I have no problem about a role for the Government and specifically for the Minister for Finance because clearly at the end of the day they pay the bill.  It is entirely reasonable that they should have not just a say but a dominant say in relation to the numbers of appointments. That is obvious.  The obvious interpretation of the section is that it gives the Minister a power that goes beyond simple numbers, and it appears to give the Minister for Education the power and the influence to deal with individual appointments. That is absolutely abhorrent, as the Minister accepted.  The Minister might be surprised on reading the section to discover that she has that power.</P>
      <P>As we wind up the debate on this Bill, I should say that the debate on the universities' Bills has typified the degree of co-operation that has applied between Government and Opposition during much of the Dáil.</P>

I thank her for the generous way in which she responded.  The way the debate has been conducted has typified the degree of co-operation that has applied during so much of the Dáil, a degree of co-operation that is now about to be torn up by the Taoiseach for his own personal party political ends.</P>

      <P>Full details of the sampling by my Department of beef from stocks held under the 1988 aids for private storage scheme were given in my reply to a number of parliamentary questions on the subject on 26 April 1989.  As indicated in that reply, the seven companies from which samples were taken account for 95 per cent of the beef stored under the 1988 aids for private storage scheme. Samplies of the cut <i>plate and flank</i> have been taken from each of the seven companies concerned.  My Department, in co-operation with the customs, are continuing to take samples for examination from the 1988 aids for private storage stocks.</P>
      <P>The procedures adopted in the taking of samples were applied uniformly in every case.</P>

      <P>The only scheme operated by my Department which is being funded out of national lottery receipts is that of grants to voluntary bodies in the social services area.  Allocations are not made on a county basis.  They depend on the <Col N="1310" /> number and nature of the applications received and are allotted following consultation with the relevant health boards.</P>
      <P>Details of applications approved in respect of the 1988 and 1989 (to date) schemes are set out in the following tabular statement.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit from 29 February 1988 to 7 December 1988, when payment was disallowed following an examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.</P>
      <P>Having expressed dissatisfaction with the decision to disallow payment the person concerned was examined on 1 February 1989 by a different medical referee who also considered her capable of work.  That decision was not appealed.</P>
      <P>The person concerned made a fresh claim to disability benefit from 8 May 1989.  An assessment of her incapacity for work by a medical referee is necessary before payment can be authorised. Arrangements have been made for her examination at an early date and the claim will be reviewed in the light of the medical referee's report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the delay in this case has been the difficulty experienced in establishing precisely the social insurance record of the person concerned during the periods which govern her entitlement to benefit.</P>
      <P>The person concerned had been paid unemployment benefit for the maximum number of days allowed under the scheme and she needs to have paid a further number of contributions of the appropriate class to requalify for further benefit.  She has been employed on a casual basis in a hospital and inquiries are still being made by the local social welfare officer from the health board to determine precisely the extent of the employment, the contribution paid and whether they have been paid at the appropriate rate.</P>
      <P>It is understood that the inquiries should be completed very shortly and this will enable a decision to be made on the person's entitlement to benefit without further delay.</P>

      <P>Following receipt of information about irregularities on the part of certain workers at a construction site in County Kerry, the Office of Public Works carried out an investigation.  In the course of the investigation every available worker at the relevant site was interviewed.

As a result of the disciplinary hearing he was dismissed.</P>
      <P>The reason for his dismissal was his involvement in irregular practices during working hours.</P>

Changes in the number of residential units is not a factor in the amount of the grant.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will continue payment of £2.41 per week for each year of service in excess of 21 years served by non-commissioned officers and privates who qualify for Defence Forces pension schemes and become entitled to social welfare retirement pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick West</i>): Under the Defence Forces (pensions) schemes, soldiers' pensions consist of three elements as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  a basic pension in respect of 21 years' qualifying service,</P>
      <P>(b)  a long-service increment for each year of qualifying service in excess of 21 years but not exceeding 31 years, and</P>
      <P>(c)  an additional increment of £2.41 a week in respect of each year of qualifying service in excess of 21 years but not exceeding 31 years.</P>
      <P>The basic pension and the long service increment are paid to the pensioner during his lifetime.  However, in accordance with the principle widely accepted in the public sector of co-ordinating occupational pensions with social welfare benefits, the additional increment ceases to be payable when the ex-soldier reaches the age prescribed for a contributory old age pension or becomes otherwise entitled to a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts.  As a special concession, the additional increment continues to be payable up to 70 years of age in the case of a pensioner discharged prior to the 1 August 1978, provided he is not in receipt of a social welfare retirement pension.  The additional increment would continue to be paid if, without is own default, the ex-soldier fails to qualify for a contributory old age pension.</P>
      <P>This has been the position for very many years and no change is proposed.</P>

      <P>Sligo has been designated by the Government as the location for a regional sports centre with maximum full cost capital funding of £1 million from the national lottery.  The project will comprise the provision of a 25 metre swimming pool with spectator facilities.  The site for the centre is being provided by Sligo Corporation adjoining the existing sports complex.</P>
      <P>It is a condition of approval for the project and for payment of the grant that the centre should be self-financing in operation and my Department is in consultation with Sligo Corporation in this regard.  It would not be possible at this stage to outline a timescale for the remaining planning stages or for the commencement of work.</P>
      <P>Payment of the grant would be made in instalments as building work proceeds on receipt of the consultants building certificates. There are no proposals under consideration in my Department to provide athletic facilities in Sligo.</P>
