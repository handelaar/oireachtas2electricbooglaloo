      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan (for Mr. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he has received representations from Mr. Harry Diamond, M.P., Belfast, on behalf of the Northern Ireland Amnesty Committee, regarding the imprisonment of a citizen of this State, Mr. David Fleming, who is on hunger strike in Belfast Jail; if he will state the nature of these representations, and what action he has taken in the matter; and, further, if he will state if any representations were made by him to the Northern Ireland or British authorities on this matter, and, if not, the reason why no action was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Diamond has written to me but not in the sense indicated <Col N="2322" /> by the Deputy.  Mr. Diamond knows, of course, as well as the Deputy knows, that I could not make the representations suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Mr. Diamond's request, as I understand it, was rather that we should release Seán McCaughey, who is on hunger strike here.  This also, Mr. Diamond and the Deputy should know, we cannot do.</P>
      <P>On at least two occasions in this House I have gone very fully into this matter of hunger striking to secure release from prison.  I refer the Deputy, in particular, to the Dáil Debates of July 9th, 1943, columns 600-606, and those of 1st December, 1944, columns 1456-1462.  On these occasions I explained at length what was involved, and made it quite clear that we could not permit prisoners to secure release by hunger strike.  On the 9th July, 1943, I said that we could not release anybody who was on hunger strike, and added &ldquo;that the decision was definite and final&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The issue in all these cases is whether we are to carry out our primary duty as a Government to protect the lives and property of the citizens, or permit citizens and servants of the State to be murdered with impunity; whether we are to endeavour intelligently to preserve the means of maintaining public order or revert to primitive anarchy by foolishly permitting to be taken from our hands the only method, short of capital punishment, known to civilised man for the restraint of the wrongdoer, namely, that of imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If lives are to be saved here, as we earnestly desire they should, it is necessary that all should understand, without any shadow of doubt, that the Government's decision, announced in the definite terms I have indicated, stands, and is irrevocable.  Those, and especially public representatives, who are endeavouring to weaken the Government in this matter, and are thereby inspiring the false hope that the Government can be forced to change its attitude, are leading directly to loss of lives.  Those who are appealing to us should address themselves instead <Col N="2323" /> to the persons with whom the remedy lies, either to the prisoner who seeks to force his release by refusing to take his food, or to those groups who order or incite him to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that a citizen of this State is on hunger strike in Belfast Jail, will the Taoiseach not consider, on humanitarian grounds, that, if a step is taken to give sympathetic consideration to the position in which Seán McCaughey is at Portlaoighise Jail, if a headline is given by the Taoiseach's Government, surely the Government of Northern Ireland will follow and thereby save the life of that Irish citizen?  Will the Taoiseach, on humanitarian grounds, give some sympathetic consideration to the request of Mr. Diamond?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated very clearly to the Deputy, the House and the country, that our hands are tied in this matter; that there is no course which we can take, consistent with the public interest, only the course we have taken, and I have nothing further to add to that reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Constitution of this country offers a safeguard to every citizen?  This man, Fleming, is interned and I am sure he is going to die in Belfast because he will not bow his knee to British Imperialism. Surely the Taoiseach and his Party are not going to stand for that&mdash;allowing a good Irishman to die in Belfast Jail?</P>

Would the Minister not consider that it is a matter of urgency that communications be addressed to all concerned with trade, labour and industry here, and, not only that, but that the widest possible publicity should be given to the type of inquiries being made, so that every aspect of the country's economic interests will be considered, in view of the important decisions that will be come to by the conference?</P>

    <P>On the following day the prisoner was informed that he would not be released. He was warned then, and on subsequent occasions, of the consequences to himself should he go on hunger-strike.  He refused food as from 19th April and he refused liquids as from 24th April.</P>
    <P>I receive a daily report as to the prisoner's state of health.  The prison medical officer examines him twice in each day and a trained male nurse is in constant attendance day and night.

The Taoiseach dealt fully with the question and referred to the deplorable consequences which had ensued when such appeals had been yielded to on a previous occasion, and he stated, in the clearest and most emphatic terms, that, in future, prisoners on hunger strike would not be released.  &ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is definite and final.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Mrs. Dooley's application for an allowance under the Army Pensions Act, 1927, in respect of the death of her husband, the late Sergeant Michael Dooley, was investigated by the Army Pensions Board, who reported to me that they were not satisfied that Sergeant Dooley's death was attributable to his military service in the forces during the emergency period.  In the circumstances, no allowance could be granted to Mrs. Dooley.  As the Army Pensions Board is a statutory body whose findings are final and conclusive, an investigation of the nature suggested by the Deputy could not be carried out.</P>
      <P>The late Sergeant Dooley applied for a certificate under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924, but his claim was rejected by the Board of Assessors. He served in the forces from February, 1922, to the date of his death, and on the enactment of certain amendments to the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme, 1937, which are at present in course of preparation, a gratuity in respect of this service will be payable to Mrs. Dooley.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question is open to a number of interpretations. If by &ldquo;valuation&rdquo; he means &ldquo;poor law valuation&rdquo;, such is determined by the General Valuation Office with reference to each individual parcel provided by the <Col N="2345" /> division of lands acquired by the Land Commission.  If the information sought is the resale value of parcels on which the agreements for repayment of stipulated purchase moneys or advances are based, this is obtained by an acre by acre survey of the land.  Or the Deputy may be concerned with the comparative values of parcels as allotted to one applicant as against another in somewhat similar circumstances; this aspect of the matter is governed by general land settlement policy, conditioned by local and personal factors, and having as the primary aim the creation of the greatest number of suitable economic holdings possible.</P>

    <P>[PART I&mdash;FINANCIAL YEAR, 1945-46.]</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>In his Budget speech last year my predecessor estimated the deficit for 1945-46 at £3,707,000.  However, although supplementary estimates introduced during the year totalled nearly £4,000,000 we finished with a deficit of only £1,742,000.  This result was due to two causes: Revenue exceeding expectations by £2,870,000 and Expenditure on all services being less than the total of original and Supplementary Estimates by £3,371,450.  There were substantial increases in customs revenue from petrol, tobacco, wine and spirits; in excise revenue from beer, spirits, betting and entertainments; and in the yields from estate duties, income tax, including surtax, corporation profits tax, stamp duties and motor vehicle duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the expenditure side the principal over-estimate was in the Vote of £3,000,000 for the alleviation of distress in Europe.  We did our utmost to spend the total Vote but were able to spend <Col N="2350" /> only £1,350,000.  A special committee of high officials was given the task of supervising the purchase and despatch of supplies, but they did not succeed in delivering the full amount owing to transport and other difficulties.  We knew that the people were as anxious as the Government to bring succour to the unfortunate peoples of Europe, not only from humanitarian motives, but as a token of thanksgiving to Almighty God for having preserved our nation, which suffered so much itself from war and famine in the past, from the scourge and lash of modern war and its aftermath of pestilence and famine.  This year we are providing £3,000,000 for the same purpose, and with the disappearance of some of the difficulties we are hopeful of being able to deliver the full amount of supplies this year and thus help to rescue from starvation some of the helpless victims on the Continent.</P>
    <P Just="Center">FINANCIAL YEAR, 1946-47.</P>
    <P>The Volume of Estimates shows the expenditure anticipated for Supply Services this year, including the £3,000,000 for the Alleviation of Distress in Europe, is £47,766,000, which is £263,000 more than the expenditure last year.  Central Fund Services will cost £5,724,000, which is £313,000 more than last year; the main part of the increase being additional payments to the Road Fund, due to heavier receipts from motor vehicle duties.  The two services total £53,490,000 of which I propose to borrow £682,000 for items of capital, etc., expenditure included in the estimates for Supply Services. These items are: Forestry £40,000, Airports £400,000, Defence Works, £42,000, Employment and Emergency Schemes £200,000.  Having deducted these sums, I have to meet an expenditure of £52,808,000.</P>
    <P>As will be seen from the White Paper circulated to the Dáil a few days ago on the Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure for the year ending 31st March, 1947, we estimate the receipts from non-tax revenue as £7,310,000 and from tax revenue, on the basis of the rates at present in force, as £48,240,000.  Adding the two together we get a sum of £55,550,000 <Col N="2351" /> which gives a surplus of £2,742,000 over the estimated expenditure on the non-capital portions of Supply and Central Fund Services.  To this surplus I have to add a saving of £180,000 on the flour subsidy this year which is due to the increase in the extraction to 90 per cent.  This gives a total surplus of £2,922,000.</P>
    <P>I have certain proposals to make regarding the allocation of the £2,922,000, all of which are very desirable in the public interest, but which would cost more than this amount.  I propose, therefore, to raise another £740,000 by taking it from where it will inflict little hardship with the amount of money in circulation and with shortage of supplies: an additional 12/6 per proof gallon on whiskey estimated to yield £440,000 and an additional 100 per cent. on wines estimated to yield £300,000.  This will mean an extra duty of 1¾d. per glass on whiskey which is 25 degrees under proof strength, 6d. per bottle on the lightest wines and 2/7 per bottle on champagne.  Adding the additional £740,000 from whiskey and wine to the surplus of £2,922,000 we get a sum of £3,662,000 to distribute.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, there is an excise duty of ?d. per lb., or 8/2 per cwt., on sugar and a customs duty of 2½d. per lb., or 23/4 per cwt.  I propose to abolish these duties from the 1st June next.  With the co-operation of the sugar company this will mean a reduction of 1d. per lb. in the price of sugar. The cost to the Exchequer is £600,000 this year and £720,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>Turf is costing the consumers in the non-turf areas 64/- per ton.  This is undoubtedly a high price, but we were very fortunate in having a home produced fuel at any price during the war. It is hoped that with extended development, more equipment and improved transport, ample supplies of machine-won turf will be available at a much lower price before many years.  I propose to reduce the price in the non-turf areas from 64/- to 54/- per ton as from the 1st June next.  This will cost the Exchequer £250,000 this year.</P>
    <P>The income tax payers, who include a large number of skilled tradesmen and some labourers, are paying an increase <Col N="2352" /> of 66 per cent. on the pre-war standard rate of tax.  I propose to reduce this somewhat, but still to leave an addition of 44 per cent. over pre-war. This means a reduction in the standard rate of 1/- in the £, that is, from 7/6 to 6/6.  The rates of surtax will remain the same as last year.  This relief will cost £1,200,000 this year and £1,600,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the reduction in income tax will give an impetus to the promotion of industry and employment. This relief will raise considerably the effective salaries and wages of income tax payers and should not be left out of account when comparing the sums paid weekly and annually here with States where the income tax is much heavier and payable on much smaller incomes.</P>
    <P>In addition to lowering the standard rate of income tax, I propose to give certain concessions in order to encourage the extension of mining and the undertaking of scientific research in industry.  It is estimated that the two reliefs will cost about £10,000.  As the matter is somewhat complicated I would ask the Deputies to await a full statement in the Finance Bill.  I may say now, however, in regard to mining that sums will rank for relief which are expended on the construction of works which are likely to be worth little or nothing when the mines have ceased to operate, and in relation to scientific research that where expense is incurred on research in connection with the trade, it may be claimed as an expense to be deducted from the assessment of trading profits.  Where necessary, capital expenditure as well as revenue expenditure on research will be covered.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed in the Finance Bill to exempt from income tax wound and disability pensions granted under the Army Pensions Act, 1946, such as pensions to members of the Defence Forces who, on discharge, were suffering from tuberculosis aggravated by, but not attributable to, service with the forces.  All wound and disability pensions granted under the Army Pensions Acts, 1923 to 1946, will then be exempt from income tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2353" /> Another section in the Finance Bill will provide that in computing for the purposes of income tax relief the six years' period for carrying forward a loss in any trade, profession or vocation the years 1939-40 to 1945-46 will not be counted.  This relief will remedy hardship where a business was badly hit owing to the circumstances of the emergency.</P>
    <P>A provision will be inserted in the Finance Bill to modernise the form of the decree prescribed for cases where proceedings in revenue matters are taken in the High Court or the Circuit Court.  The proceedings I have in mind are proceedings for the recovery of a tax which is due and payable and is collectable for the benefit of the Central Fund.  The proposed provision will be so framed as to take away the defects and archaisms appearing in the present form of the decree.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the excess corporation profits tax be abolished as from the 1st January, 1947.  This will have no effect on this year's Budget. As the tax in 1947-48 will be collected on excess profits made up to the end of 1946, its amount will depend on the excess profits made during this calendar year.  From the point of view of the general welfare of the community, it would be better if there were no excess profits and that prices should fall accordingly.  This tax, of course, was never intended to go on forever; and as it adversely affects new businesses in comparison with old-established concerns with a high pre-war rate of profit, its abolition will, I believe, encourage the development of new industries and the extension of existing concerns.  It is by the growth of enterprise that a greater output of goods and keener competition will be encouraged.  Reasonable competition with a plentiful supply of goods is the best means of reducing price levels.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to put into this year's Finance Bill any relieving provision in respect of stock held by traders on the 31st December, 1946, which may not realise the value placed upon it.  This will be a matter for next year's Finance Bill.  I wish to make it clear now, however, that it is proposed that any relief given in this <Col N="2354" /> connection should be by way of repayment. Companies who desire to claim relief will be required to show, among other things, to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners, the amount of stock on hands at the 31st day of December, 1946.</P>
    <P>In 1941 a new tax, described as excess surtax, was introduced with the excess corporation profits tax to which it was meant to be complementary.  It imposed a duty on excess trading profits arising to individuals, as distinct from companies.  As the excess corporation profits tax is being brought to an end as from 1st January, 1947, it will not be necessary next year to impose excess surtax for the year of assessment 1947-48.</P>
    <P>I am putting forward a proposal in relation to corporation profits tax and excess corporation profits tax which is covered by Financial Resolution No. 8. Under the existing law an assessment to corporation profits tax or excess corporation profits tax can be raised at any time within six years after the end of the chargeable accounting period.  The law is different for income tax.  An assessment to income tax or surtax may be made at any time, except in the special case of assessments on the executors or administrators of deceased persons, so long as the year of assessment is not earlier than 1922-23.  There is no limit as to the time.  I am proposing that the time limit for making corporation profits tax or excess corporation profits tax assessments be removed, but the proposal will affect only accounting periods ending on or after the 1st January, 1941.  It was from that date that under the provisions of the Finance Act, 1941, the charge to excess corporation profits tax and the increased incidence of &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; corporation profits tax came into force. The abolition of the time limit is required so as to ensure that profits will not escape taxation by mere effluxion of time.</P>
    <P>Having made provision for the reliefs on sugar, turf and income tax, and having made promises which will affect future budgets adversely, and a few which, I hope, will have the opposite effect, I am still left, out of the <Col N="2355" /> surplus of £3,662,000, with a balance of £1,602,000.</P>
    <P>Since 1943 petrol and fuel oil have borne the heavy tax of 1/3 per gallon. As about 80 per cent. of these fuels are used in road haulage and public passenger vehicles, their price substantially affects the cost of living.  The ordinary consumer and the user of public road transport have ultimately to pay in the price of goods, fares and freights, not only the tax, but the usual overheads and profits on the tax. I propose in order to help the consumer to reduce the tax on mineral hydrocarbon light oil and hydrocarbon oil, other sorts, by 6d. per gallon as from the 1st June next.  This will cost the Exchequer £470,000 this year, but the public have the right to expect that the aggregate prices of goods and services of which petrol prices are a factor will be reduced by more than this amount.</P>
    <P>For a number of years a grant of £2 per child has been given in the Gaeltacht when children attending school show that they are native speakers of Irish.  This grant is only given up to 14 years of age.  It is proposed to extend the age limit to 16, provided the children are attending school and live with their parents, and to increase the grant from £2 to £5 per child.  This will cost a sum of £40,000 this year.  Much as I dislike the spending of public money I hope this grant, conscientiously earned, will increase from year to year.  I appeal particularly to the parents in the Gaeltacht and the Breac-Ghaeltacht to regard it as their national duty to protect and extend our national language until it becomes spoken generally throughout the land.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs recently announced improvements in rural postal deliveries.  These improvements will cost the Exchequer £20,000 this year.</P>
    <P>There is one duty which has been operative for some years which, as well as being difficult to collect and costly to administer, is a cause of irritation and a source of dishonest practices; the entertainments duty on céilithe and dances.  Charitable <Col N="2356" /> and educational organisations are entitled to a rebate of the duty provided they keep their expenses within 30 per cent. of their takings, which, judging from the correspondence regarding the matter, they find difficult.  The incentive to evasion of this tax by organisations who want to raise funds, often for desirable local objects, causes bad feeling between the revenue officials, who are only carrying out their duty conscientiously, and the public generally, particularly the younger people. I feel that the duty tends to promote dishonest practices and impedes local initiative, and I propose to abolish it as from 1st August.  This will cost £65,000 this year and £94,000 in a full year.  This figure, however, is offset by a reduction in travelling and other expenses of the customs and excise officials whilst visiting céilithe and dances&mdash;and occasionally the District Courts&mdash;and also the expenses of the clerical staff in Dublin who deal with the voluminous correspondence and complaints regarding the duty.  The abolition of the duty should result in a reduction of the admission charges by approximately 20 per cent.</P>
    <P Just="Center">RATES ON AGRICULTURAL LAND.</P>
    <P>I propose to use £1,000,000 of the £1,007,000 available after giving the reliefs I have mentioned towards enabling farmers of over £20 valuation to increase the wages of their workers, and to give complementary benefits to farmers of smaller valuations, utilising for these purposes the machinery of the local rating authorities.  This extra £1,000,000, when added to the existing agricultural grant of £1,870,000 will make a total of £2,870,000, leaving only £2,530,000 to be borne by farmers out of a total rate assessment this year of £5,400,000 on agricultural land.</P>
    <P>Under the new scheme of allocation, for which legislation will be necessary, the total £2,870,000 will be distributed as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) Relief of three-fifths of the general rate on agricultural land in the case of land valuations not exceeding <Col N="2357" /> £20 and on the first £20 valuation of larger holdings;</P>
    <P>(2) relief of one-fifth of the general rate on that part of the valuation above £20; and</P>
    <P>(3) in addition to this one-fifth relief, and employment allowance of 10/- in the £ on valuations above £20, subject to the limitation that the amount of the allowance shall not exceed either £6 10s. 0d. for each man at work or male relative engaged on the land during the whole of the preceding calendar year, or the balance of the rates on the valuation over £20, whichever is less.</P>
    <P>Credit vouchers will be issued this year to each occupier in respect of any excess of the relief on the new basis over the amount of the allowances to which he is entitled at present, and no occupier will have to pay more rates this year in respect of agricultural land than he would have had to pay had the new scheme not been brought into operation.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that the wage-subsidy part of the new scheme is intended to last only for this year and next year.  During these years, agricultural machinery, artificial fertilisers, lime and concentrates should become more plentiful and fall in price; items like repairs and horse-shoeing should also become cheaper; and, most important of all, improved farm buildings, better attention to the soil and to farmyard manure, to proper seeding, breeding, cultivation and care of stock, should increase output per acre and output per worker very considerably, thus rendering unnecessary for the prosperity of the farming community either a cumbersome wage subsidy, or the present high prices of agricultural produce.  Even when the wage subsidy comes to an end in two years' time, the Government will be as interested as the farmers in keeping local rates within reasonable bounds seeing that it will have to find through State taxation three-fifths of the rates on the first £20 valuation of agricultural land and one-fifth of the rates on the valuations above £20.</P>
    <P>It will be seen from the figures I have given that after deducting certain capital items, which are to be met by <Col N="2358" /> borrowing, all expenditure devoted to current goods and services to be consumed and paid for during the year, including the £3,000,000 for the alleviation of distress in Europe, is being met out of current revenue, leaving a small surplus of £7,000.</P>
    <P>I wish to point out that I have not provided out of taxation for additional proposals which existing Departments or perhaps a new Department might make during the year.  In this transitional year when every encouragement should be given to production and some relief to the taxpayer and consumer, it would be unwise to tax to meet contingencies which have not yet arisen and which cannot be estimated with any degree of accuracy.  I am hopeful that if they do arise it will be in consequence of improved economic conditions and increased national income, which will add to the revenue yields for which we have estimated and justify the expenditure involved.</P>
    <P Just="Center">[PART II.]</P>
    <P>Having discussed and made provision for the non-capital elements of the Exchequer account, I wish to deal now with the capital side, that is, the expenditure from which our people will reap benefits in the years to come rather than in the present year.  I wish also to outline the means by which I propose to raise the necessary funds for capital development, and to refer to some of the broader aspects of the national economy.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NATIONAL INCOME.</P>
    <P>Two months ago there were presented to the Oireachtas the statistics of national income and expenditure for the years 1938-1944.  This publication was prepared by statisticians bent on giving the truth about the main features of our economic life, so far as it is possible to measure them. They did an excellent piece of work, which has received much favourable notice at home and abroad.  I hope this publication will be studied by those who are interested in the cultural life of our people as well as by those who are interested primarily in its economic aspects; for, though we might become prosperous without any gain in contentment, perhaps even with a lowering of our cultural standards, it would <Col N="2359" /> be hard in modern times to raise these standards&mdash;based as they should be on the best of our national traditions and on our own language&mdash;except on the solid foundation of a higher real standard of living attained through an increased annual volume of net output.</P>
    <P>What are our chances of raising the output of farm and factory?  The fact that last year both increased appreciably, in spite of all the difficulties with which we had to contend, gives encouragement for the future.  It is estimated that the net volume of agricultural output increased in 1945 by 7½ per cent. over 1944 and the net volume of industrial output by 10.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>I have received figures amending and extending Table 12, page 37, of the <i>National Income Statistics</i>, which relates to agricultural and industrial output. Revised figures for 1944 and provisional figures for 1945 are now available.</P>
    <P>The <i>value</i> at current prices of gross agricultural output was £96.8 million in 1944 and £104.7 million in 1945.  The value of net agricultural output was £89.6 million in 1944 and £97.2 million in 1945.  Net industrial output was valued at £42.1 million in 1944 and at £46.0 million in 1945.</P>
    <P>The figures for <i>volume</i> of output, which are got by converting all value figures to 1938 prices, are:&mdash;</P>

    <P>It is very satisfactory to note that the <i>volume</i> of net agricultural output&mdash;that <Col N="2360" /> is, the amount farmers produce less the materials they buy from non-farmers &mdash;increased during the difficult war period from £41.1 million in 1938 to £46.1 million in 1945, measured in 1938 prices.  Our farmers deserve the heartiest congratulations on this achievement.  The <i>value</i> of the net agricultural output went up between 1938 and 1945 from £41.1 million to £97.2 million.  With intelligent use of their savings during the last few years to improve their soil, farm buildings and stock, our farmers can ensure for themselves and their children a better income than the normal income enjoyed by themselves or by their fathers; and they can also ensure for the nation a good output of farm products at reasonable prices. By the way, an excellent use for £474,000 of their 1945 income of £97.2 million would be to pay off the arrears of land annuities outstanding on the 31st January this year.  I hope the Land Commission will, if necessary, use vigorous methods to collect these arrears as it is most unfair to the big majority of farmers who pay promptly to allow a minority to fall behind with their annuities.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that net industrial output stood only 14 per cent. lower in 1945 than in 1938 and was 10.9 per cent. up on 1944.  I hope that our industrialists will rapidly extend their activities and increase their efficiency in the coming years, particularly in the production and processing of basic materials from home sources, in order that our people may have a secure supply of the essentials of life at reasonable prices.  Our consumption of industrial products fell during the war because we had not reached this position by 1939.  It obviously would have fallen much lower if the big expansion in industry which took place in the preceding years had not been accomplished.</P>
    <P Just="Center">FOREIGN TRADE AND FOREIGN ASSETS.</P>
    <P>As well as the home output of goods increasing last year, imports increased by 43 per cent. in volume and by 44 per cent. in value.  From £28.2 million worth in 1944 they rose to £40.7 million <Col N="2361" /> in 1945.  Exports increased by 21 per cent. in volume and by 19 per cent. in value, namely, from £29.6 million to £35.2 million.  There was an import surplus in visible trade of £5,500,000 compared with an export surplus of £1,500,000 in 1944.  The import surplus for January and February of this year was higher than for the same two months of last year.</P>
    <P>Although our import figures have improved we are very far from obtaining all we could afford to buy on the basis of our current earnings, when both visible and invisible balances are taken into account, for in 1945 we increased our foreign balances, largely sterling assets, by £33.5 million.  The total addition to our foreign balances since 1939 is of the order of £140,000,000, which represents the goods delivered and the services rendered for which we did not get a current return in goods and services.</P>
    <P>I wish to make this comment on our external assets: it was this Government's policy before the war to build up the internal assets of the State even though that entailed a reduction in our external assets for the purchase of equipment and materials for capital development.  It was the force of circumstances and not the will of the Government which operated to increase them during the war.  We shall as far as possible pursue our pre-war policy regarding them in the future.  Personally, I hope that some time nations will agree not to vie with each other to increase their external assets.  All cannot increase at the same time; for every credit there must also be a debit. The essence of a just and reasonable international trade aim is that it should be capable of universal application without injury to any nation.  If we only had the rule that every nation must purchase from abroad, in some fixed accounting period, the full amount of its current exports of goods and services, including interest due on loans and investments, under penalty that any surplus would be distributed for International Red Cross relief or to those who unwillingly had current deficits, there would be an end to bitter trade wars and debt controversies, and each nation could operate <Col N="2362" /> its trade policy to suit the welfare of its own people without detriment to the welfare of others.</P>
    <P Just="Center">INTERNAL SAVINGS AND DEBT.</P>
    <P>Important items in the national balance sheet are the figures for public debt and internal savings.  It is sometimes held that the level of internal State debt is of little importance because the interest is a transfer payment between nationals; but from the point of view of Exchequer financing and social accountancy, it is very important to watch carefully the growth of public debt, State and local.</P>
    <P>The State now owes £95,000,000 of which £9.3 million is the capitalised value of the housing subsidy. £37,000,000 is productive debt, which gives a fair return to the Exchequer. The other £58,000,000 is dead weight debt, from which no return is derived in relief of the annual charges for interest and sinking fund.  State debt rose by £18.7 million between March, 1939, and March, 1946.</P>
    <P>The gross debt of local authorities was £36.3 million at the end of March, 1945.  But after deductions were made in respect of State contributions for housing and certain other items, the net debt was £23.37 million.  The liabilities of local authorities increased by about £2.7 million during the last financial year, so that their total net debt now stands at £26,000,000.  A large part of this net debt has been incurred on housing and public improvements, which add to the rateable valuations and the local authorities' annual income from rents and rates.</P>
    <P>The latest figures for the people's savings and liquid resources are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Bank deposits, £212.7 million&mdash;increase over 1939, £96.3 million.</P>
    <P>Post Office Savings Bank and Trustee Savings Banks, £39.2 million&mdash;increase over 1939, £27.3 million.</P>
    <P>Savings certificates, £15.7 million&mdash; increase over 1939, £4.7 million.</P>
    <P>Notes and coin held by the public, £32,000,000 &mdash; increase over 1939, £20,000,000.</P>
    <P>Total liquid resources and savings of <Col N="2363" /> the public, £299.6 million&mdash;increase over 1939, £148.3 million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NATIONAL DEBT COMPARISONS.</P>
    <P>It is of interest to compare the amount and rate of growth of our State debt, and the ratio of debt to national income, with similar figures for other States, as these relationships have important social and economic implications.</P>
    <P>In the United States of America the national debt is 1? times and in Great Britain 2? times the national income. In Ireland the gross State debt is only ? of the national income.</P>
    <P>Sweden's national debt trebled since 1939; that of Switzerland and New Zealand roughly doubled.  Of the major belligerents, the national debt of Great Britain trebled, and that of the United States increased sixfold. We added less than ¼ to ours.</P>
    <P>Had we increased our debt during the war at the same rate per head as Great Britain we would have added £1,080,000,000 to it, and instead of owing £95,000,000 we would now owe £1,170,000,000.</P>
    <P>I have not given these figures and comparisons to induce the complacent feeling that all is well with our social-economic fabric, or that we are richer than other peoples.  Far from it.  I have assembled them to show that this State, judged even by 19th century standards, is not overburdened with debt, and has at least as good a credit position as other States about which we hear a good deal from time to time; also to show that if as a community we use our resources prudently, if we have the will to produce the necessary goods, we have the means to buy the equipment.  The level of our internal debt is low and the level of our external assets high.  By our success in maintaining neutrality in World War II we were spared the devastation suffered by other countries.  Nevertheless, the scarcity of vital supplies during the war years bore heavily on an economy which still bears the marks of our struggle for political and economic freedom.  The deficiencies in our economy are not recorded in the Exchequer accounts, but they can be <Col N="2364" /> seen in the extent to which our capital development and output lag behind those of countries with a long exercise of freedom, and in our statistics of population, unemployment and emigration. But let me add that whatever happened in the past, if we fail to make progress in the future we will have nobody but ourselves to blame.</P>
    <P Just="Center">UNEMPLOYMENT AND EMIGRATION.</P>
    <P>The greatest social evil from which this nation suffered during the past century was the drain of emigration.  While we made some progress in the years before the recent war to stem the drain, the stoppage of development, due to shortages of imported plant and material, threw many people out of work and led large numbers to emigrate, mainly to England, between 1939 and the end of 1945.  Deducting the number who came in during these years from the number who went out, we get a net emigration figure of 78,600 up to the end of 1945.  In addition to those who emigrated and have not yet returned we had an average of 60,700 unemployed during 1945.  As a rough working assumption we might take it that if all who emigrated came home the average number of our unemployed would stand at about twice its present average, or, say, 130,000.</P>
    <P>These figures indicate the outstanding social and economic problem of the day.  It is a problem which must be overcome if we are to build a nation completely free, worthy of the endurance of this generation and of the sacrifices of our fathers.  The task is a difficult one, but it is within our capabilities if we try hard enough and are determined to succeed.</P>
    <P>If we have deficiencies to-day, we have also assets not to be found in balance sheets.  The nation has gained self-confidence.  It is justly proud of its achievements.  We are more united on national, economic and social policy than most nations, and than ever before in our history.  It is now generally agreed that our objective should be to secure out of our own resources for all our people who wish to remain at home, a reasonable supply of food, fuel, clothing and shelter, and ever-increasing opportunities for cultural <Col N="2365" /> development, based on our own language and on the best traditions of our race.  I wish I could add self-sufficiency in mechanical transport, tractors, and motive fuel to the list. But an approach to that, too, is coming, I hope.</P>
    <P>To make progress towards our objective we must apply ourselves energetically to building up additional capital resources and producing an increased output of goods and services, doing our utmost to make sure that no man who is fit and willing to help is left idle.</P>
    <P>Now that equipment and raw materials are gradually becoming available we must proceed vigorously with our programme for drainage, farm improvements, turf, rural electrification, hospitals, school and university buildings, housing, sewerage, water schemes, re-afforestation, roads, harbours, airports and for industrial and agricultural research and many other types of development.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CAPITAL ISSUES APPROVED.</P>
    <P>It will be seen from the White Paper that we propose to borrow £400,000 for capital development by Bord na Móna this year.  This organisation is producing an excellent fuel&mdash;machine-won turf &mdash;at a reasonable price.  I hope it will be able to enlarge its operations and expand production much more rapidly than was anticipitated when the post-war programme was being drawn up some years ago.</P>
    <P>Another capital item is the advance of £1,000,000 to the Electricity Supply Board, which is now engaged in a variety of projects including the preliminary work for rural electrification. It is still not possible to calculate what rural electrification will cost but it will be very much higher than the £20,000,000 estimated on the basis of 1939 prices.  Even though the scheme will be costly on the Exchequer the sooner it is completed the better it will be for the comfort of rural dwellers and the output of agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>The electric motor is one of the greatest gifts of science to the stock-feeding and dairy farmer.  It makes possible also the development of local industries which are economic to operate in small units when the handy electric motor can be used to drive the <Col N="2366" /> machine.  The Electricity Supply Board did excellent work during the war in keeping up the output of electricity. Their greatest difficulty was their production units which depended upon foreign fuel.  I hope that with the building of turf-fired stations and the development of the Liffey, the Erne and other rivers we will in future be independent of foreign fuel supplies for the production of electric power.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the Tourist Board want £350,000 new capital this year for the development of tourist facilities.  It is to be hoped, however, that private enterprise will grasp every opportunity for the extension and improvement of accommodation and recreational facilities for holiday-makers, and so render unnecessary any large investments directly by the State.  This is an industry which must expand in the coming years to cater for our own holiday-makers as well as for tourists from abroad.  A sure way of killing its development would be an attempt on the part of those engaged in it to make undue profits.  Here the long view is the sound view.</P>
    <P>The rapid advances which are being made in international air transport and the various air agreements which have been completed during the past year, make it very important that the development of our airports should be completed as rapidly as possible.  This work is now in hand, and a sum of £610,000 is being provided in the Supply Estimates for the capital expenditure on airports anticipated this year.  We are also making provision for £800,000 for planes and equipment.  It is expected that there will be a big extension this year in the activities of Aer Lingus; we will provide 60 per cent. of the capital and British interests 40 per cent.  The organisation of this joint company will serve the interests of both countries and will provide cheaper and more efficient air transport for both English and Irish travellers, than two competing companies could possibly have done on an economic basis.  As has already been announced, Aer Rianta hopes to start its transatlantic service this year.</P>
    <P>Colucht Groighe Naisiúnta na hEireann has recently been registered and a sum of £100,000 is indicated in <Col N="2367" /> our capital requirements with which to purchase shares in the new company and so provide it with funds for the development of the stud.</P>
    <P>For many kinds of development projects materials are procurable at home, though with existing equipment they are often costly to win and process. The Government is determined to get ahead with the work as quickly as possible making the best use of the available equipment and material.  If, however, we are to do the work without placing an undue burden on our children we must do it as economically as possible, employee and employer, borrower and lender, co-operating to give the best possible service for the lowest reasonable reward.  The less energy spent by each section in seeking greater rewards for itself, which must ultimately be paid by the remainder of the community in taxes or prices, the greater will be the energy available for improving permanently the lot of all sections, including itself.</P>
    <P Just="Center">FINANCE.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the main point of this part of my speech&mdash;finance.  I want to raise money for capital purposes. I want for the sake of those who have to repay it&mdash;that is the community, all sections of it&mdash;to get it at the lowest price it is possible to obtain it, in present circumstances, without ill effects on our political and economic life.</P>
    <P>Let me reply at this stage to suggestions which I am sure will be advanced: either that we should borrow all the money we require from the banks or that we should alter the law to enable the Exchequer itself to create money.  It must be realised that borrowing from the banks swells the volume of money in the hands of the people as surely as the creation and issue of money by the State.  At this moment the community as a whole has enough money to buy the available goods.  Any appreciable increase in either bank credit or State deficit, borrowed, minted or printed, which did not bring additional goods on the market, would only tend to raise the existing price level, unless it were <Col N="2368" /> counteracted by increased savings. Our financial problem to-day is not a shortage of money and a surplus of goods; I wish it were as simple as that.  It is the problem of how at the same time and with the fewest possible controls, to induce saving in the proper directions, and to induce spending in the proper directions; how to reduce the pressure of money on goods in short supply, and how to promote the spending of money to employ the men who are without work, in the creation of additional goods and additional capital wealth.</P>
    <P>I propose for the capital items detailed in Part III of the White Paper and for the other purposes to which I shall refer later, to raise money during the coming year by the following means:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) By the issue to the public of a long-term loan at a maximum of 2½ per cent.</P>
    <P>(2) By borrowing through the Post Office Savings Bank and Trustee Savings Banks.  In this connection I propose, as from 1st January, 1947, to decrease the rate of interest to 2 per cent. on sums up to £300 and on the first £300 of each deposit over that amount; on the excess over £300 the rate of interest will be reduced to 1¼ per cent.  There will be no change in the existing rate of 2½ per cent. on Post Office and Trustee Savings Banks' Deposits in respect of this calendar year.</P>
    <P>(3) By borrowing through a new issue of lower-yielding Savings Certificates.  The existing issue is being withdrawn as from to-day.</P>
    <P>(4) By the issue of three months' Exchequer Bills to the commercial banks which they have agreed to discount at 1? per cent. per annum. These bills will be issued from time to time during the year only if additional ways and means advances are required to supplement the inflow of revenue and of loans from the public.</P>
    <P>The combination of means for obtaining money which I have outlined will enable me to make long-term loans to local authorities and to State and semi-State organisations for capital <Col N="2369" /> development, at a rate of 2½ per cent. per annum.  Future loans issued to these bodies from the Exchequer or Local Loans Fund will bear this rate of interest, and may in appropriate cases have repayment periods as long as 50 years.  It should be noted that a weekly payment of 1/4 will repay £100 at 2½ per cent. interest in 50 years, and that it takes a weekly payment of 2/1½ to repay £100 under the present terms of 4¼ per cent. for 35 years.  This reduction of 37 per cent. in annual charges will assist local authorities in building houses to let at reasonable rents, provided, of course, they get the co-operation of the master builders and the trades unions regarding three other vital elements of cost; profits, wages and output.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the other purposes for which I propose to borrow, I wish to point out that if our outstanding loans could be converted to a 2½ per cent. basis immediately, we would be able to borrow £25,000,000 without increasing the amount appropriated for loan charges which this year are costing the taxpayer £4.89 million.  We cannot, of course, convert outstanding loans until their first redemption dates arrive; but we can, if there is a legitimate and pressing need for borrowing, borrow with the knowledge that the burden of interest and sinking fund charges is becoming relatively lighter.  Debt charges are 9.1 per cent. of this Budget and were 11.2 per cent. of the 1939 Budget.  They will become much easier to bear if we pursue policies which have the effect of keeping such charges down whilst increasing our national income.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TRANSITION DEVELOPMENT FUND.</P>
    <P>Of all the means by which the national income can be increased, the most obvious is to use for this purpose the energy and skill of those now seeking employment.  It is more obvious, but not so immediately effective, as would be an increase in the output of those already engaged in agriculture and industry.  It is, however, socially urgent; and despite all the difficulties and financial cost involved, it must be <Col N="2370" /> tackled with the greatest vigour in this post-war period of transition.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that now is the wrong time to do work when prices are high, and that local authorities and State and semi-State companies, would be crippled by undertaking development before prices fall.</P>
    <P>To meet this difficulty of the present abnormal level of costs, I propose to set up a Transition Development Fund to operate during the next two financial years, out of which contributions will be made towards the extra capital expenses of State organisations and local authorities, which are attributable to post-war transitional difficulties such as high prices of materials and shortage of equipment.  I also propose for this year to meet out of the fund any surplus expenditure on development work which Departments did not anticipate would be possible when their Estimates were being prepared last December. By the time the transitional period is over and prices have fallen, we will, I hope, be well on the move and can then accelerate much more rapidly than if we had remained stationary.  For this fund I propose to borrow, if necessary. up to £5,000,000 this year.  Issues from the fund will be made as rapidly as possible when suitable projects are put forward.  Priority will be given to projects from the Gaeltacht and large urban areas in which desirable schemes might otherwise be postponed because of transitional difficulties.  There is plenty of desirable work in every area of the country, work which will pay dividends in increased productivity, better health and more comfort, if the schemes are properly organised and a good output is given.</P>
    <P>In the Finance Bill I shall bring forward a clause legalising the establishment of the Transition Development Fund for two years; and, if it is approved, introduce an Estimate to the Dáil for a maximum sum of £5,000,000 for this year.  Detailed public announcements will be made later by various Departments as to grants which will be made available from the fund.  At this stage I will give two illustrations as to how the fund might be used.  The first is farm improvements.  Although <Col N="2371" /> in the Estimate for Employment and Emergency Schemes we provided an additional £50,000 this year, bringing the total up to £400,000, more applications than we expected have come in. I propose to meet the additional applications out of the fund.  The second is housing.  It is very difficult to foretell in the disturbed state of the world what the prices and supplies of materials are likely to be over the next two years.  It is proposed, therefore, not to alter the existing standard subsidies to local authorities for housing but if reasonable tenders are made for the erection of houses on the basis of the current cost of available materials and methods of construction, to add to the normal subsidy a grant out of the Transition Development Fund.  If the tenders are reasonable the grant will be sufficient to keep the rents of new workers' dwellings at a reasonable figure, having regard to the level of current wages.  If in particular cases houses cannot be completed at once owing to shortage of certain materials, local authorities will be encouraged to complete them as far as the supply of materials will allow, and the capital charges on the outlay will be borne by the fund until they can be completed.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to say that with the co-operation of spending authorities on the lines I have suggested, with efficient and strict management, and with the co-operation of the men employed on the work in giving good output, I feel confident we can make a good start this year on our post-war programme for developing this portion of the country to be a somewhat worthier home for our people.  We have no certainty of success, of course; but, as they used say in Armagh, nothing beats a try. Buailimis faoi'n obair, in ainm Dé.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the general matter of the Budget and the statement by the Minister for Finance.  I would opine that there will be considerable rejoicing in the Budget notices in the newspapers, and that that will be followed by an attitude which will be tempered by something considerably less than joy, when the full effect of the Budget is realised. The Minister's announcement was in connection with sugar, turf, income-tax, petrol, and agricultural rates. There were some minor matters, but these were the chief ones.  The remissions amount to about £4,000,000. When one looks at the White Paper which was circulated a few days ago, one sees that the receipts derived from last year's taxation amounted to £43,500,000, and it was estimated that the same rates would bring in this year £48,250,000.  We have taken off £4,000,000.  That is the first effort in the first year of peace.  We are looking for revenue of, at least, £1,000,000 more than we received last year.  There is a picture which was recently criticised in London.  There were a whole-lot of notable performers in it, but, unfortunately, it had a bad script from the producer, and the critics stated that it was a poor evening's entertainment at a high level.  I think when thoughts on the Budget have settled down it will be criticised in the same <Col N="2373" /> way, as a foolish evening's entertainment on the highest level of taxation this State has had.  There was an appeal to the producers of the picture for more amusement, that they might introduce acrobats.  We have acrobats in this.</P>
      <P>As far as income-tax is concerned we are going to make remissions in a full year amounting to £1,600,000.  We are going to bring the return on income-tax down as compared with last year, and if those who suffer from income-tax take a slight dose of whiskey or wine to celebrate the occasion they will lose half the remission of tax this year.  In any event, what we are doing in the first year of peace is going back to the income-tax level established here in the year 1941.  We are not going back to the pre-war figure, although that was high enough.  We are going back to the figure of 6/6 in 1940-41.  That is the Minister's contribution, as far as that particular section of the community is concerned. No doubt the reduction with regard to turf will be gladly welcomed.  It is a great relief, even though people may have to bear a similar weight of taxation in other matters in the Budget. In this connection, people should turn their attention to the figures for customs and excise.  They brought in nearly £22,000,000 last year, and were expected, without increasing any of the rates, to bring in £25,500,000 this year. We are apparently going to look for £25,500,000.  In other words, the new taxes to be borne by the people, in conjunction with customs and excise, will bring in the whole £4,000,000 and a bit more of what is given away in the five or six major reliefs to which I referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be noted that we are now at a proposed level of taxation of almost £54,000,000.  In 1939, the proposed level was something short of £32,000,000, so that we have still an increase of almost £18,000,000 on the year 1938-39. Farmers will, no doubt, welcome the relief they are going to get by way of £1,000,000 on agricultural rates.  In so far as the Budget marks a step towards the programme that we have advocated of full derating, that is welcome. The farmers will, no doubt, be <Col N="2374" /> aware that in the old days of the land annuities controversy they were promised that the whole of the annuities would be used in the relief of rates. That was not carried out and they found out, as the years went on, that whatever relief they got was more than offset by rates.  They get £1,000,000 extra in relief of agricultural rates this year, but they remember well that, during the progress of the Local Government Bill through the House, we were told that new imposts in the way of extra rates would be placed upon them, so that they are likely to find themselves in this position, that more than what they save in reductions in rates through the agricultural grant may be imposed on them through the increase which has been promised.  The relief in respect of petrol which will inure to a great extent to the benefit of the transport company is also welcome and it will be particularly welcomed by the transport company as an extra subsidy borne through the extra customs and excise duties being levied on the community.</P>
    <P>There are two things in this Budget which I specially welcome.  One is the advance&mdash;if it is not carried out wholeheartedly and fully, it will be disappointing&mdash;towards this derating policy. The second is the stride taken, even though with a certain amount of timidity, towards the policy so long advocated in this House of borrowing at low interest rates.  That is now announced as an official policy.  It is time it came, but I think the House will have to consider very definitely the methods by which this policy of borrowing is to be carried out.  We are to have new issues, and the speech which contains the statement as to these new issues, these new loans, and all the other matters spoken of, also contains a statement as to the immense savings of the public here since 1938-39, or even since 1944.  It has often been asked in this House that these savings, savings which people are inclined to deposit in funds which bear only low interest rates, should be utilised and that one should not go to the ordinary commercial lenders who will exact their toll, if they are <Col N="2375" /> approached in the ordinary way.  However, as I say, it is a big step forward.</P>
    <P>I remember when I first mooted this idea and referred to the fact that the propaganda in respect of saving certificates had been called off, the Minister for Supplies interrupted me to say that there was good reason for its having been called off in that particular year, because the Government were going for a national loan, and, as they wanted money at 4 per cent., it was absurd to allow people to lend to them at 2 per cent. or 1½ per cent.  We have now apparently adopted the policy that it is good tactics and good economics to have these savings availed of when people are willing to lend at low rates. I notice a statement in the Budget speech that suggestions will probably be made about borrowing money from the banks or altering the law to enable the Exchequer itself to create money. I hope the Minister will tell us from whom these suggestions previously came and the dates on which they were made, so that we can have whatever statement or suggestion was made along these lines analysed, and see whether that is not a perversion of the suggestion put forward.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not so fond to-day as he was a year ago of the accumulation of external assets.  We now have something in the nature of an apology that if we did pile up further external assets in the last three or four years, it was not because we desired to do so, the Minister says, but because circumstances drove us in that direction.  In July of 1945, there were lamentations when the suggestion was made that we should not deliberately increase these foreign holdings of ours, and efforts were made from the Government side to show that these foreign holdings were very valuable, that they would inure to our benefit and that it was proper and right that they should be increased.  Now we have pulled out of that track.  We have not pulled out sufficiently far, but there apparently is at least an appreciation in the minds of the Minister and those who advise him that this policy of having our eggs all in the English financial basket may not be sound and that the country may <Col N="2376" /> suffer very substantial losses, even by reason of the extra amount put into that particular basket in the last four or five years.  It may be that the new view has come too late, but it is a welcome change, even if it is only the mental approach to the whole situation.</P>
    <P>I think that, when this Budget comes to be examined from the point of view from which it must be examined in this House, one will wonder what all the pother is about.  This country in the last three or four years has been faced with three or four great problems. The first is that production has very seriously decreased; the second is that the cost of living has very seriously increased; the third is that an attempt has been made by the Government to shift over from the policy of wage earning to a policy of State benefits; and the fourth is the outcropping of all these, that emigration has risen to a level never seen in this country since the time of the famine.  The Minister has given us figures which nobody will credit in connection with emigration, belied as they are by his own official statistics.  One looks through this Budget statement for anything which will aid, say, in bringing down the cost of living or anything which will aid against the outflow of emigrants.  There is a little here for production, but production is pushed into the back place, and there is apparently no appreciation whatever of the impact of high revenue charges upon the cost of living and upon the good of the country.</P>
    <P>It is rather notable that a speech which went into so many details should reserve to the last two or three pages the only item in it respecting a deliberate effort to increase productivity in the country, and then that it is put under the heading of a transitional development scheme.  The Minister is going to borrow £5,000,000 and he gives one or two examples of the objects upon which this £5,000,000 might be spent.  One of them is farm improvement schemes.  The farms of the country, the natural source of wealth of the community, the only thing, in the end, by which we can live, are pushed into the last two and a half <Col N="2377" /> pages of the statement and they are to be at the mercy of a transitional development scheme.  The claims of farmers for improvements of their farms and farm buildings are to be taken out of this particular fund which is to be raised and which is to last over two years only.  That is the effort in the Budget with regard to productivity.</P>
    <P>I see no point in this Budget in respect of which I could say that the costs of living to any degree are to be reduced.  The Minister apparently is content to blind himself to the emigration which has taken place and to hope that it will simply be at the same rate as before.  I do not see what hope he holds out of a reduction in the old number of unemployed.  He has simply made a statistical calculation and has told us what the numbers are as between emigrants and unemployed. One of the earliest statistical records contained a review by the late Mr. Hooper of the Statistics Branch in which he showed the progress of the cattle of this country from the farms on which they were bred, up through the Midlands where they were fattened for a period and then eventually to the outskirts of Dublin where they had to be watered and fed prior to being put on the boat to be shifted to England.</P>
    <P>The new statisticians might give us some picture of the human population of this country for the last four or five years being taken from their scattered farms in a way which the Minister for Agriculture says is only natural, brought up here into the overcrowded slums of the city, taken in hand by the Department of Public Health and fumigated, washed and cleansed and then, through the medium of the employment exchanges of Industry and Commerce, helped on board a ship, ticketed for their various destinations, and thrown out at such a rate that the ordinary natural increase in the population over the last five years, the surplus of births over deaths, has been more than exhausted by the number of people whom the present Government have assisted to the work in England which they promised them here and failed to give them.  I see little chance in this Budget that that outflow will be arrested, and, until it is arrested, <Col N="2378" /> nobody can say that this country is in a healthy condition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Just a year ago, the Budget speech of the Minister's predecessor led us to believe that, with the cessation of hostilities in Europe and the ending of the emergency period, we could look forward to big reductions in many directions and particularly in the cost of living.  The Minister's Budget speech to-day, I must say, is very disappointing.  Just a few reliefs are thrown out.  The income-tax payers are to be afforded a relief of 1/- in the £.  There is to be a reduction in the duty on petrol and other light fuel oils.  But I do not see a single word about any tendency towards an increase in old age pensions which has been advocated again and again in this House.  It is all very well to reduce income-tax by 1/-.  But we must remember that there is a certain section of our people who are living on actual starvation diet, due to the very low old age pension which is being paid.  I shall have more to say on that subject later.</P>
      <P>There is a sum of £1,000,000 towards the relief of rates.  I am glad the Minister has become alive to the fact that something was needed in that direction.  His method of relief follows almost word for word a scheme which we proposed in the Dáil during the last 12 months, with this difference, that he has introduced a highly com plicated scheme for the relief of the ratepayers, whereas ours was a very simple one.  We proposed the derating of all agricultural land up to the first £20 of the valuation and additional derating of £15 over that for each male adult worker employed whole-time on the farm.  The Minister's scheme is very complicated and I do not see how he is to manage it.  It will impose increased work on county council staffs.  However, it is the first step in the right direction.  It is encouraging to know that the Government have at last wakened up to the fact that the burden of rates had reached breaking point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Budget statement on unemploymen and emigration is certainly very enlightening.  We find that 78,600 <Col N="2379" /> people emigrated from 1939 to 1945 and that, in addition to that, there were 60,700 persons unemployed last year.  The Minister in his statement said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These figures indicate the outstanding social and economic problem of the day.  It is a problem which must be overcome if we are to build a nation completely free, worthy of the endurance of this generation and of the sacrifices of our fathers.  The task is a difficult one but it is within our capabilities if we try hard enough and are determined to succeed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Government for 14 years have been trying to succeed in that direction.  It is a wonder that they have not succeeded up to now. Then he goes on to propose a lot of grand schemes and says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Now that equipment and raw material are gradually becoming available we must proceed vigorously with our programme for drainage, farm improvements, turf, rural electrification, hospitals, school and university buildings, housing, sewerage, water schemes, reafforestation, roads, harbours, airports and for industrial and agricultural research and many other types of development.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If he wants to tackle the problem of emigration, which is bound up very closely with unemployment, I think that instead of giving £40,000 for afforestation he should have given more.  He was able to spare £400,000 for airports.  He should be able to spare £400,000 for afforestation, which is a very urgent national problem at present.  There is to be a reduction of 6d. in the duty on petrol.  I hope that the appropriate Minister will see that the big transport monopoly we have at present will not use that relief to swell their own profits but will pass it on to the people who use the road services and who have big freight problems to meet.</P>
    <P>I must say that the Budget statement has been very disappointing.  We were expecting far bigger concessions.  There is 1d. in the lb. taken off sugar. <Col N="2380" /> That is a clear indication that the point of view expressed here many times by this Party has been right, that not alone could sugar have been sold a little cheaper, but that the farmers could have got something more than the price they were getting for beet.  We could have had much more sugar for our own needs here and the ration could have been higher and we could have sugar to export if there had been a slight increase allowed in the price of beet.  Now, when the Minister can take 1d. in the lb. off sugar, I should like to hear him explain that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Large masses of people who have made sacrifices during the past six years under emergency conditions will welcome the announcement that the price of sugar is to be reduced, even though the reduction is small, probably not giving relief to the average family to a greater extent than 4d. per week.  The price of turf, always ridiculously high, is now to be reduced in the non-turf areas to 54/- per ton. Even these reliefs are welcome these days and particularly welcome to a people who have been looking at a rather bleak economic picture for the past six years.  I suppose, therefore, that this House, like the rest of the community, will be glad of these two reliefs in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one aspect of the Minister's speech which I must confess I rather liked.  The Minister, I think, indicated an element of vigour in his desire to see certain development works pushed ahead.  I think I recognise there is a disposition on his part&mdash;how long that disposition will last is another matter&mdash;to see schemes of national development pushed into the forefront of our activities.  In so far as the Minister is serious in that and in so far as it indicates an abandonment of the past Micawber-like policy on the part of the Government.  I welcome the Minister's speech.  I hope his intentions were not merely developed for the purpose of this Budget speech. I still hope that they will live after the speech has been printed in the newspapers and read.  So far as the Minister will push forward vigorously a policy of developing our industry so as <Col N="2381" /> to provide employment and wealth for the people, I think the Minister will find in this House and in the country an abundance of goodwill to help him to surmount any difficulties that may present themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to emigration.  Everybody knows that emigration is probably the most dangerous social evil, the most dangerous cancer, of our national life from which it is possible for a nation to suffer.  It has been heart-breaking for the last six years to see the finest of our young men and young women pleading and begging at the labour exchanges throughout the country to get a permit to go to work in Britain, to work in the war industries, to join the British Army, and to try to toil and moil anyway in bomb-blitzed Britain because they could not get here the employment which ought to be available for them.  The Minister now says that that is a serious problem which must be tackled.  Of course it must be tackled if there is to be any Irish nation left. Of course it must be tackled if there is to be any virility left in the nation. Of course it must be tackled unless we are to see the end of the Celt and the entire extinction of the Irish people as a race.  What we have been doing during the past six years has been that we left Great Britain to solve our unemployment problem.  Ministers can go to meetings, conferences and banquets, and tell us of the Government's policy in respect to full employment. The Government have no policy for full employment here.  They have only a policy of full employment for the Irish in Britain.  The highlight of events this week is that, not only are we sending thousands and tens of thousands of our people to Great Britain to find work, but now France is coming into the picture offering asylum to Irish workers who are going to build up France's basic industries.  Is there any limit to Irish craziness?  Is there any limit to the absurdities to which we commit ourselves?  Here we have a relatively undeveloped country with our people crying out for an opportunity to create work and earn a livelihood; yet we sit down and calmly permit thousands and tens of thousands <Col N="2382" /> of our people to go to Britain.  We issue permits to thousands and tens of thousands of our people to go to Britain.  The future is made grimmer still by a proposal made by a French Minister to take in thousands of Irish workers to rebuild French industry, while our own industries are in greater need than ever of that rebuilding to which France and Britain are energetically applying themselves. I would ask the Minister why cannot we keep these people at home.</P>
    <P>Supposing that these people who went to Britain said that they would not go and would insist on exercising their right to live in their own country and claim their heritage and right to work and to a decent livelihood in Ireland, what then would this Government contemplate doing?  It could not export them; it could not deport them; it could not compulsorily emigrate them.  It would be its duty to provide employment for them.  But the Government has taken the easier way out.  Instead of providing employment for the people who have been driven to Britain by force of the economic circumstances at home the Government has taken the easy route of providing them with permits and sending them to Britain, and &ldquo;they will be high in the sky by and by&rdquo; in Ireland.  That has been the Government's policy.  The Minister made a fantastic statement to the effect that if all our emigrants returned it might be assumed that the total number of unemployed in this country would be 130,000.  I think that figure is perfectly ridiculous.</P>

      <P>The Minister was at some pains to explain our national debt in relation to the national debts of other countries and he drew certain comparisons with the United States and Great Britain.  Because of the size of these countries it is of course impossible to make any comparison of our circumstances vis-à-vis theirs; but it is possible to make some comparison with Sweden and New Zealand.  It is true that these latter countries have approximately doubled their national debt during the last six years; but it is equally true that there is no citizen in Sweden or New Zealand who is not glad to carry their national debt and have their standards of living as compared with our lower national debt and our appallingly low standard of living. It is true that New Zealand has a national debt which is heavier than ours but she has introduced legislation recently which fixes a minimum wage of £5 5s. a week for every adult male employee; and when you think of close on 200,000 agricultural workers in this country toiling for 40/- a week and at the same time remember that the agricultural worker in New Zealand gets £5 5s. a week, it is easy to see how New Zealand can carry, with the utmost equanimity, a national debt which is greater than ours.  We have no reason to congratulate ourselves or pride ourselves on the fact that our national debt is not as high as these countries because where these countries have high national debts they have an entirely different and much better standard of living than our people have here.  I think that if a census of opinion of our people were taken it would disclose that they would prefer the New Zealand standard of national debt if they could at the same time have the social services which go hand in hand <Col N="2384" /> with enlightened government in New Zealand.</P>
      <P>One of the things that struck me forcibly in listening to the Minister's speech was the complete absence of any reference to social services. Whether the low standard of our social services has now become a closed book to the Minister, I do not know, but it is rather significant that we had no reference whatever to our standard of social services.  In the Budget to-day the Minister was giving away £3,000,000.  He could not provide 1/- per week extra to old age pensioners who to-day are compelled to live on an old age pension of 10/- a week when in fact it would take approximately 25/- a week to buy what that old age pension of 10/- bought in 1916.  In a Budget, under which the Minister is dispensing benefits to large transport companies in the form of reduced prices of petrol and oil, it was not found possible to give even 1/- to old age pensioners or to widows and orphans, and particularly to widows and orphans who are compelled to subsist on a standard of pension related to non-contributory rates.  I should have thought that the Minister, in a Budget of this kind and with money to dispense, would at least have made some effort to build up the standard of living of the lower paid sections of the community in preference to giving relief to large transport companies and well-to-do motor users at the expense of denying any assistance whatever to old age pensioners and widows and orphans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1939 this House gave the Government the Emergency Powers Act; it later learned to its astonishment that that Act was going to be utilised for the purpose of controlling the wages paid to workers.  In fact, although ostensibly intended as a measure of defence to protect the nation during the war, that Act so far as the Government wage policy is concerned, was utilised for making war on the standard of living of the workers.  During the past six years we have seen a rigid policy of controlling wages, of pegging wages down to the lowest possible level whilst, on the other hand, we have seen a price control policy <Col N="2385" /> represented by permitting the cost of living to increase by more than 70 per cent.  Now we are coming to the end of the emergency.  Now we are coming to the time when the Emergency Powers Act is nearing expiration. Surely we ought to have from the Government some indication as to whether it intends to pursue this wage control policy with the same rigidity and with the same appalling effect on the standard of living of those who are subject to that wage control Order.  The Minister provided relief for those who pay income-tax, for those who pay excess profits tax, and for large transport companies.  Those are the people who in the future are going to do better than they have done in the past. Is there going to be no relief for the ordinary worker from the Emergency Powers Act as applied to the wages paid in industry, commerce, agriculture and various other types of work? We ought to have from the Minister some indication as to where the Government stands in that matter.  We ought to have, now that we are clear of the war period and there can be no further excuse for continuing emergency conditions in circumstances which do not justify their continuance, some assurance that there will be no further control of wages except the control exercised by the State to ensure that there will be a minimum standard of living for everybody in the country and that wages will not be regulated to the advantage of those whose only interest is in keeping wages, in so far as they are a factor in production, as low as they can possibly keep them.</P>
    <P>We have had a teachers' strike in this city for the last two months, with the most appalling effects on the children, their education, their sense of citizenship, their characters and their minds, effects which it is impossible for anybody to conceive. Young children have been running around the city for the last two months whilst this strike is in progress.  Surely it ought to be possible for the Government to utilise some of their surplus to effect a settlement of that strike in the interests of the people, in the interests of the teachers and particularly in the interests of the children themselves, <Col N="2386" /> who are the most important consideration in the matter, and in the interests of the parents, who in the industrial areas and in the working-class areas in this city are beset with the problem of trying to keep their children out of those dangers which imperil children every day of the week when they are compelled to play in crowded streets which are arteries for vehicular traffic.  If the Minister was anxious to make some atonement for the sins of his predecessors which he himself has inherited, surely he might have made some restitution, especially to the lower paid civil servants, of the amount of money he has filched out of their pockets during the past six years.</P>
    <P>During the past six years, form 1940 to 1945, if he had honoured his obligations, he would have to pay £5,900,000 cost-of-living bonus to civil servants, but because the Minister repudiated his obligation, he was now able to line the Exchequer with approximately £6,000,000 which in the ordinary course, unless he manipulated the law, he would be compelled to pay.  As far as teachers, civil servants, widows and orphans and old age pensioners are concerned, there is nothing for them in this Budget.  Whatever reception the Budget may get either here or in the country, the real test is what standard of living it is going to make available for the masses of our people.  If this Budget is going to continue emigration to Britain, if it is going to leave 60,000 or 70,000 of our people unemployed at home, it is going to follow that large masses of our people will be deprived of the barest necessaries of life; this Budget will bring the same blackness and the same gloom as many previous Budgets.  If the Minister wants to get away from unemployment, emigration and a low standard of living, then the Minister ought to make sure that the sentiments which are expressed in some portions of his Budget speech, namely, a desire to see national activities pushed to the forefront, work provided in various fields of national endeavour, are lived up to.  In that way and only in that way can he create a situation here which will keep our people at home in relative decency instead of <Col N="2387" /> compelling them as has been done for the past six years to seek a livelihood outside the country.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 20, before Section 48, line <Col N="2399" /> 58, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>48.&mdash;(1) Whenever a harbour authority are authorised by a harbour works Order under Part VIII of the Harbours Act, 1946 (No. 9 of 1946) to construct or maintain the bridge&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  this Part of this Act (except Sections 49 and 51) shall have effect as if such harbour authority were a road authority,</P>
    <P>(b)  sub-section (1) of Section 45 of this Act shall have effect as if the expenses incurred by such harbour authority under the Harbours Act, 1946, in obtaining the harbour works Order were part of the expenses of the work.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Minister shall not by virtue of this section do any of the following things save with the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  include in the bridge Order a direction under Section 42 of this Act to a harbour authority to execute the work;</P>
    <P>(b)  include in the bridge Order a requirement under sub-section (1) of Section 45 of this Act of a contribution to be made by a harbour authority;</P>
    <P>(c)  in a case where the application for the bridge Order is made by a road authority other than a harbour authority and is refused require under sub-section (2) of Section 41 of this Act a contribution to be made by a harbour authority;</P>
    <P>(d)  vary under sub-section (3) of Section 45 of this Act a contribution to be made by a harbour authority under sub-section (1) of the said section.</P>
    <P>(3)  In this section the expression &ldquo;harbour authority&rdquo; has the same meaning as in the Harbours Act, 1946.</P>
    <P>Section 134 of the Harbours Act, 1946, empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce to authorise harbour authorities to carry out certain works. The purpose of Section 134 is to obviate <Col N="2400" /> the need for Private Bills on each occasion on which it is desired that a harbour authority should carry out the work.  The purpose of this new section is to make a harbour authority, that has been authorised to construct or maintain a bridge, a road authority for the purpose of Part IV of the Bill.  An example of how the section will work can be found in connection with the proposed transporter bridge over the river Liffey.  The Dublin Port and Docks (Bridges) Act, 1929, provided for the construction of this bridge by the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  The cost of construction and portion of the cost of operation was to be borne by the local authority.  The time in which the work was to be undertaken has expired.  Under the new Harbours Act it is open to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to authorise the construction of such a bridge by the Dublin Port and Docks Board, but before this could be done Part IV of the Bill would have to be brought into operation in order that the financial contribution by the Dublin Corporation, which was at that time contemplated, could be made.</P>
    <P>The purpose, therefore, of this amendment is to include harbour authorities among the authorities which can be consulted by the Minister for Local Government in connection with financial matters arising out of the construction of bridges; that is to say, that if the Minister for Industry and Commerce should permit a harbour authority to construct a bridge, a preliminary report can be obtained on the character of the bridge and the necessary inquiries held, just as though the harbour authority was a road authority, in order that the road authority and the harbour authority could combine and co-ordinate in respect of the financial contribution.  In fact, this amendment could have been inserted during the Committee Stage if the Harbours Act had been passed and if we were fully aware of its implications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I follow the Parliamentary Secretary fully in this matter.  Do I understand that the full purport of this proposed new section is merely to give <Col N="2401" /> the Minister an opportunity of consulting with the harbour authority, and it does not go beyond that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the new Harbours Act, the Minister for Industry and Commerce can authorise a harbour authority to construct a bridge, but if, for reasons of public good, the local authority should pay part of the cost of that bridge, then the harbour authority can be included along with other road authorities, or a road authority, in the application of the general provisions of Part IV of the Bill, so that if a harbour authority, for example, is to construct a bridge, the plans could be sent to the local authority and could then be examined by the Minister for Local Government if there should be some conflict between the local authority and the harbour authority.  I think I have made the position fairly clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will clarify, if not the section, at least my mind, a little more.  This, I take it, brings in something new and it gives an opportunity now of putting the cost or portion of the cost on the local authority which could not, without the passage of this section, be put on them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, it is a fresh imposition on the local authority. It is giving power to impose part of the cost of a bridge on the local authority, that power not being here if this new section is not inserted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I want to get at.  That is where I find myself in some difficulty because, having regard to the fact that the local authority now, or almost immediately, will be there in name only, for a purpose such as this it will consist of an official who, so far as his responsibility is concerned, instead of sitting in the Custom House will sit and <Col N="2402" /> operate in the City Hall.  So far as any power in relation to the local authority is concerned, he will have none when this Bill becomes law.  I object to the provision of fresh opportunities to put further impositions on local authorities, particularly when the direct representatives of the people will have no say in the matter.  This section seems to me to be bringing into the Bill something for which the Bill was never intended from the beginning.  It is a completely new matter.  It proposes to give to the Minister a completely new power, a power which may result in a further heavy imposition on the ratepayers.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 20, Section 48 (1), to delete lines 63 and 64, and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;that is to say, sub-section (3) of Section 37, sub-section (3) of Section 38, paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) of Section 39, sub-section (3) of Section 43, Section 45 and Section 47.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It will be recalled that on the Committee Stage of this Bill we inserted a Ministerial amendment enabling railway companies and canal companies to be included as persons or authorities that must be consulted in connection with the application of a bridge Order, and the other provisions of Part IV of the Bill.  Deputies will recall that there have been a number of judicial decisions whereby the maintenance of a bridge over a railway is partly the responsibility of the railway.</P>
      <P>This amendment is purely a consequential one.  Once the amendment was put in on the Committee Stage, this amendment becomes necessary in order that a railway company or a canal company will take part in all the consultations and be provided with the plans for the building or the reconstruction of a bridge and be provided also with the preliminary report on the cost of such construction or reconstruction.</P>

I do not know that I <Col N="2403" /> have ever seen an amendment drafted in such a way.  It talks about sub-section (3) of Section 37, sub-section (3) of Section 38, paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) of Section 39, sub-section (3) of Section 43, Section 45 and Section 47 &mdash;whatever all that means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If the Deputy looks at Section 48 of the Bill he will see that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a person other than a road authority is required by or under any Act to construct or maintain the bridge or a part of the bridge or to pay or to contribute to the expenses of such construction or maintenance the following portions of this Part of this Act shall have effect&rdquo;,</P>
      <P>and then it quotes certain portions.  We shall have further to amend the Bill in order that all the provisions of Part IV, which concern consultation or the forwarding of plans or decisions in connection with the bridge, shall apply to railway companies and canal companies; in other words, that they may be part and parcel of all negotiations in connection with an application for the making of a bridge Order.

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 25, before Section 60, line 53, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>60.&mdash;(1) One or more than one road authority may, with the consent of the Minister, make and carry out an agreement with a harbour authority to undertake jointly with the harbour authority the doing of anything in relation to the harbour of the harbour authority which the harbour authority are for the time being authorised by law to do.</P>
      <P>(2) A road authority may pay such proportion of the cost of anything undertaken jointly with a harbour authority in pursuance of an agreement under this section as is specified in the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2405" /> (3) A road authority which is the council of a county or the corporation of a county borough, may for the purpose of defraying expenses incurred by them under this section, borrow money under Article 22 of the Schedule to the Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order, 1898, in like manner as if such purposes were mentioned in that Article, and money so borrowed shall not be reckoned as part of the debt of such authority for the purposes of the said Article.</P>
    <P>(4) A road authority which is an urban authority may, for the purposes of defraying expenses incurred by them under this section, borrow money under the Public Health Acts, 1878 to 1931, as if such purposes were purposes for which such authority is authorised to borrow under those Acts, and money so borrowed shall not be reckoned as part of the debt of such authority for the purposes of any limitation on borrowing imposed by those Acts.</P>
    <P>(5) Money borrowed pursuant to this section may be lent to a road authority by means of an issue from the Local Loans Fund as if such loan constituted a local loan within the meaning of the Local Loans Fund Acts, 1935 to 1945, and was authorised by an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>(6)  In this section, the expression &ldquo;harbour authority&rdquo; means a harbour authority within the meaning of the Harbours Act, 1946 (No. 9 of 1946).</P>
    <P>There was a section in the Harbours Act, Section 161, authorising harbour authorities, with the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to make and carry out agreements with other persons, to undertake works jointly, and to pay a proportion of the cost.  This new section is intended to enable local authorities, with the consent of the Minister for Local Government, to make, carry out and undertake work with harbour authorities and jointly to pay a proportion of the cost. Section 161 covered the construction of roads in the neighbourhood of towns where there is joint responsibility between a local authority and the harbour authority.  It makes it possible <Col N="2406" /> for a local authority to carry out road work on behalf of a harbour authority and to make an agreement for the maintenance and construction of the road to be apportioned between the two bodies.</P>

This is simply a voluntary undertaking to be carried out in respect to roads.  Should the cost exceed the amount in the original agreement there will have to be another agreement.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  This amendment was inserted because it was felt desirable in some cases for harbour authorities to initiate the construction of roads.  In a particular town, where there is a harbour adjacent to it, it might be considered desirable to construct a new road or to alter an existing road.  Obviously, the main reason for including such a road would be to increase harbour facilities.  It would not be a matter primarily for the local authority but they could combine with the harbour authority and make a joint agreement.</P>

      <P>There may be a case of a harbour authority deciding to construct a new building, and they might <Col N="2408" /> think it desirable to have a road reconstructed or widened.  The reconstruction of the road might have some value to the people living in the adjacent area.  If there is no agreement between the local authority and the harbour authority, it is obviously up to the harbour authority to pay the full cost of the work, if they so desire, for their own good, in order to increase the value of their own property and their own amenities; but if they can make an agreement with the local authority and if the local authority is willing to pay towards the cost because they think they will benefit, that section of the Bill becomes operative.</P>

    <P>64.&mdash;(1) Subject to this section, the council of an urban district or the <Col N="2409" /> commissioners of a town may apply to the Government to make an Order under this section changing the name of the urban district or town.</P>
    <P>(2) The council of an urban district shall not make an application under this section unless&mdash;</P>

    <P>(3)  The commissioners of a town shall not make an application under this section unless either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) (i)  four-sevenths of the ratepayers in the town have consented to the application being made, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the council of the county in which the town is situate have also consented to the application being made, or</P>
    <P>(b) (i) the commissioners have by resolution passed before the commencement of this section, purported to change the name of the town, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the Minister certifies that such resolution has been adopted by the commissioners and that the new name specified in such resolution has been used for official purposes.</P>
    <P>(4) (a)  The power conferred by sub-section (1) of this section shall be a reserved function.</P>
    <P>(b)  the giving by the council of a county of consent to the making of an application under this section shall be a reserved function.</P>
    <P>(5)  The Minister may make regulations prescribing the procedure to be followed in ascertaining for the purposes of this section whether not less than four-sevenths of the ratepayers of an urban district or a town consent to an application being made under this section for an Order changing the name of the urban district or town.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2410" /> (6)  The council of a county shall before consenting to an application being made under this section consult the prescribed persons.</P>
    <P>(7) (a)  Where an application is duly made under this section by the council of an urban district or the commissioners of a town, the Government may by Order change the name of the urban district or the town to such other name as they think fit.</P>
    <P>(b)  An Order under this sub-section shall come into operation on the 1st day of January next following the expiration of six months from the date of the Order.</P>
    <P>(8)  Every Order made under sub-section (7) of this section shall be published in such manner and as often as the Minister may direct and shall be notified to the prescribed persons.</P>
    <P>(9)  Where an Order is made under this section changing the name of an urban district from its existing name to a new name, then, as on and from the date on which the Order comes into operation every reference in any instrument, document or map to the existing name shall be construed as a reference to the new name.</P>

    <P>(6) (a)  Where an application, in relation to any townland or non-municipal town, is duly made under this section, the Government may by Order change the name of the townland or non-municipal town to such other name as they think fit.</P>
    <P>(b)  An Order under this sub-section shall come into operation on the 1st day of January next following the expiration of six months from the date of the Order.</P>
    <P>(7)  Every Order made under sub-section (6) of this section shall be published in such manner and as often as the Minister may direct and <Col N="2413" /> shall be notified to the prescribed persons.</P>

I have in mind the district known as Pearse Park in my town where there are something like 14 streets, comprising 320 houses.

      <P>That is a point which is sometimes overlooked.  The point raised here is somewhat difficult.  I do not know whether the name of the park is one which has any legal significance.  It is merely a popular description of the district, it will be necessary to change it by usage.  If, on the other hand, it is a name of which official notice is taken in some official State document, I confess that there is no provision in this Bill, or, so far as I know, in the law, for the changing of the name of a district inside an urban area as distinct from changing the name of a street.  If the district were outside the urban area, we could I think, follow the procedure in amendment No. 26&mdash;if, for instance, it were a townland&mdash;but I must say that this point has never arisen before and I have not adverted to it.</P>

      <P>To make myself more clear, the position is that, when we were developing the town and embarking on a large scheme of houses, we went in on virgin soil and built some 320 houses.  We gave the district the official name of Patrick Pearse Park.  In that district, there are a number of streets&mdash;something like a dozen all told&mdash;and I want to know if the council will have power to change the name of Pearse Park by getting the assent of four-sevenths of the ratepayers, <Col N="2416" /> or will it be necessary to change the name of each street?  That is the problem.  I know it is a little complicated.</P>

    <P>In the Bill we propose to confer on local authorities power to acquire land sometimes in advance of the specific need.  The point was made, I think, by Deputy Allen, that as the law stood at present apparently the power to dispose of land acquired by a county council is vested in the county manager, and he suggested that we should formulate some procedure whereby this could only be done after due notice being given to the elected members of the local authority and that the elected members should be given power to object or, if necessary, to modify the terms upon which the disposal should take place.  This amendment provides for that.</P>

      <P>I have a case in point.  We had a piece of idle property and the manager let it on a monthly tenancy.  The tenant came along a year afterwards and applied to the corporation for a lease.  Of course the granting of a lease is our function and not the function of the manager.  They get in the thin edge of the wedge and then they drive the wedge in the whole way. I think the Minister ought to give serious consideration to that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points which I should like to have made clear by the Minister.  So far as I read sub-section (b), the local authority may resolve either to agree <Col N="2421" /> or to disagree.  There is no provision made here for any amendment or for any compromise.  For instance, the manager may want to dispose of a piece of property at a certain figure or under certain conditions.  The local authority has no power.  Do you see the point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I think the Deputy has not adverted to the significance of the word &ldquo;resolved&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;are resolved that the disposal shall be carried out in accordance with the terms specified in the resolution&rdquo;. The act of resolving is expressed.  You understand that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I see that. Now, there is one other point with regard to the method of disposal of any property, whether it is land, houses, or otherwise, that is covered by this. Is there any machinery provided?  Is it to be disposed of after it has been advertised for public tender, the ratepayers and the public generally being informed that a piece of land, say, the property of the local authority is to be disposed of?  Or, is it to be within the competence of the county manager, if he so desires, to tell one individual, or a number of individuals, that he proposes to dispose of this land and &ldquo;I will be glad if you will give me a price for it&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the manager must take the initiative in this matter.  It is the manager himself who proposes to dispose of this land and it is he who is bound to look for the best price he can get.  Therefore he must advertise the fact publicly that he is prepared to dispose of it.  The manager is bound to dispose of the land at the best price he can get for it.  There is only one way of testing that and that is to invite applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons why I raised that point is that I have a recollection that a member of the Minister's own Party raised a question here in the House quite recently as to the disposal of a piece of land in County Dublin.  I do not know anything about that beyond what I heard here in this House.  The allegation <Col N="2422" /> was that it was not advertised and that neither the ratepayers nor the people in the locality generally got an equal opportunity.  I am concerned only with seeing that the machinery (1) which is likely to give every citizen an equal opportunity, and (2) which is likely to bring the best price to the local authority is carried out.  I think, if that obligation is not already there, the sooner it is put there the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And it is there so far as the manager is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJosephBroderi" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the manager is extremely foolish to undertake such a liability and to leave himself open to the possibility of suspicion by not associating with the local authority.  In his own interests I think it would be extremely foolish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. L.J. Walsh Mr. L.J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not the local authority be informed under this Bill of the making of a lease by the manager? Is it not necessary that two members of the local authority shall witness the sealing of that document? If the members refuse to sign surely the manager has then got to bring it before the local authority?  The practice is that where a lease is given by the county manager at least two members of the local authority must witness the sealing of that lease.  In that way the manager cannot grant a lease without acquainting the local authority, at least, through two of its members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJosephBroderi" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LaurenceJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. L.J. Walsh Mr. L.J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat disappointed to hear expressions of opinion here from members of local authorities commenting upon the disposal of public property.  We have a very large estate in the neighbourhood of Drogheda, which is known to the Minister.  When the lease expires, it is not to the manager we apply for a renewal of the lease; it is to the corporation. We then sit down and consider the application and decide upon the term and the figure.  If there is a piece of property to be disposed of we also sit down and consider it; tenders are invited publicly and are considered by the corporation.  Then when we have made our decision it is handed over to the manager to execute.  But <Col N="2423" /> we are the people who make the decisions. There seems to be some ambiguity here, judging by the expressions of opinions of some of the members; that should be clarified.  It is the elected representatives of the people who have the buying and the selling. That is specifically laid down in the Managerial Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the procedure here is that the manager will proceed to advertise the property first, according to this amendment, to discover the person to whom it is proposed to dispose of it.  When he has discovered that person he then gets the sanction of the local authority.  I am in agreement with Deputy Walsh that the procedure ought to be as he has outlined it.  The local authority ought to deal with such a matter themselves and their consent ought to be secured. If the county manager advertises the property that he is going to sell and then comes along to the local authority to get their consent it will be much more difficult to get their consent in that case than if they were consulted in the first instance.  The amendment, as drafted, does not provide for consultation at all.  The manager proceeds to dispose of the property; before it is finally disposed of he must get the consent of the local authority.  I do not think that procedure is wise and I do not think it is going to make for harmony between the manager and the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>You see the position is not quite so simple as Deputy Hughes would like to make it.  Now Deputy Walsh is dealing with an old-established local authority which is in possession of considerable corporate property.  Under the managerial Acts the right to dispose of corporate property, in the city or urban district, is reserved to the elected body.  Outside of that there is property held for specific purposes by local authorities, which is not corporate property. <Col N="2424" /> Hitherto the manager had power of disposal over that.  The reason is that, in order to ensure that the executive functions of the Council are vested in the manager, that has been accepted as the procedure which is likely to be the most businesslike one.  There was a flaw in it, to which Deputy Allen directed my attention&mdash;a flaw which might become a very serious one now that we are giving local authorities power to acquire property in advance of a specific need &mdash;that is, in anticipation of plans which, perhaps, at the moment have not been very definitely formulated.  In that event, if the local authority is going to acquire land in that way, it has to provide for the acquisition of the land the money necessary for acquiring the land; therefore, before the manager can enter into any commitment he must be certain that the acquisition will be approved of by the local authority to the extent that they will be prepared to accept the financial obligations involved.  But it is an entirely different matter when land has to be disposed of because then the manager does not have to go to the local authority and say: &ldquo;You must provide me with money&rdquo;, because by disposing of the land he is in a position to put himself in funds.  That, as I say, was a flaw in the section as originally drafted.  This is now intended to deal with that situation and to ensure that where property which has been acquired in anticipation of a specific need has to be disposed of the matter will be brought to the notice of the members of the local authority concerned so that they will be in a position to approve of such disposal, or to suggest amended terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we must remember that county managers are beginning to learn that they have got to work in close association with the elected body; they are now beginning to understand that.  I take it, once we have a procedure such as that laid down in the Act, any manager, who is fit to be a manager, will settle with his own council, before he proceeds to advertise, before any specific purchaser who comes along the terms upon which he may be permitted to dispose of this property.  Having <Col N="2425" /> settled those terms in advance, he is then bound under Section 202 of the Public Health Act, where he is acting and his council proposes to dispose of property, to dispose of it at the best price that can be got for it.  The onus will be on him to show to the auditor that he took every practicable step to ensure that the best price was got. The one thing that he would have to do would be to advertise the fact that he was prepared to dispose of the property on terms and to ask for tenders.  On the basis of those tenders he would go back to the council and satisfy them that the transaction was a <i>bona fide</i> one.</P>

    <P>(3)  Where a road authority sell or transfer any land to a person under sub-section (2) of this section, they may make the sale or transfer subject to such conditions (including conditions requiring that person to fence such land in with other lands and to permit it to be occupied with other lands) as the road authority think fit.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 32:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 27, before Section 67, line 13, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>67.&mdash;(1)  An urban authority may borrow for the purposes of defraying any expenses incurred by them in the construction and maintenance of roads in the same manner in which a sanitary authority may borrow for the purposes of defraying expenses under the Public Health Acts, 1878 to 1931.</P>
      <P>(2)  The provisions of the Public Health Acts, 1878 to 1931, in relation to borrowing by a sanitary authority shall, with the necessary modifications, apply in relation to any borrowing under this section by an urban authority.</P>
      <P>(3)  Money borrowed under this section may be lent to an urban authority by means of an issue from the local loans fund as if such loan constituted a loan within the meaning of the Local Loans Fund Acts, 1935 to 1945, and was authorised by an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is to remove a doubt regarding the power of urban councils to borrow money for the construction of roads <Col N="2428" /> and bridges.  In sub-section (3) of the proposed amendment, third line, before the word &ldquo;loan&rdquo; I would propose to make a verbal amendment&mdash;to insert the word &ldquo;local&rdquo; so that the line will read: &ldquo;as if such loan constituted a local loan within the meaning of the Local Loans Fund Acts, 1935 to 1945.&rdquo;  There is a definition in the Local Loans Act of &ldquo;local loan.&rdquo;  We want this to remove doubts raised as to the power of authorities to raise loans for the construction of roads and bridges.</P>

It is a county-at-large charge in some counties where sanitary services are provided for the towns, but that is because the county council is the sanitary authority and I presume they have agreed not to have a special area of charge for the purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>He can do it.  He need not bring it in as an item.  There is an allocation of one-third of the county council charges under the heading of &ldquo;other charges&rdquo; and we do not know what they are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We know through certain channels, but, under the law, in the estimate each year one-third of the revenues that the county council are asked to raise is put under the heading of &ldquo;other charges&rdquo;.  There is nothing to stop the manager putting under the heading of &ldquo;other charges&rdquo; the lighting of a town or some other function that they are already performing. When you change the law in this measure you make no provision for ensuring that the services performed in the past by the town commissioners will be performed in the future.  You have relieved them of the burden of loans and you have made that the <Col N="2431" /> responsibility of the county council.  Is not that so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is Chairman of the Wexford County Council and, if he is, I will direct his attention to Section 27 of the Management Act.  He seems to be under the impression that the manager can do these things.  If, under this heading of &ldquo;other charges&rdquo;, there is reason to believe that the manager is providing for the lighting of a town&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If so, it could only be with the consent of the county council, because under Section 27 every county manager, when requested by a chairman of a council, shall afford all information as may be in his possession or procurement in regard to any act, matter or thing pertaining to any business or transaction be in his possession or procurement in of the council.  This must be a peculiar difficulty in Wexford, because the Deputy has suggested that it is difficult to get information from the manager about anything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said that. Under your official documents the manager must present the council with the details of the estimates.  There are <Col N="2432" /> several headings and one-third of the revenues are provided under one heading. There may be £30,000 or £25,000 under that heading.

      <P>I can see friction arising between county councils and town commissioners in certain directions.  There are certain services that they should provide, that are not provided.  Formerly the county council or the board of health took over services such as sanitation, water, scavenging and road-making that the town commissioners could have provided for themselves under the Towns Improvement Act.  I can see friction arising in the future between these authorities as to whether it should be a county-at-large or a town charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>This comes as a surprise to me.  The only statutory obligation for a county-at-large charge is roads.  Sewerage, water supplies and other schemes are simply at the option of the county council to indicate what will be the area of charge.  The manager can only go on the area of charge <Col N="2433" /> and on the amount decided by the county councils.  He makes provision for the scheme in the demand note. The whole thing is quite simple and I never heard anyone question it.  The manager or the secretary of the county council can only proceed to do what the council has instructed him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to discuss this Estimate as far as possible in a non-controversial way and, where I am critical, I am critical with a view to making suggestions to the Minister, because I agree with what some other Deputies have said, that, in recent years, we have experienced from the Minister in charge of this Department a desire, if not to grant every request made by Deputies on behalf of their constituents, at least to examine and investigate them very fully and with an open and sympathetic mind.  That type of approach to Parliament by a Minister always produces a healthy response and reaction inside Parliament.</P>
      <P>This Vote, like every other Vote, keeps in step with the fashions in so far as the fashions appear to be higher and higher and it is in step in so far as it goes up from year to year.  From the point of view of a resident in the City of Dublin, I must say that the people of Dublin are compensated for the increasing expenditure and increasing cost, because postal services all round in the City of Dublin have reached such a high degree of excellence that they could compare more than favourably with similar services rendered to the people of any other European capital.  To that extent, I feel bound to congratulate the Minister and his Department.  Their service in Dublin is excellent.  Faults reported and complaints passed on are very expeditiously attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say that the telephone service has gone ahead very much in the City of Dublin.  That does not apply to the country.  I think that it could be argued that the telephone service is being advanced and developed and made more excellent and more efficient in the City of Dublin at the expense of the country subscribers and of country taxpayers.  The telephone service in Dublin, as I have said, is excellent.  In the provinces, the telephone service is primitive, antediluvian, which, I think, does not show <Col N="2438" /> either sound administration or sound salesmanship.  People have to get accustomed to the telephone, like a great number of other articles.  The first article cannot be just placed on the market according to the strict sense of profit and loss.  The first second or third article must be placed on the market by way of advertisement and in order to make the person who has not got that article feel that it is good business to have it.  Consequently, if the telephone service is to be extended and generally used throughout the country, then there must be a loss faced on the earlier telephones.  This system of cutting off a town or area or district or village at 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening is entirely unreasonable and, in comparison with the service given in the City of Dublin, I have no hesitation in saying that it is definitely unjust.  People in the country who get in a telephone get it in very frequently with a view to an emergency situation.  They are cut off the telephone at the time when it is impossible to send a telegram.  I have, like other Deputies representing country constituencies, repeatedly made representations with regard to towns, not always small towns.  The reply is always courteous, but it is the reply of the person who wants to balance two sides of a ledger: that it does not pay to extend the telephone in that particular area; that they have not sufficient users; that there is not sufficient revenue coming from that particular area.  If that was the mentality of the pioneers of the telephone service, it would never have become an instrument of international use.</P>
    <P>I have one particular town in mind, the town of Mountrath.  A very influential and representative committee from every angle made representations with regard to the telephone service for that town and the reply was that what they asked for could not be done.  In recent years an all-night telephone line was run to Ballyfin College, passing by that town.  In that case, it is not a question of having a special staff, it is not a case of keeping any exchange open all night.  The Port-laoighise exchange is an all-night exchange and Ballyfin is linked up with <Col N="2439" /> that exchange.  It is merely a case of linking the town of Mountrath by night with the Ballyfin line.  I think consideration should be given to a situation of that kind that does not carry with it the cost that it would entail in any other town where you had not an all-through line running right beside the town.</P>
    <P>Then there is another suggestion I would make to the Minister.  There are facilities within the Post Office when anybody changes his address temporarily to have his letters forwarded to the new address.  In 99 out of 100 cases a telegram is a more urgent thing than a letter.  Even if it means an extra charge, I think a telegram should be sent on to the new address where the Post Office have already been notified that the person is residing <i>pro tem.</i>  I think it is scarcely reasonable merely to send on letters when a person has filled up a form and given notice of his new address and that a telegram should be forwarded to the new address.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a further point with regard to the Post Office service generally.  Here we have a service making a big profit.  I think it is the biggest employing Department outside the Army in emergency times.  In regard to the conditions of service and pay, I think it sets a very bad example to other employers.  When you take the standard of education, of reliability, of sobriety, of character, and of honesty that is required before a man is appointed as an ordinary rural postman, I think that the rates of pay are entirely unsuitable and inequitable and that some little fraction of the profits being made should at least be turned back so as to make the conditions of service and the conditions of living of the workers, particularly the rural postmen, a little bit more attractive. It is not sufficient to say that they have an emergency bonus.  The emergency bonus is a matter of general application.  It is not a case of trying to keep step with the cost of living, but of trying to keep in sight of the cost of living.  Whatever may be said about private employers, a Government Department should aim at <Col N="2440" /> making the income of the individual servant keep reasonably and steadily with the cost of living.  Particularly in a State where prices are controlled by the Government, it would be reasonable to say that, if the cost of living has gone up, it has gone up, if not with Government assistance, then with Government connivance or approval.</P>
    <P>That being the situation, there is a very definite and clear responsibility on the Government to see that their own paid servants get a remuneration in line, in agreement, or in harmony with the cost of living arranged or devised or approved by the Government. I can never understand why subordinate workers are kept in temporary acting positions for an indefinite length of time&mdash;in some cases, years.  It would be entirely unworthy to suggest that such a state of affairs could be condoned by the tiny saving effected in pension.  I think it arises merely from a lack of alertness.  I do not suppose it happens in the City of Dublin; but it is not unusual to find a person filling the position of a temporary acting rural postman from one year to another. Now the effect of that can only be bad.  The individual in question is a good type of man; otherwise he would not hold the position he is in. He is there under conditions of &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass.&rdquo;  He is there merely from day to day with no security of tenure and no confidence or certainly that he is going to be kept in permanent employment.  The result is that that particularly outstanding type of man looks for employment elsewhere and the service must thereby in the long run lose by that type of policy.  When a service, such as Posts and Telegraphs, loses a good man through that policy it means that the people served by it lose in turn.  I think it is reasonable enough for big employing Departments to have a man as a probationer, and even to have a fairly long probationary period.  That is quite a different matter, because that man has actually been appointed and he has got a position subject to a satisfactory probationary period.  I am referring to the situation where positions are filled by temporary acting men existing, as far as I know, on a week to week or month to month tenure of <Col N="2441" /> office and for a very considerable length of time.  Those are the only remarks I have to make in connection with this particular Vote, and I hope the Minister will not think, because I have spent the greater portion of the time on criticism rather than on praise, that as a Deputy speaking in a representative capacity, I am not appreciative of the fact that this is a Department which in the main has given satisfaction to the people and a Minister who in the main has given, if not always a sympathetic ear, certainly an open ear to matters to which his attention is drawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a few suggestions to put before the Minister. The first is that, now the emergency period is over and there is a possibility of getting increased supplies of material for this particular Department, I would ask the Minister to pay particular attention to the rural areas and to rural post offices to which no telephone line has yet been extended.  In many parts of Mayo I know that people in some areas suffer a good deal because of the lack of telephone services, particularly at night time where they may be seven or eight miles from the nearest telephone. Losses of stock have arisen because of this lack; very often there are urgent calls for doctors&mdash;I will not say it actually means loss of life, but it sails very close to it, and I would appeal very strongly to the Minister, the moment material becomes available to extend branch lines to those areas.  The last speaker spoke about the cutting off of the rural areas from the towns at night.  I remember not so very long ago there was an urgent call from a country post office.  The post mistress on the particular occasion was good enough to open the post office and endeavour to make contact with the town.  She actually did so but it then appeared that there was some regulation which prevented the official in the town from putting the call through.  The next best thing he could do was to ask the person who wanted to make the call to come into the town and approach a private subscriber there to put the call through.  I cannot see why a regulation of that nature should stand.  Evidently there was an official in the post office <Col N="2442" /> to take night calls.  If he could take calls from a private subscriber in the town I do not see why he could not have taken the call from the country post office.  There is one further suggestion I want to make to the Minister and that is that, if at all convenient, telephone kiosks should be available to the public outside the post office so that the public could go in at any hour of the day or night and get in touch with the local town during the off hours in the rural post office.</P>
      <P>There is definite uneasiness and instability amongst rural postmen who are working merely on a day to day employment basis.  They are not established. They have no security of tenure and there is no pension for them at the end of their term.  It might be argued that they are only part-time.  Some of them because of the size of their particular beat are whole-time.  Some of them have to leave their homes as early as 7 o'clock in the morning to take up duty and do not return home until 2 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon.  It is my experience that they are pretty well tired out after their day's work and if they have any little bit of land or any other side line, the working of it generally devolves on the wives and children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that that insecurity is responsible in some cases for little failures on the part of the postmen. Now and again we come across cases where rural postmen do not deliver the mails in the proper way.  Now, lest there should be any misapprehension, what I am referring to is cases where I know myself circular letters and other little articles, such as periodicals going through the post, which are adjudged by the postman to be of not very much importance, are left aside for a few days until he meets the people at Mass on Sunday, or something like that.  If there was more security of office I do not think this sort of thing would happen.  I want to make it plain that nothing really serious has ever occurred or been brought to my notice.  Nevertheless these little things are happening. I would ask the Minister not to take any serious notice of them beyond, perhaps, a reprimand.  I would not <Col N="2443" /> like that a rural postman should be discharged for some minor fault.  But I would ask the Minister to take these things into consideration.  We have heard complaints from time to time of where rent receipts have not been delivered in the more remote areas bcause the postman has to travel long distances to deliver them.  That has caused a lot of trouble with the Land Commission.  People were waiting for their rent receipts and did not get them.  The next thing that happened was the Land Commission served them with a six days' notice.  Neither the Land Commission nor the party was actually responsible.  I think if postmen were given more security these little things, which must be most exasperating to all concerned, would not occur.</P>
    <P>There is one further suggestion which I would like to put before the Minister with regard to the present colour of postmen's uniforms.  Postmen as a rule like to keep themselves fairly trim and neat, but on dusty roads in the summer time they often come home from their beat as white as a miller.  I would suggest&mdash;and this has been adopted in some countries&mdash;that the colour should be changed to either a grey or a greenish-grey, or some colour that would not show the dust so much.  It should not mean any additional cost.  It is only a minor matter if you like.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider seriously the giving of a pension to postmen at the age of 65 until such time as they become eligible for an old age pension.  At the present time postmen are ineligible because they may have some other little means, and they have to wait until they are 70.</P>
    <P>There should be some pension and some little recognition for their services. This is one of the Government Departments about which there were few complaints.  It is a service which gives every satisfaction.  I think the whole Department is fairly well managed from the Minister down. One never hears of any serious charge or discourtesy against them.  Postmasters and postmistresses also have their duties increased very considerably <Col N="2444" /> and I suggest they are seriously underpaid.  I think there should be a complete overhaul of the whole system.  Their duties hold them down to the job from eight in the morning until six or seven at night and sometimes eight, and then there is always some odd caller. There is somebody always dropping in, particularly in the rural districts, for something or another.  These are the major things.  One reference was made on the adjournment debate on the subject of the appointment of rural postmen.  The Minister accused me on that occasion of bullying postmasters.  In his reply, I would like him to state who they were and where they were.  I will admit I asked information from postmasters on different occasions and I always found them very courteous and kind.  I never bullied a postmaster and I cannot see why a responsible Minister of State should stand up and say I bullied any postmaster.  When he is replying, I would like him to say who were the postmasters I bullied and when, as it is a very serious charge against a Deputy.  I challenge him to show one tittle of proof.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cupla rud a chur os comhair an Aire.  There are a few matters I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister.  The delivery of letters to County Westmeath from Dublin takes two days.  Letters posted to-day in Dublin will not be delivered in any place outside Mullingar until Friday.  My statement is a statement of fact.  Town improvements committees in Delvin, Killucan and Castle-pollard have made representations to the local postal authorities to do something about it.  The explanation was that a letter posted to-day got to Mullingar but that they had not got time to sort them until to-morrow and consequently they were not delivered until Friday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be better to put into operation the pre-war system where the post car left with the evening post.  What use is there in waiting for the train to come in and one or two letters picked out and the train waiting there for an hour or so?  I would like the Minister and the Department <Col N="2445" /> to examine that matter.  The early morning train could be delayed for an hour or so so that the letters could be sorted and sent out.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to the overloading of the telephone service and to the long delay getting a call through.  We can all understand the shortage of material, but I do put it to the Department that the telephone exchange in Mullingar is overworked and overloaded and the staff are not able to cope with the work passing through. I do not know of any trunk call going through in less than two hours during the emergency.  Before one o'clock and after two o'clock are the most difficult periods and in fact people tell me that other people put through a call and often forget about it until the call comes through about four hours after, the distance being only 50 miles. People from outside districts admit that the work is too big for Mullingar.</P>
    <P>The other matter I want to refer to is the delivery of letters on the train. Meath letters go by train, but Westmeath letters go by bus.  I live approximately four miles from the Meath border, but in the parish of County Meath.  If I post a letter in my parish it takes three days for that letter to be delivered.  I challenge anyone to contradict that.  I post the letter and it goes into Mullingar and then it has to go on to the line It takes three days, two to go out.  We might as well be sending letters to Northumberland as sending them to County Meath.  I had an experience yesterday.  I sent a telegram to a businessman in Oldcastle at 9.50 a.m. and it was some time after 12 when I got the reply.  He got my telegram half an hour after I sent it and he sent the reply to me immediately and it took two hours to come.  If anyone went on a bicycle to Oldcastle, eight miles away, he would have the reply back in that time.</P>
    <P>The Department did link up Athboy with Mullingar and now one can get a call in a reasonable time.  At a place like Oldcastle, some 10 miles from Castlepollard, one cannot get a call for hours.  I am talking about the delay in trunk calls to Dublin.  Very <Col N="2446" /> often one may be kept six hours in the case of Oldcastle, and that is no exaggeration.  The call may get lost and you ring up again and they say they are trying to get them.  Then they contact Kells or somewhere else. They tell you the call has to go through Navan and there is a hold-up in Navan and in Kells.  Anyone living there and having that experience can tell the Minister that I am not exaggerating.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the village of Delvin, which is in the County Westmeath, had its circuit through the County Meath.  There was one case where there was an urgent call.  The official putting the call through to the county hospital was waiting a considerable time in Delvin.  He went by motor car to a neighbouring town and, after putting the call through there, he was told by the post office that his first call was ready.  They have now linked up Delvin, Athboy and Mullingar and, notwithstanding the congestion in Mullingar, the result is that the local calls on that circuit go through quickly.  I suggest to the Minister that as it has been proved effective to make that link up with Athboy, it would be equally effective to have a link up with Oldcastle, Navan and Kells.</P>
    <P>These two counties adjoin and they have their businessmen, farmers and others who deserve to be facilitated. At the moment, so far as Meath and Westmeath are concerned, you might as well talk about Cork and Antrim, because the telephone service there would be just as quick, if not quicker. Why do we not have a carrier system the same as in other telephone services? We are told it would not pay to have it in Mullingar.  I believe it would pay and that Mullingar would justify the carrier system.</P>
    <P>Deputies have spoken about the work of rural postmasters and postmistresses. Some years ago there was an innovation in the form of a half-holiday. I noticed it at Milltown Pass and I could not understand why it was not extended to other places.  I see now it has been extended to Castle-pollard. That is a very good thing. The work of the Post Office has increased <Col N="2447" /> in every village year after year.  The officials need a rest.  They are brought in as apprentices and they are paid very little.  I am not talking now about officials of the Department. I am talking about the unfortunates who are brought in and who think there is a post office career before them.  They serve their time with no pay and then they get a little pay.  The half-holiday is a blessing to these individuals. It should be compulsory in every sub-office in the country.  Even in small villages where there are one or two shops the assistants have a half-holiday.  I suggest to the Minister that the half-holiday should be extended to other places in County Westmeath.  It is very desirable that there should be a half-holiday for the post office workers in the smaller villages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to emphasise the importance of having a daily postal delivery in every area.  It is very difficult for many people, particularly in rural areas, to deal with correspondence that may be a couple of days late.  There are many people who may not be at home when the postman arrives and a couple of days elapse before one can reply to a letter.  The farmers in the rural areas are complaining that the alternate day delivery is very unfair.  I suggest, now that the emergency is over and many men, ex-soldiers and others, are unemployed that the Minister should make some move to utilise them and so have a daily delivery.  There has been some grumbling in my area as regards the inadequate postal deliveries.  I get the post every second day and very often important letters have to be replied to and the delay in delivery causes much inconvenience.  I suggest the people are entitled to a daily delivery.  I hope the Minister will make an effort to see that the rural areas get a daily delivery for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important point is the need that exists for a pillar box in the Ballysaggart area.  The Minister knows that it is a thickly populated area.  He is also aware that during the emergency a considerable quantity of turf was produced there.  A lot of inconvenience was caused to merchants and others in <Col N="2448" /> Dungarvan and elsewhere because of the delay in delivering letters.  A very unsatisfactory position arose because they had not their letters in time.  The turf production there was very extensive&mdash;there were 4,000 tons produced last year.  I think the Minister should do all he possibly can to see that proper facilities are given to the people.  It is a very important area and the country people are entitled to the same postal facilities as are given in the villages and towns.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have referred to the unsatisfactory position of the telephone service.  I suppose during the emergency it was hard to meet all demands because of the scarcity of materials.  I hope the Minister will do all he can to improve the position.  I am aware of the difficulty of getting through to Dublin, to Government Departments.  On several occasions I could not obtain a telephone call.  I must say that the officials in the post office are quite courteous. In the Ballyduff area a complaint was made by a merchant who carries on a very big business there. He was very dissatisfied with the telephone service, to which he is a subscriber. I hope the Minister will see that the position in that area will be improved.  This man is an asset to the agricultural community.  It is time that the interests of the people were looked after.</P>

      <P>I wish to pay a tribute to the Minister and to the members of his staff for the courtesy and helpfulness that I have generally received from them, even when requests that I made on the Department were not granted.  At the same time I wish to call attention again to the telephone service in rural districts.  I speak particularly about County Waterford where, on several occasions, the disadvantage of not having the telephone has been stressed.  I refer to Grange, near Ardmore, where there is no telephone service, and where there appears to be no chance of getting it. An accident happened there some time ago, but there was no means of sending a telegram or ringing for a doctor. When the matter was brought to my notice I approached the Department, with a view to having a telephone installed but, as the emergency was on, <Col N="2449" /> it was not possible to do so on account of the scarcity of materials.  As this is the first occasion on which the Estimate has been before the House since the passing of the emergency, perhaps the Minister could now give some hope of the installation of the telephone in that district.  Another point is that in many places, not so remote, the telephone service closes down completely at 7 p.m.  People do not know that accidents will happen before 7 p.m., or that someone will get sick by 7 p.m. For that reason I ask the Minister, even though the telephone service may have to be run at a loss rather than at a profit, to have the hours of the service extended after 7 p.m. every day in the week.  On Sunday last I happened to ring up somebody who was ill in a country district, and I was told that I could not get in touch with a subscriber on any Sunday; that the only way to do so was through the Civic Guard.</P>
      <P>As well as having the service extended after 7 o'clock, we should have a Sunday service for all subscribers seeing that they have to pay for the installation, as well as a yearly rent and for calls.  If necessary the service should be run at a loss for one year so as to give service rather than no service and a profit.  Some Deputies referred to the country postal services. In the year 1946 every citizen in the Twenty-Six Counties should have at least one service daily.  I ask the Minister to try to speed up the service in that respect.  In some places people are so cut off for want of the telephone, as well as a daily postage service, that they seem to be forgotten. That is what they say in the country. I do not want to be taken as saying anything vindictive, but I ask the Minister to take a note of the matters to which I refer.  I trust he will appreciate that I am not mentioning them out of antagonism to the Department, because I received every courtesy and helpful suggestion there. The points that I have now mentioned are pertinent, and I am sure are known to other Deputies.</P>

      <P>It is significant that the revenue from telegraphs has increased despite the huge increase in the telephone <Col N="2450" /> service.  I do not know whether that is due to the emergency or if it will remain a permanent feature of the Estimate.  One would imagine that if there was an enormous increase in the use of the telephone, there would be a decrease in revenue from telegraphs. Presumably in peace time the revenue from telephones will continue to increase, and that revenue from telegraphs will decrease.  It is obvious from the Minister's figures that the telephone is coming more and more into common use as an indispensable adjunct to business people as well as private individuals.  That being so, it should be the Minister's aim to give those who use the telephone a more efficient service.  Deputy O'Higgins spoke of the efficiency of the service in Dublin.  I only wish that I could say that the same efficient service was given to country subscribers.</P>
      <P>Anybody who is in the habit of using the telephone a great deal, especially for trunk calls, must have been exasperated on many occasions because of the abnormal delays that take place The Minister apparently anticipated such criticism as, in his statement, he referred to the difficulty of securing equipment.  I have been a Deputy for 25 years, and year after year I have heard complaints made against the Department of Posts and Telegraphs about the abnormal delay, especially in trunk calls, from country towns to Dublin and from one part of the State to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that due to the lack of equipment the Department has not in recent years been able to give efficient service, but the same complaints were made in normal times, when there was no difficulty about getting equipment.  There should not have been such difficulty in providing circuits which would give an efficient trunk service.  It is time that the Department became really alive to the supreme importance of the telephone service to commercial, professional and private citizens.  We should aim at giving the people as efficient service as is given in Great Britain.  Services in country towns and districts should be as efficient as those in Dublin or in the Dáil.  It happens on occasions that <Col N="2451" /> the service improves with a change of postmasters.  I came to the conclusion that inefficiency depended to a great extent on the type of personnel in charge in different areas.  It should be the ambition of the Minister to provide an efficient service throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Some months ago, I asked a question here as to the conditions in Sligo Post Office.  Over a number of years, the officials there have been trying to get more accommodation.  They have petitioned the Minister and the Secretary of the Post Office on a number of occasions to have certain reconstruction work carried out, so that the staff would be able to carry out their duties in a more expeditious way and so that better facilities would be provided for the public as well.  In a Supplementary Question, I referred especially to the conditions in the telephone room, which I described as appalling.  If there was a stronger adjective, I would be inclined to use it on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The Minister denied that the conditions were as bad as I described them, but I repeat that the conditions are disgraceful, and, as a matter of fact, if such a set of conditions existed in any private business or institution, I am perfectly certain that the proprietor of the business house or the people in charge of the institution would be made amenable to the law.  These applications have been made on numerous occasions for the purpose of having better conditions provided in the Sligo Post Office, and, in response to these applications, officials from the Post Office and from the Board of Works have been sent down.  Promises have been made on many occasions that a change would be effected as speedily as possible, and only this week certain officials were down there carrying out another inspection.  I do not know how many inspections have been carried out, but the people in the post office there must have lost count of them, and probably another half-dozen or dozen inspections will be carried out before anything is done.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that it is rather carrying the joke too far to be wasting the time of officials and spending <Col N="2452" /> public money in such a manner without effecting any improvements whatever in the abominable conditions which exist there.  I sincerely hope, now that equipment is becoming available&mdash;I hope that in a few months' time ample equipment will be available&mdash;he will take steps to see that a change in the conditions in Sligo Post Office is brought about, to see that proper conditions are established there not alone for the staff in charge of the telephones but for the officials in the post office section of the building.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister has made some provision for an improvement in rural deliveries, and I sincerely hope it is the first step towards the establishment of daily deliveries in rural areas.  I intended to say much more on this point, but, in view of the fact that the Minister has made some provision for an improvement in the number of deliveries, I merely say that I hope he will go a further step next year or the year after that and will establish a daily delivery in all the rural areas.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to refer to the pay of post office staffs generally.  I refer not to postmen but to post office staffs generally.  In comparison with other branches of the service, they are, relatively speaking, a badly paid staff, and in view of the importance of the duties they carry out, I think they deserve to be treated at any rate as fairly and as decently as the staffs of other Government Departments.  It is a most exacting service, a service which requires a high sense of responsibility, a high sense of efficiency and a high sense of integrity in those engaged in it, and I think the Minister should show his appreciation of the qualities and abilities which he requires from the staff by compensating them adequately for the services they perform. I hope the opinions given expression to here to-day will influence the Minister towards giving consideration to that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister broke some new ground this year in the course of his introductory remarks on his Estimate.  He took occasion to tell the House that, during the year, he was infected with the spirit of reform and had decided to do as he had been often <Col N="2453" /> asked to do, namely, to abolish that detestable form of employment, part-time labour in the telephone service. Happily, that was abolished during the year, and I think everybody rejoices in the fact that that evil is now behind us, but the Minister knows that he still has a notion of part-time employment in other branches of the Department, and I hope, now that he realises that part-time employment is such a detestable thing, that he will lose no time in applying his talents and his energies to the abolition of part-time employment in other branches of the service and will endeavour to organise the service on the basis of full-time employment.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us, too, that during the year the Department had decided to provide small motor cars instead of motor cycle combinations for post office linesmen.  That, too, was a welcome development, and when I heard the Minister speaking of it, I was reminded of the Biblical quotation: &ldquo;There is great joy in Heaven when the penitent sinner returns to the fold.&rdquo;  The fact that the Minister has seen fit during the year to substitute small motor vans for motor cycle combinations is evidence that he is making progress and that, for once, a spark of enlightenment has accidentally struck the Post Office Department.</P>
      <P>The Post Office, as the Minister might know, was not always as enlightened as it appears to have been during the year in the matter of providing these small vans.  I have some interesting letters here which were written away back in 1936, in which, with considerable profundity, the Post Office says that &ldquo;after examining the whole matter of providing small motor cars in lieu of motor cycle combinations, the Minister expresses very great regret that he is not able to sanction the proposal.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the Minister credit for what he did this year, and I hope the same progress will continue. In case anybody thinks that the Post Office changes its mind in the matter of being enlightened quickly, there was, two years later, another profound letter <Col N="2454" /> saying that the Minister had given the matter very careful consideration but that he was unable to find sufficient grounds to warrant a departure from the decision previously made and that he regretted he was unable to sanction the proposal; so that what the Minister was asked to do in every year since 1933 he was only able to do in 1946. The facts are the same in 1946 as they were in 1933.  Every year they were the same, but it took the Post Office 13 years to stagger towards this intelligent reform which both the British and Northern Ireland Post Office Departments carried out many years ago.</P>
      <P>However, I am glad to see that even the Minister has learned something and I am very glad to note that the Post Office has now made up its mind that it is not going to be the headquarters of conservatism in Ireland and that it will occasionally let a ray of intelligence into its administrative methods. I hope the Minister will make up his mind to come to the House next year with a rather formidable array of reforms long overdue like those which he introduced during the year and will tackle his new administration of the Post Office with some more human and intelligent outlook than we have so far seen in relation to a lot of matters.</P>
      <P>Deputy Roddy talked about the conditions in Sligo Post Office and other Deputies have had complaints to make about the accommodation in various other post offices.  The truth of the matter is that the whole post office accommodation problem is a perfect scandal. Anybody who knows anything about it, or who takes the trouble to find out anything about it, knows that, so far as accommodation in post offices is concerned, or so far as the planning of accommodation is concerned, the whole thing is a perfect joke.  The Post Office owns a wide variety of property all over the country and the section of the Minister's Department responsible for administering it could not look after a single establishment because the place is simply starved of staff.  There is no body of adequate staff to supervise the day-to-day requirements of the Post Office so far as accommodation is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The picture which Deputy Roddy painted with regard to the Sligo Post <Col N="2455" /> Office is perfectly true.  A blind man would realise it if he went down there, but Sligo is not an isolated example. It is symptomatic of what is happening all over the country.  If the Minister does not know it, let me quote a few cases.</P>
    <P>In the Ballina office for two years there were supervisors, surveyors, inspectors, engineers, contractors and tradesmen measuring up, surveying, and photographing the place.  After two years' pilgrimage of these people to Ballina, the post office is in the same chaotic condition from the point of view of accommodation as it was before the first of these pioneers trekked to the town.  Let us take another example&mdash;Claremorris.  Here is a description of the telephone exchange there, and after hearing it you will wonder how we get a telephone service at all.  The telephone exchange is about ten feet square and the staff consists of five.  Within these ten feet square accommodation has to be provided for three switchboards and other engineering equipment.  It is with accommodation of that kind, in a room ten feet square, with three switchboards, that the staff have to try to give a telephone service.</P>
    <P>Here is a picture of the Ennis telephone exchange.  The room is 15 ft. by 9½ ft.  It houses five people during the daytime and three from 7 to 11.30 p.m. and a night attendant as well. In addition to a switchboard measuring 7 ft. 3 in. by 2 ft., there are a table 5 ft. 4 inches by 2 ft., a test case 3 ft. 3 ins. by 1 ft. 6 in., five chairs, a radiator, etc.  That is the accommodation provided for the telephone exchange at Ennis, the nearest big town to Rineanna, about which the Minister indulges in speeches from time to time. How can you imagine a proper telephone service being provided there? There was a delay of four hours in trunk calls last year from Ennis, the town nearest to Rineanna, where you have the most modern equipment and the latest in the science of aeronautics.</P>
    <P>Now we come to Waterford to see what the position is there, a place for which the Minister has some responsibility. Here is a description of the <Col N="2456" /> telephone exchange there.  The telephone exchange was originally designed to accommodate six telephonists and a supervisor and only one set of switchboards.  On the introduction of the carrier trunk system the staff was increased and a second set of switchboards installed.  Representations made succeeded in having a small adjoining room added to the accommodation, which was a slight improvement at the time.  The position to-day is that there are 18 telephonists, plus one supervisor, accommodated in the room together with two sets of switchboards and other equipment installed on the introduction of carrier trunk system.</P>
    <P>That room, which was provided originally for seven people, has packed into it 19 people, plus two switchboards. Is it any wonder that it is difficult to give a proper telephone service with conditions of that kind? Is the Minister satisfied that his Department is working satisfactorily when you get conditions of that kind in telephone exchanges around the country?  As I said, anybody who knows the conditions of these offices&mdash; and the Minister might usefully undertake a tour of them&mdash;can see plainly that the Post Office has fallen down completely on the job of providing adequate accommodation, and that the volume and diversity of work has increased enormously without corresponding increase in the accommodation available for the staff.</P>
    <P>I have quoted four cases.  I could quote 54 if I were disposed to delay the House.  The Minister will have to watch the Post Office accommodation problem.  One of the first things necessary is to create a department capable of dealing promptly with demands for increased accommodation, capable of getting these matters put on their way quickly, and capable of sufficient elasticity to adjust accommodation to the growing volume of traffic that has to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Last year on this Estimate the question of providing pensions for auxiliary postmen was raised by a number of Deputies and I also raised the matter myself.  It was pointed out then that <Col N="2457" /> auxiliary postmen, that is part-time postmen, who may work 34 hours per week, who have rendered 40 years' service, may be compelled to retire and not receive one halfpenny compensation or pension or gratuity from the Post Office in return for all that service. The Minister was told then&mdash;he knew it already&mdash;that no good private employer would dare to treat an employee who rendered upwards of 40 years' service in the mean kind of way the Post Office treats auxiliary postmen. If they have been thrifty&mdash;and they can hardly be thrifty on the miserable pittance that masquerades as wages&mdash;they cannot get a grant even from the Minister's special fund, which is reserved exclusively for dealing with persons in necessitous circumstances. The Minister has been pleaded with to recognise the merits of the claim to grant pensions for auxiliary postmen in return for long and faithful service. The merits of the case have been portrayed for him time and time again. He ought to know that no good class employer in private industry would throw an employee out after 40 years' service and give him no compensation whatever.  Last year the Minister said that he would examine the matter and see what could be done.  I do not know whether he has given any consideration to it during the year.  In view of his promise to look into the matter, I hope he will tell us what he has found it possible to do or contemplates doing in the matter.  It is a very serious thing and a very bad reflection on the State, particularly on the Department concerned, that persons who served for upwards of 40 years should be turned out at 65 or 70 years of age without as much as a penny gratuity or compensation from the Department which they have served so long.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister can justify that by reference to any standard of decent conduct.  Of course, it could be justified perhaps on the basis: &ldquo;You are just a cog in the machine.  You are of no further use to us; out you go.  We will get another cog.&rdquo;  People who stand for the recognition of human rights could not justify a code of conduct such as the Post Office adopts in its dealings with auxiliary postmen who served it <Col N="2458" /> for 40 years.  I should like to know what the Minister proposes to do in that matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins and others mentioned the case of temporary postmen and the insecure position in which they find themselves.  There are two aspects of that problem which I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister. The first is the case of a group of temporary postmen in Dublin.  Many of these people are employed as full-time temporary postmen and have been so employed for the past 20 years. Because of their age and because of the fact that they have been a long time away from school it is quite unlikely that they would be eligible to compete in a limited examination to secure established appointments, or, if eligible on the ground of age, would have any chance of getting through a keenly contested examination because of the fact that younger officers would be competing with them.  A number of these officers have given 20 years' continuous service and they are still graded as temporary postmen in the same way as a temporary postman who came into the service yesterday or last week.  The Minister should recognise that he has a responsibility towards persons whom he has employed for 20 years in what is described as the position of temporary postmen.  There should be some recognition of the long and faithful service which these people have given to the State.  The Minister can quite easily recognise his responsibility and in fact discharge his responsibility, if he only approaches this problem with some humanitarianism towards those who have served him, and with some determination to get over whatever trifling difficulties may be encountered.  There are a considerable number of unestablished postmen in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There should be no difficulty in the world&mdash;it has been done before with 48 such persons&mdash;in appointing a number of these long-service temporary postmen to established appointments, thereby giving them permanent employment in the Post Office, removing them from the category of temporary employees and giving them a stability which, I think, every right minded person <Col N="2459" /> will recognise they have surely earned after more than 20 years' service in the capacity of temporary postmen. There should not be the slightest difficulty in doing that.  As I say, it has been done before.  All it wants is the heart to do it, and the will to do it; and I appeal to the Minister to recognise that this is a problem which can quite easily be solved and it is one in which he will encounter no difficulties whatever.  There is the other aspect of the problem of the insecurity of temporary employees and I would like to ask the Minister what he intends to do in this respect.  Since the emergency developed in 1939, every person employed as an auxiliary postman has been employed in an acting capacity only&mdash;in other words, he was appointed as a temporary auxiliary postman, the idea apparently being that the question of the filling of the post permanently would not be considered until the emergency terminated.  Now from the point of view of making definite appointments to these posts the emergency is over, as much as it ever will be over, and I would like to know from the Minister what he intends to do in connection with making these posts permanent.  Many of the officers have been employed in them for the past six years.  In fact some of them have filled these positions for nearly seven years.  Surely something should be done now in the way of appointing these officers permanently to the positions in which they have been employed for over six years in a great many cases.  In any case there is no reason whatever for delaying the appointments further and I hope that the Minister, when he is replying, will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>Questions have been raised in the course of this debate as to the staffing of various post offices.  Here, again, I do not purport to know on what basis the Post Office calculates its staffing requirements, nor have I ever been able to understand the scheme by which they endeavour to budget for the volume of work with which they have to deal.  But I would like the Minister to make some inquiries and find out the extent to which practically every office <Col N="2460" /> in the country is being staffed at the moment, particularly in relation to post office clerks.  I know&mdash;and I challenge contradiction&mdash;that the position of the staffs of various offices throughout the country is positively chaotic.</P>
    <P>In many of these offices overtime has been worked from the month of January to the month of December simply because the Post Office has not got sufficient staff.  That is due to the fact that the Department did not recruit and train staff in order to have them available.  A very considerable volume of overtime has to be worked in these post offices, and it has to be worked because that is the only way in which to deal with the volume of work.  That is not intelligent staff planning.  That is merely expediency. That is a rule-of-thumb method of dealing with the matter.  Surely any proper organisation should budget for staff on the basis of known demands. As far as the Post Office is concerned the staffing of the entire offices throughout the country is simply on the principle of &ldquo;robbing Peter to pay Paul&rdquo;.  One person in an office puts in an application for transfer to another office&mdash;a thing which he is perfectly entitled to do.  The Post Office tell him that he cannot be released because they have nobody to replace him. If you ask the Post Office to appoint staff to make good vacancies in post offices they tell you they have no staff available.  The position is so bad that they have actually asked married women to come back to the service because of the shortage of trained personnel.</P>
    <P>As far as Post Office clerks are concerned the Post Office will simply grab anybody who can operate a telegraph key.  That should not happen; and that is all due to the fact that plans were not made in time to recruit staffs.  If these plans had been made in time staff would be available now. As I said, it is a kind of &ldquo;robbing Peter to pay Paul&rdquo; policy, and it should have no place in the proper organisation of a public Department. It should be abandoned; and it can only be abandoned when the Post Office recognises its function to recruit staff sufficient to cope with the volume of <Col N="2461" /> work with which it has to deal.  The position at the moment is that there is overtime being worked in a whole variety of offices because without such overtime there would be a complete breakdown.  Even overtime has not prevented things happening which ought not to have happened, if there was an enlightened policy so far as adequate staff is concerned.</P>
    <P>Now I would like to ascertain from the Minister whether it is likely that work on the St. Andrew's Street Exchange will be commenced this year. I think the Minister must recognise that it is impossible to have any effective and really efficient telephone service in Dublin&mdash;and Dublin is the core in this matter&mdash;until such time as there is proper accommodation sufficient to contain the telephone equipment necessary to provide an efficient service from the capital of the country.  The Minister has already indicated that he believes the equipment will be available when the office reaches completion, and I think he also indicated that, so far as priority was concerned, the erection of this new building was high up in the priority list.  Could the Minister say now with any degree of definiteness what he intends to do in respect of commencing work on the St. Andrew's Street Exchange?  Is work likely to be undertaken this year; and, if so, could the Minister hazard any guess as to when the new building will be available for occupation as a telephone exchange?  A short time ago I asked the Minister when he proposed to demolish the disused distillery which acts as a central sorting and delivery office in Pearse Street and erect a proper building there.  At that time&mdash; though his predecessor promised a new building would be erected in 1941 &mdash;the present Minister told us that he thought that, at best, work on the erection of the building would not be commenced for about three years.  I do not know whether that was an offhand, wide-of-the-mark guess by the Minister, but if he has any more reliable information or any more up-to-date information in connection with the provision of a proper sorting and delivery office in Dublin I would be glad if the Minister would furnish us <Col N="2462" /> now with whatever information he has.  The present building, notwithstanding what the Minister&mdash;who does not work in it&mdash;says, is a thoroughly insanitary building from the point of view of the staff working in it. Week after week and month after month they complain about the condition of the building.  In the summer time the roof leaks tar; in the winter time it leaks rain.  That is the kind of building that served as an essential sorting and delivering office in the capital of this country.  I think the Minister ought to try, with his colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to get away from that situation&mdash;a disused distillery serving as a central sorting office and a central letter office for the past 22 years.</P>
    <P>At the present rate of progress we shall be dead&mdash;long dead&mdash;before we ever see anything other than the present shack as a central sorting and central delivery office in Dublin.  In any case, the Minister might well make history if he would give this wheel a turn and do something to induce somebody to perspire a little in the erection of a new sorting office in Pearse Street. The present building there has been occupied for the last 22 years.  It is a joke and a satire as sorting office and letter office.  Apparently the Minister thinks it is a lovely one.  If he does then every other post office administration in the world that has built decent sorting offices is crazy and the Minister is the one sane Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  The fact that other administrations have found it desirable to erect decent and artistic buildings leads me to the belief that they are sensible and that the Post Office here is at fault in hanging on to the present buildings.</P>
    <P>Appeals have been made to the Minister by Deputies who have spoken in this debate in regard to the necessity for raising the wage levels of the Post Office staff and I think the Minister must recognise that he has a very heavy moral responsibility towards those whom he employs. In this House and outside the House there is widespread approval of the claims made by the Post Office staff for increases in their present low <Col N="2463" /> standards of remuneration.  There has been public sympathy for the demand that the Post Office staffs should be decently paid and they are not being decently paid to-day.  There has been public sympathy for the demand that Post Office staffs have a right to be taken out of the disgraceful position of being the Cinderella of all the services. Every newspaper free to express an opinion on the matter has wholeheartedly endorsed the demand for improved wages and better conditions of employment for these State employees. Nobody has opposed this demand publicly except the Post Office Department itself, but the Minister knows perfectly well that newspapers have gone on record supporting the demand of the Post Office staffs that they should be decently paid.  The Minister has a moral responsibility in this matter and a Cabinet responsibility as well.  In the last resort the Minister is the employer of those employed in the Post Office services and there is on him a grave responsibility of ensuring that those whom he employs are adequately paid and not compelled to exist on the low rates paid to them at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance confessed to-day at Question Time that, as a result of the stabilising of the cost-of-living bonus in 1940, he succeeded in keeping in the Exchequer £5,900,000 which he otherwise would have paid out if he had been decent enough to honour his moral obligations.  He said to-day, by inference, that because he repudiated his obligation he had been able to keep in the Exchequer close on £6,000,000 which, in fact, belongs to the Civil Service, and a very large portion of that sum belongs to the Post Office staff.  By withholding it he has exaggerated an already serious position.  The Minister told us, in the course of his opening speech in this debate, that he expected to have a surplus of £182,000 on the 31st March, 1946.  It seems to me to be nothing short of a scandal to have a surplus of £182,000 on the Post Office service.  It was secured by employment at low rates of wages. That surplus is possible only because you sweat people, only because you deny them a reasonable wage, only <Col N="2464" /> because you fail to make provision to pay them a wage commensurate with their domestic and moral responsibilities. The Minister should examine his conscience and realise that this surplus should be utilised for the purpose of raising wages and improving conditions of the thousands of people employed in this service.  He has a moral responsibility to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>We all admit that the Post Office service is one of the most important and responsible and, in some respects, one of the most confidential of our national services.  Many very desirable and progressive reforms have been made in this service and undoubtedly it is becoming more efficient year by year.  I do not think it is right to criticise as some Deputies have criticised here to-day, the officials of the Department for having no ideas at all as to how the services should be developed. From my personal knowledge I know they have ideas and that some of the matters for which they have been criticised here to-day have been given effect to.  If there is room for criticism it is because these reforms have not been sufficiently pushed forward and more generally adopted.  As regards the telephone service it has been pretty severely critised here to-day by a great number of Deputies.  We all agree it is an expanding service because of the increased demands for it from private, professional and business interests.  No doubt it is very efficient within certain circuits but for long-distance calls it does not seem to be sufficiently organised or progressive enough to deal with the demands being made upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter for criticism, of course, that in a city like Cork one has to wait four hours on any kind of a busy day for a call to Dublin.  That is far beyond the limit.  The time has come for an extension of the service.  Not only rural areas and towns are making claims for an efficient telephone service but the new built-up areas in the cities are making claims too, and unfortunately these demands from private and public interests have been referred for consideration with some system of priorities.  The closing down of the service at 7 o'clock at night is another very serious matter for the people <Col N="2465" /> affected.  The obvious answer to this is that these post offices are mainly situated in shops and that in many places these shops have to close down in accordance with the terms of the Shops Acts.  It has been said that in such cases kiosks should be put outside. These kiosks have been put outside the post office in Cork which shows that the Post Office has got this idea itself but you cannot expect kiosks to be put up outside every post office in the country.  Some provision should be made for the provision of reasonable facilities for the public who desire these services.  Some of the demands made by Deputies will not require any additional staff at all.  All that is necessary is a link-up with the existing system where staffs are available after the usual hours.  The payment of the Post Office staff is a matter for consideration undoubtedly and also the question of pensions for auxiliary postmen. It is very hard on men who have given a national service for a lifetime to go out without a pension or without anything to provide for their families.</P>
    <P>I must congratulate the Minister on the progress he has made.  I know that in Cork he has made a very desirable connection between the letters department and the parcels department and that is a great help to the public.  Even if the counter space is still limited, we are glad to see that progress is being made.  I know that under the guidance of the present Minister some of the matters referred to by Deputy Norton and others have been made effective during the past year, even with the drawbacks of the emergency, and I am sure that further progress will be made, now that the emergency period has passed.</P>

      <P>I appealed to the Minister 12 months ago to do something with regard to the post office in Enniscorthy.  Tuesdays and Fridays are particularly busy days.  On Fridays you have the old people standing at the post office counter.  I have been there on a few occasions waiting to get stamps and I could see the poor old people waiting there for half an hour. On Tuesdays the officials have to deal with family allowances.  There is no increase in the staff, not even an extra <Col N="2466" /> clerk.  There are two good officials there who are doing their best.  People have complained to me in the post office.  They want to know why I have not done something, why I did not bring this matter before the Minister. I did so 12 months ago, but nothing has been done to relieve the congestion.</P>
      <P>As regards rural postmen, I know a lot of them.  Is it not a shame to see these employees having to work a few hours with a farmer or trapping rabbits to try to get a little extra money, although they are carrying the State bag?  With regard to appointments of rural postmen, I have a letter which was sent to me and which I will read for the Minister.  He can deny it if he likes.  It shows how these appointments are made:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am writing to inform you about a vacancy for an auxiliary postman at .... sub-post office.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I will give the letter to the Minister afterwards, if he wishes.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In 1945 the vacancy was declared. I was a member of the Defence Forces from September, 1939, to December, 1945, and held the rank of sergeant.  I am a married man with two children, one aged four years and the other one year.  My age is 30 years.  I obtained a good knowledge of Irish.  I submitted an application for the vacancy in the usual manner and also sent the highest testimonials from the Army and civilians.  Even the Minister for Defence wrote on my behalf to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  The acting postmaster at Enniscorthy informed me at an interview that he had recommended me for the vacancy and I told the postmaster that the sub-postmistress had sent me to him with her recommendation also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I was employed as temporary postman from the 3/2/46 up to the present, but now the appointment has been made and the man appointed was a member of the Defence Forces all right and is also married, but he has no children.  He is, no doubt, a member of the local Fianna Fáil club.  He has very little, if any, Irish and he is over 50 years of age. This is another case of the Fianna <Col N="2467" /> Fáil jobbery plan, and I fail to see why the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should not give his views when making or about to make this appointment.  If he considered a married man with no family better entitled to the vacancy than a married man with a family, he then made his decision only on the advice of the three or four members who met on a Monday night in an old preaching house belonging to the Fianna Fáil Party.  There is another ex-member of the Defence Forces married, with one child.  He was also an applicant for the vacancy.  He is a single man who can read, write and speak Irish, and he was a member of the L.D.F. I would be very grateful if you would bring this case before the Dáil so that the public would know just another small bit about this so-called Republican Party and its departments.  If you want any further information on this subject I shall be too pleased to furnish same.  Hoping you will bring this case before the Dáil and that they will allow the Press a good hearing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Will the Minister, in his reply, deny that?</P>

      <P>This thing is happening all over the country.  We had a case a few months ago in Mayo.  I know where an appointment was made in another post office and the candidate was brought by two officials to the examination and was brought home again by the very people who were sent <Col N="2468" /> down.  What is the use of parents getting young men and young girls educated and sending them up for tests when the jobs are given out beforehand? They are only wasting their time, and it would be better to save the expense of sending them to these examinations.  There is nothing but criticism all over the country about appointments in the Post Office and in the Civil Service.  There is nothing but jobbery and corruption.  It is not the best educated person who gets the job; it is the man with the biggest pull, and that will have to be stopped.  If you are not well in with someone in the Department, or if you have not some fellow who is a great Fianna Fáil man pushing you in, you will not get any job. What is the use of these examinations? These are the things the public know all about.</P>

Perhaps they got something like the letter I read, but they funked it and hesitated to bring it forward because they made the job all right.  Where is the preference for the Army men?

      <P>Yes, but the other man was a sergeant with a great knowledge of Irish.  He was ousted and another man was brought in through political influence.  I do not like to have to get up here and say these things, but the people insist that I should do it.  The <Col N="2469" /> people sent me here to voice their grievances and to expose any corruption. All that is wanted is fair play for any candidate, and to have nothing about Fianna Fáil clubs, about men meeting in a house, or any sort of backsliding going on.  Let matters be decided on their merits.  Meetings are being held all over the country to raise funds and to provide work for ex-Army men.  The man I referred to is out of his job from February 3rd.  The Minister should not be led away in such matters.  I heard a Deputy from Mayo a few months ago stating that the same thing happened in reference to a postmaster in that county.  The same thing is going on in my constituency in Wexford.  Rural postmen are carrying State bags, but some of them are without uniforms or capes in the winter months.  If we are to have good service, in view of the millions of money that have been mentioned, we should be able to pay the State servants. The Budget to-day told of the great things that have been done, but we are leaving the rural postmen to try to carry on on a few miserable shillings a week.  If the Minister wants the information that is in my possession he can have it.  I hope that he will reply to the points that I have raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>After five or six years during which considerable difficulty prevailed in getting material one does not desire to be critical, but the present position cannot continue. In country districts it is not uncommon to have to wait close on two hours to get a call through to a place 17 miles away.  I do not know if that is due to technical reasons or because there are so many other calls to go through.  What will happen ultimately if that continues is that people will cease to use the telephone. I was in Ballybofey last week and I wanted to ring up a person in Letterkenny, a distance of 17 miles, and when I asked what delay there would be I was told that it might be half an hour or three-quarters of an hour.  I cancelled the call.  Delays may be due to the fact that the Department has not sufficient lines to clear calls, but <Col N="2470" /> whatever the cause, it is essential in the interests of the Department that the position should be remedied at the earliest possible moment.  The telegraph will die out no matter what we do, but let us have one efficient service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It took a long time to make our people telephone-minded.  It would be very bad if the development of the service was retarded.  When Deputy McCarthy spoke I suppose he was speaking to the electorate about the closing down of sub-post offices and telephone exchanges at 7 o'clock.  The Deputy made a glib reference to the pay of those engaged at those offices. I wonder if Deputy McCarthy suggests that in addition to the ordinary work of people employed in rural post offices, some shanty should be put up in which a girl or somebody in the house would stay until 10 o'clock each night to deal with telephone business.  Did the conditions and the hours which these people work occur to Deputy McCarthy?  One feels ashamed to be a member of this House, where jointly to some extent, we are responsible for their employment and for the conditions under which they work.  I have referred to this matter year after year. I shall continue to do so.  I wonder if it occurred to Deputy McCarthy that these lady clerks during their first year at work get no pay at all.  They go into these post offices, having taken their breakfast at home, and while at work they get dinner and also tea.  That is all they get for the first year.  We have seen cases where during the second year they get the munificent sum of 2/6 per week.  Yet the Minister stands up in this House and tells us that he hopes to have a surplus of £182,000 arising out of the work of these people. In introducing the Estimate, when dealing with the Savings Bank business, he stated that growth was well maintained during the past year.  He added: &ldquo;For the second year in succession the number of deposits accepted exceeded the million mark, and for the first time the value of deposits exceeded £10,000,000.  Compared with the previous year, deposits at £10,630,000 showed an increase of £2,280,000 and withdrawals at £4,959,000 an increase of £1,520,000.  The balance to credit of <Col N="2471" /> depositors on 31st December, 1945, was £32,754,000.&rdquo;  Post Office employees have taken in and have taken charge of £32,754,000 and handled 599,000 accounts.  On some of these accounts girls are employed who get their dinner daily and 10/- a month at the end of their second year at business.</P>
    <P>Then we read of some of these girls, who come from very respectable parents, having been placed in a position and working for the Department whether directly or indirectly, who fall out of the sheer necessity of having some pocket money for their urgent needs, and being brought before the criminal courts and convicted.  It is all very well if the judge has compassion on the individual in view of the circumstances and applies the Probation of Offenders Act, but that person is found guilty before that course is adopted, so that he or she is then a convicted person. Will this House put an end to this condition of affairs in which the sons and daughters of respectable people, at whom the finger of scorn could not be pointed by anybody, people who reared their children well and gave them a decent education, are made criminals by the conditions under which this Department employs them?  A person employed in any employment should receive wages or salary commensurate with the responsibility placed upon him.  If that is not so, then the person employed is a menace.</P>
    <P>The conditions under which these people are employed is nothing short of an outrage in view of the present cost of living.  A girl, 30 or 50 years ago, could work in a rural post office near her home.  There were then no pictures, no cigarettes, no permanent waves and no Mae West frocks, but a girl who goes into such a post office now must be respectably dressed, and how is she to do it on the money she receives?  For years, I have protested against the payment made to sub-postmasters out of which arise the conditions which make these girls criminals.  There are some 2,000 sub-postmasters in this State with salaries of £1 per week and under, and assuming <Col N="2472" /> they are in a shop and the shop closes at 6 o'clock in the evening, the telephone exchange must be kept open until 7 o'clock.  The telephone and telegraph office must be opened on Sundays between 9 and 10 o'clock and for two hours on Sunday evening.  If there are any religious devotions in progress in the parish, there is some adult person who cannot attend them. They, nevertheless, have to do all this work for the munificent sum of £1 per week, and, in many cases, 10/- per week would probably be nearer the mark.</P>
    <P>The House must make up its mind on what it proposes to do about this. We have been told that the Minister will have a surplus of £182,000.  Is all that money to go into the Exchequer, or will the people who earned it get at least a minimum wage out of it?  I think that Deputies of every Party should take their courage in their hands and insist on justice being done to these people who, by their joint efforts in all the branches of the Post Office, have been responsible for this surplus of £182,000 in one year.  The first people with a claim on that money are the people who earn it.  Secondly, we must make up our minds that, on the lines of the new philosophy as to the distribution of wealth, we will never go back to the conditions which obtained in the Post Office and elsewhere 20, 30, 40 and 50 years ago.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient for the Minister to tell us that these sub-post offices are run by shopkeepers.  If a man has a shop, he has enough to do in running his own business.  If he does not run his own business, nobody else will do it for him.  The practice is to bring some respectable country girl from the neighbourhood into that shop and get her to work in the sub-post office under these conditions.  There are so few opportunities that the father and mother of that young girl are delighted with the chance of getting her placed there, but the conditions under which she works constitute a temptation, because when that girl goes out and meets other girls who have money to buy decent frocks, coats, shoes, cigarettes and to pay for admission to pictures, and realises that she has not <Col N="2473" /> got a brass farthing, although she, with others, is responsible for a surplus of £182,000, she is inevitably led into criminal ways.</P>
    <P>It was said of the Bourbons that they never learned anything and never forgot anything, and this runs through the whole of this Department.  The little boy or girl gets a shilling for delivering a telegram, and the &ldquo;bob&rdquo; which the militiaman got 50 years ago still obtains in the Post Office.  Does the Minister not think that it is time that system of getting a young boy or girl to travel a mile, on a bicycle or otherwise, for a shilling was reviewed?</P>
    <P>Another practice which I notice in post offices is the practice adopted by other Departments of sending along posters and getting the postmaster to hang them around his place.  Sub-postmasters should not be asked to be bill-posters.  The country is wide enough for the diffusion of knowledge and if other Departments have posters which they require to be posted up, let them pay for doing so, or get officers of their own Departments to do it.  The Minister should not ask the officers of his Department to be bill-posters for other Departments.</P>
    <P>Some time in February of last year the Minister received a deputation of sub-postmasters on the matter of their remuneration under various heads. Am I correctly informed that, even up to this day, the Minister has not had the courtesy to send the reply which he promised to send to that deputation? Surely, even if they were not to get any increase, it would have been courtesy to send a reply stating that he could not do anything for them, that he had made representations to the Minister for Finance and that the Minister for Finance would not move? If the Minister for Finance has £1,000,000 to throw around, it will be thrown around in some way that will catch votes and not in paying people to enable them to be honest and worthy of the trust reposed in them, such as sub-postmasters and clerks in rural post offices.</P>
    <P>I loathe having to say these things but I feel bound to say them.  I feel a moral duty on me to raise these <Col N="2474" /> matters and I do not wish to avoid it. There was a case of a girl in the last couple of months who was brought before the court in Kells or Trim, and the story unfolded there should be sufficient to arouse the public and to arouse Deputies to a sense of their duty and the Minister to a sense of his responsibility.  Surely the facts related there are sufficient to induce the Minister to insist on justice being done to these people or, if the Minister for Finance refuses to meet his demands in the matter, to resign.</P>
    <P>If I were a Minister and these conditions obtained, I would either get justice done or I would not be responsible for the Department.  There are things which are far more important than office or emoluments.  I understand there is a distinction made between Savings Bank business and other money matters with which the Post Office deals, such as licences of all kinds, and that the system of payment is different.  What justification is there for the distinction made between taking money for licences and taking money for the Savings Bank? Why is there a distinction as to the rates of payment?</P>
    <P>Before the Minister brings in his Estimate next year I hope that some decision will be arrived at whereby justice will be done and reasonable payment made to Post Office employees so as not to incite them to crime.  It is tragic to see these young people placed in such circumstances.  I would not keep a messenger boy in my employment for one week without giving him wages commensurate with the task which he has to discharge.  It is elementary that people who are handling money should be paid wages or salaries that would put them beyond the temptation to misappropriate funds.  So long as the present system obtains you will have misappropriation of public money.  It is time to make up our minds to put an end to that.  Then, if there are misappropriations of public money, it can be justly said that we have paid these people well and that there was no reason why they should take public money or any other money. I ask the Minister to tell us what advance he has made with the Minister <Col N="2475" /> for Finance with regard to the representations he has made on behalf of these people.  Is there any hope for them?  With the present cost of living and the cost of labour, sub-postmasters, like the school teachers, will be driven to go on strike.  Some morning we will find that there is no postal service in rural Ireland.  It would not surprise me in the least and I certainly would say it was justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year on this Estimate I called the Minister's attention to the inadequate accommodation in the central post office in Kilkenny City and I was pleased to hear from him that he proposed to carry out the much-wanted and long-awaited alterations in that building.  A whole year has passed and, beyond flying visits from surveyors or engineers or people of that kind, nothing whatever appears to have been done.  Surely the Minister will appreciate that when this office was first opened a great many years ago the amount of business to be transacted in a post office at that time was only a fraction of the volume of work which has to be dealt with to-day.  In those days licences and pensions and so on had not to be dealt with.  Since the first Great War a big number of British army pensions are paid in the central post office.  In the old days dog licences were dealt with in the petty sessions clerk's office.  Children's allowances are the latest addition to the Post Office work.</P>
      <P>Apart from these extra services, which have been imposed on the post office, the staff is not large enough and the building itself is most unsuitable. When there is any rush on, there is great difficulty in getting into it and, when you get in, you have twice as much trouble in getting out.  Surely the City of Kilkenny, with a population of not less than 12,000, is entitled to a better central office than the general post office in High Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In furtherance of the policy of providing better accommodation, I would expect when there is a vacancy for a sub-office that the Minister, when filling the vacancy, would look for the best possible officer for the purpose.  I do not think the Minister ought to take <Col N="2476" /> the petty view that appears to be taken, namely, finding a job for somebody. My outlook would be to give better service to the community. Recently there was a vacancy for a sub-post office at Irishtown in Kilkenny City and I am sorry that I have to complain about the Minister's decision in the matter.  I was terribly disappointed to find the lines on which he reached his decision in that case, which was based absolutely on political considerations.</P>
    <P>I have been told by a very responsible person in Kilkenny that the recommendation in that instance came, not from any Deputy for the constituency, not from any public representative, but from a few people who constitute what is called the local Fianna Fáil cumann.  What was the result? The person appointed hardly held the office for 24 hours and a vacancy still exists there.  I invite the Minister to send down any inspector or anybody with any sense of justice to examine the position as outlined in the written representations put up by me.  I based my representations on service to the community.  I did mention a certain applicant, but the principle running through my representations was better service to the community.  I pointed out on two occasions that the corporation had built over 230 houses in that particular sub-office district.</P>
    <P>In addition the Irish Union of Distributive Workers and Clerks built a very nice terrace of houses in the same district.  Other private individuals built houses there also.  The result is that the population and the entire layout of that sub-post office district bears now no relation of any kind to the situation as it existed when the Irishtown post office was first opened.  I am sorry that I have to make these complaints to this House but in view of the very reliable information I had as to how that decision was arrived at recently in Kilkenny I came to the conclusion that this was the only place in which to raise the matter.  I defy the Minister to send down an impartial person to examine the situation and prove otherwise. When the new appointment is made it should be made with due regard to the provision of a better service <Col N="2477" /> to the community as a whole; and it should be completely free of any attempt to provide a job for some friend.</P>
    <P>Last year also I joined with other Deputies in this House in appealing to the Minister to have regard to the position of auxiliary postmen.  The present position is a disgrace to the country.  Certainly I have never heard of any other country which treats its servants in the way in which the Minister treats his auxiliary postmen.  I instanced one case where there was an auxiliary postman occupying that position from the time the delivery system was first established; and that old man to-day has no place to turn to except the county home.  When the time comes at which his employment will automatically cease, no provision of any kind has been made for a pension for him; no provision has been made for a gratuity.  Last year I felt a bit hopeful about the situation because I thought that the Minister was definitely sympathetic and would like to do something.  As a member of the Government, I think he ought to be able to make more progress in the matter in this stage of our civilisation.  It is a disgrace that this should happen in a country about which we hear so many pious things said.  It is a disgrace that there should be no reward for honest service.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I certainly think ought to be examined into is the position of people who are employed by post office contractors for the delivery of mails.  The Minister has no control over the wages paid to these. The possibility is that they are actually paid worse than the Minister pays his auxiliary postmen.  They cannot afford to buy clothes for themselves.  The only piece of decent clothing they possess is the official post-office cap. Surely the money those contractors receive under their contract ought to enable them to pay these employees properly.  If it is not sufficient then the system should be changed.  My information is that the conditions of employment are appalling.</P>
    <P>I had occasion recently to complain to the postmistress in Kilkenny about the mishandling of boxes of eggs.  I <Col N="2478" /> know people who take every precaution to comply with the official advice given to them by radio, and otherwise, as to the proper packing of eggs and who use only the approved boxes for that purpose.  Now I am going to give you one instance which affected me personally.  A relative of mine who lives in County Kilkenny posted a box of eggs home to me from Durrow.  Durrow post office is not in County Kilkenny. It is just across the border.  On inquiry I was given to understand that the box of eggs had to be transported first to Portlaoighise, from there to Dublin and then back down to County Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>Is not that a shocking state of affairs?  I left the box of eggs and the packing with the supervisor in Kilkenny for examination and he told me that he was satisfied the eggs were more than adequately packed.  Out of two dozen eggs exactly one dozen were completely smashed.  Surely there could be some type of special bag provided for the transportation of eggs. The Minister should take every precaution, above all at the present time when eggs are so expensive and so difficult to get, to ensure their safe delivery.</P>
    <P>That concludes what I would like to say on this subject.  But I would like again to emphasise the importance of providing an adequate service to an area like Kilkenny which has several villages on its outskirts that could be described as suburbs, such as Talbots Inch and other places.  You have a large number of people residing there and the majority of them have to do their postal business either at the suboffices or at the central office in Kilkenny. I think I am safe in saying that there is no place in Ireland comparable with Kilkenny which has not got adequate postal facilities, and I sincerely hope that this will be the last occasion on which I shall have to complain in this House.</P>
    <P>I hope when the Minister is dealing with the filling of the vacancy in the present sub-office that he will do so, not because of the representations I make to him but as a matter of principle, to provide a good service to the community; and if he can get better <Col N="2479" /> premises than those I have recommended I shall be delighted.  But, again, I want to impress that it is the public who must be considered and not just a friend who is in need of a job.</P>

      <P>There are just a few matters I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister in connection with telephone services.  I find that there are complaints throughout my part of the country that the accounts furnished have often proved to be wrong.  Time and again calls which should appear in one individual's account are charged up in another.  The result is that everybody in my area who has a 'phone and who has to use it very frequently, particularly in connection with business, has now got to have one of his staff for the purpose of keeping an accurate telephone account of every call that is made, otherwise he will find himself paying for somebody else's 'phone calls.  That has happened time and time again and it is undermining the confidence of telephone users in the Post Office.  I think that is a matter which the Minister should look into.  The complaint is very general throughout my part of the country.  The only remedy we have is that we ourselves must keep a check of every call we make. As I have said, that undermines the confidence of the public in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with telephone services as a whole, I think the Minister's approach to the matter is the wong one.  I think the Minister should not consider the question of what the return is going to be from installing public telephones in the country areas. I think the approach of the Minister should be from the point of view of service to the people, particularly in isolated country districts where they are vitally essential for keeping in contact with doctors and clergymen. To every request for the provision of telephones the answer received from the Minister is that the place is too isolated and the telephone would not pay.  Now the people are inclined to look on the telephone as a social service; it certainly is a social service in an isolated country area.  I would <Col N="2480" /> strongly urge on the Minister that the future policy of his Department should be to supply a telephone service irrespective of the cost and the local demand, particularly in isolated areas.</P>
    <P>There have been many complaints about the cost of the telephone service. There have been many complaints about the cost of telephones, but notwithstanding the cost the demand is increasing because the telephone has become a necessity in modern business. I, in conjunction with many Deputies, have been writing to the Minister and his Department pressing the claims of particular individuals for a telephone, I understand the delay is due to supplies, and I hope that the Minister will soon be in a position to meet these demands.  Numbers of people are waiting throughout the country to get telephones installed.  They are waiting for a considerable period and now it is an urgent necessity.  The cheaper the Minister can make the telephone service available the more people will use it.  It would pay in the long run even if the rentals were reduced to a much lower figure.</P>
    <P>I have to endorse some of the things stated in this House by other Deputies, particularly in regard to the staffs of sub-post offices.  I know that this is not a matter for which the Minister is primarily responsible, but I do think that there should be some type of fair wage clause or some such provision in force in connection with some of these sub-post offices. I understand the system is that the sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress gets a lump sum and is allowed to provide staff any way he or she can.  I and a good many other people who have experience of the courts find these unfortunate people coming up week after week, and we find they are being paid miserable wages, as the result of which I believe they start on the wrong road, start embezzling funds entrusted to them. I think the Minister should see that in these sub-post offices a minimum wage is fixed for the people who would be employed there.  I would like to point out also that in some of the isolated country post offices there should be better inspection.  The <Col N="2481" /> steam kettle is not so much out of use as many people think.  In some of these isolated areas the local postmistress is the main source of information in the district.  I have received complaints, and I have reason to believe that in some isolated instances this is being done.  I do not know the remedy, but I suggest where there is even a suspicion of this kind there should be surprise visits made by the Post Office inspectors.</P>
    <P>I hope that the complaint made by Deputy Pattison about appointments is better founded than some of the complaints we have been listening to in this House recently.  Some of the outpourings of Deputy Cafferky in this House on the same subject recently resulted in a great many crocodile tears being shed over the non-appointment of a lady to the post office in Charlestown in County Mayo.  When the matter was examined, it has now become public property, it was not non-appointment of a particular lady that was the real cause of the trouble. The real cause was that a relation of his own whom he recommended was not appointed.  I hope the complaints made in the House to-night on this same subject have more foundation in fact.  Deputies have appealed to the Minister to be non-political in these appointments.  I appeal to the Minister too, to be non-political in these appointments.  By this I mean that the Minister is not to discriminate against an applicant for one of those posts because he happens to belong to a Fianna Fail cumann in the area.  It would appear to some Deputies that membership of the Fianna Fáil organisation should debar a person from a public appointment even though he is well equipped otherwise for the position. I appeal to the Minister to be non-political because there seems to be a new philosophy growing in certain quarters that because a person belongs to the organisation enjoying the support and confidence of the vast majority of the people he should be discriminated against when it comes to an appointment.  Deputy Cafferky's outburst recently was an example of that. On that occasion the House was treated to a deliberate misstatement of the facts with regard to the Charlestown <Col N="2482" /> appointment.  That is well known. It is past history now in County Mayo. In future appointments I appeal to the Minister to see that membership of a particular organisation will not debar a person from appointment who is qualified otherwise.  Certain Deputies have suggested that it should.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is one other matter I would like to bring to the Minister's notice.  I have recently received complaints that in some country post offices there is a lack of courtesy to the public.  Some of the staffs dealing with the public in some of the busy country post offices seem to forget that they are public servants. I appreciate that on some days in some of these offices they are very busy but a few words from the Minister ton his matter would be appreciated by the general public.  Some of these staffs seem to forget that they are public servants and they make no effort to be helpful to the country people.  There are many forms to be filled in under modern legislation and various entries of different natures to be made in a post office, and country people, in particular, may not understand what is required of them to do.  They expect co-operation and assistance from the Minister's officers and I suggest to the Minister that if he addressed a circular to postmasters and postmistresses on this subject it would remedy matters.</P>

      <P>Of all the Departments of State this is the one I can least criticise.  I am satisfied that the service is reasonably good, but I do agree that we could have a vast extension of the services over every area if we spend the money.  On the other hand, if the Minister over-spends we would be critical of him also.  I think we should creep before we walk.  This is one of the few Departments that have something left in the Exchequer at the end of the year and we should be thankful for that.  It is time, however, that we extended the services to some of the country areas and I join with Deputy Kennedy in drawing the Minister's attention to the position in North Meath, to Oldeastle, in particular. They have only a couple of <Col N="2483" /> deliveries a week there.  I ask the Minister to give that serious consideration and send a post office motor van there.  Both Deputy Kennedy and myself have been after this for four or five years.  We appreciated the difficulty of doing anything during the emergency but now that the emergency is practically over something should be done forthwith.  North Meath was a particularly backward out-of-the-way area.  As regards Navan Post Office, which is a very good office, run by very good officials, I would like to ask the Minister to see that it is properly staffed.  I have been in queues there with many others waiting to get served while men were working there with their coats off, so to speak.  I think the Minister should look into the question of staff there.  I do not think there is sufficient staff.</P>
      <P>We heard a good deal about the pay of sub-postmasters and the way their staffs are paid.  There was mention of a case in the Kells court.  I remember the case well.  I will not blame the postmaster in that case and neither am I going to blame the unfortunate girl who got into trouble.  We shall have to pay more decent remuneration to our sub-postmasters.  I do not think they get enough.  They get anything from £20 to £40 or £50, and that is not enough.  Those sub-post offices are very small affairs in country districts.  They are not able to stand on their own legs and they must have a little shop in addition to the post office.  Most of these places are very small country shops where the turnover is very little.  The postmaster is not able to pay a decent salary to a girl to run that post office. We shall have to consider the position and, if we can give more money to the sub-postmasters, they are deserving of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The day has arrived when we should have a telephone service in every post office.  That is the only way to satisfy the people.  The telephone service is advancing in every country and, to meet the requirements of the people in our towns and villages, we should have a telephone in every post office. <Col N="2484" /> That, with a little extra remuneration for the staffs, will help to relieve a lot of difficulties.  The people in the post offices throughout the country are splendid.  They give excellent service. They do not turn a deaf ear to the demands of the poor.  They do everything to help people to fill up forms. That is the experience in my county, and I have no doubt it applies all over the country.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Department has done well and, if we want to do better, we shall have to give it more money.  If we are not satisfied with the progress it has made, we shall have to spend more money for an extension of the services.  The Post Office has done very well during the past five years.  It gave a pretty good service.  I think it is advisable to have a daily postal delivery in every area.  The people are entitled to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">

      <P>I would like, with Deputy O'Higgins, to convey to the Minister my appreciation of the manner in which the officials in the executive section of the Department give information to Deputies.  I had some correspondence with the Minister's Department in connection with grievances about sub-post offices and the necessity for an extension of the telephone service in the rural areas.  I certainly can say, from years of experience, that while we always got the &ldquo;if&rdquo;, we also got great courtesy and consideration.  We recognise the difficulty in relation to supplies, but on all occasions we received the greatest courtesy and very satisfactory explanations from the officials.  In view of the criticisms from some Deputies, I think it is necessary that we should give a little credit where the credit is due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already brought to the Minister's attention the question of mail deliveries in Wicklow town.  It is not the fault of the post office there, but it is the fault of the railway service. There is a train arriving at 9.30 or 10 o'clock.  The post office is three-quarters of a mile from the railway station.  For the purpose of conveying the mails from the railway station to the post office a hand-cart is used. Surely there should be something better than a primitive service of that <Col N="2485" /> type.  By the time the mails are delivered at the post office and sorted and made ready for delivery, some hours have passed and it might be one o'clock or 2 o'clock before the delivery is completed in and around the town. Then it must be remembered that in Brittas Bay and other areas convenient to Wicklow there are large numbers of visitors in the summer time and it would be late in the day when deliveries are made in these areas.</P>
    <P>If there was a motor van to take the deliveries to and from Wicklow town there would not be such a long delay as 48 hours in the delivery of letters and parcels.  Such a long delay is unreasonable.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to have the postal deliveries made in the same way as the newspapers make their deliveries. The agents for the Sunday papers, in particular, can supply customers in local towns by using motor vans.  The English and Irish papers are delivered in motor vans each day, and what is to prevent the Post Office following that example, especially when we find the railway services are responsible for such delays? In areas where you have factories and businesses of various sorts depending upon the postal services, there should be a more prompt delivery.  If the railway is not able to give a better service we should concentrate upon deliveries by motor vans from Dublin to Wicklow and the surrounding districts. There should be a more up-to-date service, and it is unreasonable to have business people receiving their letters and parcels as late as 1 o'clock in the day.</P>
    <P>With regard to the demand from Arklow for an improved telephone service, I should like to point out that during the summer months there is a population of 10,000 or over in that district.  There is no exchange operating after 7 o'clock in the evening other than through the Gárda barracks, and if there is an urgent case for the hospital there is grave inconvenience caused.  I am glad the Minister has agreed to make certain arrangements to give facilities to these people in the Arklow area, so that there will be some communication <Col N="2486" /> with a central office which will enable them to get in touch with Dublin or with the county hospital in urgent cases.</P>
    <P>As to the grievances of auxiliary postmen, I hope the Minister will see that justice will be done to these men. As regards the need for a telephone service in the rural areas, I think it was Deputy O'Higgins who pointed out that while the cities and larger towns had all the facilities, the country areas were being overlooked.  We all recognise the great need for this service in out-of-the-way places, especially in Wicklow County.</P>
    <P>There are some districts seven or eight miles from the nearest post office or Gárda station.  Very often a doctor or a clergyman may be required by the people late at night and there is no way of communicating with them other than through the Gárda barracks.  When supplies have been obtained, the Minister should concentrate on extending the telephone to the rural areas, especially where there is a demand by the county authorities and the people, such as the County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Pattison in his references to damaged parcels going through the post.  The Minister received a letter from a constituent of mine living at Bray.  He complained about presents he received from a foreign country being damaged in the post.  He sent a letter on the 12th February, stating that half of the things in the parcel were taken and what was left was destroyed.  He drew the Minister's attention to the facts on 15th March and indicated that the articles were there for examination by the Minister's inspector.  The inspector called and admitted it.  The Minister admitted afterwards that at the Customs the parcel did not contain all the articles mentioned in the original letter.  The Minister's attention was drawn to this, that if these things were not in the parcel when it was opened, why did the Customs authorities not state that on the parcel&mdash;that the parcel was found opened and had been interfered with?</P>
    <P>The Minister told me, on the 31st <Col N="2487" /> March, that he would bear the matter in mind and would make certain recommendations to the Customs authorities in the future.  I will draw attention to this fact, that there is no evidence there, other than the Minister's statement, that the parcel was opened.  It was only when my constituent complained about the parcel not containing all the articles his friend had told him he sent, that the Minister admitted that the parcel had been found open on the first occasion in the Customs office.  If the Minister will refer to the letter of the 31st March he will see that it says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to your letter of the 15th instant, I have to express much regret for the delay in replying to your original complaint and for the failure to endorse the cover of the parcel to indicate that certain items were missing when the parcel was opened for Customs examination. I have to add that suitable notice is being taken of these irregularities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have been asked to draw the Minister's attention to this matter.  The gentleman concerned does not want anything further, only to protect other people in the future.  If a parcel comes through the post it should be stated there and then that it was found open and certain articles which it originally contained were missing.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to bear the points I have referred to in mind.  If anything can be done to have an earlier delivery in Wicklow and other towns, I hope it will be done soon. You cannot have an earlier delivery in Wicklow if you continue to send the mails by goods train and transfer them to the passenger train in the morning. If you do not make arrangements to send the mails by road, the inconvenience we have suffered from during the past few years will continue.  Now that we have arrived at the post-war period, I hope there will be some improvement. I do not think there would be much difference in cost over the present method of delivering letters and parcels if they were sent by road. The road transport would mean an earlier delivery and industrialists, <Col N="2488" /> factory owners and businessmen in Wicklow would have an opportunity of replying to letters on the day they receive them instead of having their letters delivered at 1 o'clock or later and having to post their replies by 5 o'clock in order to have them conveyed to Dublin.  I think there is too much delay in an area only 32 miles from Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Giles in paying a tribute to the executive staff of the Department.  I have had occasion to make representations to the Department on behalf of my constituents, and while I was not always successful, I am satisfied that this Department is one of the most efficient in the State, in having matters to which its attention is called, investigated. The Department is also very prompt in replying to correspondence, and giving the full results of such investigations. I stated here last year that I found the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs most obliging in the way of furnishing full information about complaints made by citizens and Deputies. I think a great deal of good work has been done by the Department during the past five years.  It is certainly advancing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to draw attention to the fact that it is necessary that messengers should be appointed in towns for the delivery of telegrams.  In many sub-post offices local postmasters employ youths of 16 or 17, but let them go when they reach 20 years, when they have experience of post office work. They are then too old to take up a trade or some type of work that would be useful to them in later years.  I suggest that the Minister should appoint messengers who would be recognised by the Department, where telegraphic traffic would warrant such appointments. A messenger was appointed in Mountmellick some years ago and, as a result, the volume of telegraphic business considerably increased.  The Department had been considering the abolition of the position on the ground that the business did not warrant it.  I strongly recommend the Minister to look into the question of appointing messengers in offices in provincial towns.  Messengers would be more <Col N="2489" /> interested in their work if they could be established as civil servants, as they would have some future before them. I am opposed to the present system by which local postmasters employ youths for the delivery of telegrams, and would be glad if some arrangement could be made whereby the Department would make such appointments.</P>
    <P>I also wish to draw attention to the fact that the majority of post offices close for a half holiday in the middle of the week.  I am not opposed to a half holiday for sub-postmasters.  If they are entitled to a half holiday they should take it, but arrangements should be made so that the offices would remain open for the transaction of public business.  Imagine the inconvenience that is caused when people arrive at a sub-post office when they want to use the telephone.  They find that the office is closed and are told that the sub-postmaster has taken a half holiday.  Let the sub-postmasters have a holiday, but somebody else should remain in charge and keep the office open.  The Minister should see that these officials should have decent wages and that they should leave somebody in charge to transact business on half holidays.  I am aware of people who wanted to use the telephone being inconvenienced because they found the post office closed on a half holiday.</P>
    <P>I am also opposed to having a post office on the same floor of a shop in which groceries and provisions are sold. If there is not a partition in the shop other customers are listening to the conversation that takes place over the telephone.  I think that is a disgrace. The post office should be separated from the other portion of the shop so that people could transact their business confidentially.  If a person wishes to use the telephone he does not want to have every Tom, Dick and Harry who comes in for a packet of Woodbines listening to the conversation. The post office compartment should be away from the hardware section or the public-house section of premises.  In fact, there should be a separate entrance to the postal part of the premises so that confidential business could be transacted without being overheard by others.</P>
    <P>I want to refer also to a statement <Col N="2490" /> made by Deputy Moran from Mayo regarding a statement that was made some time ago by Deputy Cafferky. Was Deputy Cafferky's statement right or wrong?  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is an intelligent man.  I never had any conflict with him either inside or outside this House.  I always found the Minister very sympathetic. He uses his common sense, but I say definitely that the Minister was wrong in publishing in the daily newspapers any communication addressed to him by a member of this House.  In his reply I should like to hear if the Minister is going to make a practice of publishing in the daily papers copies of correspondence addressed to him by Deputies.  I do not wish to defend Deputy Cafferky's statement, or his attitude in this House, nor do I want to contradict it, but I think in all fairness, whether Deputy Cafferky is right or wrong, if he addresses a communication to a responsible Minister, and if that communication is for the information and guidance of the Minister and the Department, it should not be published in the daily newspapers.  I think, on second thoughts, the Minister would not do so.  In my experience as a Deputy I have never known of a case where a communication to a Department was published in the newspapers. I think that is a wrong practice.  There was no excuse for the publication of a recommendation made by any Deputy or by any public representative.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>At Question Time to-day, I asked this Question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Justice whether he has received a petition, addressed to the Taoiseach, and signed by several members of Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann on the subject of the hunger strike of Mr. Seán McCaughey in Portlaoighise Prison: and whether he will make a statement on the hunger strike, and also on the steps taken by him on receipt of the petition.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2491" /> It was with a deep sense of regret that, because of the unfavourable and unsatisfactory reply given to that question, I was compelled to ask your permission, Sir, to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  The reply which the Minister gave was a lengthy one, in which he said that the Governor of Portlaoighise Prison had received from Mr. McCaughey a notice which set out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To all whom it may concern: This is to notify you that unless I am released before Friday 17th instant I will be compelled to go on hunger strike until I am.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would be the last Deputy to advocate that any group of citizens should rise in arms against the powers that be, the Government.  I have never advocated and never propose to advocate that policemen should be either fired at or shot.  The only thing I advocate is that citizens, no matter what the charge against them, be given the benefit of a fair trial under the law as established.  Seán McCaughey was not sentenced for murder.  He was sentenced for a common assault, and I saw in the newspapers the case of a citizen who was brought through the courts and fined 1/- within the last week for an offence similar to that for which McCaughey was sentenced to death.  What laws in the world provide that a man shall be sentenced to death for a common assault?  What laws are there in the world which provide for the sentencing to death of a citizen for an offence for which any other person would have received a month's or perhaps six months' imprisonment? If I know legal procedure, for common assault, a citizen in this country may be sentenced to a month, to six months' or, at the very most, to nine months' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>In McCaughey's case, I do not know why such a harsh sentence was imposed. He cannot be classified as a criminal as he was charged only with common assault, but, instead of receiving a sentence of six months' imprisonment, he was given a sentence of death.</P>

      <P>In the petition which was sent to the Taoiseach, signed by a number of Deputies, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice were asked to give consideration to the question of this man's release.  In the course of the replies to-day, reference was made to a statement by the Taoiseach that his hands were tied.  I submit to the Minister and to the Taoiseach that their hands are not tied, and that, if they are, they are in a position to loosen them.  I say that Mr. McCaughey who is lying dangerously ill in Portlaoighise prison to-night should be released, and my reason for saying that he should be released is that it will be a headline for the Ulster Government who have another Irish citizen lying in a similar state in a Belfast gaol.  For the first time, we can say that it has been proven beyond yea or nay that there is no difference between the Ulster Government and the Government which functions here.  They are both alike so far as sentencing any citizen who stands for the abolition of Partition is concerned.</P>
      <P>The Minister, when replying, will no doubt give the usual type of reply given on these matters&mdash;that they must protect the citizens and they must have law and order.  I agree, and I am fully behind the Government in the maintenance of law and order, but the Military Tribunal was established by the Cosgrave Government, and during all the time that tribunal was responsible for the imprisonment of citizens, we had no executions until the Fianna Fáil Government took over.  The court which sentenced Mr. McCaughey to life imprisonment is a criminal court, and I should be glad if the Minister would explain how many cases were dismissed by that court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have given a definite refusal in the <Col N="2493" /> matter of McCaughey's release, and my reason for standing up here to-night is to make an appeal to the Minister to use his good offices with his fellow members of the Government in getting this man released, since he cannot be classified as in any sense a criminal.  I fail to see why the Government treated this matter in the manner in which they have treated it, and I believe that if the Government of the Twenty-Six Counties give the matter sympathetic consideration and do not allow this man to die, the Government of Northern Ireland will follow suit.</P>
      <P>The Minister may reply that this man was sentenced by a court and that the Government are not responsible for his going on hunger strike.  Hunger strike is the only means left to this citizen by which he can let the country know the injustice from which he is suffering.  If this prisoner has been four years without seeing daylight for a common assault, and if he is to spend the remainder of his days in the same condition, would he not be as well dead as having to exist in a Southern Ireland Belsen Camp?  That is the only way in which I can refer to the prison in which this man now lies dangerously ill, a prison which, I am sorry to say, is in my own constituency and only four miles from my own town.  Deputy Finucane made a request to see the prisoner, which was refused, although the black Government of the North permitted public representatives to go into the prison.  For certain reasons, the Irish Government have not allowed public representatives either to advise or to use their influence in this matter. Since there are many others in the same position as this prisoner, I should like to ask the Minister when he proposes to release this man, or if it is his intention and the intention of the Government to keep these prisoners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If Mr. McCaughey wants to be released, the Government say the matter is in his own hands.  I should be very glad if the Minister would tell the House what Mr. McCaughey must do in order to be released.  Must he sign papers? <Col N="2494" /> What steps must be taken by him? Why is he denied political treatment? I hold, as an elected representative to Dáil Eireann, that this man is entitled to release.  I would be very pleased if the Minister would indicate to the House in plain language what this prisoner must do in order to get out. I am sorry that I had to raise this matter.  I should be very glad if we could show to the world that we have a Government in this country that is not standing for the dictatorial tactics that we had experience of on the Continent some years ago and the prison conditions which we read about on the Continent.  I am sorry to say that we have similar conditions in this country. In order to prevent the death of this young man, I make a strong appeal to the Minister for his most sympathetic consideration of this case. I cannot classify him in any sense of the word as a convict.  I say he is a good Irishman to go on hunger strike. Not only is he carrying on the tradition of his fellow-Republicans, but he is the cream of the republicans in this country to-day.</P>
      <P>The Minister himself on numerous occasions in this House in the past asked for an investigation into prison conditions here.  Now, when he is Minister for Justice, he turns a deaf ear to those on this side of the House or on his own side of the House who ask for an investigation into the conditions which have forced this citizen to take the action he has taken.  I ask the Minister on humanitarian grounds to do everything possible to see that this man does not die.  We have enough deaths already on the roll of honour of the Fianna Fáil Government, and we do not want any more of them.  If he does die, I would not like to be associated with the Party who stand for his death under such conditions.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister in a Supplementary Question to-day if he was aware of the fact that Seán McCaughey's sister went to visit her brother last week in the prison, that her brother used a rag, a dirty rag at that, to wipe his mouth and that when she handed him her handkerchief it was dragged from him by a warder.  Surely <Col N="2495" /> such a thing as that should not happen in an Irish jail.  It was enough for his sister to see him dying after 18 days on hunger strike without any warder, whether he be an Irishman or an Englishman, dragging from him the handkerchief that she gave him.  I believe myself that the statement as to the conditions in this Belsen camp, as Deputy Flanagan has stated, must be true when you have prisoners willing to sacrifice their lives in order to better the conditions of their fellow-prisoners. We believe that the statements made with regard to the conditions are true, that the prisoners there are wearing only bedclothes.  They were advised not to wear prison garments, because we know that every prisoner who went out to fight for the freedom of his country would not wear prison garments whether in an Irish jail or an English jail.  Even the Taoiseach always agitated for political treatment for such Irish prisoners, whether in Irish or in English jails.</P>
      <P>I believe that political treatment should be given to these prisoners.  It is most unfair to ask Seán McCaughey and his comrades to wear prison garments, to deny them political treatment, and to compel them to exist under such conditions for the last four years.  The Minister, if he owned a dog, would not keep him tied up for four years in a box.  He certainly would take him out for a walk once or twice a day.  Are the Minister and the Government going to be inhuman and allow men to die because they are fighting for political treatment?  We all know that this man is nearing his end, and I appeal to the Government to accord him political treatment or to give him the freedom that he deserves, because we all know that he is imprisoned for an assault which might take place at any street corner any day of the week.  I believe that what is behind this is that the Government want to put Seán McCaughey to death because he knows too much, because he may be able to give information that would implicate members of this House. I believe that the Government think he is a man who knows something that would terrify the members of the Government.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to be human and just and to give consideration to the suggestion I made to-day.  I believe that Seán McCaughey is dying in this prison dressed in dirty garments which are unfit for any prisoner and that he should be allowed to wear his own clothes.  He must be a good Irishman when he is willing to lay down his life for his country.  If the Government release Seán McCaughey now, I believe that the Belfast Government will spare the life of David Fleming.</P>

      <P>I have nothing to add to the reply I gave to-day.  I might say that this question of people on hunger strike was settled about six years ago when, unfortunately, two men died on hunger strike.  The Government's attitude was restated very definitely here in a debate shortly after the election in 1943.  I referred to the matter and the Taoiseach also referred to it and definitely stated that nobody will be released because of a hunger strike. That is definite and final.  I want to thank Deputy Flanagan for raising this matter as it gives me an opportunity to deal with the vilification he poured on the prison staff in the statement he made to-day, that this unfortunate man was being left to die on a dirty sack. The prison staff were horrified when they read the evening papers and found that such a statement had been made in this House.  I want to pay a tribute to the manner in which the prison staff has tried to help and ease the lot of this man, from the governor down to the humblest member of the staff.  They have stayed up all night with him and done everything possible to alleviate his sufferings.  It is a shame that a Deputy should make an unwarranted charge of that kind.</P>
      <P>The position is that this man has a spring hospital bed and mattress, three pillows, two air-cushions, eight woollen blankets and a hospital bedrest. He is also supplied with two hotwater bottles and there is an electric heater in the cell.  His own relations have visited him several times and were there this evening.  If any of these say that the conditions are not as I state, all I can say is that they are not telling the truth.  The chaplain and the governor are there, as well as the staff, and there is also a visiting justice.  I have also made inquiries about the handkerchief incident.</P>

      <P>Whatever they were, they were accepted by this House.  I was not going to refer to this incident of the handkerchief as I thought it was too trivial.  I did not think the Deputy would come back to it.  I think we should clear up that matter.  I made inquiries about that.  The visitor was his sister.  She did not attempt to wipe the prisoner's mouth.  She wanted to leave him a handkerchief and she was told by the warder that handkerchiefs were supplied by the prison.  The prisoner took out his handkerchief and showed it to her and she took her handkerchief away.  I do not think that Deputies who are raising this matter are doing one bit of good to this prisoner.  I have had some experience of hunger strikes and the mentality of men on hunger strike.  I know that the slightest ray of hope will encourage a man to remain on hunger strike until it becomes too late.  I said that before to people who interested themselves in the case of others on hunger strike.  Unfortunately, my advice was not taken and the dire result was that two men died.  I want everyone to be certain of this, that our last word has been said on this matter. Anyone who wants to be released will not be released as a result of a hunger strike.  I have no more to say.</P>
