      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House adjourned last night I had pointed out that the establishment of the two new Departments contemplated by this Bill had been demanded for some time by public opinion which had been voiced in many quarters of this House.  I had also pointed out, however, that the Government had taken action far in advance of public opinion in this matter, and so far back as 1942 had been considering the problems involved in setting up the new Departments. In that connection, I had reminded the House of the statement which I made in February, 1944, and of the delegation Order which the Government had made in the following month as a step preparatory to setting up the new Ministry of Health.  Therefore, it will be seen that the decisions to which the Bill now under discussion <Col N="1020" /> will give effect have been arrived at only after full and mature consideration of every factor involved.  Leaving this aspect of the matter, I was in the process of reviewing the present duties which in such numbers and in almost infinite variety fall upon the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  As I have stated, when the House adjourned I had mentioned in a general way, but in no great detail, the functions which the Minister and his Department have to discharge in relation to maternity and child welfare, free milk and school meals, the welfare of the blind, the prevention and treatment of venereal diseases, tuberculosis services, standardisation of foods, control of proprietary remedies, medical research, bacteriology, public hospitals, voluntary and otherwise, hospital finance and construction, Public assistance&mdash; domiciliary, institutional and financial &mdash;medical services.</P>
      <P>I had mentioned that the Minister has to determine the numbers and types of district institutions which are provided and maintained by local authorities, and that he has to decide, among other things, for the continuance or discontinuance of particular institutions and to regulate the class of patients or inmates to be maintained in each.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the House passed a measure which was hailed everywhere as marking a great advance on the present methods of dealing with mental diseases.  The Mental Treatment Act has recast the legal basis for the detention and care of persons suffering from these disorders, and it will be brought into operation on the 1st January next. Once again, a considerable weight of extra duties and responsibilities will be thrown on the Minister for Local Government and Public Health as that Ministry is now constituted.  These extra duties and responsibilities will arise not only in respect of the mental hospital services administered by the local authorities but also of the private mental institutions.  Hitherto, these institutions have been licensed by the Circuit Courts.  Henceforward, they must be registered annually by the Minister.  Similar provisions have been <Col N="1021" /> made also in relation to charitable institutions which hitherto have not been licensed by any authority.  The new Act will also involve the organisation of the existing services so as to provide for the treatment of temporary patients and voluntary patients, including &ldquo;addicts,&rdquo; for whom special arrangements have not been made hitherto.</P>
    <P>The approval of the Minister will be required for new institutions in which these two classes of patients may be received and a considerable amount of new investigation and supervision will thus arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that apply to a new private charitable institution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>They must get Ministerial permission in the future to establish private charitable institutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, if they are going to treat persons who, by reason of mental defect, are unable to safeguard their own interests.  May I say this, before I leave the point which the leader of the Opposition has raised? The Act under which that will be done was discussed fully by this House, was approved in every quarter of the House, and has been approved outside the House by all those competent to express an opinion on these matters, so that the Deputy, if he has any objections on the ground which he has indicated, shares collective responsibility with everybody here.</P>
      <P>The Act furthermore contains a new and complicated superannuation scheme for employees of mental hospital authorities under which the Minister will be the deciding authority on a wide range of questions.  Many of these questions, as some of us know from experience, are very thorny and difficult, and to most of them the Minister will be called upon, in due course, to give personal consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government and Public Health is also responsible for the General Register Office, which supervises the registration of births, <Col N="1022" /> deaths and marriages, and arranges for the compilation of vital statistics.</P>
    <P>Then come his duties under the National Health Insurance Acts and the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts.  These involve the control and management of the National Health Insurance Fund, National Health Insurance Reserve Fund and the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Fund; the determination of insurability and the enforcement of compliance; the exercise of statutory functions in relation to administration by Cumann an Árachais Náisiúnta ar Shláinte (including the administration of medical treatment schemes of additional benefit); issue of funds; supervision of expenditure on administration; investigation of complaints; decisions of disputes between insured persons and the society and the determination of capacity for work; making agreements with doctors for medical certification; the formulation of reciprocal arrangements with the insurance authorities of other countries; decision on claims to pensions and the management and supervision of pensions in course of payment.</P>
    <P>Now, the duties and responsibilities which I have outlined do not represent even one-half of the burden that falls at the moment on the Minister for Local Government and Public Health. Not only is he the Minister responsible for the health, vital statistics and insurance services, but he is also responsible for the supervision of slum clearance, of local authorities' housing schemes, of the grant of assistance to private persons and societies for the erection or reconstruction of dwellings, and for the direction and control of town and regional planning, water supply and sewerage schemes and the provision of playgrounds, parks and open spaces, and other such matters and for the construction, repair and maintenance of roads and bridges and the collection, management and distribution of the Road Fund, the administration of grants for the relief of unemployment and numerous matters relating to road traffic.  The Minister also acts in the role of appeals body in connection with the grant of old age and blind pensions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1023" /> He is responsible for the administration of the law relating to parliamentary and local elections, for general local administration, the recruitment of staff, collection of rates, and the complex questions of local finance, including local borrowings and the administration of the numerous and diversified grants in aid of local expenditure.</P>
    <P>He is also responsible for the auditing of the accounts of public bodies and for ensuring that such defects in control or administration as these audits may disclose will be quickly remedied. He has furthermore to arrange for grouped purchasing by local authorities through a system of centrally-made contracts, and since the start of the emergency period and up to the present time he has directed the part taken by the local authorities in the turf production drive, and the distribution of free and cheap fuel.</P>
    <P>It will be evident from this review that the Department of Local Government and Public Health has become overloaded with a multiplicity of functions and that a continuous process of growth has reached a stage where effective control by one Minister over such a wide variety of disparate services is no longer possible.  A cleavage is essential and, of course, the cleavage should be made along the line which lends itself most appropriately to division.  I submit it will be equally evident, from the general review which I have made of the services, that the services relating to the health of the citizen and the community have in themselves attained a size and importance which demand the whole-time attention of a Minister.</P>
    <P>The provision of health services in a modern community presents a series of complex problems involving technology and organisation which demand a new and specialised approach.  It is becoming increasingly recognised that it is the duty of the State, not only to supervise generally the existing health activities of local authorities, but also to lead and direct these activities in accordance with the advances which are being made in medical knowledge and experience the world over.  Such advances have now attained a rate of <Col N="1024" /> accleration never experienced before. Scientific discoveries have led to great developments in the efficacy and scope of preventive and curative medicine.</P>
    <P>The Minister responsible for health services must, therefore, be in a position to give a considerable proportion of his attention to the import of these scientific achievements and to prepare from the specialised study of them a planned course of general action for the promotion of the public health, the prevention of disease, the cure of ill-health and the mitigation and alleviation of its consequences.</P>
    <P>Advances in medical technology give grounds for greater hope than ever before that such a general action may achieve signal success, but, if results of these advances are to become readily accessible to the people, they must be accompanied by similar advances on the side of organisation and administration. The inter-relationship is so intimate that the close co-ordination of the administrative and scientific arms is essential to the successful conduct of any war against disease.</P>
    <P>Apart from those special measures which must be undertaken for the provision of a new and better organised and more scientific approach to health problems in general, the normal departmental work of the new Minister for Health will be voluminous, urgent and of prime national importance. Health services are assuming a new significance to-day, both because of the unwonted virulence now attaching to certain diseases, the danger from which is aggravated by the freedom of movement and of intercourse which is being so rapidly developed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>And by malnutrition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And, of course, because of the general decline in population which is threatening the countries of Western Europe.  It is true that the case, for instance, for the intensification of the campaign against tuberculosis has already been conceded, but there are also other diseases whose incidence here is heavier than elsewhere. I refer, in particular, to diseases such as diphtheria and gastroenteritis which take particular toll of <Col N="1025" /> child life.  I have already indicated, in various public statements and in reply to questions in this House, the steps which are being taken to prevent the spread of these scourges.</P>
      <P>The best general mode of attack will be found in the introduction of a comprehensive health service scheme.  The Minister for Health would naturally address himself first to the establishment of comprehensive and co-ordinated schemes for mother and child welfare, a complete tuberculosis service, including the payment, where necessary, of maintenance allowances to families of persons undergoing treatment or who are unable to carry on their ordinary occupations, and to the provision of new and improved health clinics and county and district hospitals. He would integrate all these with specialist and regional hospital services and with the undertakings in the same fields of numerous public and voluntary bodies, so that no person who needs it will lack anything that medical skill can do to make him well or to keep him well.</P>
      <P>The second portion of the new Minister's tasks will be related to the modern scientific and technical developments to which I have referred.  For instance, the laboratory facilities for essential biological and bacteriological work in the realm of public health are inadequate to meet the full needs of the field services and they fail to provide adequate opportunities for research.  This matter and the corresponding need for stepping up the standard of medical education, including post - graduate training and research, represent essential prerequisites to the health reforms which are being formulated.  Without adequate numbers of trained medical and nursing personnel and specialists, our plans would be useless.  It will be the task of the new Minister to decide whether the higher training and research and the specialist services to which I have referred can be provided within the existing framework or whether new organistions such as State institutes will have to be created to provide them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1026" /> In brief, I may sum up what I have said by remarking that we have now in existence the blueprints of a health structure completely divorced from the old public assistance system, based upon a greatly improved family doctor service, and providing for every scientific agent that may be utilised for the preservation of health and the prolongation of life.  The Government hopes that, under the aegis of the new Minister, the execution of these plans will afford every inducement to the most distinguished graduates of our medical and scientific schools to stay in their own land, and to devote their talents to the welfare of their own people and the maintenance of the traditional repute of Irish medicine.</P>
    <P>Now, perhaps, I should say a word as to the proposed division of functions as between health authorities and sanitary authorities and the corresponding allocation of duties and responsibilities between the Ministers concerned.  As indicated in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated to Deputies, the intention is that the Minister for Health should be made responsible for the co-ordination and development of all the direct preventive and curative public health services. All these services will be administered locally by county and county borough health authorities. County councils and county borough councils, acting as health authorities, administer a number of the direct medical services already, but other duties touching these are performed in the more restricted and more numerous administrative sanitary districts by the urban and rural sanitary authorities. The present sanitary authorities, urban and rural, would remain under the supervision of the Minister for Local Government.  Their functions relate to what may be termed the environmental sanitary services, such as waterworks and sewerage schemes; street cleansing and scavenging works; the management and control of fairs and markets; public lighting; the provision of public parks, playgrounds, open spaces, baths, washhouses and swimming pools.  The local authorities responsible at present for these services would continue to provide them in addition to fulfilling <Col N="1027" /> their other obligations in regard to housing, roads, etc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>So they will do housing as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputies will recall that the Public Health Bill, 1945, which has already been discussed in the House, contains several parts devoted to a number of these environmental services.  Moreover, the title of the Minister as defined in the Bill is, of course, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  The Act of 1939 to which I referred in the opening part of my statement last night, gives power to adapt enactments and references to Departments of State, but the provisions of the Public Health Bill cannot be adapted seeing that it has not become law and it would be anomalous to proceed with it in its present form after this Bill has been enacted.  It is, therefore, proposed to withdraw the Public Health Bill and to allocate its responsibilities between the two Ministers according to their respective functions.  Then two new measures will be introduced instead, with the relevant amendments for Report and other appropriate and consequential amendments embodied therein.  The Bill to be sponsored by the Minister for Local Government will deal with what we shall call &ldquo;sanitary services&rdquo; and the other Bill to be sponsored by the Minister for Health will relate to the health services as I have defined and described them here to-day.  I turn now to the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us a little more about the death of the Public Health Bill, if we are setting up a Ministry of Health?  Is the Minister aware that as recently&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not giving way to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  It was very urgent at Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has any difficulty in understanding what I have said, I may repeat that the Public Health Bill, as now before the House, will be withdrawn, that it will be divided into separate measures.  Those provisions of it which relate to health <Col N="1028" /> services will be embodied in a Health Bill with appropriate and consequential amendments thereto, while the others will be introduced as a Local Government Bill dealing with the sanitary services and will be taken by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>Surely, it is not beyond the capacity of the Leader of the Opposition to comprehend the consequences that flow from that, the first of them being that the House will have an opportunity of discussing these two measures again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister whether, in view of the fact that the Public Health Bill was so urgent in its entirety last Easter, we could have some explanation of the change of view.  We are now being asked to set up a Ministry of Public Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy a full explanation of the change.  If he is not in a position to appreciate what I have said, I regret it very much but I submit that it is not my fault.  I was saying that I proposed to refer to the projected institution of a Department of Social Welfare.  The establishment of this Department will present a less complex task than that of the Department of Health, inasmuch as the functions proposed to be assigned to it will, with few exceptions, relate to the services which can be transferred <i>in globo.</i> The existing services which may be so transferred include children's allowances, food allowances, national health insurance, unemployment insurance and unemployment (intermittent) insurance, unemployment assistance, widows' and orphans' pensions, pensions for blind persons and old age pensions.  Each of these services, as most Deputies are aware, was designed and established at different times to meet particular social defects&mdash;to provide against the consequences of loss of income arising from sickness, unemployment, old age or death of the wage-earner.  The latest scheme, children's allowances, is in essence a non-contributory social assistance scheme for necessitous persons with families of more than two young children, inasmuch as the absence of a means tests in that scheme <Col N="1029" /> is offset by the reduction of the income-tax concession for children eligible for the allowances.  Each of these schemes, according as it was introduced, was assigned to whatever Department of State seemed best able to handle it. Expediency rather than principle seemed to have been the governing factor.  The old age pensions service, for example, is administered by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, subject to appeal to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, although, in fact, the service is not one properly referable to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Again, the national health insurance scheme is now administered by a unified society under the supervision of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, while the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme is administered directly by the same Minister, but is associated with the national health insurance&mdash;a single stamp being used to collect contributions under both services.  Unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance are administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce, but in determining questions of scope under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, liaison is maintained with the national health section of the Department of Local Government and Public Health on matters common to national health and unemployment insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, the national health inspectors are responsible for securing compliance with the Unemployment Insurance Acts and the Insurance (Intermittent Unemployment) Act, 1942.  In the assessment of eligibility for old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and unemployment assistance, claims are investigated by investigation officers of the Revenue Commissioners, while, in connection with all the social services I have reviewed, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs provides facilities at post offices for the sale of contribution stamps and the cashing of pensions and allowances. Repeated demands have emanated from various sections of the Dáil for the association of these services in a single Department.  In deference to these demands, the Government has <Col N="1030" /> had an examination instituted by the Departments concerned as to whether it was practicable and desirable to assign them to a single Minister.  As a result, the conclusion has been arrived at that the Department should have at its disposal the specialist advice of a Minister and a Department established for that purpose.  In coming to this decision the growing demands for the development and expansion of social services were reverted to.  A consideration of the problems to which the concession of these demands would give rise indicated that the Government should have a Minister who would become the centre of informed opinion on social policy, and be able to analyse and advise on such demands and, should our circumstances warrant it, prepare and administer the legislation necessary to meet them.</P>
    <P>It has been claimed that better co-ordination of effort and certain economies in staff were anticipated as a result of the merger but I cannot recommend the proposal on this score because, as I have already shown, staff of one Department in relation to the social services administered by it have been generally availed of by other Departments which likewise have been concerned with social services.  We have had a system whereby the staffs which appeared to be most suitable for one purpose have been utilised, where they appeared to be equally suitable, for other purposes, so that I cannot see that any great economies will be secured as a result of the co-ordination. Furthermore, I should say that it is possible that the development and merger of these social services will bring into being an organisation which may not be quite as economical as the organisations which administer the services at present.  I am prepared to concede, however, that we may have a social code which will be better co-ordinated and more uniform in the benefits and advantages which those who come within its scope will derive from it.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that the Minister for Social Welfare will advise the Government in regard to certain of the social services.  &ldquo;Social services&rdquo; is an expression which has a wide connotation. <Col N="1031" /> In the present context, I should emphasise that the expression, &ldquo;social services&rdquo; means the income-maintenance services which it is now proposed to assign to the Minister for Social Welfare.  The term &ldquo;income-maintenance service&rdquo; and the term &ldquo;social welfare&rdquo; have been adopted as being more accurately descriptive of the functions of the new Department, which will be only one of several Departments which are concerned with &ldquo;social services&rdquo; in the wider meaning of that term.</P>
    <P>I should say also that it is the intention to transfer to the Minister for Social Welfare the responsibility for the supervision of home assistance.  He will also have responsibility for those other public assistance functions, which relate to the maintenance in institutions or otherwise, of the destitute, aged and infirm and generally for the residuum of necessitous classes who are not covered by any of the other contributory or non-contributory social assistance schemes.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should say a word about the special position of the national health insurance schemes.  When this scheme was first introduced in Great Britain, it was intended to provide not only for insurance against loss of health but also for the prevention and cure of disease.  While the first part of this programme was immediately implemented, the development of the preventive and curative health services continued to proceed on different lines and through the medium of other agencies, namely the local sanitary and public assistance authorities and the voluntary hospitals and voluntary nursing bodies.  The additional benefits scheme administered by Cumann an Árachais Náisiúnta ar Shláinte, whereby certain dental, optical, hospital and specialist services are provided for eligible members of the society, is a recent development arising out of a change in the law which released for distribution the surplus income which in the past had been carried to reserve.  Pending the implementing of the Health Department's plan for a comprehensive medical service, this &ldquo;additional <Col N="1032" /> benefits&rdquo; scheme performs a very useful service for such members of the society as are deemed eligible and the continuance of the scheme is desirable until it can be adapted, or replaced on possibly a more expanded form, by the health authorities.</P>
    <P>When this temporary link between national health insurance and the preventive and curative medical services to be supervised by the Minister for Health has been severed and when that Minister succeeds in providing a comprehensive medical service, there will be no direct material connection between national health insurance and the health services.</P>
    <P>National health insurance must be regarded as an income-maintenance service and an essential constituent of a Department of Social Welfare. Without national health insurance that Department would be incomplete and its establishment unjustifiable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>An income-maintenance service of 15/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy ought to grow up.  He is surely a mature person now.  Why did he not increase the 15/- a week when he was Minister for Local Government?  He had control of Parliament and there was but one Party in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Deputy and his Government not do everything they are demanding now and remedy all the defects against which he is now cavilling?  The Deputy must think that people have a very short memory in this country.  Not so long ago the Deputy was crying out against the burden of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>And I still do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Now he is asking us to provide for all the things he failed to do during the ten years he was in office.  Before I leave this question of national health insurance, I should say that a great deal of consideration has already been given&mdash;and this touches the interruption of the Deputy&mdash;to the <Col N="1033" /> problems involved in recasting the whole national health insurance scheme so as to secure that the benefits under it will be more commensurate with the loss of income which an employee suffers when he falls ill.  No doubt the Minister for Social Welfare will review the progress which has been made in examining this problem and will formulate his proposals in regard to it at an early date.</P>
      <P>Lastly, perhaps again I should emphasise that careful consideration was given to the setting up of one Department comprising both public health and social welfare, but it was soon evident that a Department concerned with the ever-widening functions associated with public health, which I have sketched to the House already, and also with the similarly expanding problems of individual income and family welfare would present far too wide a task for a single Minister.  The House will therefore realise that it is only after the most mature consideration of all relevant factors and close advertence to the best design for the future care of the two most necessary physical needs of our people, health and sustenance, that the Government asks the Dáil to give effect to the proposal to establish two new Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ministry in dealing with what the Minister calls the two most necessary needs for the physical well-being of our people, proposes to put the new Ministry of Public Health and the new Ministry of Social Welfare on an equal footing with the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce upon which everything in the country must be sustained, including our social services.  We are offered here, in the draft of the measure before us, in the explanatory memorandum, coloured white, that has gone with it and in the Minister's statement, just the results of the incompetency and the indolence which have characterised the Department of Local Government and Public Health for such a long period. We have the Government like bad workmen, complaining about their tools, complaining about the tools they have destroyed and off which they have <Col N="1034" /> taken the edge, and which they have failed to put into effective use.  In their picture of what the effect on the lives of the people as a whole will be, they tell us nothing about that.  They tell us nothing but that two new Ministries, new experts of a political kind under the control of the Government to direct two new sets of machinery, will be set up.  We are told, in the face of statements that have been made on behalf of the Government both by the Taoiseach and other Ministers during the last 12 months at any rate, to confine ourselves to that.  I think, from the impression the Minister's statement has conveyed to me, that his imagination seems to have lost its delicacy.  If he had not blunted his literary talents so badly by the hack work he had to carry on as a very important part of his Departmental work in writing to the editors of the Dublin daily Press letters to be published over the name of his private secretary, he would have approached the introduction of this measure in a clearer, simpler, and more artistic way.  He could have called the measure something like an Act to recall and then embody the great Twin Brethren who are going to save the mob of this State from all dangers that may arise in every possible way.  He recalls days long ago when people were prepared to accept things without examining them. The great Twin Brethren&mdash;&ldquo;and none who saw their bearing durst ask their name or race&rdquo;; and looking to the future as to what the supposed effect of this measure will be, we can recall the effect the great Twin Brethren had long ago.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Back comes the Chief in triumph</P>
      <P>Who in the hour of fight</P>
      <P>Hath seen the great Twin Brethren</P>
      <P>In harness on his right.</P>
      <P>Safe comes the ship to haven</P>
      <P>Through billows and through gales</P>
      <P>If once the great Twin Brethren</P>
      <P>Sit shining on the sails.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And the mob of this country who are effective enough, intelligent enough and active enough, in their own way and through their voluntary organisations, to set up a Parliament here are being <Col N="1035" /> asked, without explanation of any kind, to accept a Ministry of Health and a Ministry of Social Services to look after everything with regard to their health in the most up-to-date way and to secure that their incomes will be properly maintained.</P>
    <P>The Minister last night read a statement delivered by the Taoiseach in the Seanad in April last, and, when he came to the end of his reading, he said he had read far more than he had intended.  He did, because he read the end of a statement by the Taoiseach which indicated that the idea of a Ministry of Health was born out of the fact that a Parliamentary Secretary to whom powers were transmitted had got out of hand, and it had to be explained by the Taoiseach to the Seanad that a Parliamentary Secretary, once he got the bit in his teeth, was almost completely independent of the Executive and could do things and take a stand which a Minister ordinarily would not do or take.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister in relation to his proposal here and his statement that the present Public Health Bill is being dropped to explain why, in April this year, at a time when the Taoiseach was making his statement in the Seanad, it was considered so important that that Public Health Bill, which is now lying on the political beaches of this country as big a wreck as anything on the beaches of France, should be proceeded with.  In the most important financial period not only in this House but in the general history of our country, as we were getting out of the atmosphere and the circumstances of a ghastly world war, when the House was considering its financial business, down on top of that business was thrown the Public Health Bill, and, in Committee alone, or in two-thirds of the Committee period alone, the House was asked to spend 15 days discussing the matter.</P>
    <P>We did give our services in the House to discussing the matter, up and down and inside out, and, with only two-thirds of the work on that Bill done, when we came to Holy Week and Easter Week, the House was taken by the throat by the Government, through <Col N="1036" /> the hands of the Parliamentary Secretary, and told that the matter was so urgent that the House had to spend Holy Week and, if necessary, Easter Week, in order to finish that Bill.  This House sat every week from about 28th January this year until the end of July. There were only two short weeks in which any respite was given to members to enable them to lay aside their parliamentary duties or to attend in a systematic way to business at home and that period had to be eaten into by an ugly trick on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that we, objecting to these tactics, left the discussion of the Bill after 15 days in Committee, and the Bill was simply pushed through the House.  More than 100 amendments had to be discussed and it was slapped through in a few hours, simply because the Opposition were driven out of the House by the Government's tactics.  It was urgent then and now it is thrown on the scrap-heap.  We want a Minister for Health instead and we get a long list of the tremendous things the Minister for Local Government has to do and of the great advances which have been made in science in the world and we are told how important it is to have an expert, a political expert, with a new and costly machine under him to keep the country abreast of all the things that require to be done for health.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Make no mistake about it&mdash;the root and primeval cause of all infectious disease, whether you think about the typhus that swept the country in the '40's or the gastroenteritis which decimates the population of the Dublin slums in our own time, is malnutrition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a statement made comparatively recently by a very prominent medical expert in the City of Dublin, and while new Ministries and new expenses are being set up here so that our health may be safeguarded, the real work of the country which will sustain the health of the country is being neglected and left undone.</P>
    <P>The Minister details in various ways what requires to be done in order that the health of this country may be safeguarded. He tells us that the social <Col N="1037" /> services can be co-ordinated, but we have pleaded, argued and spoken, year in and year out, for the doing of that, and we cannot understand an approach to the discussion of this measure by which the Minister can say that, in the remnants of the Public Health Bill now being cleared off the Order Paper, the Government has subscribed to the idea that if a person gets, say, tuberculosis or some infectious disease of one kind or another, he and his family will be maintained entirely at the public expense.  But if a man breaks his leg, he has to exist on 15/- a week from national health insurance funds.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I not entitled to discuss here what the Ministry of Health is wanted for and what it will do?  I realise, Sir, that I cannot put questions to you that are not <i>ad hoc.</i> I propose to talk to the best of my ability, at any rate, about the principles enshrined in such statements or documents as we are able to get from the Ministry on the question of public health.  When we are asked to go to <Col N="1038" /> the expense of setting up another public Department, particularly a public Department which the Minister said was going to do such tremendous things, I want to get discussed in the House by the various Deputies who are interested in the matter what this Public Health Department could do if it were set up and whether it is worth having it set up.  The Minister rides away on a general suggestion that there has been a very widespread demand for a Ministry of Public Health.  There has been a widespread demand to take nearly every branch of administration connected in any way with any vital need of the country out of the hands of the Ministry of Local Government and Public Health.  But that is entirely a reflection on the Department and the way in which it has broken down.</P>
      <P>On 3rd April, 1946, there was a motion before the Seanad proposed by Senator Sir John Keane in the following terms:-</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad takes note of the intention of the Government to appoint two new Ministers within the Department of Local Government and Public Health, and requests the Government to issue a paper embodying the principles of the proposed change and further to afford the House an opportunity to debate the matter before the actual legislation is introduced.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is reported in column 1226 of the Official Reports.  In relation to that the Taoiseach said at column 1246:-</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have already told you that the Senator's demand is being met and that a White Paper will be circulated. How long it will be circulated before the Bill appears, I cannot say at the moment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As reported in column 1247, the Taoiseach went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The procedure which the Senator principally requests is to be adopted in this particular case.  It was indicated in advance that it would be adopted.  That is why I think it rather strange that the Senator did not give a little more thought to the way in which he drafted the motion.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator in his motion asked for a <Col N="1039" /> White Paper.  The Taoiseach promised a White Paper and we have not got the White Paper.  All that was stated on the 3rd April, 1946.  At that particular time we were discussing the Public Health Bill in the Dáil.  The White Paper promised cannot have referred to the Public Health Bill.  It must have referred to what Senator Sir John Keane deals with there, namely, the principles of the proposed change. What is wrong that we could not have had the White Paper which the Taoiseach spoke about before this Bill was introduced and before we were asked to discuss it here?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government is simply treating the House in the kind of way in which the House has too often recently been treated by the Government generally.  Yesterday, the Tánaiste suggested that the whole business would be passed through that day with very little talk.  As this matter was discussed on a motion by Deputy Everett in this House in November last and in the Seanad in April, and as the Minister has gone back to 1942 in discussing all these various problems, why can we not have a statement of what this Ministry proposes to do in order to preserve and maintain the health of the country?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the tuberculosis plans.  The rate of mortality from tuberculosis was falling substantially and regularly practically from the time this State was set up until 1934, at any rate.  Then it started to go up and down.  In 1942-43 it went up in such a way that the Minister speaks very alarmingly about it and very elaborate schemes are being organised to examine early symptoms of tuberculosis when they appear amongst our people.  A Tuberculosis Bill was passed to give the Department of Local Government full authority to choke down the activity of every hospital, whether private or public, in the country in relation to tuberculosis until they got the very big scheme of three major hospitals put into operation throughout the country. Now we find that none of these plans has yet appeared, that developments were held up for some time past in relation to Peamount&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister and his Department not only did so, but they are taking almost complete control of some of the private hospitals which were dealing particularly with tuberculosis.  I suggest to the Minister that he is putting the heavy hand of the State completely down on the Peamount institution and probably on the Newcastle institution, that he has prevented Peamount from developing plans for providing extra beds which they could have readily done and were anxious to do.  They were told to wait until the great new developments with regard to the three new regional hospitals were gone ahead with.  Now we find that probably the great scheme for Santry Court sanatorium is not going to go ahead and that we are to have an extension of the airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take the opportunity, when replying, to traverse every statement that the Deputy has made and to show that they are without foundation in relation to any well-considered plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the Minister may have a lot to say in replying, particularly when we take into consideration that during the 15 days we were in Committee on the Public Health Bill, we could not get the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to come into the House to discuss any aspect of the measure. So far from discussing or appearing in the House to discuss any aspect of the measure, when two Financial Resolutions had to be moved by a Minister, it not being possible under the procedure <Col N="1041" /> of the House to have them moved by a Parliamentary Secretary, we could not get the Minister to come into the House to move these resolutions, and they had to be moved by other Ministers.  The Minister for Lands had to come in on one occasion and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on the other.  But we are asked to pass a Bill to set up a Minister for Public Health here, with the wrecks of the Public Health Bill there.  We are being told that it is being wiped out and that it is not going to be pursued.  We are not being told why or what particular principles are going to be embodied in the new measure the Minister speaks about and we have not been given a White Paper on the general principles that would be involved in such proposals, as was promised in the Seanad by the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The Minister is concerned with the maintenance of income and the general social service.  The Taoiseach told the Seanad, in column 1247:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The next question is concerned with the social services.  Any members of the Seanad who read the remarks I made on that subject on more than one occasion in the Dáil, will understand what our position is in that regard.  We do not believe that there is any substance in the case which has been presented to us for the co-ordination of the social services as they stand at present.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was April, 1946.  So that, in the proposals to set up a Ministry of Social Welfare on the grounds that that Ministry will co-ordinate the social services, the Government have somersaulted as completely in respect of the social services as they have somersaulted in regard to the Public Health Bill.  &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are going to set up a separate Ministry for a different reason&rdquo;&mdash;and the reason is given in column 1248:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Consequently, we want to have a member of the Government who will be in a position of authority, and who will know the mind of the Government, to take those services as a whole under his control.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So that we are going to get a social services manager and he is going to be <Col N="1042" /> called an expert.  I could see some reason for establishing a Ministry of Social Welfare that would help to gather the various threads of the social services machinery in the country together under a person who would discuss with the House and encourage discussion in the House on matters affecting every aspect of our social services. I could understand that, but I cannot understand a Ministry being set up to control the social services, particularly when we realise what control means in the phraseology of the Government.  Therefore, in connection with that matter, I would ask whether any consideration has been given and I would ask the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who professes to be so full of determination to tell us things when he is replying, without being so disposed when opening the matter, to tell us, when he is replying, how the principles that he has in mind in relation to the social services and their organisation compare with the recommendations and suggestions that have been made by the Commission on Vocational Organisation.  At page 434, column 691, of their report, the commission say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As described in Part III, Chapter VIII, social services such as medical care, unemployment assistance, old age pensions and poor relief are administered by central or local government agencies, by vocational bodies and by other voluntary organisations.  Different parts of these schemes are administered by different organisations, which, moreover, have varying degrees of responsibility for them.  This variety of treatment may not appeal to the type of mind which likes everything to be on a uniform and tidy pattern, but we consider that it is socially sound and should be maintained.</P>
    <P>The benefits provided by trade unions and professional benevolent societies for their members constitute a very large and valuable form of assistance and one which is very efficiently and economically administered. There is a natural tendency in every organised profession or trade to develop such forms of practical <Col N="1043" /> benevolence and brotherhood, and it is obviously more in the public interest to encourage this tendency than to stifle it.  Men give more freely and generously for the assistance of those bound to them by ties of professional loyalty and comradeship. Moreover, they can administer such schemes more efficiently and economically when they know the recipients and have immediate personal interest in avoiding waste or abuse.  Where employers wish to make special provision out of profits for pensions or other social benefits they should be encouraged by the State to do so.  The present system of old age pensions does not encourage such persons or companies to promote or develop pension schemes for their workers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister what is the attitude of the Government to the spirit of the recommendations and suggestions and approval contained in that paragraph.  I ask him to tell us what is meant by the Taoiseach when he says, &ldquo;to take these services as a whole under his control,&rdquo; and I particularly ask him what examination has taken place and what departmental or inter-departmental discussions have taken place on the various services that are mentioned here and whether it would not have been reasonable, before any proposals were put before the House to set up a Ministry of Social Welfare, that an outline should have been made in a White Paper, however detailed, showing exactly the extent to which these various services that are mentioned were out of keeping with one another.  Surely we ought to discuss whether it is reasonable that a man with a broken leg would be expected to exist and maintain his family on 15/- a week from an insurance policy plus home assistance; and a person who had contracted tuberculosis or some infectious disease would be cared for completely through the local authorities and outside the poor law system completely because he was not able to maintain his family as a result of his contracting an infectious disease. Surely there should be some examination of whether unemployment insurance, health insurance, and so on, could <Col N="1044" /> not be put together in a general insurance scheme, and surely the time is ripe, when this particular measure is moved here, to have a more satisfactory review of the proposals put before the public generally by Dr. Dignan in his paper&mdash;a review which was promised from the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister is treating the House in an absurd and most unsatisfactory way.  We are discussing measures that are largely going to be operated through local authorities&mdash;if they can be called such any longer.  At present the county manager takes complete supersedence over the local representative in most of the work that is mentioned here.  These proposals mean that the county manager will now be the servant of three Ministries&mdash;the Ministry of Local Government, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Social Welfare.  I ask the Minister to discuss the position of the county manager as the servant of three particular Ministries.  The attitude of the Government has been, up to the present, to centralise as much as possible with regard to local administration. They have centralised very much in the powers they gave the Minister for Local Government and Public Health. Now they are decentralising him.  I submit that they are only decentralising the Minister for Local Government because of the inefficiency that has characterised his administration, and because of the disruption which his inefficiency has created in his Department.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that ought to be discussed when the Government are proposing these measures to us.  It arises out of the principles enshrined in Most Rev. Dr. Dignan's report as to how all this is going to be related to the principle that families can only be maintained on a sound income by getting productive work in the country. The Minister is simply piling on an additional piece of taxation and giving an additional amount of political grip into the hands of Ministers whose whole concern is for the prestige of their Party&mdash;for the way in which they can hold up their Party prestige and power by gripping every scrap and bit of machinery in the country and cow <Col N="1045" /> the ordinary people as a mob.  We have the extraordinary position that in the last 12 months, when public health matters have been discussed, the medical fraternity were, until very recently, completely unlistened to by the Department that was putting a measure together.  That system is broken down now.  The condition to which the medical profession were reduced by the attitude of the Government was such that they were afraid to open their mouths in public, and even to-day, although I understand some medical organisations have made representation to the Government with regard to the drafting of new public health legislation, no group of the organised medical profession in the country has thought fit to address its ideas or its counter-proposals to any other Party in the House.  They are still in the cowed position that they were in when public health was being discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is the fulfilment of a promise that was made in the House last year by the Taoiseach when we had a motion down dealing with the social services. Naturally we require first of all Ministers for these Departments.  It will then be their duty to introduce measures to carry out the wishes of the majority of the members of the House. The Minister for Social Welfare will, I see, have duties relating to unemployment assistance, widows and orphans, and national health, but I observe one serious omission, and that is the Workmen's Compensation Act. My experience of the working of that Act is that the insurance companies continue to pay an allowance to an injured workman for probably six months, but they always watch the period in which the Circuit Court will be holding a sitting.  About a fortnight after the court has sat the injured workman receives notice that the payment of his compensation is suspended, with the result that he may then have to seek home assistance from the local authority for the support of his family and himself, pending a settlement with the insurance company.  My experience is that there will be no settlement until notice is served to bring on the case at the following Circuit Court.  That will take three months.  It will often happen that before the court is held the workman will make a settlement which will not provide for anything, except perhaps enable him to pay his bills.  The settlement will make no provision for his detention or cure in hospital.  I think it is a serious omission that nothing is to be done under <Col N="1047" /> this legislation to prevent insurance companies from carrying on the practices that I have referred to.  They should be compelled to make provision for the detention and care of an injured person in hospital as well as making a compensation payment.  Even where a man receives £200 or £300 he sometimes becomes a charge on the public purse within a year.  I hope that the Minister will deal with this matter when he is replying.  This question of workmen's compensation&mdash;dealing with insurance companies as regard their treatment of injured workmen&mdash;should be the responsibility of the Minister for Social Welfare.  I take it that the Minister for Health will have full charge with regard to home assistance matters.</P>

      <P>We all recognise the amount of work that is carried out by the Department of Local Government. Practically the whole machinery of the State is controlled by that Department. While we may not all agree with the Minister, we recognise that he gives his full time to the work of the Department. I advocated on many occasions that a number of the services under the Department at present should be dealt with by a separate Ministry, because of the impossibility of one man doing all the work that is to be done.  I think as regards the social services, and the care and welfare of the sick that it is well worth while taking the risk of appointing a Minister who will give his whole time to that work.</P>

      <P>When I was speaking to this motion on Wednesday night I had reached the point where I said that soldiers are soon forgotten.  It is only a few years ago since the eyes of the nation were turned to the bogs and the bogmen were asked to take off their coats to save the nation by producing fuel, so that the people would not be cold during the winter months.  The bogmen responded to the call in no uncertain way.  Now that the emergency is easing off, and conditions are coming back to normal, we find that the bogmen are not being applauded for what they did but they are to be penalised, notwithstanding all the good work they did for the Irish nation.</P>
      <P>So far as I see, the actions of the Government are little different from the actions of the old Irish landlords. If a man improved his place they slapped on new taxation and the position with many people in the country was that their last state was worse than the first.  The Minister starts by pin-pricking in various parts of the country to see how this business of increasing valuations will be taken.  He started in Tipperary and then in Mayo and increased valuations here and there.  I am not sure whether he has yet come to my county, but there is one thing certain, that if this is allowed now there will soon be a general revaluation and I do not think the Irish people will be prepared to stand for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would think the bogmen made huge profits, that their pockets are bulging with money.  So far as my county is concerned, that is a fallacy. It is unjust to suggest that about the bogmen because those of them who reside in Meath got a raw, cruel deal. It may be that bogmen did well in other counties where the bogs are vast, but there is not a vast area of bogland in Meath.  There is one part with a fair amount of bog, but I should like the Minister to realise that fully 75 per cent. of the bog areas in Meath are, as a result of the Government's <Col N="1049" /> operations, now completely wiped out. They are now a wilderness.  In the past there were men in Meath who had little bogs which they regarded as private concerns for themselves and their friends.  When the emergency came the State stepped in and trampled on the rights of these private individuals and gave them practically no compensation.  State agents cut the turf and allowed others to cut it until the little bogs were wiped out.  Now the men who formerly had those bogs have to travel outside their areas to get fuel.</P>
    <P>We are told that the bogmen are well off and the Government are about to increase their valuations.  That is very unfair.  Most of the bogmen that I know regret that there ever was an emergency because it did them an immense amount of harm and it has left them without fuel for the future.  This action on the part of the Government is mean, niggardly and un-Irish.  Who are the bogmen?  They are the most unfortunate people in the country.  They represent the remnants of the old Irish race, the people who had to go to Hell or Connaught.  They went to the bogs and they survived, but always it has been a desperate life, a hard, pitiful life.  Would the Minister live for 24 hours in any of these bogs, let alone for 24 years?  I do not think he would. He might have passed through them at one time while he was on the run, but I do not think he would stay a night there now.</P>
    <P>These areas are bleak and miserable. For the people living there it is damp, sour and dour.  Most families are afflicted with tuberculosis, pains or rheumatism.  All the afflictions common to man reach the bogmen.  Most of them die young.  You can see many of them moving around on crutches; they are nearly always lame from the dampness.  The Government now tell us that the people on the bogs have had a good time and a higher valuation must be imposed on them.  Cromwell is not dead yet.  I have had a letter from one of those new-rich, as the Government describe them, those famous bogmen.  When I read that letter the House will see how these unfortunate men are placed.  It is only right that <Col N="1050" /> I should read this letter.  The writer seems to be an honest, straightforward man who just wants a fair crack of the whip.  Here is what he wrote to me:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I beg to ask you to do a little favour for me.  The Meath County Council has a spread ground for turf taken from me under the emergency Order for the past six years. The council had it the first two years and Mr. Geraghty has had it now for four years.  Now Mr. McKiterian, the district surveyor, says I was paid £2 the first two years.  I definitely got no money for the first two years. Now they want to put me away with £2 for four years, 10/- a year.  I measured the area under turf covered by Mr. Geraghty and the area was 1 acre 1 rood and 28¼ square yards, Irish measure.  An auctioneer has valued the spread ground at £5 per Irish acre per season.  Under the emergency Order it was read out for me at an arbitration meeting held at the courthouse in Ballivor recently. The arbitrator was Mr. A. J. Malone, solicitor, Trim.  Mr. Noonan and Mr. McKiterian were also there. It was read out that the county council of each county would pay full compensation for any damage done. I cannot go to law under the Order. I have returned the cheque for £2 to Mr. Ward, solicitor, Edenderry. What I want to ask you is, will you ask a question in the Dáil or put one to the Minister over this business, or bring this matter up at a county council meeting?  I will have your answer published.  Another thing, Mr. A.J. Malone never saw the bog, he was not there, and Mr. McKiterian would not let Mr. Murphy, ex-teacher from Trim, survey the area under turf.  I am a poor man trying hard to eke out a living.  Do not let them best me.  I am entitled to full compensation.&mdash;MICHAEL COMMONS.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the type of man on whom the Government want to increase the valuation.  He is a Meath bogman with a few acres.  There is a spread bank which he could let to his neighbours at £2, £3, or £5 an acre, but the Government would not let him do that. They took over the spread bank and offered him 10/- a year for one and a <Col N="1051" /> half Irish acres when he could have got £2, £3 or £5 an acre from his neighbours or could use it for grazing.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Finance knows of people who have made huge profits out of turf, he will not find any of them in my county or in Westmeath East either.  This thing is going too far.  It is bringing contempt on the Irish Government and on this House.  These unfortunate men got a chance&mdash;the one chance in a lifetime.  When did the bogman get a chance before?  Did he get a chance in the last 50 or 100 years?  He did not.  In the last few years the men on the bogs got a chance to make a little money by hard work and now the Government begrudge them the little they made and want to take it off them.  Such action is mean, dirty, un-Irish.  It brings us back to the days of Cromwell.  And all this is not being done under our own laws.  The Government have to resurrect the Victorian laws, old British laws, the laws which the Minister said he had such contempt for. I am afraid he has not very much contempt for them now because he is using them to penalise a down-trodden people.</P>
    <P>The Government should drop this idea of increasing the valuation and give these poor people a chance of living.  We ought to be proud of them for the way they stood by the nation in a time of need.  The Forces man cannot even get a house built for him. The houses are all mud cabins, with no foundations, sitting in quagmires. Then an Irish Government must have money to make new Ministries, to give the officials a better time and squeeze the down-and-outs.  I want the Minister for Finance now present to realise that those who were prepared to shelter Irishmen in their struggle for freedom did do it and Irish nationalism ran in the blood of everyone. Let him stop this dirty, mean work and let him be as Irish as he was 15 years ago.  If he does not do that, the Irish people will live to regret the actions of this Government.</P>

      <P>I represent a constituency where there is a vast area of bog and I remember the time, some 14 <Col N="1052" /> years ago, when thousands of acres of that bog in Kildare had no access to it at all.  It was undrained and large areas were owned by big land owners. The Government here, 12 or 14 years ago&mdash;and not just at the beginning of the emergency&mdash;decided to expend vast sums of money on bog drainage, to bring those bogs into production. That was long before the war.  In 1933 and 1934, officials inspected those bogs and I know cases where thousands of pounds were spent on 500 or 600 acres of bog.  The poor people of the district were amazed at first at such amounts being allocated. Protests were made by people who did not agree with the Government on this wastage of public money and protests were made by Opposition members here against the extravagance of Fianna Fáil in wasting millions of pounds, in 1933 and 1934, on such useless work.  Many people throughout the country asked why the Government should spend such an amount of money to improve the property of individuals and said it was unfair to the taxpayer to do so.</P>

      <P>Many supporters of Deputy Mulcahy in my constituency were opposed to that large expenditure of public money on the improvement of what they called swamp and waste.  The <Col N="1053" /> Government continued and developed those large areas, which up to then were swamps, utilised only for game, an odd grouse drive, for snipe and duck shooting.  Up to then, the poor bogmen Deputy Giles talks about were in a bad way.  Having decided to foster turf, a guaranteed price was arranged by the Government and it was decided that the fuel to be used in the Government services was turf.  As a result, those areas of swamp became of value. The owners decided to put on a rent and they were getting a handsome income out of them.  That is not since the emergency started, but 14 or 15 years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to interrupt the Deputy again, but on a point of order, this is a motion for which there is very little time available. It deals with the emergency and with the discrimination during the emergency between counties such as Kildare and Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHarris" hpid="Mr. Harris Mr. Harris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming back to the emergency.  The bogs that were worthless immediately became of value and there was competition for them.  Other people saw there was money in turf and those who had tried to live on them during the period when they were undrained and undeveloped found that competitors with more money were coming in and giving big prices.  I am coming to the emergency now, but even before the emergency there was a great volume of opinion against the Government spending that money to the advantage of individuals.  A good case could have been made then for the Government if, before spending those millions, they had taken over those bogs in the national interest, at the very low price which they were worth, and then developed them so that the community might have the advantage instead of letting it go to individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the coming of the emergency, the position became more acute.  Those areas were put up for public auction and what was not worth 10/- or even 5/- a square perch previous to their development by the expenditure of Government money went up to £10 a perch and more.  As a result of that&mdash;<Col N="1054" /> and Deputy Norton knows all about this, as he had to step in along with me to seek some control over the prices &mdash;the Minister for Supplies was compelled to make an Emergency Powers Order, restricting the price of turf banks to what they were at the beginning of the emergency and putting an end to public auctions altogether, as the local people, the bogmen Deputy Giles talks about, were being put completely out of the picture.  I believe that, instead of the motion which Deputy Mulcahy put down, he should have taken action on directly opposite lines.  He should have taken up the attitude that the valuation authorities have been lax in their duty and that, 12 or 14 years ago, they should have dealt with this matter and tried to save the taxpayers and ratepayers, who had to finance this bog development, some of the burdens they had to bear.</P>

If he had consulted his leader about the position and about the implications of this motion, he would, I think, have taken a completely different line.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never listened to a more feeble case for the defence of any Government plan or any form of taxation than I have listened to in respect of this attempt by the Minister for Finance to take money out of the pockets of the bog owners.  I know nothing about Kildare and still less about Tipperary so far as the bogs and their owners there are concerned.  But I do know something about Mayo.  The percentage of bog in Mayo is not as great as one would imagine.  The county is densely populated and a great portion of the bog is divided in two and three acre plots amongst small farmers.  As I stated here, in the form of a supplementary question on a question addressed to the Minister by another Deputy, the Taoiseach and other responsible citizens at the beginning of the emergency appealed to the small farmer and to the small farmer's son to go out into their little piece of turbary and increase production. They were asked to make even a second cutting.  They were told to cut early and to cut again, the second cutting to go towards providing fuel for the people in the towns and cities.  The farmers' sons did that. The Minister for Industry and Commerce made sure that they would have to do it.  Prior to the emergency, the small farmer's son went to England to earn a livelihood.  He had to stay at home during the emergency and, if he did not go into the bog and endeavour to earn a pittance there by hard labour from early morning until sunset, he would have to starve.  Whether he did that from patriotic motives, or as a matter of public duty or to save himself from starvation, at all events he cut the turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do we find to-day?  We find the Minister for Finance sending out notices asking these small tenants with an acre, or from two to four acres, of bog&mdash;some of them have less than an acre&mdash;to fill in a form stating what profits they made during such and such a year.  Nobody who knew Fianna Fáil as I knew them and who was familiar with their history would think that a <Col N="1056" /> Fianna Fáil Minister and Fianna Fáil Deputies would be rising here to-day to defend that type of taxation.  Who would have thought that the day would come when we should find a Minister for Finance representing that Party defending such a proceeding as this? They gave us to understand many years back that they stood for the poor, that they were out to reduce taxation and that taxation was far in excess of what it should be.  Who would have thought that the day would come when, having put taxation to the very limit on every other section of the community and on every possible commodity, they would turn to the bog owner, to the man in Mayo, who, during the emergency did as I have said?  We find that this gentleman, Mr. Aiken&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="1057" /> The Minister is aware that there is a land agitation in County Mayo.  We shall have a bog agitation there and I want to assure the Minister that he can send out forms and send down officials to value the bogs and estimate the amount of money supposed to be made in these bogs; he can endeavour to gather that money in in the form of an increase in the rates or an increase in taxation, but he will be foolish and mistaken.  We shall do everything in our power to prevent that and stop it and we shall have the backing of the small tenant farmer in County Mayo.  The small farmer in Mayo looked at that piece of bog as his property.  It is his property and, in making a second cutting to provide fuel for the cities and towns, he felt he was reducing the amount of turbary he had at his disposal.  He considered that he was reducing the life of that turbary by half because of making a second cutting.  He had no guarantee that, when that fuel would have gone, he would have anything to take its place in the form of coal or electricity. Nevertheless, he was good enough to make his contribution.  His son, instead of going to England, went into the bog and worked from 8 o'clock in the morning until sunset.  In and around Ballyhaunis, papers have been sent to small bog owners asking them for a return of the profits they made.  How can they give a return of their profits? They cannot give an exact return.  The Minister has acted stupidly and the sooner he realises that the better.  He has &ldquo;put his foot in it&rdquo;.  I do not know if there are landlords in Kildare or Tipperary with 1,000 acres of bog but, if he thinks he is going to tax the small bog owner in Mayo, he is hitting his head against a concrete wall.  The small bog owner will have the support of all Deputies, whether of the Clann na Talmhan Party or the Fianna Fáil Party.  If they have not the support of Fianna Fáil Deputies, they will not be worthy of being called Deputies.  If the Minister tries to enforce that type of taxation, the small tenant farmer will have the support of all Parties.  I have made my protest and let the Minister take the consequences.</P>

      <P>I think that we have been very unfairly dealt with.  We had the main contribution on the Government side from the Minister.  Then we had a contribution from Deputy Colley who indicated that while increased valuation is coming very slowly, it will come all in good time.  Later we had a contribution from Deputy Harris. No one is going to argue here that the people of Kildare did not make a little bit of money out of turf during the emergency but when we are told by the Minister that the valuation goes up by one-third of the average annual income that may be expected from the property, it becomes useful for us to know why Deputy Harris thinks that the scheme is a grand one and that it should be operated long ago.  In County Kildare during the emergency not a single additional halfpenny went on turf valuation for the whole period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My motion protests in the first place against the discrimination that has occurred by which persons in North Tipperary who provided turf during the emergency had their valuations increased by a kind of after-thought, while none of their neighbours either in South Tipperary, Waterford, Clare or Galway had any increase put on their valuation.  I am not saying that it would not have been wrong to increase the valuations in South Tipperary, Clare, Mayo or Galway by reason of turf produced for emergency purposes.  The Minister has indicated that it is a matter for the ratepayers and the whole history of this question throughout the country has shown how common-sense and fair-minded the ratepayers of the country were, because outside Monaghan and Tipperary, the people in whose power it was to move in their own interests that an increased valuation should be put on turf bogs, did not so move.  That <Col N="1060" /> fact is an interpretation of the people's mentality and outlook.  The Minister for Finance indicated, as against that, that the Minister for Local Government addressed a communication to county managers some years ago calling their attention to the fact that there was increased turf production and that, as there was an increased income from bogs, the valuations should go up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a mistake to say that that communication went to county managers some years ago.  It was only this spring it was sent out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This spring, after the emergency was over, the managers were apparently asked to go back and try to estimate how much turf was produced in each of the last three years so that they might be in a position to advise the valuation officials that an increased valuation should be put upon such property, property which as many Deputies have pointed out, had been destroyed utterly from the point of view of its grazing possibilities and property from which a substantial amount of turf, which the owners would ordinarily conserve for their own household purposes, was used up because of the national emergency. The value of such property as a result of the removal of excessive quantities of turf from it, was depreciated rather than increased.</P>

      <P>The Act was there for Mayo, for Galway, for Donegal and for all the places the Minister can think of.  It is very hard to know how it would have acted, but I will give the House an example.  Not all the turf produced in the country was sold through Fuel Importers, Limited, but if the valuation in, say, County Mayo had been raised in relation to the turf sold from Mayo through the local authority to Fuel Importers, Limited, taking into consideration that about 60,000 tons a year for the years 1943, 1944, 1945, were supplied and assuming that the producer got even £1 per ton, on the Minister's figures, the valuation in Mayo should have gone up by £20,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In North Tipperary, on an average, 11,000 tons were sold for the three years, and if the valuation had gone up in relation to that amount, it ought to have gone up by something like £4,000.  It went up by £1,000, so that, in so far as one can judge the situation by the turf provided for Fuel Importers, Limited, three-quarters of the people in North Tipperary were relieved of a burden which one-quarter had to pay.  In Deputy O'Donnell's part of the county, they were quite happy because some queer wall divided north from south.</P>

      <P>The extra cost arising out of the production of turf was paid by the turf users in Dublin and by the subsidy which had to be given by the Government, but surely the Minister is not telling us now that some of the cost of producing turf in <Col N="1064" /> various counties is to be left as a burden on the ratepayers through the county council machinery?  Are we to understand that the Minister does not propose to relieve the county council machinery and the rates of any excessive cost arising out of turf production during the emergency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out that if, in north Tipperary, £4,000 of rates which should have been collected from the people who got the money for the turf is not being collected, the rest of the ratepayers in north Tipperary must be paying it, over and above what they would have had to pay if it had been taken from the proper people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not understand what I am saying, but what he now implies is that, when turf cutting started throughout the country, a certain amount of rates normally payable by the country should have been taken from the other ratepayers and put on the turf cutters.  The country did not believe that was reasonable or sensible and refused to do it, except in two isolated instances. I protest against that, and I suggest that the necessary legislation should be introduced to relieve that small number of people of the injustice done to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that legislation should be introduced immediately which will improve the pay and prospects of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses and which will entitle them to pension rights on the same basis as other State servants; and, furthermore, is also of opinion that all auxiliary postmen should be put on the established list so as to ensure for them not only reasonable remuneration, but also decent pensions after long and strenuous service to the community.</P>
      <P>The particular class of public servants whose position this motion proposes to improve is a very small number, taking the total number of State servants into account.  We have some interesting particulars with regard to this matter, amongst them being the promise made about two years ago by the Minister that the whole salary and remuneration situation would be reviewed, a thing which has not been done so far to my knowledge.  As to the conditions of work of these officials, they have a pretty arduous life.  They have to be in their offices from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., but that does not cover all their work. On at least one night per week, they have to spend many hours after the closing of their office squaring up the weekly accounts in order to have them ready for the postmaster.  They must provide their own office and also light and fuel without any State help.  Where the work in a country post office is too heavy for one person, the sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress has to employ an assistant at his or her own expense.  About 2,000 of the total number of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses are receiving less than £1 a week.  The average weekly pay is in the neighbourhood of £1 12s. a week.  They have no annual leave, no half-holiday and no pension.  When they come to the end of their employment the only thing they can look forward to in many cases is the old age pension, for which there is a means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of rural postmen.  It is superfluous to go into details because everyone must know their condition. They are unestablished.  Their service can be terminated at a week's notice. They are not very well paid.  They have to start work in many cases at 8 o'clock in the morning and to undertake toilsome journeys in any weather. I have not the slightest doubt that in the case of rural postmen the Minister will put forward the case that in most cases they have a sideline, perhaps a bit of land, a small business, or so on. Take the case of those who have land. What amount of work on his land can a man do who has to cover ten to 20 miles, perhaps 30 miles, on a bicycle, delivering mail from door to door in a country district in any kind of weather?  When he returns after that work to his home, what can he do on the land?  He has done a heavy day's work and must feel tired.  If there is any benefit to be derived from that sideline it is certainly not for the postman. <Col N="1067" /> His wife or his children or some other person may get the benefit.</P>
    <P>I do not need to elaborate on this subject.  The motion was put down for the purpose of bringing to the Minister's notice and to the notice of the House the situation as it is.  Sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses have to provide an office at their own expense.  They do not receive any help in the form of free light or fuel.  They have to work from 9 until 7.  They have to work after office hours to complete their accounts.  Some postmistresses have to rise as early as 6 o'clock to allow in the postmen to do the sorting before they go on their rounds.  As I have said there are at least 2,000 of them whose salary is under £1 a week.  They were promised a full review of their case two years ago and nothing has come of that.  I put this case forward to bring to the Minister's notice that this section of people are a deserving body.  They are a small section but that is the very reason why they should not be forgotten. Of the total number of State servants they are a mere handful but they should not be forgotten.  They are a very useful section.</P>
    <P>Occasionally we read in the paper where a sub-postmaster or a sub-postmistress is charged with embezzlement. The miserably low scale of pay is responsible for that.  The situation, if not actually creating criminals, is conducive to criminal acts.  These people handle a good deal of public money.  The number of people in rural districts using the Post Office Savings Bank to a very great extent is increasing year by year.  In putting people in charge of public money we should raise them above the level of temptation. We have not done that.  We are not paying them.  Their hours are long and strenuous.  They have contributed well to the State for a long number of years and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Consideration is overdue for the two classes&mdash;sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses and rural auxiliary postmen.  The Minister must be well aware of the difficulties they have to contend with in the ordinary course of their duties.  Their work has been <Col N="1068" /> increasing year by year.  They have work in connection with children's allowances and, in some cases, have to cope with a coupon system.  They are at the beck and call of everybody.  A country post office is open all day long. No meal hour is stipulated.  If the person in charge is in the middle of a meal he or she must leave it to attend to anyone who comes in.  We very seldom hear complaints.  There may be some complaints from time to time but they are very few in number.  It is very hard to blame them, if they are abrupt with their customers from time to time. The case we are putting up is that the review of the situation which the Minister promised some time ago should now be put in hands and that these two classes in the community should get the consideration they so richly deserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion because I think it calls for a remedy in respect of very deserving classes of public servants.  An effort of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to remedy the outstanding grievances associated with the employment of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses and auxiliary postmen is long overdue.  So far as sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses are concerned, nobody in this country&mdash;except the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, which buries its head in the sand, because it is the victim of a vicious and inherited system &mdash;will attempt to justify the scales of payment.  An examination of the remuneration of these grades will clearly indicate that the Post Office exploit them in a soulless manner while they have their hand on their heart pretending that they are most anxious to do whatever can be done.  They never have the slightest intention of doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before this debate finishes I will get, by means of a Parliamentary question, particulars of the remuneration of these people.  If the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs can justify employing people at such scandalously low rates of pay as those which he pays to sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses, then I must say he is completely devoid of all sense of conscience and of the concepts of social justice.  These sub-postmasters <Col N="1069" /> and sub-postmistresses are employed on what is known as scale payment offices.  Their remuneration is paid on a unit system of work.  That is to say, every transaction in the office is given a unit value.  These units are aggregated by a process that is more noticeable for its division than for its addition or multiplication.  The Post Office arrives at a scale of remuneration in that way, and then says that is the salary attached to the post. How the Post Office can give to this remuneration the majestic title of salary passes my comprehension.  The fact is that what is granted to sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses on the scale payment method is a beggarly pittance for doing important State work.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably say that, every time there is a vacancy in these offices, the Department gets a number of applications, and that a lot of people are keen on getting the appointment. That is probably true.  In a number of cases you have many applications for appointment to a particular post.  Many of those people just see the rose at a distance.  They get the employment, and when they get a closeup view of the rose they begin to realise that there are many thorns associated with it, and that it has not all the glamour that it appeared to have when seen at a distance.  There was the case of a sub-postmistress at a place called Portroe who was prosecuted by the State for defalcation in her accounts.  That unfortunate lady admitted that when she took the appointment in the first instance she thought she was in a secure position for life, only to realise that not only could she not live on the paltry wage she received but that in fact she had to engage in these manipulations which brought about her downfall.  That person would be honest to-day, she would be a free citizen to-day&mdash;if she was not subject to the viciousness which goes hand in hand with the payment of salaries on the scale payment method to sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses. These unfortunate people are not only compelled to work at the low salary which the Post Office pays, but in addition they have to provide premises out of their remuneration. <Col N="1070" /> They have to provide an assistant if it is necessary.  They have to provide light, they have to provide for the cleaning of the office, they have to provide pens, ink and blotting paper&mdash;in a word they have to provide a post office for the Post Office, and do the work on the miserable scales which are paid by the Post Office.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that these exploited sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses, being the victims of the vicious system by which their remuneration is calculated by the Post Office, in turn find themselves in the position in which they themselves become exploiters. The Post Office at the top exploits the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses by giving them a beggarly wage.  The sub-postmaster finds, because he is very often unlearned or unversed in Post Office work, that he cannot do it himself.  He may have some other outside interest which engages his attention or in any case he may have no special talent to engage in the kind of nimble financial transactions which are essentially associated with the post office business.  In that situation he finds it necessary to employ an assistant so that when the assistant comes in to work for the exploited sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress this further exploitation takes place.  The sub-postmaster says to the assistant: &ldquo;Look here, I have got the best intentions in the world towards you; nothing would please me better than to see you well-paid whilst you are in my employment; the Post Office gives me £1 a week for running this office; I have to provide the premises, the light and for the cleaning of the office, the stationery, etc., you will quite clearly recognise that not only could I not pay you the whole £1 a week which I get from the Post Office, having regard to the other things which I provide in the office, but you will have to work for me for 10/- a week.&rdquo;  If the person concerned is in economic stress she will probably take the employment, but that is the kind of employment that a person gets in a State post office. That person may be fed and accommodated by the sub-postmaster and may have to do odd jobs in his house or in <Col N="1071" /> some other premises which he may have.  The fact, however, remains that, so long as sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses are exploited in that way by the Post Office they in turn will exploit the assistants whom they employ.  Is it any wonder that there has been such a spate of prosecutions in the last two years, especially of unfortunate sub-office assistants who defaulted in their accounts?  Quite startling cases came to notice recently, not in one or two instances but in quite a consideration number of instances in which unfortunate sub-office assistants misappropriated large sums of money. The most striking part of the whole business was the strictures of the judges on the Post Office system of employment which compelled these unfortunate people to work for the pittances they received.  How can you expect to get honest citizens if you pay them 10/- or 15/- a week?  How can you get honest, trustworthy service on such coolie standards?  How can you expect to get the best people, the most honest and trustworthy people if that is the valuation that you put on their trust?  How can you expect them to be people of exalted mind and heart with a nice sense of rectitude if that is the best that the Post Office can do? Is it any wonder that you have defalcations and embezzlements in these offices?  You will continue to have defalcations and embezzlements, and you will have young girls sent to terms of imprisonment for defalcations in sub-post offices so long as you exploit them by the present method of remuneration&mdash;that is so far as these grades are concerned.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that this method of employing sub-postmasters, with its corollary of exploiting the unfortunate sub-office assistants by the underpaid sub-postmasters, is a system that ought to be brought to an end at the earliest possible moment.  A decent standard of remuneration ought to be provided for those who are doing this responsible work.  They are engaged in the transaction of post office business for the community.  The community have the right to expect that the citizens serving them in these sub-post offices are properly paid so <Col N="1072" /> that they can discharge their duties without the besetting fear that they will not know on Monday how they are going to meet their liabilities on Saturday.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat amused by a statement which was made in the Seanad the other day by the Minister when apparently this matter was raised.  I have not had an opportunity of reading the Official Report.  The Minister was doing his best, as he gallantly does on occasions like this, to justify the low payments to sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses.  He tried to excuse himself from the responsibility which he has for the exploitation of these sub-office assistants, and said that the Post Office does everything it possibly can to see that the sub-office assistant is not sweated.  I do not know where the Minister got that notion.  I can tell the Minister&mdash;he can confirm this if he makes inquiries&mdash;that the Post Office does absolutely no such thing. The Post Office machine works with the utmost complacency.  It knows from its own records that sub-office assistants are being paid unscrupulously low wages&mdash;the Post Office knows the remuneration that is being paid to every sub-office assistant in the country, or at any rate it can get the information within 24 hours&mdash;and if it took the slightest human interest in those people or cared in the slightest for the scale of salaries paid to them, it would long ago have taken action in the matter.  The Post Office has got the records and knows the low payments that are made to these sub-office assistants.  Yet it has done absolutely nothing to call the attention of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses to the low wages that are being paid.  The Minister knows perfectly well that the sub-postmaster will say: &ldquo;What do you expect me to do out of what you pay me?&rdquo; If the Minister wants to realise how unconsciously humorous his statement the other day in the Seanad was, he ought to ask the Department to tell him how often, within the past five years, the Post Office has said anything to a sub-postmaster about the rate of wages paid to assistants.  He ought to find out the rate of wages paid.  The Post Office has all the records.  He will see that the Post Office is an accessory <Col N="1073" /> before and after the fact of the exploitation of young post office assistants.  I leave the position of sub-postmasters to whatever sense of social justice and whatever sense of abhorrence of human exploitation it is possible for the Minister to enshroud himself in when considering this motion.</P>
    <P>I pass on to the section of the motion which expresses the opinion that all auxiliary postmen should be put on the established list, so as to ensure for them not only reasonable remuneration, but also decent pensions after long and strenuous service to the community. There is nothing unreasonable in that claim; in fact, it is an eminently reasonable claim.  If one were to approach this problem of the employment of auxiliary postmen with even a modicum of honesty and decency, one would realise that the claim set out in the motion is one which ought to be implemented.</P>
    <P>The Post Office employs about 2,500 auxiliary postmen for not more than 30 hours per week.  There may be isolated cases where they are employed a little longer.  The Post Office employs another 1,000 persons, described as allowance deliverers, for not more than 18 hours per week.  Efforts have been made from time to time by unions representing the staff to get the Post Office to recognise that part-time employment is an evil which ought to be eradicated with the utmost expedition. Whilst I am aware that, under intense pressure, the Post Office has grudgingly and reluctantly avoided part-time duties and created full-time duties in certain cases, the fact remains that there is still a large number of part-time employees in the Post Office. They are paid a low rate of wages because of their part-time employment and their employment very often, because of the hours at which that employment is available, prevents those persons from securing any other employment to supplement the inadequate wages they receive.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested to the Post Office time and again that the problem of part-time labour can ultimately be solved, or at least it can be brought within manageable dimensions inside a relatively short period.  The Minister <Col N="1074" /> for Industry and Commerce has made speeches throughout the country indicating that the Government are wedded to a policy of full employment, that that is the new goal of the Government so far as its social and industrial programme is concerned.  While you get the Minister for Industry and Commerce talking about the desirability of full employment, his colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, endeavours to justify not full employment, but permanent part-time employment for State servants.  That is what is happening in the Post Office to-day.</P>
    <P>The Post Office to-day is the greatest enemy of full-time employment that there is in the country.  Not only does it employ the largest number of part-time employees in any single industry, but it seals its intelligence against any possibility that anybody will ever persuade it to depart from that vicious system.  I know the Post Office service very well.  I know what can be done with the service.  If only somebody will apply his imagination and decent concepts of life to the reorganisation of it, there would not be the slightest difficulty, now the Government have accepted the policy of full employment, in the Post Office accepting an obligation to build up their services on the basis of full-time employment.  It can be done.  It may present certain difficulties at the outset, but these are not insuperable.  Every one of the 2,500 who are under-employed in the Post Office could be employed for full-time if the Post Office would provide additional services for the public.</P>
    <P>At a time when the Post Office is yielding a substantial surplus, and apparently hopes to yield a bigger one, there would be no difficulty in providing sufficient additional work in the form of improved public services which would be capable of providing full-time employment for all who are at present employed part-time.  In addition to that, when vacancies occur in part-time posts the Post Office could amalgamate the vacant post with an existing part-time post and make a full-time post; they could make three full-time posts by the merging of four part-time posts.  In a variety of ways full-time employment can be provided for auxiliary postmen.  By the provision <Col N="1075" /> of additional public services, in towns and cities particularly, it should be possible to eliminate part-time employment completely.</P>
    <P>If once the Post Office can be got to recognise that this problem can be dealt with on the basis of courage and vision, and if it can be got away from the mentality that it must always have part-time employees, that it must have them, especially, in 1946 because it had them in 1906, that would be a step in the right direction.  I have never seen the Post Office attempting to face up to its moral responsibilities.  It is easy to do nothing; there is nothing easier in the world than doing nothing.  So far as part-time employment is concerned, the Post Office, while it has faced up, under pressure, to the abolition of part-time duties in Dublin and certain other cities, it has made no real effort to get down to the abolition of the post of part-time postman in various towns throughout the country by providing full-time employment for him, and in the rural areas I do not think the Department has yet been able to tune its mind down to the need of examining that problem.</P>
    <P>I can prove to the satisfaction of the Post Office that within two months the Minister could abolish part-time posts at every head office in the country without the slightest difficulty in providing additional services for the public in all these towns.  If this discussion does nothing else but fertilise the Minister's mind on the necessity for applying himself to the discharge of his responsibilities towards those whom he employs, it will have been well worth while.</P>
    <P>Another portion of this motion suggests that auxiliary postmen should be granted pensions on retirement.  That is a matter to which, I understand, the Minister promised to give some consideration, when this matter was discussed on the Estimates this year and last year.  At all events, the Minister has written that promise into the official records and I assume he did so with such deliberation that he has not forgotten his promise.  I do not know how long it takes him to consider matters of this kind, but we have been <Col N="1076" /> told this is under consideration for two years&mdash;and, even for the Post Office, that is a bit thick.  It may well be that the Minister intends to seek financial sanction, but if he has not yet made a move in that direction he should apply himself to that task with some agility immediately, so that this problem may be ended, so that the State can look those who served it for upwards of 40 years in the face, without feeling it has treated them in a way which would shame any private employer.</P>
    <P>Many of these men have served the State for 40 years&mdash;and many for more than 40.  During that period, they have given service roughly equivalent to half or threequarters' full-time employment, working every day in the week for the Post Office to the extent of 30 or 32 hours per week.  It may be that the 40 or 45 years started when the man was 20.  Now that they are leaving the service, on coming towards the age of 70, they will not get, as a matter of right, as much as 1d. in pension.  The most they may get is, if they go out in necessitous circumstances in which they would appear to be a liability on the home assistance authority, that the Post Office will graciously consider making them a miserable grant from what is known as the Minister's special fund.  A few hundred pounds is put into the kitty each year and, bear this in mind, if an abnormal number of people apply in that year, the fund is not replenished but what is in it is spread out in still more meagre sums amongst those who retire.  That is the best sense of humanity the Post Office is able to develop to reward those people.</P>
    <P>If the retiring employee happens to have a son working in England or a daughter in domestic service, who think of dad in his old age and send him a few shillings now and again, the Post Office will calculate the amount sent and say: &ldquo;He is getting so much and we do not think the circumstances are such that a grant should be made from the Minister's special fund.&rdquo;  I put it to the Minister that amongst all his acquaintences, in his own constituency or elsewhere, he will scarcely find a single employer who would employ a person for 50 years and would <Col N="1077" /> send him out at 65 or 70 without as much as one penny in pension.  That is what the Minister is doing and, strangest of all, nothwithstanding the high-sounding sentiments in the Constitution, he is purporting to do all this in the name of the Constitution and in the name of the community.  I hope he will avail of this discussion to tell us by what process of social thought or by what sense of human reaction and understanding he can justify employing these people for 40 years and then sending them out, when unable to earn any further income, without one halfpenny in compensation. How can he justify subjecting them to this odious means test, in order to grant them a small lump sum of £20 or £30 from this special fund?</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister takes his responsibility towards his employees very seriously or deeply, or whether he has got a cavalier outlook on the whole matter and looks upon his position as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in a very perfunctory way. While that outlook is a very pleasant one and may not worry him too much, I would say to him that there are serious social conditions involved in this whole motion.  Right down behind it is an effort to put on him some moral responsibility for the conditions he is enforcing on his employees.  The Minister has been found guilty, before the bar of free public opinion in this country, of exploiting sub-postmasters and postmistresses; every newspaper that is free to criticise the Minister has complained of his attitude regarding the remuneration of those officials; and I venture to say that, if we could get a Gallup Poll on the question, the Minister would be found guilty and sentenced to political extermination for life.</P>
    <P>In regard to part-time employment in the Post Office, many newspapers, organisations of public opinion and local authorities have expressed the opinion that these employees are underpaid, that it is nothing short of a scandal to deny them a pension.  All that censure has left the Minister cold and indifferent to the sufferings of these people, but I think he can no <Col N="1078" /> longer fail to recognise that he has a moral responsibility in this matter. Newspapers have endeavoured to bring home to him a sense of realisation of what he owes to those whom he employs.  Staff organisations have endeavoured to do the same.  This House, during discussions on his Estimates, has endeavoured to bring him up against the cold facts, but so far he has adopted a Pharaoh-like attitude to all these demands for decent treatment. He should shake himself out of the Micawber-like attitude into which, either consciously or unconsciously, he has dropped; he should realise that he, in the last resort, is the employer of those with whom this motion deals, that he has a moral responsibility before his own conscience, before the Constitution and before every decent thought, to ensure that these people are treated properly.  He can best discharge that responsibility by saying that, if he will not accept the terms of the motion, he will at least accept the spirit of the motion, that he will go to the Government and say: &ldquo;It is not fair that I should be put in the position of exploiting these people&rdquo;&mdash;if his sentiments lack any direction other than exploitation.  He should ask the Government to provide the necessary funds to pay these people decent salaries and give them decent pensions, so that there may not be permanent economic ghosts appearing before the Minister for his economic misdeeds.  He has an opportunity now to accept the spirit behind this motion.  I hope he will do so and be able to tell the House &mdash;now that the Government is making allocations of money for this, that and the other&mdash;that he is not always the person who arrives too late to get anything. He ought to accept the principle of this motion, take it to the Government and tell them the views which I feel sure will be expressed here during this debate; and, if he does that, I cannot imagine the Government being so completely devoid of its sense of responsibility to the country that it will turn a deaf ear to his reasonable demands.</P>

      <P>Looking at this motion on the Order Paper, I could not believe my eyes when I saw the names of <Col N="1079" /> Deputy Halliden and Deputy Blowick attached to it.  I could more readily understand if this motion had been tabled by the last speaker or some of his colleagues.  What has been puzzling me is whether there has been a complete change in Clann na Talmhan outlook since the time that Party put this motion on the Order Paper.  I have been listening to the Leader of that Party and his colleagues, in this House and outside, asserting that everybody in the country was too well paid, that the unfortunate farmer was being blistered to pay pensions and increases of wages to everybody and that the community as a whole could not afford that.  Whether this motion represents a complete change of heart on the part of Deputies Halliden and Blowick or whether they have changed their views completely on the issue of what the country can afford to pay, it would be interesting to learn.  I have no doubt that, when we come to Budget time, we shall hear from those two Deputies bitter complaints about the amount of taxation the community is asked to bear.  I have no doubt that we shall be told that the community is being blistered by the squandermania of the Government.  I have no doubt that it will be conveniently forgotten by those Deputies that, in this motion, they sought to blister the community, including the farming portion of it, so as to pay a greater amount of money to these officials.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand, these Deputies are prepared to accept the responsibility of asking the Government and the community to provide the additional money which the passing of this motion would entail.  I want to make clear that, if those Deputies are now prepared to shoulder the responsibility for asking the farming community to meet the additional cost which this motion would entail, they should be prepared when the Budget comes along equally to accept responsibility for such additional expenditure in respect of this motion and other similar motions.  With the first part of this motion, I may say that&mdash;having <Col N="1080" /> said so much on the other aspect of the matter&mdash;I agree.  A good case can be made for the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses.  I think that their scales of pay are not in accord with the amount of work they have to do or with their responsibilities.  Day after day, we come across some of these people in the courts on charges of embezzlement.  When people are charged with the responsibility of looking after large amounts of money, if they have small salaries, they are in a state of continuous temptation.  The Minister would be well advised to review the scales of salary of these people.</P>
      <P>The position of sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress is not the same as it was 20 years ago or even 12 years ago. They have additional responsibilities and they have much more work to do than they had to do then.  As our social legislation has been expanding, more work has devolved on the sub-postmaster and sub-postmistress.  They have a great deal to do, for instance, in connection with the filling of forms for widows' and orphans' pensions. Various new duties have devolved on them during the past few years as a result of our social legislation.  It is, therefore, high time that the whole position should be reviewed.  I suggest to the Minister that, in view of the small salaries some of these people receive, it is not fair to ask them to account for the large sums of money which pass through their hands.  If they are in straitened financial circumstances, the Minister leaves them in a position of permanent temptation. It is not purely by chance we have so many of those people coming before our criminal courts.  It cannot be that a high percentage of persons appointed to those positions are prone to embezzlement.  It must be that so much temptation is placed in their way, and that their scales of salary being so low, they are living in a state of continuous temptation.  The Minister should seriously consider reviewing the position so far as these people are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion deals with two completely different questions.  With the first part of the motion, which is concerned <Col N="1081" /> with sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses, I am in agreement. With the latter portion of the motion, dealing with auxiliary postmen in the country, a completely different issue is raised.  I do not know how far the people of the country would be prepared to go on this question.  A number of rural auxiliary postmen work only an hour or so in the day.  It is quite true that their remuneration is small but, in the main, these men are farmers or have some other work. Deputies have been speaking as if rural auxiliary postmen were whole-time officials.  They know quite well that that is not so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither are they all farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>They may not be all farmers.  I am speaking of my own part of the country which, I think, is not greatly different from the rest of the country.  In the main, these men are farmers or have other employment. It might as well be suggested that men working for the county council two months of the year should be made permanent.  The same argument could be used in that case as for the auxiliary type of postman which I have in mind. Perhaps, it would be better to amalgamate a number of those posts as, I think, Deputy Norton suggested, and provide full-time employment for a particular individual.  The auxiliary postman who, I think, is referred to in this motion lives in a village from which there may be only a three-day delivery in the week.  The delivery occupies only one and a half or two hours and the amount the postman receives from the authorities goes to supplement his ordinary income.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In our part of the <Col N="1082" /> country, we call him an auxiliary postman. I do not dispute Deputy Norton's better knowledge of postmen. He is the type I have in mind.  Some things are applicable to employment as auxiliary postmen which are not applicable to other types of employment. The auxiliary postman is not subject to an age limit such as you have in other types of employment.  It suits the men I have in mind to earn a few shillings for short-time employment which does not interfere so much with their ordinary avocations.  They are able to carry on their ordinary work and at the same time attend to this work which provides them with some cash income.</P>
      <P>The second part of the motion raises a completely different issue, an issue upon which I certainly should like some more information before being convinced that a case can be established for these men.  If we want to provide full-time employment for these men, I do not see how that can be done except by amalgamating some of the routes on which men are already employed.  I think no case can be made for putting them on a permanent basis and, in any event, permanent employment at this work would not be suitable for the type of men I have in mind.  I may be wrong in my conception of an auxiliary postman, but the present system suits the people I have in mind much better than the system which Deputy Norton advocates.  Many of these men are better off in doing part-time work, which enables them to carry on their ordinary avocations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses, I think it high time that something should be done to improve their conditions.  This is a question which should have been dealt with some considerable time ago, and the Minister by now should have ample proof that their scales of salary are not sufficient.  He should have ample proof in the views expressed in this House and outside it, even by some members of the judiciary on occasions when charges were brought against some of these people in the criminal courts. Their work has been increased enormously by the new social legislation, and the whole position in their regard <Col N="1083" /> should be reviewed.  I do not subscribe at all to the second part of the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there can be anyone who has any knowledge of the work involved in the postal services, the conditions of employment and the wages and salaries of those who man such services, who would for a moment hesitate in saying, remembering the importance of the services they operate, that they are very poorly paid.  I have the utmost sympathy with the proposal to increase the salaries of these officials.  Their work is of the highest importance.  It calls for the highest standard of conduct and integrity both on the part of sub-postmasters and postmen, whether auxiliary or permanent.  We all know of the onerous nature of their work. The postmen, particularly, have to be out under all weather conditions in all seasons of the year.  They have to attend punctually at the offices and carry out deliveries in accordance with strict regulations and within a certain time limit.  I do think that servants of that type are entitled to a better reward than they are receiving at present.  At the same time, I cannot at all agree with the suggestion made by Deputy Norton that posts should be amalgamated with a view to allowing more permanent or continuous employment.  To my mind, the fundamental question is what service we can give the community and we have to consider the interests, not merely of those engaged in the service, but the interests of the community as a whole from the viewpoint of the advantages they derive from an up to date postal service.  If we are going to amalgamate, as Deputy Norton suggests, two or three areas, displacing two or three part-time postmen, consolidating the areas which they served under one permanent postman, then it would not be humanly possible to provide the whole of the community with an early delivery of letters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that I did not suggest that amalgamation should take place in a form that would involve the displacement of any individual? What I did suggest was that <Col N="1084" /> in an area where there are, say, three part-time postmen, serving districts abutting on one another, when one of these districts becomes vacant, that district should be amalgamated with the other districts to provide increased work for the other two postmen and to enable the districts to be served from the same office just as expeditiously as they are at present being served by three postmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see how the proposal, which Deputy Norton now explains more clearly, would provide the public with a service as efficient as they are now getting.  If the districts are to be amalgamated, so that areas which were formerly served by three men will now have to be served by two men, surely the deliveries will not be as regular or as early.  The hours of delivery are regulated by the time the mail arrives, usually in the morning, and one man cannot give equal service as regards delivery as two men. There is bound to be a long delay in the delivery of letters in some part of the area to be covered.  Again I say that the fundamental purpose of the Post Office is to render service to the community, rural and urban, and I do not believe that that can be efficiently done under the proposal outlined by Deputy Norton.  I would regard it as a retrograde step to give effect to that proposal and I do not consider that it would be just or equitable to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards our attitude to postmen in general, one thing I could never understand is why there should be two grades of postmen&mdash;one man classed as an auxiliary postman and another as a permanent or staff-man.  Owing to some technical distinction in the service, the man who is able to reach staff rank receives&mdash;I am speaking approximately but I do not think I am exaggerating too much&mdash;twice the salary of the auxiliary postman who does precisely the same work.  There is no greater responsibility on the staff-man. He does exactly the same work and at the end of a period of years he is entitled to a pension.  If that man is entitled to a salary ranging from £3 to £5 per week and to a pension after a certain number of years service, then in justice the other man who gives <Col N="1085" /> equal service, is entitled to the same conditions.  I am sorry to have to suggest that the only justification I can see for this wretched treatment of postal servants is that the State finds that there are so many applicants, whenever a vacancy occurs, from amongst those who are starved for the least form of alternative employment, that it can pick and choose and dictate terms that it dare not offer, if that section of the service were organised as these workers would be organised if they were employed in an industrial concern.  I suggest to the Minister that <Col N="1086" /> it is not fair, just, human or Christian to take advantage of the economic conditions that prevail in the country and to utilise these conditions for the purpose of economising in his service, thereby depressing below a reasonable standard the reward that is due for a service of that kind.  He is depressing it below a standard which is not just I move the adjournment of the debate</P>
