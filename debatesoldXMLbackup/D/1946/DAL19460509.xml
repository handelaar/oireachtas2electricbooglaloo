      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he will inform Dáil Eireann if the resolution of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate of the United States of America, declaring all air agreements made on behalf of the United States of America null and void unless and until incorporated in treaties approved by the Senate, affects the air agreement made with Ireland at the Chicago Conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question involves a point of American Constitutional law upon which there appears to be some difference of opinion in the United States.</P>
      <P>I do not think that any authoritative judicial decision has been pronounced. It would not be proper for me to express an opinion, particularly as there are other agreements concerned as well as our own.  We have received no communication in the matter from the American Government, and so far as we are concerned the agreement stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the intention of the Minister for External Affairs to remain in the position of Mahomet's coffin, unless and until he hears something, or are we entitled to know where we stand?  Have we an agreement or have we not?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but that is not very much good to us, standing by an agreement on our side if the other fellow is not going to stand by the agreement on his side.  It is a question of &ldquo;you puts your money in and you takes your choice.&rdquo;  Surely there is no discourtesy or incivility in asking the Government of the United States, have they an agreement with us or have they not?  The only person who takes exception to that is the Taoiseach when the Commonwealth of Nations asks him is he in the Commonwealth or not. Have we an agreement or have we not? Surely our own Minister for External Affairs ought to be able to tell us?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the Deputy and, in telling the Deputy, I am telling the House, that there is involved a question of American Constitutional law upon which there appears to be a difference of opinion in the United States; that no authoritative legal decision has been pronounced; that we have received no communication from the American Government and, therefore, as far as we are concerned, the agreement stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that flour millers in this country will only quote carriage paid prices for flour and milling offals, thus making it impossible for merchants to use their own lorries to carry their own flour and meal from mills to their own premises; and whether he will take steps to ensure that, in future, an allowance corresponding to the freight charges will be made in all cases where delivery is taken at the mill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan) (for Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that it is not correct that flour millers will only quote carriage paid prices for flour.  The relevant Order fixes a maximum f.o.r. price which is all the purchaser need pay if he takes delivery himself at the mill.</P>
      <P>The millers' price of offals is uniform for the whole country and includes an average charge for freights.  I do not consider it desirable that this arrangement, which facilitates the fair distribution of offals, should be changed by eliminating the average freight charges where delivery is taken at the mill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of any merchant being refused an allowance in respect of freight, where he takes the delivery of the flour at the mill, if he applies to the Minister, will the Minister take steps to ensure that the appropriate allowance is made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the answer covers that point.  The relevant Order fixes a maximum f.o.r. price which is all the purchaser need pay if he takes delivery at the mill.  It would seem to me that that Order covers the particular point the Deputy raises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister take appropriate steps to ensure that effect is given to that Order in the event of a merchant complaining that he has been denied the benefit of it, or must the merchant report the matter to the Gárda, swear an information, and have proceedings instituted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Minister, in making the Order, gave himself all the powers necessary to take the action Deputy Dillon suggests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he will provide facilities whereby citizens, who are desirous of assisting in the provision of food supplies for countries in urgent need, would be enabled to surrender voluntarily their individual ration of butter (or other rationed foods) with the object of having such surrendered food rations exported in bulk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the difficulties of organisation which would arise, I consider that it would not be practicable to arrange for the voluntary surrender by private persons of their individual rations with a view to their collection and exportation in bulk for relief purposes.</P>
      <P>In this connection, I would point out that, under the Government's relief schemes for last year and for the current year, the quantities of rationed foodstuffs provided for the relief of distress in Europe have been made available either by general reductions in the domestic rations for all persons or by sacrificing increases which would otherwise have been possible.</P>

      <P>As indicated in the reply to a similar question on 30th January last, it was not found possible to proceed with the consideration of the proposed Superannuation Bill owing to heavy pressure of legislative work in relation to the Local Government and Public Health measures at present before the House.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the age limits prescribed for the entry of officers into the Civil Service, also the prescribed <Col N="2508" /> retiring ages for all such officers; whether there are any officers still serving who have passed the prescribed retiring age for their grade; if so, the number of such officers; and if he will, henceforth, insist on the retirement of all officers immediately they reach the prescribed retiring age, so as to provide opportunities for younger civil servants to earn promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the question refers to officers of established grades.  The age limits for entry to the general service basic grades are announced publicly early in each year by the Civil Service Commissioners and are as follows: Junior administrative officer, 21 to 26 years; junior executive officer, 18 to 20 years; clerical officer and writing assistant, 16½ to 18½ years; shorthand-typist and typist, 18 to 25 years.</P>
      <P>The age limits for entry to the professional and technical classes are determined by the requirements of the post to be filled and the field of recruitment. The normal retiring age for established civil servants is 65 years of age but officers may be required to retire at any time after the age of 60.  There are 55 officers at present serving who have passed the normal retiring age; 23 of these belong to the various general service grades.  In regard to the final portion of the question, officers were retained during the emergency to a greater extent than would normally have been the case owing to the urgent need for trained staff for new and expanding services.  This necessity has gradually become less acute and at the end of 1945 steps were taken to restore the usual practice of requiring retirement at the age of 65.  In the application of this rule there always have been some exceptions because of special circumstances related to the public interest and/or hardship.  There does not appear to be any adequate reason for departing from a practice which has worked satisfactorily in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that such a large number of civil servants as the Minister has outlined are employed in the Service, who are over the retiring age, would he not consider it a wise step, seeing that we have reached the closing stage of the <Col N="2509" /> emergency, to request these gentlemen to retire, in order to make way for young married civil servants who would fill their places and give as good if not greater satisfaction?  I think younger civil servants would give better service than older officials who are beyond their work.  Will the Minister request these officials to resign?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

Owing to the number of prisoners of the class referred to sentenced to long terms of imprisonment and the difficulties in providing for their safe custody, it was decided that, in general, they should be sent to detention barracks under military control.  In a certain number of cases, however, such as murder, attempted murder, kidnapping with great violence and threats of murder, armed robbery, or treachery by State servants, it was decided that the convicted prisoners should serve their sentences under the same conditions as applied to prisoners sentenced by the ordinary criminal courts for similar serious offences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The outstanding fact which strikes me with regard to the Minister's Budget statement yesterday is that, in the first place, he anticipates taking from the people this year £2,995,000 more in taxation than he took last year, and, in the second place, that he gave no indication whatever of what was being done as a result of this enormous expenditure to increase the real productive power of the people. A year after the end of the war, we find the Government collecting £2,995,000 more in taxation from the people's pockets than they collected in the last year of the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to realise how appalling that burden is we have to look at some figures of the taxes raised during the war.  In the year before the war, the customs duties taken totalled £10,091,000; last year, they totalled £12,900,000; and this year, they are to total £15,240,000.  The Government, standing at the ports where a small amount of imports has been dribbling in over the war years, took more in customs duties at the ports every year since the war began, and now, when the war is over, they propose to take £15,240,000 in taxes out of the people. In excise duty, in the year before the war, the sum of £6,110,000 was taken; last year, a sum of £9,810,000 was <Col N="2515" /> taken; and this year, it is to be £9,965,000.  So much for customs and excise.</P>
    <P>Before the war, the amount collected from income tax was £5,803,000; last year, it was £13,100,000; and this year it is to be £13,070,000.  Corporation Profits tax before the war provided £591,000; last year, the amount collected was £4,475,000; and this year, it is to be £4,660,000.  The bulk sum raised in taxation in the year before the war was £25,987,000; last year it was £43,640,000; and this year it will be £46,635,000, or £2,995,000 more than last year&mdash;and that for the year after the war is over.  With all that enormous taxation and the spending of it in the Government's hands&mdash;they propose to save nothing out of it&mdash;we have a Budget statement that, so far as the economic position of the country and the future prospects of its economic betterment are concerned, gives no suggestion as to how the real people and the only people that can effect a betterment of that kind are to be sustained in any way, either the agricultural producers or the manufacturers. The Minister indicated that he realises that it is only out of an increase in the national income that this country can carry on or its people be sustained. That can only be brought about by the development of our present industries, agricultural or manufacturing, or the establishment of new ones.  That is our main economic problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister also realises and insists that there is a more urgent social problem to be faced, the sustenance and the employment of our people who are without employment.  The Minister does not indicate any effective ways of giving employment to those who are unemployed. Whether he has effective ways for that or not, or whether he proposes by his new development fund or by some of the expenditure there is to be met from taxation to maintain these adequately or suitably, we cannot at this stage of our economic history and one year after the war is over feel that there is any problem as urgent both for our present well being and our future well being as to see that those who have their hands on the productive resources of the country are given <Col N="2516" /> an opportunity and encouragement to go ahead with their work and to increase the productive capacity of the country both in agriculture and in industry.</P>
    <P>The recent White Paper on national income and expenditure, together with the figures that the Minister gave yesterday, has indicated that our gross agricultural production to-day is no more than it was in 1938.  There is no indication from anything the Government are doing or saying that they foresee any increase in agricultural production in the near future.  We cannot take it that the agricultural production figure of 1938 is a suitable one at which to remain or even to progress from in a leisurely way, because in 1938 there were 26,000 fewer men employed in agriculture than before the Fianna Fáil Party came into office and 43,000 fewer than in 1934.  Therefore, when our people are having to bear the cost of government to the extent that this Budget presents to us, standing on the one leg of our agricultural production in 1938 we must feel that there is a very hopeless prospect for the country's future.  The Minister indicated yesterday that industrial production last year was 86 per cent. of our industrial production in 1938.  That may offer us a more hopeful prospect, and it is well that on the industrial side we should be offered a more hopeful prospect, because so far as increasing production must support an increasing number of workers we will probably have to look more to manufacturing industry to sustain an increasing number of workers than to agriculture.  It is there that I find the Budget statement showing to the greatest extent a complete lack of imagination.</P>
    <P>Industrialists who have kept industrial production going during the war have done so by almost superhuman exertions and by astonishing ingenuity and persistence and very great courage.  The system of taxation of industry adopted during the war was such as to undermine men's courage and to make them feel that it could not be worth while taking chances, because taxation was so imposed that it put as big a burden on the extension of an industry as it did upon the <Col N="2517" /> excess profits accuring in an adventitious way as a result of war circumstances. While the Minister takes a shilling off the income-tax and says that the excess profits tax is to be abandoned after the 1st January next, he does not offer the industrialists the kind of hope or spur that they are entitled to get.  The Minister knows that if we are to have industrial expansion here we must have an additional amount of capital put into industry. He must know that the most effective and satisfactory way of developing an industry is that such profits as the industry can make and can profitably use in the expansion of business should be put back into the business.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as I say, raised a very considerable amount from the excess profits tax, whether on profits made adventitiously or by expansion of industry, and I think that it would have been only right that the Minister should have indicated that the taxation of profits in industry would be so changed that there would be a reduction of taxation on those profits that went back into the business.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also indicated that he proposes to allow a relief from income-tax in respect of money spent for research in industry, even where that research involves the expenditure of a certain amount of money on capital works.  The industrialists, who are being told to-day that they are going to be relieved of income-tax on money which they spend on research for the purpose of improving their industry ought, in my opinion, to be told that when, as a result of their research, they see ways of extending their business and they put into the extension of their business the capital profits they have made, that they will get a certain relief of income-tax in respect of the use of these profit for the extension of their business.  But the Minister has simply taken a shilling off the income-tax.  That may help. He is stopping excess profits tax this year but he is giving no encouragement of any kind, through any statement of his, to industrialists to speed ahead with extending their industries now.  The man who is going to put profits made last year and the year before&mdash;whatever he has left out of <Col N="2518" /> them after meeting taxation&mdash;into industry will automatically have these profits taxed.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that there is urgent need to inspire those, who are bearing the burden of organising and managing industry and who are prepared to take the risks involved in such industry, if industry is going to expand here; and the Minister ought, before the discussion on the Budget this year concludes, review the whole matter to see whether he cannot make a more hopeful statement to those who are going to use their profits for the purpose of expanding industry.  We cannot have increased employment in this country unless those who organise industry and who establish industry in this country are, in the first place, fully competent to do that and, in the second place, are encouraged by circumstances, created through Government policy, to go ahead and do it. There is no other way by which we may effectively maintain our people except by means of our agricultural and productive industries.  The amount of industry or the amount of employment that the Government itself can carry out is of a very limited nature; and it is not going to be as productive of employment, nor is it going to have the same organic capacity to increase itself, as industry managed by the entrepreneur.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I asked what steps the Taoiseach, on the one hand, or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on the other, were taking to ensure that we will stand in line in connection with the conferences and the discussions that are going on at the present moment throughout the world amongst other countries for the purpose of improving our trade position and, as a natural corollary, our employment position.  The answer I got yesterday would suggest there is complete inertia of mind on the part of the Government in these matters.  We had to gather our chairs from all over this city&mdash;from the Dáil here and from Civil Service offices&mdash;in order to accommodate the members of all the nations of the world who took part in the conference on air development some months ago here.  That was probably very important. But in every country in the <Col N="2519" /> world to-day, not only the politicians and the members of Governments, but representatives of agriculture, commerce and industry are being brought together to consider with the utmost intensity of purpose how in the interests of their own country, and in the mutual interests of other countries, they can plan, organise and work to increase employment for their people and to raise the standard of living of their people.</P>
    <P>We have had a number of inquiries initiated by the Government and initiated by other people during the last few years directed to considering what are those things which vitally affect our social position and our economic condition here.  We have had the report of the committee of inquiry into post-war agricultural policy.  We have had the report of the commission of inquiry into vocational organisation. We have had the personal report of the late chairman of the National Health Insurance Commission.  All these things point to fundamental facts in our economy here.  So far as we can judge, they have been completely ignored.  If we are going to have any kind of decent social order here the wages that are paid to our workers must be a wage capable of maintaining them in reasonably comfortable home conditions.  The Minister, in reply to Deputy Norton the other day, told him that the amount withheld from the body of civil servants as a whole as a result of the Stabilisation of Bonus Order during the emergency was £5,900,000.  The Minister for Finance, when he was speaking on the Budget last year, gave the figures as to the cost of the Civil Service.  He stated that in 1943 the cost of the Civil Service was £6,100,000. We find ourselves in the position, therefore, that our civil servants have had one year's pay deducted from them in the six years of war.  There was £5,900,000 stopped from them through withholding from them the cost-of-living bonus.  There might be some kind of case for stabilising wages throughout the country; but does anyone realise that civil servants&mdash;a considerable proportion of whom are in <Col N="2520" /> receipt of very moderate scales of income&mdash;have had a complete year's wages deducted from them; and the greater incidence of that has fallen on the old fabric of the Civil Service which was there long before the temporary staff, recruited for the emergency, was brought in.  Throughout the country we have had the Minister for Local Government strenuously resisting the unanimous opinion of local bodies as to what should be the wages of the lower-paid permanent workers working under local authorities.  A long-drawn out fight has taken place between the Department of Local Government and county councils all over the country with regard to the rate of wages to be paid to road workers.  They are a group of people that will eternally be wanted so long as we want roads.  They will be eternally the employees of public bodies. Their rates of wages are such that not one of them could maintain a decent home or feel that they were part of a progressive, happy or stable society of any kind.</P>
    <P>The committee inquiring into postwar agriculture emphasises the position in which we now are and the position in which we will find ourselves unless there is increased production in agriculture and a stable trade policy between ourselves and Great Britain, such as would enable us to pay the agricultural workers in a more satisfactory manner.  All those things hinge together&mdash;increased agricultural production, a proper rate of wages for our people throughout the country, increased industrial production.  All these things have been co-related in such a clear and concise way that they can neither be denied nor argued against.  In the vocational organization report it was put clearly before us that there are people in this country who follow a variety of vocations requiring great skill and great tradition; and that the country has no service in building up its economy or in strengthening its economy except the service of those men who grow up in particular avocations and who, through co-operation with one another, perfect themselves and strengthen their own group, both by their qualifications and by their <Col N="2521" /> work in order to make a contribution to the building up of society here.  Just as we have a complete squeezing down on wages by the Government, which prevents a reasonable social standard being adopted by the workers of the country, in the same way we have a complete closing down of the mind of the Government on those organisations, associations and avocations that can, and that only can, guide the Government in the carrying on of its economic business.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce yesterday what representations had been made to various industries and to various organisations, or what inquiries had been made of them so that this Government could have expert information and first-hand knowledge that would enable it to take part in international discussions so that every interest in this country would be safeguarded.  In May, 1946, the only reply of the Minister for Industry and Commerce was that they would be consulted in the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Finance, during these discussions, to tell us what the Government is doing to see that the farmers get a reasonable opportunity of extending their production. I would ask him whether he accepts the recommendations of the Majority and the Minority Reports that have been presented to the Minister for Agriculture by the Committee of Inquiry on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy.  He will find there that they argue very strongly that if the export price that we get for agricultural produce is less than the price that is paid for domestic agricultural produce in Great Britain then we will be in a position that we will have to export our agricultural labourers to Great Britain instead of our agricultural products.  He will see there that they say that if we make no particular effort to develop export capacity now, the United Kingdom market will become adjusted to doing without our contribution.  He will see that the committee is of opinion that progressive increase in output per person occupied in agriculture is a fundamental and inescapable condition of any considerable increase in our industrial <Col N="2522" /> development; that the committee is of opinion that since appreciable extension in our agriculture can be effected only through increasing export, output must be raised, the quality of products improved and standardised and the costs of production, purchasing and marketing reduced and to this end, of course, comprehensive educational progress is an imperative necessity.  He will see that a Minority Report says that increased economic stability will in post-emergency years continue to depend to a large degree on the export of agricultural commodities and the production of these must therefore be developed to the limit of the availability of profitable markets. But, throughout the whole report, he will see that a fair arrangement with regard to the price of our agricultural exports is necessary in order to keep our population here, that increased agricultural exports are necessary in order to maintain our agricultural population here and to increase our industry and that a better general education policy, and better education in certain aspects of agricultural training are necessary.</P>
    <P>With this appalling bill in front of us, higher than last year, we get no information at all as to what is being done in order that our agriculture may extend itself.  Our industrialists, as I say, are given no encouragement that they will be relieved in any intelligent way of taxation in order to induce them to improve and to extend their industries.  The Minister hopes to become self-sufficient in quite a number of things, including fuel.  On the 11th April last, Fuel Importers Limited addressed a communication to a firm using 60 tons a week of industrial turf, which they were getting at 25/- a ton, indicating to them that that was to be increased to 30/- a ton.  That increased the weekly expenditure on fuel to that firm by £15.  But, on the 16th April, five days afterwards, they got another letter stating that the price of industrial turf would be increased to 40/- a ton.  So that, within five days, one industrial firm here had the price of its industrial turf increased by £2,340 a year.  Private consumers of turf are being given a certain concession with regard to the <Col N="2523" /> price of turf.  Are we to understand that the concession that is being given to private users is not, in fact, going to be met by the Government at all but that it is going to be squeezed out of industry or, can the Minister give any adequate reason as to why a firm, within a period of five days, should have its expenditure on fuel raised by £15 a week and then by £30 a week, a total of £45 a week or of £2,340 a year?</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to think that the Minister and the Government are bringing any kind of vigorous or even intelligent mind to bear on the general condition of the country.  The Minister has shown that he is adopting a more intelligent line with regard to interest rates than the Government were prepared to adopt in the past.  We have argued from this side, ever since the opportunity was provided by discussions on the Central Bank, that the Government were paying unnecessarily high prices for money.  The Minister has indicated a change of mind and we welcome that.  The Minister gave figures showing what it would cost per week to repay £100 borrowed at 35 years or at a period of 50 years, and he rather suggested that for certain purposes the Minister might be prepared to borrow at 2½ per cent. at 50 years' repayment instead of at 35 years.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, now that the Government is adopting a new policy with regard to interest rates, to give us an opportunity at some stage of the finance discussions here to have a freer and franker discussion of interest rates than we have been able to have in the past.  The fact that the Government was resisting so strongly the arguments put from this side of the House in regard to interest rates in the last two or three years, prevented reasonable discussion.  I would put this to the Minister, if he is thinking of borrowing for a period of, say, 50 years: He told us yesterday that it would take 1/4 a week to repay £100 borrowed at 2½ per cent. for a period of 50 years. It would take 1/7 a week to repay it if the period of borrowing was 35 years. If the period is 50 years, by the time the loan is completely paid off, the Minister <Col N="2524" /> will have to repay a total of £171 for the £100 borrowed, whereas if the period was for 35 years, the total repayment would be only £151.  That means that by extending the borrowing period from 35 to 50 years the Minister is unnecessarily putting a payment of £20 on the borrower.</P>
    <P>Now is the time to discuss these things and to get a clear idea about them, because, when we are having a change in policy with regard to interest rates and borrowing, let us have the last word of common sense and let us have the fullest possible understanding about it, so that we will not at any time in the future get back into the condition that we were in this House in the past, when no one would be allowed to discuss interest rates with any reason or common sense or a clear looking at the facts.  Again, I say, it is a crushing burden that the country is bearing and it will find it very difficult to support and understand it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is giving £1,000,000 to the farming community in respect of relief of rates.  The Minister's Party originally promised to wipe out all rates.  Between their coming into office and the beginning of the war, they added £1,000,000 to the county council rates.  Since the war began they have added another £1,000,000.  One of these millions is going to disappear but, in disappearing, it will be collected in a way which, perhaps, in more than any other way will increase the cost of living. We are going to collect in customs duties this year £2,307,000 more than we collected last year.  It will be of interest to see how the increased taxes are going to be collected this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister will take £2,307,000 more in customs duties.  £155,000 more in excise duties, £94,000 more in estate duties, £60,000 in stamp duties, £185,000 in corporation profits tax and £224,000 in motor vehicle duties, with the income tax payer paying £30,000 less than he paid last year.  I submit that in collecting the £2,307,000 more in customs duties this year, the Minister is doing something which, more than anything else, will persist in maintaining the cost of living here, so that as regards those things that we expect the Minister to do, that is, to <Col N="2525" /> reduce the cost of living, to increase production, and take away hardship from the ordinary workers of the country, the Minister is doing nothing in this Budget, although the war is more than a year over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing that strikes one about this Budget is that there is relief given to a good many sections of the people, but one particular section is left out, and that is the old age pensioners.  Some time ago there was a motion in the House, tabled by the members of the Labour Party.  It got good support and I believe it was sincerely welcomed by most Deputies on the Government Benches.  While we have 1/- in the £ taken off the income tax, and while it may be very necessary for a certain section of the smaller taxable wage earners, I do not see that there was any need to cut down the income tax in the case of people with larger salaries.  In many cases, not in all cases, old age pensioners are definitely living on a very low diet.  Instances have been brought to my notice where they are definitely hungry and, but for the charity of their neighbours, their plight would have been anything but decent.  Time and again that question has been raised here.  It is very strange that the oldest section of the community, those who have given the best part of their lives to the State, have not got some form of relief in this Budget, although it has been possible to afford relief in other cases.</P>
      <P>In the course of the Minister's speech he referred to the relief in income tax and surtax and he used the words &ldquo;This relief will cost £1,200,000 this year and £1,600,000 next year.&rdquo;  It is not relief.  Take the taxable wage earner who has a wife and family and who can badly afford any income tax. It is not relief to him.  I am sure some of the wealthier people do not need it; those who can afford the 7/6 income tax do not want that relief.  It is not taking from them what the Government have power to take from them if they wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been 1d. in the lb. of a reduction in the price of sugar.  I would like to hear the Minister explaining how it is possible to reduce <Col N="2526" /> the price of sugar by 1d. at this stage, why it was not done earlier, or why it was that sugar was not sold at a cheaper rate for the last few years. The beet growers did not get the increased price which was demanded again and again so as to encourage the growing of beet and the production of more sugar.  We are still on a sugar ration.  We have four factories capable of producing sugar, not alone for our own requirements, but for export as well.  The reason they are not in full production is that the farmers are not satisfied that the price they are getting is an economic price.  The raw material should be kept at full pressure at all costs.  We must have the food.  I remember speaking to the Minister for Agriculture when he was on a visit to Mayo some years ago.  I put that point to him, that it was better to have the sugar, plenty of it, even though it might be a halfpenny or a penny in the lb. dearer.</P>
    <P>Turf is down by 10/- a ton.  That is a reduction that should have come long ago.  I could never understand why turf should cost 64/- a ton, plus a subsidy, here in the City of Dublin. Turf privately produced in the West of Ireland was sold at 15/- a ton.  I could never understand why it is that turf leaving the bogs in Mayo and Galway and other places at 15/- or £1 a ton, should cost the consumer in the city here, and consumers elsewhere, £3 4s. a ton, with a subsidy which the Minister for Industry and Commerce told us in the Dáil brought the final price to 73/9 a ton.  Not alone is there room for a 10/- reduction, but there is room for a greater reduction in the price of turf.  We had an ample opportunity forced upon us to develop our turf resources and to get people turf-minded. I am afraid we have thrown that chance away, owing to bad handling of the situation and the excessively high prices charged for turf.</P>
    <P>I have always been interested in drainage and afforestation.  They are big national works and it would, undoubtedly, be expensive to carry them out.  There is a Drainage Bill lying somewhere, which gives the Government powers to spend £7,000,000.  Seeing that drainage comes under the <Col N="2527" /> management of the Minister's Department I ask him to have the matter tackled, now that the emergency is over and things are returning to normal. I am told that we may have to wait for machinery, but a vast amount of drainage could be done successfully in the upper regions of some rivers with ordinary picks and shovels.</P>
    <P>Work of that kind must be done sooner or later.  The argument may be put up that until rivers down stream are cleaned such a task could not be undertaken.  Drainage of upper catchment areas could be dealt with straightway. The drainage question affects Mayo and other counties west of the Shannon that are not in Connaught. Some provision might be made for dealing with these areas.  I hope we will not have to wait another year before the scheme is put in hand.  Some of the best land is lying useless because work that was carried out by the Congested Districts Board and Land Commission in years gone by has silted, following the rearrangement of estates. The Drainage Bill which was before the Dáil was a good one, and Deputies gave the Minister every help in getting it passed.  It makes provision for the annual cleaning up of silt or deposit that chokes the rivers.  That Bill was the first attempt to tackle the problem in a businesslike manner by any Government, Irish or English.</P>
    <P>Afforestation must also be taken into consideration, if it was only for the purpose of helping to stop the emigration that is going on.  If other countries can make a profit out of the labour of our people who emigrate I do not see why we should not be able to do so by employing them at home.  Unfortunately emigration is on the increase. There should be no reason for such a state of affairs now.  We should get down to business.  I was prepared to make allowance for emigration after the war of independence, seeing that things were unsettled and that, perhaps, there was a good deal of inexperience in legislative matters.  We must check that now.  After 22 or 23 years of our Government we should know where we are going.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a good mercantile marine established in this country. <Col N="2528" /> I am sure the Minister for Finance will have a big part to play in that matter. We were caught unawares when the war broke out, and I hope that the lesson we learned will not go unheeded. We are a maritime nation, and we have sailors.  For that reason I do not see why we should not develop a marine service as well as our neighbours did in the past.  Now is the time to make a start.  I know that there is no use crying over spilt milk, so let us make a start now.</P>
    <P>The biggest change-over from my point of view is the grant of £1,000,000 by the Government towards the relief of rates on agricultural holdings.  On February 1st the following motion in the names of Deputy Cogan and Deputy Halliden was moved in this House:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that in order to secure a more equitable distribution of the burden of local rates, and to promote increased employment on the land, legislation should be introduced providing for complete derating of the first £20 of the Poor Law Valuation of each farm, and the further total derating of each additional £15 of the Poor Law Valuation in respect of each adult worker employed on the holding; and that the deficit be made good from the Exchequer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has accepted that proposal almost in its entirety. Our method of working, as suggested by the motion, was much simpler than what the Minister proposes. It is much easier to derate all land of a valuation up to £20.  For anybody with a valuation over £20 there is an inducement to employ labour and, by keeping a man, and to get an additional £15 derated for each worker employed whole-time.  In his reply on February 6th, the Minister stated that the motion, if passed, would cost £2,000,000.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I was very glad to hear a number of Deputies on this side of the House, particularly Deputies from the west, who understand the conditions of the smallholders, point out to Clann na Talmhan that, if this £2,000,000 is to be collected off the taxpayers instead of the farmers, <Col N="2529" /> and if additional taxes are put on commodities like tea, sugar and tobacco, the small farmers will pay more by way of increased taxes than they are paying as rates.  That cannot be denied.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should point out that our scheme would not have cost £2,000,000.  The most it would cost would be £1,000,000 or £1,250,000.  The Minister pointed to tea, sugar and tobacco as bogies of Fianna Fáil and small farmers. Strange to say, he has seen his way now to come two-thirds of our way and not only that but to reduce the price of sugar.  I think there is a different reason for the change of front on the part of the Government.  I think it was the recent by-election in Mayo which did more to bring the Minister to a sense of responsibility than our motion.  The farmers of Mayo are more to be thanked for what has happened than the Minister or Fianna Fáil.  During the years of the emergency very big demands were made on farmers.  They were asked to break up their land in order to feed people who could not produce food. Substantial help must now be given farmers in order to restore the land to fertility.</P>

      <P>Very good; I will pass from it, but I want the Minister to consider particularly a subsidy on artificial fertilisers.  There is a crying need for these at present and farmers were badly caught out at the start of the emergency.  We were producing only very little at home and it was not of the highest quality.  Farmers have done a remarkably good job of work and it was they, next to Providence, who preserved our neutrality.  If they could not have produced the food, the tune would have been entirely different.  This sum of £1,000,000 will be a certain relief to them&mdash;it is not as much as we would like&mdash;but the other point as to bringing the land back to the state of fertility which obtained before the war is equally important.  We do not know what the future may hold.  It may hold another emergency period, for all we know, and let us not be caught with the land depleted of fertility which might result in our being compelled to adopt a very different attitude from that which we adopted in recent years.  Let us see that that does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is the first Budget introduced by the Minister, I should like to congratulate him on the form of its presentation.  I was one of those who sat through the entire statement and it was a refreshing change from the procedure adopted on previous occasions.  It was quite easy to follow the statement without having to wade through a rather voluminous document and its general style was <Col N="2531" /> simple.  Having said that, let me go on to deal with the Budget.  Those who may get the benefit of what are generally regarded as concessions under the Budget, such as income-tax payers, motorists and so on, will naturally regard this Budget as a rather pleasant document, and in certain respects it will be well received, too, by the people of this city in view of the reduction in the price of turf.  These people have had to bear a very heavy impost for the past five years, and very often for fuel of a rather inferior quality.  I end my congratulations at this point and go on to express some feelings of disappointment.</P>
      <P>In the first place, may I say that I regard the Minister as being guilty of a grave social blunder in that recognising, as he does, and as all members of this House recognise, the hardships under which a very large section of our people are undoubtedly suffering and have been suffering, particularly during the past five years, no provision whatever is made in the Budget for any amelioration of their lot in the future. I refer to that section mentioned by other speakers, the old age pensioners. May I say that if the Minister took what might be regarded as the bold step of allocating the entire amount at his disposal towards the relief of this section, I am quite certain that his action would be applauded by the country as a whole.  Even if he had devoted a proportion to the relief of these people and then went on to give reliefs, in a limited form I grant you, in other directions, his gesture would also be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand the Minister's failure to do one thing in relation to a feature of the old age pensions code on which there is a general consensus of agreement amongst Deputies on this side and on the other side of the House, that is to take the opportunity of providing, if not for the abolition, at least for a mitigation of the iniquitous section of the old age pensions code known as the means test.  Since there is nothing whatever in the Minister's statement which holds out any hope for the old age pensioners in the future I am forced to the conclusion <Col N="2532" /> that the old age pensioners must now be regarded as belonging to the legion of the lost.  I think it is a regrettable position and one which will be deeply deplored throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister evidently was tilting at members on the Labour Benches when he made comparisons with other countries in the matter of the national debt.  I must say that I was delighted that the Minister advanced into that sphere, even though the comparisons he made might presumably have an adverse effect on the arguments put forward from this side from time to time.  I am very glad he did make these comparisons, if for no other reason than that he felt that conditions in such countries as America, Sweden and New Zealand might be of interest to the people here.  There was a time when we did, for obvious reasons, refer to conditions, particularly in New Zealand and Sweden. Our arguments, particularly in respect of the social services operating there, were received with a certain amount of cynicism, and I gladly welcome the fact that the Minister is prepared to take cognisance of conditions in these countries now.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of the actual conditions responsible for the increase in the national debt in these countries, but it is at least common knowledge that New Zealand was a belligerent in the recent war and that the conditions of Sweden were not far removed from that state.  As a neutral country, she had perhaps more trials and tribulations than any other neutral country. The fact, however, remains that despite the increase in the national debt of these countries, the value of the real wages there was far higher than obtained here throughout the past five years and the further fact remains that social services in these countries were improved during these years. Therefore, the comparison is one which we are not prepared to accept in the same spirit as that in which it was put forward by the Minister, because the people in receipt of old age pensions and other services in New Zealand have, and had, a higher standard of life during the war than <Col N="2533" /> was enjoyed by a considerable section of our people.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the real test of this Budget is to be found in the economic position of the country as reflected in a constant figure of unemployed.  The Minister has acknowledged a figure of about 60,000 which is reckoned as the constant figure, excluding emigration, and, by the way, I should say that his figure of 70,000 odd for emigration to England was received with a certain amount of amazement and astonishment in all parts of the House.  I should be very glad to get the source of the information on which these figures were built up.</P>

      <P>I was making the point that, since we have a constant pool of unemployment of about 60,000, the test of the Government's intention to put the economic position of the country right will be their approach to the solution of that problem.  The Minister in his speech expressed certain hopes that action would be taken throughout the country to remedy that particular position.  He indicated that there were almost numberless avenues of employment in various counties.  But I gathered that he was rather relying on sources outside the Government for putting these schemes into operation. My own personal view is that the unemployment problem will not be solved until there is initiative, zeal, and a through determination displayed from <Col N="2534" /> the top, as represented by the Government, in a matter of this kind.  If it is left to other sources, there will inevitably be a lag.</P>
      <P>Therefore I suggest that the Government will have to indicate that they are prepared to take more vigorous steps to ensure at least the lowering of that pool of unemployment, if not its entire elimination.  I am not satisfied from the Minister's statement that we shall have any approach along these lines within the next 12 months.</P>
      <P>I had hoped to hear from the Budget speech what was to be the position in connection with education.  It was clear that the amount which it was hoped would meet the problem of the primary teachers would have to be provided for.  But there is no indication in the Book of Estimates that that is so.  Here again I must express disappointment that advantage was not taken of the amount at the Minister's disposal to solve this question of the dispute between the Minister for Education and the teachers.</P>

      <P>This point, I think you will agree, sir, affects the Minister for Finance.  The explanation given here before, so far as the cost was concerned, was that the Department were limited by the particular amount provided&mdash;the Minister for Education used the phrase that he had to cut his cloth according to the measure at his disposal. That statement would lead one to think that the finances of the country were not in the position represented in this Budget speech.  I say that there was ample room at the Minister's disposal to provide from his surplus the amount&mdash;it was generally believed not to be a very large amount &mdash;which would settle this question once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I come to what I regard personally as the most interesting part of the Budget speech and that is in connection with the future procedure for financing local authorities, particularly in matters such as housing.  Last year I brought to the notice of the Minister the undesirable position obtaining in so far as finance for local authorities <Col N="2535" /> was concerned; the haphazard and indeterminate system of going to the market at certain periods, having to submit to various fluctuations, and having to take whatever price was being offered on the market from time to time.</P>
    <P>That, plus the fact that one local authority was in competition with another, was leading to a state of affairs in local authorities' finance which was, to say the least of it, undesirable. I asked the Minister to look into the matter in conjunction with the Minister for Local Government. I am glad to see that he, apparently, did that.  The first indication of that was the Financial (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which was introduced, by which the Dublin Corporation was facilitated to the extent of an advance in connection with the conversion loan of last year.  Now it has been indicated in the Budget speech that the Minister proposes to borrow under certain headings for the future.  I am anxious to know whether his intention is that the scheme by which public authorities, particularly for housing, may approach the Minister and get advances from the Exchequer or the Local Loans Fund is to be a temporary expedient.  Is it to be limited to a number of years, or is it to be the policy for the future? I think it is desirable that we should know precisely what the position is in that respect.</P>
    <P>I should like to direct the Minister's special attention to the fact that we have been led to believe in this House, for the past six months particularly, and recently by the Minister for Local Government, that the allocation of the subsidy operating under the Housing Act of 1932 would be altered in favour of the local authorities. It is true that the Minister has indicated in his Budget speech that he proposes to make a certain arrangement to that end.  He proposes to set up what is to be known as a transition development fund&mdash;I do not like that term; it is not easy to get your tongue around it&mdash;and that from that fund certain grants will be made in certain circumstances.  From my reading <Col N="2536" /> of the Minister's statement I am not quite clear on that matter and I hope he will elaborate it at a later stage.  He says that if the tenders for the building of houses are reasonable, then a grant out of this fund should keep the rents of the cottages at a reasonable figure.  But suppose the tenders are not reasonable, what is to be the position of the local authority concerned?  What precisely will be the graded form of the grant to be made?  Members of local authorities are aware of the inequalities that obtained in connection with this subsidy since 1832.  When the original subsidies were granted they were a decided advance and were regarded as exceedingly helpful so far as local authorities were concerned.  But they were limited in the case of cottages to a maximum price of £450 in the borough areas and in the case of flats to £500.</P>
    <P>Anybody who knows anything about building costs, during the last four or five years particularly, will readily understand that, while there was an advantage to be got up to, say, 1939, from the subsidy granted, the maximum cost of £450 in one case and £500 in the other bears no relation to the circumstances obtaining to-day.  Therefore, we have been pressing for some considerable time that there should be an adjustment in an upward and more favourable direction so far as local authorities are concerned.</P>
    <P>The average cost of our cottages in the City of Dublin at present, excluding the cost of acquisition, is £750. Because of certain difficulties it has not been possible for some considerable time to build any flats at all and it is obvious that the municipality, as such, has been bearing an undue&mdash; certainly an exceedingly heavy&mdash;proportion of the cost of these housing programmes, by reason of the fact that it has had to bear the difference between the maximum rate on £450 up to a cost of £750; and, in the same way, with the question of flats.  Now, I do ask the Minister to elaborate further on the question of how far and in what manner this particular subsidy relating to houses for local authorities will be applied.  On the <Col N="2537" /> question of interest charges, may I say it will be received as an exceedingly welcome step&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by every public authority throughout this country, an illustration of which may be found in the fact that, so far as Dublin is concerned, we have provided in our current financial year for interest charges on housing alone no less a figure than £440,000, equivalent to 4/- in the £, or on all our services a sum of £535,000, equivalent to 5/- in the £. In line with what the Minister said regarding his own charges&mdash;that is his own national charges&mdash;I would, of course, like to repeat that we can do nothing about this particular debt, or the weight of that debt, until such time as the stocks which were issued will be due for normal redemption.</P>
      <P>But in any case it opens a brighter future&mdash;here again particularly so far as Dublin is concerned&mdash;when we consider that we are due a programme in this city of something like 2,000 houses a year for ten years, which, on current costs, would cost the municipality something like £1,600,000 per annum. To the extent that these charges can be reduced in future&mdash;including, of course, the dead weight of the city&mdash; I must say that this is the most striking feature of this Budget statement as far as I am concerned.  For that reason, I put the question as to whether it is merely to be regarded as a temporary measure.  Is it intended to be just merely for a limited period or are we to take it that it is the settled policy of the Government that local authorities for all public utility purposes in the future shall have access to the Minister's exchequer, on the one hand, or the local loans, on the other, on the principles which he has enunciated in this speech&mdash;that is, on the basis of 2½ per cent.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, I understand that when Metro Goldwyn Mayer came to the conclusion that their existing female stars tended to fade, one enterprising executive directed their attention to Betty Grable's legs and said that he thought it would be well worth investing half a million in publicising <Col N="2538" /> them so that they could use her as a substitute for the declining stars in the cinema firmament.  It occurs to me that the Tánaiste&mdash;Deputy Lemass&mdash;is the Betty Grable's legs of the Fianna Fáil Party, because I observe for the last two years (1) that he is held up as the rising star and (2) that almost every piece of legislation, including this Budget, contains substantial appropriations of money for the purpose of adorning the picture&mdash;not in this case of Betty Grable's legs but on a &ldquo;young Lochinvar come out of the west&rdquo; surrounded by triumphs.  Some of his stagger into existence; but they do in the heel of the hunt at immense public expense.</P>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity on the occasion of the appointment of a new Minister for Finance, to inquire from him if he can tell us now how much the public in this country are going to be called upon to expend for the adequate varnishing of Fianna Fáil Betty Grable's legs?  To-day we have to consider a reduction of 6d. a gallon on the tax on petrol.  To a man of the meanest intelligence that is a subsidy to Córas Iompair Éireann.  The public memory is so short that they will have forgotten that our young Lochinvar&mdash;the Tánaiste&mdash;was responsible for railway legislation in 1933, which went up the spout, for railway legislation some years later that also went up the spout; and that his last effort is Córas Iompair Éireann.  And, having provided that body with a monopoly and a variety of other very substantial concessions, this Budget, amidst gifts for everybody I confess, bestows a substantial gift on Córas Iompair Éireann because the consumption of petrol by them at present equals that of the entire of the rest of the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suppose I can find undue fault with the Fianna Fáil Party for grooming a new candidate for the position of Taoiseach, though I think it is a little graceless on their part to be pushing the present occupant of the office into semi-retirement so soon because, God bless him, he looks as brisk as a bee and just as resourceful and formidable as he ever was; and I am sure all sides of the House will <Col N="2539" /> share the pious hope that he will be long spared to afflict this country as he has so effectively done over the last 25 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But if the new candidate for the office has to be groomed, I really do think we have spent enough public money on him.  There is £470,000 a year now for the petrol. There are millions being poured into Rineanna so that he can unroll red carpets for distinguished visitors and sign agreements which will become, like Mohammed's coffin, suspended. We do not know whether they work or whether they do not.  We are going to pour millions into the bogs of Ireland for the production of turf.  Just imagine the folly, in a time when there is a scarcity of coal, of announcing that our reaction to that scarcity of coal is to turn to the bogs in the year 1946. Suppose we heard that the Egyptian Government had started to create a national scheme for the Pasha of Cascara Sagrada's fleet of camels in order to increase the domestic supply of camel dung for the purpose of utilising it for fuel for generating electricity! Camel dung is a very much superior fuel to the turf of this country.  That is perfectly true.  The water content of that comestible, carefully controlled, is much less than that of the turf cut on our Irish bogs.  But that is going to involve the use of machines, and, of course, every block-headed Deputy in this House&mdash;and there are a good many of them&mdash;who foresaw that some of the expenditure would be spent in his constituency stood up and cheered and said &ldquo;this is lovely and when are you going to start in my constituency?&rdquo; The truth of it is that it is a disgusting, shameless piece of codology, involving an expenditure of millions of money for the glorification of the legs of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blowick is clamouring for a mercantile marine.  He asks why are not our ships ploughing the seven seas. What are they going to plough the seven seas for?  For the fun of giving Deputy Blowick's constituents tours. What is it going to cost to keep these ships ploughing the seven seas?  The <Col N="2540" /> Tourist Development Board&mdash;another monument to Fianna Fáil's legs&mdash;does anybody know what that board is spending, or how it is spending it?</P>
    <P>I am told they spent £28,000&mdash;some say £40,000&mdash;on a green patch of soil down at Tramore.  If any man asked me for £40,000 for the bit of green in front of the Grand Hotel in Tramore I would ask him was he daft.  I would buy the whole front of Tramore, nearly, for that sum of money.  I hear of hotels being bought from this fellow and pavilions being bought from that fellow but nobody knows the circumstances in which these transactions took place and nobody gives a damn. Of course, luncheons are given at infrequent intervals in which the great vision and the glorious statesmanship of Mr. Lemass, the Tánaiste, are acclaimed.  Lastly, unlike other Ministers, he could not live in the accommodation we had for him.  We had to build a palace in Kildare Street to house him, and the existing Tánaiste has now the finest Government offices in this country, built at immense expense in the middle of the emergency. That money is all gone and it has gone building him up, his own particular clique building him up to succeed the Taoiseach.  Leaving aside all questions of delicacy, I want to ask the modest question: what is the ultimate ceiling for the cost of this operation and when is the burden of publicising this particular version of Betty Grable's legs going to transfer from the Exchequer to the funds of the Fianna Fáil Party?  I think the time has nearly come.  I invite Deputies, in future, when daft schemes are brought before them for the consumption of public money to ask themselves what is the true purpose of using turf in 1946 as a source of power instead of oil or any reasonable medium of power that might be considered as an alternative to coal.  Is it for the betterment of our people or is it for the consolidation of the political structure of the Fianna Fáil Party under the direction of that bustling aspirant for preferment in its ranks?</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever that this Budget does distribute largesse, much of which is welcome.  It is an interesting thing that, in a time of crisis such <Col N="2541" /> as that through which the world has recently passed, democracies particularly have shown superb fortitude in shouldering financial burdens for the preservation of the institutions in which they believe.  Our democracy has been in no way peculiar and our people have uncomplainingly accepted burdens of taxation during the past six years which would have been unthinkable in peace time.  But, there is this remarkable quality about inexperienced democracies and that is, that when the time comes when the peculiar difficulties which justified the imposition of taxation of that character pass away we are very much inclined to be quite dazzled by the first relaxation of the fiduciary burden which everybody knew could not be long maintained.  It is very comfortable to get 1/- off the income tax, very nice to hear that there is going to be no more Excess Profits Corporation Tax after the end of this year, very agreeable to the shareholders of Corás Iompair Éireann to hear there is going to be 6d. a gallon taken off petrol.  It is very nice to have 10/- a ton taken off turf; it is lots of fun to be able to hold dances and ceilidhthe without paying any revenue tax upon them.  It is just grand to get £5 instead of £2 for every child who is represented as being a native speaker in his own home in the Gaeltacht, which is the most egregious cod, although I do not grudge the people of the Gaeltacht the £5 per child they are getting.  The fact that they remain in the Gaeltacht and live in the Gaeltacht, I think, entitles them to a benefit of that character, but I wish to God we could give it to them without the veneer of cod and fraud upon it.  I would prefer to give it to all the children in the Gaeltacht than to be conducting a kind of spurious tests to determine whether in fact the children speak Irish all the time in their own homes because that is the equivalent of setting up an office at which you can draw £5 provided you are prepared to tell lies.  How could anybody determine with accuracy whether a child speaks Irish always in its own home?  Who is going to advocate the establishment of an inspectorate to raid people's houses night and day, to eavesdrop at their doors to see whether the conditions of the grant are <Col N="2542" /> being carried into effect or not?  It would be an intolerable situation and highly undesirable.</P>
    <P>Why then cannot we give it to the children living in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and leave it at that and not set a premium on lying and fraud, not compel needy parents, who require the money to provide their children with extra amenities that they otherwise would not be able to afford, to lie if they cannot get it in accordance with the terms laid down by the scheme?</P>
    <P>I want to say a word on the occasion of this Budget for a section of the community in this country on whose behalf few people ever care to break the silence.  We are all aware of the difficulties of the old age pensioners and they have many eloquent spokesmen in this House.  Their number is legion and their voting power strong.  I leave it to my colleagues who have spoken so eloquently on their behalf to gather all the benefits that will in due course accrue to them for their valiant efforts.  I want to speak on behalf of a body of persons whose votes are peculiarly independent and rarely swayed by personal interest, the middle classes, the salary-earning middle classes, and that section of the community who are living on modest fixed incomes which no exertion on their part can increase.  I want to tell the House that the circumstances of many of these persons are grievous and acute.  There are many scholars, public servants of one kind or another, elderly people, mainly women, dependent on small settlements or the produce of modest estates.  In the case of the salaried elements in that class, their salaries have mainly remained stationary and, although the cost-of-living has gone up 70 per cent. since the beginning of the war, no addition has been made to their emoluments. In regard to the class of persons whose income depends on a modest volume of investments which was laid by for them years ago to provide against destitution or poverty, the tendency has been for the rate of interest payable on trustee securities to decline and at the same time the cost of living has gone steeply up.  They are not a class of people who care to publicise their difficulties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2543" /> They are not the type of people who desire to communicate to all and sundry the financial stringency that afflicts them and the very difficult adjustments that they are for ever striving to make in order to maintain a standard of living, not identical with but nearly analogous to that to which they were accustomed pre-war and to which by their exertions they are most pre-eminently entitled.  I have knowledge that the reduction of 1/- in the income-tax is some contribution to their problem.  I suggest to the Minister for Finance that the circumstances of this class of persons should be specially examined, either with a view to devising some special relief for them through the medium of the income-tax code, or with a view to promoting in the country, in respect to the salaried class to which I refer, a standard and reasonable adjustment of their revenues, and, in respect of the rentier class which I have described, an alleviation of their distress which, in very many cases, has become acute and urgent.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to speak in a way calculated to stir emotion on behalf of the destitute.  It is very easy to speak eloquently for sympathy with the afflicted.  But it is not easy to bespeak understanding and sympathy with that most precious element in our community who have habitually looked after themselves, who have never sought or desired to become a charge on public funds of any kind, but who have it bred in their bones to earn their own living by their own exertions and to take any hard knocks which the community is called upon as a whole to take.  But what is more than human endurance can stand is that, when they have accepted all that every other section of the community have accepted, they are called upon to bear that little extra which every other section of the community is helped to bear but which they are assumed to be able to carry alone.</P>
    <P>From my knowledge of them, and I am proud to come of that class, they are no longer able to bear it and in many houses which have an exterior <Col N="2544" /> of more than modest comfort there is at the present time acute suffering and anxiety which, if we search our minds, I think we will be constrained to remember has produced untimely ill-health or worse, through the difficulties which the responsible heads of such families have been called upon to bear in silence.  I would like to see a recognition of that on all sides and a resolve that persons so situated would, from their immediate employers, be they public authorities, academic institutions or other establishments of that character, be given some percentage increase on the emoluments they held prior to the war.</P>
    <P>With regard to the rentier class which I have described, it would not be easy to segregate the deserving element of it and exclude those who have vast incomes from their accumulated wealth.  But there is a certain section of the rentier class which is in dire straits, through no fault of their own, and I cannot believe that it would surpass the ingenuity of that most resourceful body, the Revenue Commissioners, to devise a plan so as to ensure that those on whom the difficulties of the present situation are bearing unreasonably heavily might be relieved of some part of that contribution to the income-tax revenue which they are at present called upon to bear.</P>
    <P>The third matter I want to refer to is one that was dealt with by Deputy Martin O'Sullivan.  Most notable is the arrangement whereunder joint stock banks have undertaken to discount bills and provide short-term accommodation for the Government at a rate of 1? per cent.  I remember a very wise man saying, on his 70th birthday, looking back over his life, that he did not think this world was a bad place at all if only people would be reasonable.  A French gentleman in his company hastened to interject: &ldquo;<i>Ah mais</i>, <i>Monsieur</i>, <i>c'est une reservation considerable</i>&rdquo;, and indeed it is our painful experience that it is a very considerable qualification on most occasions.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I salute, with peculiar satisfaction, the fact that on this occasion, when a difficult departure from <Col N="2545" /> well-established practice was to be made, apparently both the Minister, his advisers and the joint stock banks were reasonable.  They recognised that a new situation existed and that new methods had to be employed to deal with it and they arrived at the machinery whereby that could be done in a reasonable spirit.  I think all parties to that transaction, and especially the joint stock banks, are to be cordially congratulated.  I believe that that first step on a very important new departure provides us with a valuable insurance against the possibility which often haunted my mind, that unless people were reasonable in the adjustments that required to be made in that regard, that some day irresponsible and reckless people would plunge in and, in an endeavour to abate a manifest abuse, do infinitely more harm in their uninformed reforming zeal than the existing abuse gave rise to.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister and the joint stock banks, between them, by the reasonable procedure they have adopted in this matter and which was announced in the Budget statement, deserve well not only of this country but very possibly of every country which believes in democracy and private enterprise as a desirable part of their political set-up, because at last we have established clearly an essential difference which ought to be recognised if the system of private property and private enterprise is to be maintained, as opposed to the detestable servitude of socialism&mdash;that there can be and should be a distinction made between the commercial transactions that take place between a Government or a municipality and a joint stock bank on the one hand and the commercial transactions that take place between a joint stock bank and its ordinary mercantile customer on the other.  These transactions belong to two entirely different classes or categories and what is proper, right and necessary in regard to their transactions with a municipality or a Government may be neither right nor desirable in the course of their business but, in any case, is something which should be left for settlement between the bank and its customers without any attempt on the part of the <Col N="2546" /> Government of the day to interfere on the one side or on the other.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point I wish to touch upon.  I wonder if I can touch upon it, so as to get a responsive chord from the Minister's heart.  I like a dance.  Many a Saturday night I danced at ceilidhthes in the Mansion House and then went to 6 o'clock Mass at Clarendon Street on Sunday morning. I am not to be taken as a spoil sport.  I know all the tricks of the trade.  It is possible to get a short Mass at 6 o'clock in Clarendon Street on Sunday mornings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not too early after ceilidhthes that went on all night.  If ceilidhthes are kept going until 5 o'clock you can then get 6 o'clock Mass in Clarendon Street.  I have been to dances in dance halls in this city and in rural areas.  I wore the white tie and tails and also attire similar to what I am now wearing.  I enjoyed them all and, with the help of God, I look forward to enjoying many more before I am done.  But I am blowed if I would give £65,000 to the gentlemen who run dance halls.  I have no objection to dance halls.  I have no objection to the fellows who spend 6d. or 1/- on dances if they want to do so.  Is it reasonable to propose to take off that industry, which is a very prosperous one, a levy of £65,000 at a time when the National University of Ireland is in receipt of a grant no greater than it had when the number of students for which it catered was not half what it is to-day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Conceive what a difference it would make to University College, Dublin, to University College, Galway, or University College, Cork, if that £65,000 were given to them.  Look at the position of University College, Dublin. They have not sufficient buildings wherein to house those who attend there.  They have virtually no equipment with which to do their work, and the laboratories are at the end of their tether to carry on efficiently.  It is a question of scraping and scrounging from one department to another to get the minimum equipment necessary for the work that has to be done.  You <Col N="2547" /> have scholars of the highest standing there, pegging away day after day lecturing classes.</P>
    <P>The multitude of students is so great, and the number of lecturers and professors so small, that men who ought to be engaged in research and learning, contributing to the prestige and distinction of their university and the country as a whole, must devote all their time to doing work which men little better equipped than secondary teachers would do equally well.  That is all because they have not the money.  It is not because it is not possible to get equipment; it is not because there are not men and women eminently fitted for such work; it is not because there is any dearth of students anxious to go and in fact going there.</P>
    <P>It is because Oireachtas Eireann will not provide the money, and because we will not realise that all great universities in the United States of America do not have to depend on subventions. They have their own wealthy patrons. The University of Chicago has received literally millions from the Rockefellers.  In addition, Yale, Princeton and other universities have a very large alumni which endowed them with gargantuan sums which are invested, and the proceeds devoted to the promotion of one thing or another.  There is no one in this country in a position to endow our seats of learning.  Trinity, as a result of its long existence, has accumulated very considerable endowments, although they do not compare with Oxford or Cambridge or with wealthy universities in the United States. But there are some funds of which scholars of high standing can avail to add lustre to the University of Dublin by devoting their time to research. Those on the staff of the National University of Ireland virtually end their lives as scholars, because the clamour of the host of students who go to that institution make it virtually impossible for professors to devote their leisure time to research and to learning which they might as ordinary university professors be expected to undertake.</P>
    <P>Surely nobody will complain if we <Col N="2548" /> take this £65,000 back from the dance halls and give it to the university.  To give the devil his due, I do not believe that a boy or girl going to a dance in rural Ireland would grudge a contribution for that purpose.  I know that there is argument down the country about having to put stamps on tickets. The same is true everywhere.  The same is true of every revenue law.  The same is true of almost every minor piece of legislation passed by this House.  Ask the Guards if there is not contention and argument as to whether a person can drink a pint of porter at five minutes after ten.  There is contention in every town in Ireland about that, yet we do not repeal the whole of the licensing laws.  If laws are made providing for the drinking of a pint of porter at 10 p.m., 11 p.m. or 12 p.m. there will be a few fellows who will want to argue about their right to get it at five minutes past twelve, and if they are found drinking it then they will say it was paint to be used for black-out, and that the Guards made a mistake.</P>
    <P>Every now and again fellows are prosecuted for not putting stamps on tickets.  We all know that.  I do not deny that if there is a dance or a social coming on, it is not uncommon for inquiries to be made as to where the revenue official will be that night. If anybody can send him to a social or a funeral every facility will be provided for him.  If he steals a march and gets back in time to catch them, nobody complains.  If anybody is convicted in court, such as the secretary of a local temperance association, for not having the tickets stamped his good name is not seriously aspersed.  I think it is a soft test.  I never heard anybody complaining about it.  I never heard anybody say that the tax bore unduly heavily on any section of the community. There is a very substantial sum of money involved, but from the point of view of higher education it would mean a great deal.  It is a pathetic thing that in this country the proceeds of stamps stuck on dance tickets should be a matter of very great consideration to the National University of Ireland.  If that is true, and I assert that it is true, it is our own fault.</P>
    <P>Is it unreasonable, then, to ask the <Col N="2549" /> Minister to reconsider this concession and, instead, to announce that he proposes to divert the money to the Universities, and I do not think that, if he were so minded, it would break his heart to add a little to it?  I notice that the provision for overestimation in this Budget is of a conservative character.  Surely the Minister, in all he was handing out to everybody, might have thought of the Universities, might have thought of their dire stress and need, might have thought of the very real problem that is created by the professor who is enjoying the same salary as he had six years ago and who could not possibly live on it if he did not go out and seek ancillary employment in his spare time, or by the lecturer&mdash;and bear this in mind: to become a lecturer in the National University, one ought to be a man of some standing&mdash;who entered the service of the University at a salary of £360 a year and who, after nine years' service, after the publication of a good deal of work in international journals which has been acknowledged as being of value&mdash;and that is not only one man but several&mdash; is still in receipt of £360 a year, substantially less than the hosiery buyer in any department store in Dublin and substantially less than the competent sanitary supervisor in the employment of the municipality.</P>
    <P>God be with the days when it could be truly said of this country that we had a reverence for learning.  If reverence for learning is to be measured by the generosity with which the scholars are entertained by their employers, the State, we must have the poorest opinion of scholarship in all the civilised world.  I do not believe that is true.  I believe that our failure to deal with that situation is very largely due to ignorance and to lack of knowledge on the part of Deputies.  I am giving them the knowledge now.  I am telling them that there are lecturers in University College, Dublin, who entered the service of the University at a salary of £360 per year and who still have the same salary after seven, eight and nine years' service.  I have described the conditions under which these men are working, and I invite the sympathetic consideration of the <Col N="2550" /> Minister for Finance, for, in the last analysis, the responsibility must be his.</P>
    <P>With this word I conclude, because I want the House to remember that, if that deplorable situation in regard to scholarship which I describe is to be remedied, it must be remedied with an open hand and an endowment to which no strings are attached.</P>
    <P>The temptation to make the occasion of rectifying the deficiency I described the occasion for imposing conditions, making stipulations and requiring certain considerations from a learned institution is well-nigh irresistible to a bureaucracy, and even to a legislature. The day this House embarked on such a course would mark the end of learning in this country, for no scholar worthy of the name would desire to be on the pay-roll of any institution which submitted to conditions of that kind. When we go to endow learning, we must leave it to the scholars to justify by their achievement the trust we put in them by giving them the endowment. If they fail us, then it must be because the best we have in Ireland are unworthy of the trust.  I do not believe that will ever happen, and that is why I ask the Minister for Finance on this, the occasion of his first Budget, instead of remitting the tax on dance halls, to give it, and a good deal more, not to the extravagant, but merely to the adequate endowment of higher education for our people, in the confidence that, given their opportunity, our people will prove the equal, and even the superior of almost any other people on the earth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the occasion of a Budget, I always have a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister for Finance, no matter who that Minister may be, because very frequently we completely lose sight of the fact that the Minister on Budget day is merely making provision for the expenditure and the demands of all and every Government Department, and it so happens that, on the occasion of the debate on the Budget, the Minister is the only Minister available, either in the witness-box or in the dock, as the case may be, and our remarks, observations and criticisms must of necessity be directed at that particular individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this Budget, on the very face of it is the appearance of a business establishment which has a few attractive items and which pushes these in big display in the window, hoping that these attractive items will catch the public attention and that no curious gaze will be directed more deeply into the shop.  We have before <Col N="2552" /> us a concession with regard to the turf burners in the non-turf areas, a sop for the income-tax payers and a concession to the users of petrol; but, behind that shop window, we have to face up to the cold fact that this year, with peace ahead of us and war behind us, this Budget makes provision for Central and Supply Services which will cost altogether considerably more than they cost in any previous year, and when this Budget is asking for authority to take considerably more out of the pockets of the taxpayer than ever was previously taken.  We are going to borrow less to stop the gap between our requirements and our tax revenue; but our supply services are to cost more from the taxpayer than heretofore.</P>
    <P>That is what is behind the bold frontage, the attractive shop-window. We give allowances in this direction by way of easing the lot of the consumer, but, through the medium of Customs, we will take a couple of million pounds more out of the pocket of the consumer. We will take the latter couple of millions directly out of his pocket. But the concessions to the consumer will be given through the medium of the racketeer in the transport of turf, hoping that some of what is passed in will, in the course of time, trickle down to the consumer.  In other words, when we are taking from the consumer, we take directly and there are no pious hopes as to whether we will get it or not.  But, when we are giving contributions, alleged by the Minister to be aimed at easing the plight of the consumer, we give them indirectly through the instrumentality of a number of bodies who may or may not pass them on to the consumer.  There is no obligation, however, and, so far as I can see, there is no machinery or no arrangement&mdash;quite the contrary. When we make an arrangement with regard to our flour and bread, so that we are selling pollard to human beings at the price of white flour, when we mulct them out of £180,000 per annum by selling them pollard under the pretence that it is flour, what becomes of the £180,000?  Does it go back to the consumer?  It is taken over by the Department of Finance and threshed out to the profiteer or the racketeer <Col N="2553" /> who is dragging turf up and down the country.</P>
    <P>That is where I see the big lack of thought, the lack of study, the lack of consideration in this particular Budget. On the very face of it, I think it is noisy, screaming evidence that it is the Budget of a person who is thinking in terms of figures and not in terms of human beings.  I would like to see a human Budget introduced in this country that would carry on the face of it evidence of consideration for the people who live in the country.  We have seen it in other countries.</P>
    <P>We have income-tax concessions at the rate of 1/- in the £.  If we give a moment's consideration to that income-tax concession <i>vis-à-vis</i> the state of affairs that exists according to all accounts in this country where the cost of living is breaking the back of the strongest family man, one would imagine that there would be some adjustment between the income-tax relief and the cost of maintaining a family. We give an income-tax relief of 1/- in the £ in the standard rate, so that if you take two people whose incomes are equal, one being a bachelor and the other being the head of a large family, under this Budget the bachelor, who has no dependents, who is scarcely worried with regard to the galloping rise in the cost of living, is to get far more consideration and financial help from the taxpayers of the country than the individual who is trying to rear a family.</P>
    <P>When we come to the reliefs with regard to the income-tax payer in the field of industry, we have exactly the same features staring out of that Budget, namely, that the relief is given irrespective of what becomes of the money after it is given.  We heard the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the other side of the water broadcast recently.  When he was making concessions to industrialists, he faced the facts as they exist there in a country that will have to produce and sell twice as much as it did before the war if it is to hold the position it held before the war; a country that possibly will be faced with a huge wave of unemployment after demobilisation. What income-tax reliefs were made <Col N="2554" /> there to industry?  Every inducement and every attraction to have the reliefs granted, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer stated, ploughed back again into industry so as to increase production and employment, so as to ensure modern planning, so that the reliefs given would contribute to the wealth and the happiness of all the people and not merely to the wealth or the bank account of an individual. Let us apply anything like that line of approach to the conditions in this country post-war.  What are the conditions, as admitted by every one of us?  It would be idle to shirk or dodge or deny them.</P>
    <P>We have a country that was spared the horrors of war, but we have a country whose expenditure more or less kept in step with the fashion of Europe.  Because there was a war on, whether it was here or elsewhere, that war was made a kind of alibi for a rapidly mounting expenditure.  But, when we were faced with that rapidly mounting expenditure, knowing that one of the results of that would be a greatly increased cost of living, we started by taking the precaution that the wage or salary earner could not lift his head above the dirt on the road. The very first power taken was to get that fellow down and the reason given was that, if we let him poke his nose up, the cost of living would rise.</P>
    <P>Having ensured the position of that man, then the cost of living rose, and rose, and rose to such an extent that no working head of a family could maintain that family above the destitution level except that he or some other member of the family emigrated to Britain in order to send home some of his wages.  The Minister, in his Budget statement, makes it appear that the emigration we suffered in recent years was brought about through lack of supplies&mdash;industry working at half-cock or closing down altogether, shortage of work because of shortage of material.  Every Deputy in this House, no matter where he sits, knows very well that that was not the fundamental cause of the emigration from this country in the last five to six years.  The cause of the emigration was the attraction abroad of high wages <Col N="2555" /> and better wages.  When they were going abroad they knew they were going into worse conditions&mdash;into a tightly, rigidly rationed country and a country in which it was even dangerous to be alive, into a country where life was not in any way assured from one hour to the next.</P>
    <P>But, in face of the discomfort of being half fed, in face of the physical danger, one member of nearly every working-class family in this country went abroad, not because he had no love for his own home folk but because he was driven abroad through love for his home folk, so that by his exertions and by his hardships and by the risks he had to take he would be able to send something back to help to maintain that family against and in face of the greatly increased cost of living. There is the situation.  There is the situation as we have it to-day&mdash;a situation where costs are beating the head of every family and breaking up our homes.  How many letters has every Deputy here in his bag at the present moment from wives trying to join their husbands, husbands trying to join their wives, and husbands and wives trying to get their families over to them?  Every single Deputy, irrespective of Party, knows that that is the situation.  Is there any evidence in this document or in that mass of figures of any direct effort, or any direct attempt, to reduce the cost of living? Is there any evidence of any direct effort or any attempt to make good the loss to the individuals who are living on a fixed wage or on a fixed salary? Is there any hint in that document that the Standstill Order, as applied to the salaried workers, even in the Civil Service, will be lifted&mdash;however slightly&mdash;in face of the increased cost of living and the genteel destitution which prevails in most, if not all, such homes?</P>
    <P>There is the picture&mdash;emigration, pegged-down wages, fixed salaries, a rising cost of living and a few million pounds to be thrown around.  In the throwing around of that few million pounds, is there even a single sixpenny bit directed towards increased production, either in the factory or on the <Col N="2556" /> farm?  Is there any single pound in expenditure docketed to any condition in order to produce, or lead to, increased production or to give increased employment?  We know, and the Minister knows, that the emigration in recent years was not brought about through lack of employment.</P>
    <P>We know, and the Minister must know, that that emigration was going on at a much higher rate than the Minister indicates here and that, going on alongside of that emigration, we had a shortage of workers in the rural areas and we had the farmers looking, without success, for workers; we had the armed soldiers of this country turned out to give help on the farms because of the shortage of labour.  I admit that officially a man had to be registered as unemployed.  The fact of the matter was that the employment available was not sufficient to keep the man's family.  He became artificially, or officially, unemployed and he left the country.  These men were not running away from employment.  They were running away from employment which would not produce a living wage for their families and they were running away from salary conditions under which they could not rear a family.  There is no attempt, facing a period of peace and with a period of war behind us, to give any consideration, or any evidence of consideration, to that state of affairs either through increased production, on the one hand, or a reduced cost of living, on the other.</P>
    <P>The income-tax concession, as I said, will be a most welcome one, because the sum is vastly greater to the single individual without dependents; and a fraction of what the man without dependents gets will be given, by way of extra relief, to the man with dependents.</P>
    <P>Now, we come to the turf.  Really turf acts like an emetic on most of us. There has been more racketeering, more profiteering and more evasion and ambiguity and figure-quibbling in connection with turf, and other forms of fuel, in the last five to six years than has ever accumulated in the history of any other country.  We have the Minister for Supplies and the Minister <Col N="2557" /> for Industry and Commerce; whenever he is questioned about this particular matter he has adopted the technique, where he has convinced himself that an assertion made with a loud enough voice and a sufficiently brazen manner, at all events, if it is not true, it carries conviction.  Any time I tried to get behind the figures that go to make up the cost of turf to the consumer in the non-turf area I merely got noise and assertions, but never any explanation.  Be that as it may, the cost of turf in this city was in or about 87/- per ton.  Most of us know the cost to the producer.</P>
    <P>The State, we are told, was giving a big subsidy so as to make it possible to sell turf in the City of Dublin at £3 4s. per ton.  We were told by one Minister, and one Parliamentary Secretary after another, that there was nothing wrong, nothing irregular, and nothing extravagant.  Yet as much as 1/- could not be taken off the price of that turf.  It is within the knowledge of all of us in this House that if any financial wreck of a man could get hold of a lorry, either by purchase, or hire, or loan, with four wheels and four raggedy tyres and get into the transport of turf that, within a month, or two months, or six months, that man's fortune was made for life.  The most fabulous and fantastic fortunes that ever were dreamt of in this country were made in the turf transport racket and are being made at present in that racket of dragging turf up from the country to the city.  All of us have friends and acquaintances who are in the racket.  We know very well that, even with this petrol coupon system in operation, any one of them will give 25/- for a gallon of petrol any day and convince you that it is good business; and that, by buying petrol at 25/- a gallon, they still make money on the day's haulage.  Now the taxpayer is asked to contribute money to reduce the price of turf by 10/- a ton in the non-turf areas.  Would not you think it could be reduced 10/- a ton by a little examination, a little investigation, a little sound organisation and sound administration?  Not only that&mdash; it is the taxpayer must do it.  We take 6d. a gallon off petrol.  As a petrol <Col N="2558" /> user, I am glad to get that concession but, again, the more petrol you use the bigger the concession.  We all know that there are firms and individuals in this turf-haulage racket that have as many as 30 and 40 lorries dragging turf, each of those lorries using, we will say, 20 gallons a day.  That would represent 600 gallons a day.</P>
    <P>Sixpence a gallon, under this Budget, to that particular individual is, on a rough calculation, about £80 a month.  There is the pious hope that he will pass on some of his wealth to the poor old age pensioner who has still to buy his turf and to whom we give an extra three-farthings a week through the concession in respect of sugar.  Sugar is rationed.  The old age pensioner, by law, cannot buy more than three-quarters of a pound of sugar a week.  There is three-farthings for the old-age pensioner and there is £75 or £100 a month for the turf haulier who already is making profits beyond the dreams of man. Would not it strike any sensible person, facing up to the price of fuel in this city and elsewhere, that if a substantial cash concession is to be made at the expense of the taxpayer to those engaged in turf-haulage, there should be some contributory throw-back from them towards the price of turf and that then, in addition, the taxpayer would step in?  There is a hope that some of that vast sum of money that is being released towards these firms having multiple lorries engaged in turf haulage will reach the consumer but alongside that hope we have the certainty that not a fraction of a farthing of that will reach the consumer but that, if the law is carried out and complied with, a great portion of it will go back again to the Minister by way of tax and supertax, if any accounts are kept with regard to the transactions of some of the people we have in mind.  There is no dispute about the matters I mention and, whether Deputies speak out or not, Deputies in every Party know that the quickest and the readiest way to get rich in recent years was to go in for the turf haulage business.</P>
    <P>Converting the £470,000 that the Minister calls loss on petrol, into gallons of petrol, for ten months of the year, that represents nearly 19,000,000 gallons of <Col N="2559" /> petrol for 10 months or 23,000,000 gallons of petrol per annum.  Our pre-war consumption of petrol was 3,000,000 gallons per month, 36,000,000 per annum.  If the figures in this Budget are to be relied on, we are getting two-thirds of our pre-war petrol allowance. I hope that is so but we have another Minister, day after day, telling us that the petrol situation is terribly difficult, that he cannot give an extra gallon to any man, no matter how urgently it is required for his business, that the position is really desperate.</P>
    <P>We have the garages running dry of petrol at least once or twice a week and the coupons issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce are no guarantee, no insurance, no safeguard, that you will get petrol.  I am interested in that particular figure.  If the Finance figure given here is correct, then it indicates that amount of petrol and, if that amount of petrol is there, I want to know who is using it.  Certainly, those who require petrol and who were regarded all through the war as being essential petrol users, are not getting it.  They are on a basis of very little more than they were getting during the very critical years of the war.  But I am aware that there is some secret known to some motorists, and particularly the wealthy motorists, that a gallon of petrol is able to do 400 and 500 miles. I do not know the secret and, if it was sold to the public it would be worth a very big thing.  I know the allowance of eight gallons of petrol per month is able to cover a queer old number of thousands of miles in the case of some people but only those who are wealthy. If we have controls in this country, if we have interference with the individual, if we have supervision, if we have laws by means of emergency regulations, then there is a responsibility definitely on somebody to see that the article controlled and the supply available is given according to Government regulations and Government ration and that no wealth or no influence can allow the supply to be bought up to such an extent that individuals who are complying with the Government ration cannot even get their ration cards or their coupons covered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2560" /> If petrol and other things were arranged on the basis of the greatest insistence on fairplay and equity between individual and individual, then this particular alleviation of tax would not be the subject of so much criticism but, as things are, I would be interested to hear whom exactly the Minister thinks he is helping by the reduction of sixpence a gallon on petrol.</P>
    <P>Amongst private or professional persons, the individuals with the greatest petrol allowance are members of the medical profession and, taking the figure of the coupons or petrol allowed to them, this concession, in the case of the greatest user in that class would amount to a few shillings a month.  It amounts to £470,000 to the taxpayer.  I believe that nearly one-half of the petrol coming into this country at the present moment is being used in the haulage of turf.  In other words, in this particular concession, we are giving the best part of £250,000 to people who are making money too easily as things stand.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Estimate last night I was drawing the Minister's attention, just when progress was reported, to a communication which was addressed to him by a Deputy.  I very strongly resented the action of the Minister in disclosing the information contained in that letter to the Press. I do not want to repeat what I said last night, but I would be very glad to get an assurance from the Minister that he will not continue this practice in the future.  Since I became a member of <Col N="2561" /> the House three years ago, I have never known of a case where a Deputy made representations through any Minister and these representations were made public property in the daily papers.  I think it is a practice that no Minister should carry out.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach made an appeal to the House for the co-operation of all Deputies with the members of his Cabinet, and when Deputies are anxious to make representations and recommendations to Ministers and when they are really at heart sincere in advising the Ministers in the discharge of their duties, it is very bad policy that any Minister, and particularly the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, should write to the editors of papers and have published copies of any communication addressed to him by any member of the House.  I hope that practice will be discontinued and that we will get an assurance from the Minister that it will not happen again. We had one experience of it some months ago and we do not want another.</P>
      <P>I sincerely hope that the Minister will give consideration to the appointment, in provincial towns, of post office messengers.  Since we have had such a great volume of emigration, all the emigrants, the 175,000 who are employed in England, have relatives in this country and every week they send them an allowance.  It is sent by telegram to the people here.  Take the town of Mountmellick, to which I have referred in the course of correspondence with the Minister.  We had a post office messenger there, but for reasons best known to the Department the post was discontinued, although the volume of telegraph traffic was never so high.  Some steps should be taken to provide messengers in all provincial towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general public do not seem to have much of a grouse so far as this Department is concerned.  When the Minister's Department resumes its activities, now that the emergency is over, I suggest he should speed up daily deliveries in all rural areas, the erection of letter-boxes in rural areas and the erection of telephone kiosks in provincial towns.  If the public get <Col N="2562" /> such services they will appreciate them very much.  I had occasion to make strong representations to the Minister's Department in connection with the provision of letter-boxes for an area where we have no post office convenient.</P>
    <P>I refer to Gurteen, quite convenient to the town of Roscrea, County Tipperary. It is in my constituency.  The Minister stated that a letter-box was not necessary in this area.  I should like to have the matter again considered. I am sure the postmaster in Roscrea will be prepared to recommend it, seeing that the appeal for it comes from a large number of local residents.  If a letter-box is erected in this area it will be a great benefit to the public there.</P>
    <P>With regard to sub-post offices, I am sorry to note that we have a lot of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses who find themselves in certain difficulties in so far as they are the custodians of the funds of the Department. In my own constituency I know of a number of cases where sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses have got themselves into slight difficulties. The reason is that they were handling State money and they were not in receipt of a decent wage, sufficient to enable them to live without tampering with State funds.  If the Minister wants these people to carry out their duties in a straightforward and honest manner, and if he wants to rely upon and trust these people, he must see that they are put in an independent way of living and will have sufficient salary to avoid any temptation with respect to the public funds entrusted to them.  I make a strong appeal to the Minister to consider most sympathetically the salaries attached to these offices and I think the public will not stand in the way of substantial increases in this connection.</P>
    <P>As for the telephone service, I cannot say that in my constituency I have any great complaints.  There is an excellent telephone service in Birr, in the Tullamora area, and in the Portlaoignise area.  There is no delay in getting on to the Capital.  I have heard none of my constituents making any <Col N="2563" /> great complaints about delays in getting calls.  I realise that other Deputies may have good grounds for complaint, Deputies such as Deputy Kennedy, from Westmeath.  I am sure the Minister will not lose sight of the complaints made and that in time all those things will be remedied.</P>
    <P>It would be most unfair if I sat down without paying a compliment to the Minister for the manner in which he has discharged his duties.  Only on very rare occasions could I stand up here and compliment any of the Fianna Fáil Ministers, but I find I never had any reason to cross swords with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  In that respect I am unlike other Deputies, such as my colleagues from South Mayo and other areas, who seem to have good grounds for making very serious allegations against the Department. Speaking for my own constituency, so far as political appointments are concerned, I am quite satisfied that if I knew of an appointment in any branch of the Minister's Department, made on political grounds, I would have no hesitation in exposing it in very strong language.  So far I have no reason for making any such complaint against the Department.  I am very frank about it.  I would be dishonest to myself as a Deputy, dishonest to my constituents, and dishonest to the Minister, if I did not say that the appointments made in every respect in my constituency were given to the applicants who were most qualified and who were most suited therefor.</P>
    <P>To the best of my knowledge these appointments were made without interference. I had occasion to make recommendations to the Minister, but they would be recommendations merely as to good character.  I always leave it to the officers of the Department to find out if persons that I recommended had the necessary qualifications for the post they sought, and requested that the applications might then be given sympathetic consideration.  I found the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs always very kind and helpful. He was always anxious to advise and <Col N="2564" /> assist in every possible way.  For that reason I think there is no ground for any serious complaint from this side of the House.  I hope that in the coming year he will be able to continue the progress which the Department has made under him.  The money that is spent by the Department is being spent for the good of the public, in giving good service, and no taxpayer is prepared to give even a second thought to question the manner in which the funds placed at the disposal of the Department are administered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no exception to take to this Estimate beyond calling the Minister's attention to a few matters which came to my notice. Coming from Mayo, I am interested in that constituency and one of my main interests is to get the Minister to realise the duty of seeing that all the people in the area have a daily postal service.  They are as much entitled to a daily service as those in the cities and towns.  It is only reasonable that those people should expect the same consideration to be shown them and the same services provided as are given in provincial towns.  I listened to the Minister's statement on this Estimate and I understand that £20,000 is to be allotted for the provision of a daily postal service.  I do not know whether that amount will be sufficient.  I have on various occasions made representations in relation to areas in which there is no daily delivery.  As Deputy Flanagan pointed out, a large number of telegraph money orders arrive in rural districts, principally from Great Britain and it is unfair that their delivery should be delayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies to letters containing cheques, which are sent home by people in England.  They are worried until they know that their letters have arrived safely.  It is only reasonable to suggest that there should be no differentiation between one section of the community and another in respect to the right of a daily delivery.  There are morning and evening deliveries in the towns, and while I am open to correction, I believe there is a third delivery in some places.  That being so, we are not asking too much in suggesting <Col N="2565" /> one daily delivery in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Coming to the position of the auxiliary postman, he has no security in his position.  He may be an auxiliary postman to-day, but may be unemployed to-morrow.  There are many instances where auxiliary postmen have constant employment, but when they retire, their service receives no consideration, and they get no pension.  The Minister might take their case into consideration.  The position is an important one, because these men are carrying letters as well as a special type of correspondence, and are trusted officials.  At intervals, some postmen misconduct themselves either by opening letters or losing them.  There were cases of that kind in Ballina and in Charlestown some time ago.  There may be other cases of which I am not aware.  Therefore, the postman must be honest and trustworthy in the discharge of his duties. The wage paid to these men is a small one, especially to married men, when the cost of living is taken into consideration. They have to supply their own bicycles.  Everybody knows the difficulty there was during the war period in getting tyres.</P>
    <P>I wish to bring to the Minister's attention the position regarding telephonic communication between Mayo and Dublin and with other parts of the country.  If a trunk call is put in at Swinford there may be a delay of two or three hours.  In the case of a call to Dublin, sometimes the delay is so long that it would be better to walk there.  Communication between Kilkelly and Dublin is hopelessly bad. I do not know what is the cause.  I am sure the officials responsible will be able to advise the Minister on that question.</P>
    <P>My next point concerns clerks, particularly those working in sub-offices. They are paid small amounts.  A short time ago a case occurred where a girl in a post office got into trouble owing to the fact, I suppose, that the wage she received was insufficient for her needs.  She was tempted to use public money.  In some of these sub-offices clerks are employed because the sub-postmaster <Col N="2566" /> or sub-postmistress has no idea how to conduct them.  They are paid a lump sum and knowing nothing about post office business they take in one or perhaps two assistants as clerks.  These poor girls or boys have to work for miserable allowances and do the job which other people are paid for.</P>
    <P>If postmasters and postmistresses were well versed in, and had knowledge of, the running of a sub-post office, there would be no need for these clerks and the remuneration given by the State would be almost sufficient. But, as it is, those appointed to these positions have no such knowledge and must employ a boy or girl with knowledge. I understand that there is such a thing as a postal service examination and that many young men and girls sit for this examination.  It is very unfair that these young men and women who go to the trouble and expense of sitting for the examination should be left out in the cold, while some &ldquo;dud&rdquo; in the person of a postmaster or postmistress is put in to do the work about which he or she knows nothing.  I am sure that other Deputies, and particularly Deputy Norton who is secretary of the Postal Workers' Union and has all this stuff at his finger tips, have gone into this matter in detail and I hope the Minister will take note of what has been said.</P>
    <P>I have had occasion to complain on a few occasions about the way appointments are made.  I had no ulterior motive in doing so.  I may be accused of having such an ulterior motive, but I cannot stop any man or group of men from accusing me of having such a motive.  If they feel I have, they are entitled to that opinion.  The Minister knows that I and other Deputies have on a number of occasions brought to his notice appointments which, in our view and in the view of the people in the particular areas, were surprising and which caused disappointment.</P>
    <P>There was the case of the appointment in Carndonagh, County Donegal; there was the appointment in the town of Charlestown some time ago; and the appointment of the postman, to which Deputy Blowick referred, in February, 1946.  These appointments <Col N="2567" /> have given rise to a certain amount of criticism and misrepresentation and I feel it my duty to make an effort to clear myself of that misrepresentation. I feel that I am in a position to do so, but, before doing so, I want it to be clear that I do not insinuate that the Minister did anything deliberate.  I should, however, like to say that I was more than surprised that a Minister of State, a man in such a responsible position, would stoop to do what he did and with which I shall now deal.  When speaking on the Vote for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs on 17th May, 1945, at Column 580, I reminded the Minister of the seriousness of appointing sub-postmasters or sub-postmistresses who were not fit for the positions.  These were my words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When there is a change-over and a new person is appointed, the Minister should send down one of his servants from Dublin who understands the administration of sub-offices, to ensure that the person who takes over is quite capable, so that in a case of emergency, when the girl or boy he or she employs leaves without notice, or with short notice, he will be able to step in and continue the business until someone else is obtained.  Through pressure from Deputies and others, the Minister may be tempted not to consider the ability of applicants and it may be pointed out to him that he can get so-and-so to carry out the administration. That may be all very well at first, but the day may come when that person walks out and the whole post office business is left with no one to look after it ...,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I then went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I understand there will be some changes in certain sub-offices in Mayo in the near future, and I know that I and other members from the county I have the honour to represent have made representations by letter.  But let that not interfere in any way with the Minister's appointments. Let him take into consideration the efficiency and knowledge of the applicant in the administration of a post office.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In making that statement as to my <Col N="2568" /> having made representations and to others having made similar representations, I had in mind the vacancy in the Charlestown post office.  By mere rumour, I was given to understand that a certain gentleman was to be appointed.  A man in Charlestown wrote to me asking me to recommend him to the Minister for the position. I deny emphatically that this gentleman is any relation of mine.  He may be connected with me in the sense that my sister's husband's sister is married to him.  If that can be termed a relationship, I cannot help it.  I also want to remind the Minister that that man was, and is, treasurer of the Fianna Fáil cumann in Charlestown. It is my duty as a public representative whenever anybody writes to me&mdash;let him be my greatest enemy&mdash;to acknowledge his letter and to do what I can for him, irrespective of what he may have done against me in the past or may do against me in the future.</P>

It was during the last week of the sitting of the Dáil last summer, at the end of June or the beginning of July, that Miss Brett, the acting sub-postmistress, came to me outside my parish church and asked me if I could do anything for her.  I told her I could not, as I understood the appointment had been made.  &ldquo;Will you expose this appointment then?&rdquo; she said.  I asked what could I expose, that I knew nothing about Mr. Harrison, about the post office or about Miss Brett.  She said: &ldquo;I will give you the data, if you will take the matter up.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;I cannot do it now, but I will do so after the Recess.&rdquo;  The Recess came and then the by-election came along, and I was engaged in something more important; but, after the by-election, I tabled a question to the Minister on the matter asking who had been appointed and what were the qualifications for the position.  I got an unsatisfactory reply and then raised the <Col N="2569" /> matter on the adjournment.  I was not interested in Miss Brett or Mr. Campbell, but, judging all the candidates, I felt that Miss Brett was the most suitable and most deserving and, with your permission, Sir, I raised the matter on the adjournment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do it as briefly as possible.  I had this matter raised in the House and debated on 14th December last.  I got the usual reply from the Minister.  There was nothing more about that until Deputy Blowick brought up the appointment of a postman in Hollymount.  In reply to Deputy Blowick, the Minister made the following statement, as reported in volume 99, number 11, columns 13, 15, 16 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Now, I do not mind representations being made to me by Deputies direct or letters being written to me. I think it is perfectly right for them to do so, just as in the case of Deputy Cafferky when he wrote to me making strong recommendations, in connection with Charlestown Post Office, that I should appoint Mr. Campbell instead of Miss Brett; but I strongly deprecate Deputy Blowick going to the local postmaster and making representations to him.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is taken from the unrevised report.  On that particular evening, at the closing of the Dáil, as the Minister will recollect, he was leaving the House when I denied that I made representations, because I took the Minister to say Miss Campbell and so did <Col N="2570" /> those in the Public Gallery.  I could not see what connection Miss Campbell had with the appointment in Hollymount. I could not understand how I could be drawn into something which only concerned Deputy Blowick.</P>
    <P>I took it that the Minister referred to Miss Campbell instead of Mr. Campbell, and, therefore, I denied that I made representations on behalf of Miss Campbell.  The following day the Press published this matter about Miss Campbell and my denial of what happened.  On the following Friday the Minister came along with a correction of the mistake, at the same time going into the files&mdash;the last thing a Minister of State should do&mdash; and out of the files taking my confidential letter to him recommending, or not recommending, a man for that particular post who asked me to do so and publishing this letter for the purpose of trying to make me look a liar before the public and this House.  Can you imagine that I would stand up and deny something that the Minister knew when I knew he had on his files a letter from me dated February, 1945? Nobody would do such a thing except an idiot or a fool.  Yet the Minister deliberately quoted from the unrevised Official Report, which you know, Sir, is not allowed according to the Standing Orders, in order to score off me and to make the people of Charlestown, and Miss Brett in particular, believe that I was a double-crosser and a double-dealer and a dishonest representative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that a Deputy in my absence should be allowed to slander and blackguard me?  Because I was not here for the Budget statement, he came to the conclusion that I was too cowardly to come before the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and explain my attitude on this occasion and that I remained away from the House.  I think I am entitled to vindicate myself.  Yesterday I was engaged on business at the request of my Party and doing my duty to the people that I represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure this House that that type of misrepresentation will meet <Col N="2572" /> with very little success in my county. It has met with some success in the past, but we have very ably exposed it and dealt with it.  I think the reply on the 4th December which brought this gentleman into this House should be sufficient answer to those who now try to misrepresent and misconstrue anything said here or elsewhere for the purpose of gaining a few miserable votes in their constituency and strengthening their position there. That is all I have to say in relation to that issue.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that future appointments should be considered more carefully.  If we are to have decent service, efficiency and honesty in the post offices and the sub-post offices, the Minister must be careful of the type of individual he appoints and the qualifications and ability of that individual.  More than a year ago I was requested by the Swinford Parish Council, together with other Deputies, I assume, to write to the Minister and recommend that the Swinford post office should be made a salaried post office.  That council represents people of all creeds and classes and politics.  I made the necessary representations and got an acknowledgment from the Minister telling me that the matter was being considered or something to that effect.  Due to the representations made by me, and I assume by other Deputies, because the council gave me to understand that they had written to all the Deputies, and I am sure they did their part as well as I did in making the necessary representations, the Minister had an investigation made as to how the Swinford post office was being run, with the result that it was found that efficiency was lacking in that post office.  Therefore the postmistress was asked to resign or she resigned.  If a lady is retired for being inefficient and no longer capable of carrying out the duties of her position, one would expect that the person who would take her place would be a responsible and efficient person.</P>
    <P>That would be the only conclusion to which one could come.  Before I go any further, I want to make it quite clear that the present occupant in charge of the sub-post office in Swinford is a very <Col N="2573" /> respectable man and a very decent citizen; but from the information at my disposal he has no qualifications for the particular position.  Now I also want to make it absolutely clear that there is a great difference between him as an individual and the man who has been appointed in Charlestown.  But it is the qualifications I am looking into, which count very much in a position of this kind.  How can you have an efficiently administered post office, or how can you have the business of a sub-office, such as Swinford, carried out in a proper manner unless you have a trained person in charge of it?  There are 11 postmen in it and yet the responsibility for the administration of this sub-post office is handed over to a man&mdash;a decent citizen and a most respectable man, but a man who has no qualifications for the post.  I say that is not right.  I am not at all surprised when I hear and read of things going wrong in sub-post offices, such as you have in Swinford, and elsewhere.  I think the parish council, when they recommended that this should be made a salaried office, were well aware of the necessity for doing that.  They were most dissatisfied when the Minister refused to take into consideration their recommendation.  I might mention that their recommendation was representative of all classes.  Because of past experience they knew that, no matter who was appointed, unless he was a postal servant fully trained sent down from Dublin and fully equipped for that particular business, it could not be run efficiently and in such a manner as to be of service to the people locally and to the State in general.</P>
    <P>There is not a great deal more that I have to say on this matter.  I referred to the daily delivery of letters and to the auxiliary postmen, particularly in relation to their conditions of service, their rates of wages, the tenure of their office, the necessity for some kind of pension after their long period of service.  I referred to the telephone communications.  Those are the most important points I wish to make.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Minister will take these matters into consideration. While I may have seemed to have criticised him somewhat adversely, <Col N="2574" /> nevertheless I appreciate the efforts he is making.  Even though I may have reason to quibble over what has happened, I am yet quite prepared to acknowledge the efforts the Minister is making to provide better services in every direction.  I hope that some of the £20,000, which he is allocating in his Estimate for daily deliveries, will go towards improving the Kilkelly postal service.  That may sound a foolish request coming from me after my most recent criticisms, but I do not think that the Minister will ignore me. I do not enter into controversy with the Minister on paper.  I prefer to come into this House and speak directly to the Minister here.</P>
    <P>I ask him now to take into consideration the thickly populated rural areas which have a heavy correspondence from Britain and America.  I think that the people in these areas deserve as much consideration as the people in the large towns and cities and I would remind the House that these people pay their share of rates and taxes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. R. Walsh Mr. R. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to keep the House very long.  I am very pleased to hear that the Minister proposes to extend the postal services and to give greater facilities with regard to telephones.  I would particularly draw his attention to the necessity for extending the telephone service to Mayo Abbey.  I do not believe it would cost very much to carry a wire from the corner of Ballyglass crossroads.  That is the only distance it would have to be brought in order to make contact with Mayo Abbey, which I might remark, is a prosperous area and a thriving centre of trade.  The people there are three or four miles from Balla and about six or seven miles from Claremorris; and they have no facilities of any kind at their disposal at the present time, with the exception of an ordinary post office.  I would also draw his attention to the necessity for establishing a sub-office at Crossard in the parish of Aughmore, outside Ballyhaunis. It is a very populous area and the people are badly in need of a service there.  I have been approached by people from different parties asking me to put before the Minister the necessity for establishing that post office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2575" /> I am not going to traverse word for word Deputy Cafferky's speech. Deputy Cafferky must think that we are all very credulous if he expects us to accept him as an &ldquo;innocent abroad.&rdquo;  I have been nearly 20 years a member of this House.  During that 20 years I venture to say that on an average I have written at least four or five letters every week recommending boys and girls for employment in the public service in every Department in the State.  I do not think there is anything corrupt or dishonest in doing that.  I have only done what every Deputy in this House, no matter to what Party he belongs, has done; and there is no Deputy in this House who would not be prepared to acknowledge that.  Sometimes&mdash;I do not know whether as a result of my recommendations or not&mdash;the applications have been successful.  Sometimes they have not&mdash;more often not.  Now on the first occasion on which Deputy Cafferky opened this matter about 12 months ago, I remember the whole Clann na Talmhan Party were gathered together here on the benches.  I made one or two remarks I think on that occasion and I was vigorously shouted down as being the greatest example of corruption in this State.  I made a recommendation in connection with the Charlestown Post Office.  I would be prepared to stand by the man who got that office as regards his character, integrity and honesty either in public or in private.  I am not going to enter into any long debate on the matter either in public or in private.  But I will say this&mdash;to say the least of it, it is certainly not a decent action to come in here to this House and throw out an implication, as Deputy Cafferky has done, which is open to serious misinterpretation by the general public outside in regard to that man's personal character. As far as I know, that man has nothing in his life to be ashamed of whatsoever.  To take advantage of a privileged position as a member of this House to throw out an implication which would not be made in public where the risk of law proceedings might be incurred is certainly not fair.</P>
    <P>I also made a recommendation for <Col N="2576" /> the post office in Swinford.  I am not ashamed of that.  I do not run away from it.  I have made recommendations to every Department in the State. I have made recommendations to private firms in Dublin.  I have gone from door to door trying to get employment from private employers in Dublin for my constituents.  I am not ashamed of that.  I do not see that there is anything corrupt or dishonest in it or anything of which any man need be ashamed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cafferky certainly has handsomely acknowledged the honesty and uprightness of the man who has got the Swinford Post Office but he still threw out that implication about the man who got the Charlestown office.  There was in his statement the implication that there was something wrong with this man, that there was something he had to be ashamed of.  I will not accuse Deputy Cafferky of inconsistency. He made a recommendation for that appointment also.  He was entitled to do it.  But there is no use in trying to make out that I am dishonest and guilty of corruption and nepotism but that Deputy Cafferky is not, when he does the very same thing. I do not intend to labour the point any further.  I would remind Deputy Cafferky of the custom, as far as I understand it, in the sub-offices within the State and if I am wrong I would ask the Minister to correct me.  Is it not the custom to allow a specified sum for a certain office, say, £400 per year for a certain sub-office in a small town?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That £400 is inclusive. It means that the person who is appointed as sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress will pay for all the assistance he requires and will pay for running expenses out of that £400.  Is not that the custom and the practice of the Post Office?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is the custom. I do not say that it is a good custom. I agree with Deputy Cafferky in that. I do not think it is a good custom.  I would go further and say that sub-postmasters <Col N="2577" /> and sub-postmistresses are very poorly paid and that for such a responsible position the return to them is very bad.  When a certain percentage of them go wrong and act dishonestly&mdash;and a very small percentage, when all is said and done&mdash;in one sense, it is hard to blame them because the temptation is there.  I say straight out that I believe they are very poorly paid.  Deputy Cafferky referred to dishonesty on the part of two or three postmen in County Mayo.  I am going on memory, but I think one of them was an established postman, that he was not an auxiliary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">

    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. R. Walsh Mr. R. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not always follow that the man who is the better paid and who has the more secure position, is the more honest man.  I would say, in answer to another attack that was made here about the appointment of an auxiliary postman, that I do not think even Deputy Blowick, who knows of it, will say that there was anything wrong with the character of the young man concerned, or that he will accuse him of misconduct or dishonesty.  I do not want to traverse line by line the speech made here by Deputy Cafferky. There may have been rough things said to Deputy Cafferky in return for that speech but he will remember that I did not pay very much attention to it either inside or outside the House.  On the occasion that he made that famous speech, I think the one thing I said was that I stood over everything I had done in regard to Charlestown Post Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I still do that and I am not ashamed or afraid of anything I have said or done in connection with it.  I do not retract.  I do not apologise for anything I have done in regard to it.  I think Deputy Cafferky will admit that he drew on himself a great deal of the attack and that he has no reason to complain.  When you hit you are going to be hit back.  I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the matters I have put before him regarding the telephone in Mayo Abbey and the establishment of a sub-office in Crossard outside Ballyhaunis.  I would <Col N="2578" /> ask him, if I have made any mis-statement regarding the custom that prevails as to the payment of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses, to correct me.</P>

      <P>I have on two or three occasions made overtures to the Minister and I have always been received nicely and most of the requests were acceded to.  I suppose they were not unreasonable.  There is one exception, the fly in the ointment, that is in connection with the Kilmoyler Post Office.  We have heard a great deal about Mayo and many other centres. Kilmoyler is in the heart of the Golden Vale, County Tipperary.  I have made overtures to you.  You have all the data.  We consider that we have a grievance.  There are five miles of country; there is a big population, quite a number of houses and there are only three deliveries in the week.  You have all the data.  I hope you will look into it very closely.</P>

      <P>Before the interval I dealt with some particular features of the Budget.  I had not referred to the section of the Budget giving substantial and welcome and overdue relief to agricultural land, agricultural land wholly.  I welcome the substantial relief that is given to it in the Budget.  At the same time, I think I am entitled to say that I would welcome far more the day when this Government and its Ministers would reach a degree of national honesty when we are dealing with public matters and public finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blowick, leader of the Clann <Col N="2580" /> na Talmhan Party, has already referred to the way the proposals from that Party regarding derating were received by the Government.  I think on half a dozen occasions this question of derating agricultural land, either wholly or to a great extent, was raised by motion in this House.  On every occasion the Minister, or Ministers, with all the available figures, with all the knowledge and all the facts available only to a Government, gave us to believe that such a proposal would mean either national bankruptcy or destitution of the very poor by the weight of taxes it would be necessary to impose on the necessaries of life.</P>
    <P>I might refer to one occasion some years ago when, speaking as the authorised mouthpiece of this Party in the City of Limerick on a Saturday afternoon, I announced that part of the plan and the programme agreed on would be the development of rural electrification, the granting of children's allowances and the derating of land up to a very substantial amount. The Tánaiste was speaking in Limerick the following night.  He had the advantage of having read my speech.  He referred to me as a political and financial lunatic who, if he had his way in this country, would destitute and pauperise every individual. It looks as if that form of lunacy was infectious and perhaps it should be included in the Public Health Act; it might lead to compulsory isolation and prohibition of transport facilities, because it appears to be taking.</P>
    <P>The measure of success of the present Government in any direction can be gauged by the extent to which they have followed the programmes which they previously denounced.  I begin to feel that everybody speaking on behalf of any of the Opposition Parties here is in the position of a schoolmaster, trying to teach sense to very dull, backward scholars, who take years to learn, but who are so soft-minded that, when they have learned, they believe they have made a discovery, and all these discoveries that are the result of years of hard hammering and teaching are featured <Col N="2581" /> as miraculous by a brilliant group of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The one feature of this Budget that I welcome more than any other, is this concession with regard to agricultural land.  In that particular concession I think there is a definite step taken towards lightening overhead charges and there is a gesture of recognition for very great efforts consistently made over the past few years.  I hope never again will we hear the kind of twaddle that we heard in the past from the Minister for Finance, when reliefs for agriculture or any other industry were advocated, that if you relieve an industry like agriculture, you will be relieving the big fellow in money to a greater extent than you will be relieving the little fellow.</P>
    <P>I could never understand why that absolutely unsound and nonsensical argument was always used when any relief for agriculture was advocated in this country, and no such argument was advanced when we were giving protection and reliefs to various industries. In the industrial field one never cared whether the owner was a millionaire or a man just beginning without capital, but in the matter of agriculture the propagandists always got up and said: &ldquo;Look at what Lord so-and-so is going to get by way of financial relief under this measure.&rdquo;  It was always twaddle, it was always dishonest, it was always insincere.  I hope that régime of twaddle, dishonesty and insincerity has closed with this particular document which we have before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago a distinguished citizen of this country invented a machine for the consumption of turf. I am not quite sure what the name of it was, but I think it was called the &ldquo;Red-Top Stove&rdquo;.  One of the features of this stove was that it kept the burning turf, the red turf, on the top and the fresh or raw turf was put in at the bottom.  There is a striking similarity between this Budget statement and that invention.  We have the desirable things, the things that appear to be popular, paraded very obviously before the public gaze, while the undesirable features are hidden away at the bottom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2582" /> The Budget statement this year differs considerably from Budget statements in the past.  I am not going to join in the tributes paid to the Minister as to the manner in which he presented his Budget statement.  I fear if I were to do so I would be casting an undeserved slur on the highest citizen of this State, who was the Minister's predecessor.  I think that to the general public it does not matter very much what way the Budget statement is presented.  What matters are the things which it contains and the things which it leaves out.</P>
    <P>The first fundamental fact that has to be faced in regard to this Budget is that it increases the total burden of taxation which is to be collected from the taxpayers as compared with last year.  Having regard to the fact that the emergency is over, and that we hope to be facing tranquil conditions, taxpayers had reason to hope that their burden would be lower.  Instead of a reduction we have a substantial increase in total taxation.  It is true that we have some reduction in the taxation of various items, but the net burden imposed on the community generally will, it is estimated, be higher than it was last year.</P>
    <P>It is undesirable that the Minister and the Government should take an unfair advantage of the emergency conditions through which we have passed.  These emergency conditions enabled the Government to increase income-tax and various other duties. Now that conditions and trade generally are improving the Government hopes to raise substantial revenue as a result of the increased rates of taxation that were imposed during that period. That is unfair and unjust to the general community.  There is no reason for maintaining as high a burden of taxation during the coming year as was imposed during the years of the emergency when, owing to prevailing conditions, costs in Government Departments as well as the cost of national defence were substantially inflated.  We know that emergency conditions seriously inflated the cost of running various Departments, and that special services had to be provided to meet the abnormal conditions.  The need for <Col N="2583" /> such services has passed and the taxpayers had a right to hope for a much more substantial reduction in the burdens that the Budget provides.</P>
    <P>Even if the Minister could not by any exercise of energy or imagination find a means of reducing the burden of taxation and expenditure for the coming year, there are certain services which should not be met out of current taxation.  One of these services, which was very deserving, will not recur we hope, in the future.  I refer to the provision of £3,000,000 for relief in Europe.  That should be financed by borrowing, if we are justified in financing any service by borrowing.  The taxpaper is called upon to provide a small relief for the fuel consumer, 10/- per ton on turf.  With the exercise of proper supervision, or alternatively with the opening up of more facilities for competition and private enterprise it should be possible to reduce the cost of turf much more than the 10/- which the taxpayer is called upon to provide. I think the cost could have been reduced by considerably more than 10/-. Even if the taxpayers are now called upon to make up the 10/- it should be accompanied by a reasonable effort so that in the handling and hauling of turf there will be a substantial saving during the coming year.</P>
    <P>During the emergency many things contributed to cost in the transport of turf.  There was a shortage of lorries, there was a more severe shortage of petrol than now exists, and a shortage of tyres.  All these were factors which added to the cost of transport.  New lorries are now available, and there should be greater facilities for people to get into the transport of turf than was the case during the emergency. There is no reason why the cost of turf should not be considerably reduced without imposing any additional burden on the taxpaying community. There is provision in the Budget for a substantial reduction in the duty on petrol.  Have we any assurance from the Government that the reduction will be passed on to consumers?  As far as the haulage of goods is concerned we know that the transport service is in the hands of a monopoly.  Have we <Col N="2584" /> any assurance that this monopoly will pass on any of the full reductions in the cost of petrol in order to enable ordinary citizens to get goods at cheaper rates or to provide cheaper travel than is the case now?</P>
    <P>I do not think we should compliment the Minister on the manner in which a reduction of income-tax has been brought about.  In reducing the burden of income-tax special provision should be made for poorer sections of the community which have to bear the heaviest burdens.  In addition, special consideration should be given to the income-tax payer who is prepared to put the relief he obtains in the Budget into industry.  The Minister for Finance should be able to devise a scheme by which additional relief should be granted in respect to those with families and dependents.  He should also be able to devise a scheme under which a producer who is genuinely adding to the wealth of the country should get a greater reduction than the person who simply puts the advantage he derives into his pocket.  That is the angle from which this question of relief of direct taxation should be approached.</P>
    <P>As a member of this Farmers' Party, I must express satisfaction that the Minister has made an attempt to meet the oft-repeated demand for relief from the burden of rates on agricultural land.  It is only a short time since this Party put down a motion demanding the relief of rates on agricultural land.  We demanded that the first £20 of each agricultural holding should be completely derated and that a further £15 should be derated in respect of every worker or dependent employed on that holding.  That demand was met with scorn and ridicule by the Minister who marshalled his braves into the Division Lobby to defeat it.  He felt so strong in his opposition to the relief of rates on agricultural land at that time that he used these words, at column 550 of the Official Debates of 6th February last:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If I had £2,000,000, I would not give one shilling under any circumstances for the relief of rates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2585" /> It is interesting to speculate on the processes by which the Minister has been converted to the necessity for relieving rates during the past couple of months.  It may be that, having reviewed the position carefully, he has come to the conclusion honestly that this Party was wise in demanding that relief last February.  It may be, on the other hand, that political expendiency has influenced him.  He may think perhaps that this Party is growing in strength, and, realising the result of the by-election in Mayo, he may have come to the conclusion that the farming community are revolting against the excessive burdens of direct taxation imposed upon them; but I am not going to throw my hat in the air and cheer the Minister for this relief he has given.  I think I should rather sympathise with him.  It is a humiliating thing for any man to have to eat his own words and then endeavour to digest them, and I am afraid the Minister must be suffering from mental indigestion at present when he remembers how strongly and vigorously he opposed our proposal for the relief of rates on agricultural land only last February.</P>
    <P>I realise that so long as the present Government is in power, we must look their gifts very carefully in the face. We must accept any concession made to agriculture with very grave suspicion. We know that, back in 1933, we had the halving of the annuities, and we know that that halving of the annuities was more than off-set by the very substantial increase in rates which occurred over the succeeding years. We feel certain that this relief of £1,000,000 for rates on agricultural land may be off-set during the coming year by a very substantial increase in the burdens which will be thrown on the ratepayers during the coming year. We know that legislation is going through at present which will have the effect of very considerably increasing the burden of rates, and I am not sure if, in the two Bills going through, there are not the potentialities of an increase of almost the amount being provided in the Budget in the way of relief.  I believe there will be a further demand of £1,000,000 from the ratepayers <Col N="2586" /> during the coming year, so that this gift must be taken with a certain amount of reserve.</P>
    <P>This whole question of the relationship between the central Exchequer and county council finances must be reviewed, because the tendency at present is to shift over additional burdens from the central Exchequer to the local authorities, and nobody has apparently endeavoured to decide what are local services and what are national services.  Sooner or later, there must be some guiding principle in this respect.  I think the time has come when, instead of throwing little sops of this kind to the ratepayers from time to time when agitation becomes strong, there ought to be some system by which a statutory limit would be fixed to the burden of rates which may be levied on property. Otherwise, we shall have this continual increase in the burden, because it is naturally easier for the central Government to pass burdens over to the local rates than to bear them itself, and this may become even more apparent if the in-flow of revenue into the national Exchequer becomes less than it is at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister, while making these concessions to agriculture, went a long distance out of his way to refer to the prosperity of the agricultural industry, to the amount of wealth and profit which had accrued to the industry during the period of the emergency.  It is time that Ministers gave up talking in general terms about this matter, and it is time they got down to facts and figures.  Again and again in this House, demands have been made upon the Government to set up some sort of machinery for finding out accurately what are the costs of production in agriculture and thus satisfy themselves and the general community as to whether farmers are making a profit or not; but the Government have always side-stepped and evaded that demand. They know that, if they were to set up such machinery, they would find it proved beyond all question that the average profits in the agricultural industry are much lower than they claim them to be and that is why they refuse <Col N="2587" /> to meet this fair and reasonable demand.</P>
    <P>It ought to be realised and clearly recognised that you cannot do justice to agriculture either in the matter of relief from the burdens of costs or overhead charges, such as rates, unless you have clearly ascertained what is the margin of profit in agriculture.  There is no use in giving a concession like this and saying, at the same time, that the farmers do not deserve it, that they are prosperous and were never more prosperous.  Let us get the figures.  An energetic Cork professor, and Cork people are very energetic, went into the figures of costings during what is considered the last normal year and he found that the profits in agriculture were exceptionally low.</P>
    <P>If a private individual could ascertain costings at that time, what is to prevent the State, with all the machinery at its disposal, from ascertaining the costings at present?  Until you ascertain the costings accurately, you cannot definitely lay down what is a fair price for agricultural produce, or what is a fair burden of direct taxation to place on the industry.  As I say, the Government have persistently evaded that demand and refused to recognise it.  It is possible that, just as they have been converted to the idea of relief of rates on agricultural land, they may eventually be converted to the idea of accurately ascertaining costings in agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the question of emigration.  In my opinion, he gave a figure which completely underestimated the extent of this problem and the number of people who are being driven from this country to find employment in Great Britain.  This matter was referred to in the British House of Commons a short time ago and the figure of 250,000 Irishmen working in Great Britain was mentioned. The Minister says that there are only 78,000 of our people so employed. I think the Minister has deliberately underestimated the number. But, whatever it is, it represents a very serious problem.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister is facing up to the gravity of this problem fully.  It is very nice of the Minister, after being 14 years in office, to start out like a young crusader and say that he is going to develop industry, to reclaim land, and do this, that and the other thing.  That may be good electioneering stuff.  In many ways, this Budget speech was more of an election speech than a Budget statement.  Possibly it may have been intended as an election speech.  We do not know that.  That is a secret which reposes in the brain of the Taoiseach.  But I think the Minister will not deceive anybody by asserting that he is a young crusader going to open up a new prospect, to increase employment, to reduce emigration, and all these fine things.  He has 14 years of office behind him.  He has had 14 years in which to do all these things <Col N="2589" /> and he has failed.  I think he is not going to impose on the public by suggesting that he can do all these things now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the community are old enough to size up the value of such promises in the light of their experience over the past 14 years. There are not many Governments in Europe or in the world to-day that have been in office as long as the present Government here.  There are not many Governments in the world at present that have such a disastrous record of failure behind them as the present Government here; failure to improve the agricultural industry, failure to provide for the development of our resources, failure to improve the area of arable land by drainage and reclamation, failure to provide for a decent national scheme of afforestation.  All these failures stare the Government in the face.  They ask the people to forget their record, to forget about their failures and to look upon them as a young Government starting out now after the emergency with a future before them and going to redeem the economic condition of our State.  That will not deceive anybody. I think that no Government has been given a greater opportunity to deliver the goods than the present Government and that they have failed ignominiously.</P>
      <P>If we want to have increased prosperity here, we must ensure that production is increased.  What have the Government done to increase agricultural or industrial production?  Very little.  There have been some developments in certain lines, but they have been offset by deterioration in other lines.  Some branches of the agricultural industry have improved and expanded, but other branches of the industry have declined to a disastrous extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum total of this whole matter is that this small country, with its small population and its extensive undeveloped resources, is unable to support its own population here.  Now we have had it stated in the British House <Col N="2590" /> of Commons recently that Irish workers over there should be sent back to this country or, alternatively, sent down the mines.  That position, if it materialises, is from the national point of view, a most humiliating one; and any Irish Government, worthy of those who suffered and died to make this country free, should be able to stand up and say to those Irish citizens in Britain: &ldquo;We can provide you here in Ireland with a decent standard of living and there is no necessity for you to be presented with the alternative of going down to the most degrading and hardest of all manual labour.&rdquo;  We should be able to call those citizens home and provide them with ample opportunity of earning a decent independent living here in this State.  But the Government through sheer laziness, through sheer want of initiative, and through a desire for nothing else, except to hang on to office at any cost, without any regard for what is best for the country as a whole&mdash;the Government, I say, has failed to solve the economic problems which face our people and, having failed, we are in the humiliating position of having a substantial number of our people&mdash;the cream of our manhood and womanhood &mdash;dependent for a living on the opportunities offered to them in adjoining States.</P>
    <P>I think that, just as the Minister has learned a little from this Party in regard to relief of rates on agricultural land, he ought to be able to learn a little more and to learn that the problem of providing work for our people here in Ireland is the first and most fundamental duty of the Government. It ought to be possible&mdash;and I maintain that it is possible&mdash;to provide employment for all our adult population without having to resort to either a socialistic or a nationalistic State.  I think, if private enterprise is given a favourable opportunity, and if those who are honestly endeavouring to produce the very maximum, whether in field or in factory, are given reasonable opportunity and reasonable encouragement, we can have the increased production which is so desirable.  In addition to that it is the duty of the Government to embark on such schemes as it may be impossible for <Col N="2591" /> private enterprise to undertake, such as the reclamation of land, arterial drainage, afforestation and housing. Those are things which private enterprise, alone and unaided, cannot undertake. But, in the management of agricultural industry and in the management of our manufacturing industry, the private individual, given reasonable encouragement and fair play, can deliver the goods and deliver them much more effectively than the Government. It is, therefore, time that a serious effort was made to reduce the total burden of taxation on the community. The Minister is inclined, and has from time to time, criticised this Party for demanding that there should be a closer supervision exercised over national expenditure.  I think, just as he accepted the principle of our motion for the relief of rates on land, he may eventually accept the principle of the motion put down by this Party&mdash;which he rejected&mdash;demanding that there should be a closer inquiry and a closer supervision over all branches of national expenditure.  I think that, since he has found it possible to eat and digest his own words in regard to derating, he may be able to eat and, possibly, digest his own words in regard to the setting up of an economy commission to ensure that no public money will be wasted.</P>

      <P>I would like to set some Deputies here in the House a little right in their ideas, but I think that that is impossible.  I doubt if it is possible. With regard to Deputy Cogan's statement that the Government, in its 14 years of office, has had plenty of time to do all the things which Deputy Cogan urged on them, I would like to remind the Deputy that from 1933 to 1939 this country was fighting an economic war, during the progress of which 40 per cent. of our population, misled by the advice given to them by the Opposition Parties in this House, stabbed the Government in the back and made no effort of any kind to fight that war.  With regard to the years 1939 to 1945, I would remind the Deputy that those years were completely abnormal, due to circumstances over which we had no control.  The net <Col N="2592" /> result is that the only normal year of office which this Government enjoyed was the year 1938.  From 1939 to 1945 we were passing through a period of grave emergency.  During those 14 years the Government won six general elections.  The Deputy should speak the truth.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins spoke about the teaching of backward scholars and said that it was due to the acceptance of Opposition policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the policy advocated by Deputy O'Higgins in the years 1939 and 1940 were put into operation I wonder how much of this little country would be left to-day.  What is the use in talking tripe?  The Government had to make every endeavour to induce the agricultural population of this country to grow wheat in order to produce bread for our people in the emergency through which we have just passed. The Government had to do that in the teeth of Opposition Deputies in this House who were out at the crossroads advising the people that they could not grow wheat.</P>

      <P>It is not a lie and the Deputy knows that it is not a lie.  The next time I speak here in this House I will produce speeches from the Opposition Benches to prove that.  It was not on account of these speeches that Deputy Dillon was put out of the Party.  Deputy Hughes sat there when Deputy Dillon was making those speeches, side-by-side with him on the front bench.  For the first two years of this emergency Deputy Hughes spent his time endeavouring to make a case before this House for the farmer who refused to till his land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the relief in rates we require no advice from any Party in connection with our actions or attitude on that matter.  I remember when the Fine Gael Party were in office how rigidly they opposed a motion of mine for £1,000,000 for derating on agricultural land.  You were Cumann na nGaedheal at that time.  You are gone in the storm now.  Neither did we want any advice as to the most equitable <Col N="2593" /> distribution of the relief that was being given in rates.  Prior to this Party coming into office the relief was being given on a flat rate.  There was no special relief for the smallholder of £20 valuation and under.  There was no differentiation between the man who was employing labour on the land and the man who had only a dog on the land.  We did not wait for the Farmers' Party to come in here and tell us all about these things.  They were carried out by the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <P>The relief in rates given to farmers under £20 valuation and the relief in rates given per man employed for 12 months has been in operation here.  If the Deputy knew anything at all about it he would know it did not need any motion on the Order Paper by any Deputy to get that done. As far as the complaint that has been made as to the enormity of the Budget is concerned, I have here a couple of sheets containing Private Members' motions.  I go back 12 months.  If Private Members' motions put down by Opposition Parties in this House for the past 12 months were put into operation by the Government our bill would not be £52,000,000, it would be £152,000,000.  Were Deputies honest in their proposals or were they humbugging? Did they consider whether the people could afford to pay, or did they not?  Where is the use of complaining of increased taxation and at the same time advocating schemes that would increase the bill?  The majority of the proposals brought in by this Government were received here with acclamation. Every social service brought in by the Government which added <Col N="2594" /> millions to this bill was received here with acclamation and if we were to carry out the other proposals of Deputies, made in Private Members' motions, it would mean £100,000,000 more.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan complains about the increase in local taxation and blames the Government for that increase. There were some special provisions brought in here from time to time to help out the agricultural community. One of them was the rural improvements scheme, by which any two farmers living along a boreen, by paying 25 per cent. of the cost of getting that boreen repaired could get it done by the State, the State contributing 75 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Farmers' Party were so wise that they put down a motion under the names of two of their members, Deputies Beirne and Donnellan, that Section 25 of the Local Government Act of 1925 be amended to enable the local authorities to take over that boreen and keep it in repair, at the expense of the rates.  They were not satisfied to take a Government grant of 75 per cent.; they wanted it thrown on the ratepayers.  We have a complaint from a Deputy of one Party about the anxiety of the Government to increase the rates, to throw more burdens on the local authorities, and on the other hand you find two Deputies of the same Party putting down for solemn discussion in the Dáil, a motion of that description, and the Party is not so big that they would not know what their members were doing.  As I have said, that is one of the very definite reasons why this Party will be here for a long time because there is nothing to take their place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The less the Deputy says about Mayo to-day, the better.  I do not want to get into any more tangles with him.  We will have another day for that.  I shall now come <Col N="2595" /> to the Budget and examine it as it stands.  When I first learned that the present Minister was being made Minister for Finance, I said to some of my farmer friends: &ldquo;Thank God, there is somebody there who knows something about agriculture now.&rdquo;  I think the Minister's proposals here for the relief of rates are good and sound, and at least show that he is definitely inclined to help out the agricultural community.  The 10/- a ton relief on turf is also a great help.  I have here a little budget made out by one farm labourer showing that he pays 6/6 a week for turf.  That is a rather heavy bill.  I suggest, and I am with Deputy Cogan in this, that now that turf seems to have come to stay, very definite steps should be taken to cut through the overhead charges.  Some of these things were brought to my notice and I dealt with them in the Dáil some years ago, in 1942 or 1943.</P>
      <P>Something definite will have to be done so that the fuel bill of this country will not go beyond all bounds. The Minister, in so far as he had the money available, has gone a long way to relieve the matter.  But, when I hear Deputy Norton complaining about teachers and Deputy O'Higgins complaining about fixed salaries, I wonder where we come in.  By &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean the 495,000 people who are earning a livelihood on the land of this country by producing food for the people of this country.  These 495,000 people are working at a wage fixed by Government which is £36 per annum less than the rise in salary that was offered to the national teachers a few months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my duty to give the facts as I see and know them.  I stated here that the Minister had done pretty well with the money placed at his disposal for distribution.  I will deal with the position as I see it of the 495,000 workers on the land whose income is, roughly, about £2 per week. I do not care whether they are farmers, farmers' sons or farm labourers, but when I hear people talking about fixed salaries and rises in salaries for teachers, I have to think first of the people who spent the last six years working, not the number of hours a week that the teacher works, but something like 70 or 80 hours a week, endeavouring to provide food for the nation.  It is a rather sad commentary that that is the farmers' present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We got two guarantees here.  We got a guarantee that we would have fixed prices for agricultural products and, in addition to that, we got a guarantee from the Minister for Agriculture last year that a costings <Col N="2598" /> tribunal for fixing prices would be set up.  The Minister desires us to pass on to labour the relief that he is giving in this Budget of £6 10s. 0d. per agricultural worker.  We certainly will. The big reason for the flight from the land, the big reason for emigration, the big reason why you have a high unemployment figure on the one side and nobody to work the land on the other is an evil that will have to be wiped out and that will have to be dealt with immediately.</P>
    <P>I can see no reason for any differentiation as between one industry and another.  We are all Irish industrialists, whether we are working in the factory or on the land, and we demand on behalf of the agricultural community equal treatment with other industrialists&mdash;in other words, cost of production, plus profits, the same as every industrialist gets.  If the present condition of affairs is allowed to continue much longer, there will not be food enough for our people.  You have the man who can stop work at 12 o'clock on Saturday and go back on Monday morning.  He will not work until 6 o'clock on Saturday evening and give four or five hours milking cattle and feeding them on Sunday, yet his wage is one and a half times as high as the wage of the man who has to work on Sunday.</P>
    <P>That is why I suggested here a few weeks ago that a wage should be fixed for the agricultural labourer equal to the wage of his brother worker in the towns.  I suggest a costings tribunal should be set up to fix the price of agricultural produce on this basis.  We hear any amount of fine talk from professors and others about going back to the land and we hear a lot of talk about the flight from the land.  Does any sane man think that anybody with common sense will settle down to the drudgery&mdash;I can call it nothing else&mdash;of ordinary farming life with the knowledge that if he gets married and has five or six children he will have to rear that family on £36 a year less than the rise that was offered to the national school teachers and that they refused to take?</P>
    <P>It is my duty as representing a rural constituency on behalf of the agricultural community, both farmers <Col N="2599" /> and labourers, to put up that case and to ask that the guarantee given in this House by a previous Minister for Finance and the guarantee given by the Minister for Agriculture on the Agricultural Estimate last year be now put into full operation.</P>
    <P>Why should we have on the one hand an industrialist able to go before a prices tribunal with his case and get the costs of production plus a profit? Why should another industrialist who produces food for this nation be refused that right?  He has to accept figures which are prepared in many cases by men who never saw the outside of an office in their lifetime and know nothing whatever about agricultural conditions. I went to the show to-day; what did I see?  I saw farmers tumbling over one another looking at labour-saving machinery to take the place of men on the land.  I could mechanise my farm for £5,000.  I wonder when I had done so and put up a case would I get 6 per cent. profit on my capital expenditure which industrialists are allowed. This rushing away from the land is a problem that will have to be tackled. There is only one way to deal with it and that is by making conditions on the land as good for the agricultural community as conditions in industry. Is there any reason why farmers should not be entitled to the cost of production plus a profit?  Is there any reason why the ordinary agricultural community, taking them all in all, are not entitled to the same fair play and conditions as industrialists?  I maintain that the ordinary farm worker is at least as skilled as any fitter or engineer in a factory.  If he is to comply with modern farm work he has to be an engineer, he has to know all about soil and he has to be a vet.  I am not going to mention all the other things he has to be.  But we are faced with a condition of affairs that, on the one hand, we have lines of people signing on at the labour exchange looking for work and, on the other hand, a dearth of workers on the land.  There must be a reason for that state of affairs.  I am giving what I consider to be the reason and this is the time to remedy it.  This is the time when <Col N="2600" /> we had very good hope from the statement made by the Minister for Agriculture. It is time that the agricultural community knew their position, and that we had an end to the conditions to which I referred.  It is a condition of affairs with which we could not carry on or leave this country in a sound position.  I should like to know from the Minister when he is concluding if the agricultural community will be put on the same basis as industrialists. Are they going to get the cost of production?  They are not going to take costings or figures prepared by people who know nothing whatever about their industry.</P>
    <P>Glad as I am to see a reduction of one penny per pound in the price of sugar I cannot help thinking that it is nearly four years since the price of beet was fixed.  Since then there has been an increase of at least 25 per cent. in the cost of farm machinery and in the wearing parts of that machinery.  There has been in addition a pretty steep increase in the cost of artificial manure, and an increase by law of between 7/- and 9/- per week in agricultural wages.  The price that farmers get for beet despite these facts remains the same as it was four years ago, 80/- per ton.  I challenge any Deputy to produce any industrialist who went before any tribunal with these figures to say that there would not be an increase in the price. I am looking for justice for the agricultural community.  I am looking to the Government for the same conditions for our biggest industries, as have been given to the smaller ones. I am proud to know that my appeal will not fall upon deaf ears, that in our present Minister for Finance we have a farmer who has knowledge of the matters that I have referred to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to certain concessions which the Minister has made to mining enterprise for the purpose of encouraging the extension of mines and the undertaking of scientific research in industry.  It is true that the Minister asks Deputies to await a fuller statement on the Finance Bill but I am long enough a member of the House to know very well that <Col N="2601" /> when a Bill takes shape it is very hard to have it amended subsequently, especially a Finance Bill.  I know that, unless a case is made for adequate concessions beforehand, it is very unlikely that they will be given once the Finance Bill has taken shape.  I am allowing first for the smallness of the amount that is being provided and I would be glad if the Minister would explain what he means by this statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I may say now, however, in regard to mining that sums will rank for relief which are expended on the construction of works which are likely to be worth little or nothing when the mines have ceased to operate ...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Concessions have been made in other countries to mining enterprises&mdash;in fact, concessions have been made over a long period of years to mining companies in the U.S.A. and concessions were also made last year in a Bill introduced in the British Parliament to British mining enterprise&mdash;and I am very anxious to know if the Minister is prepared in the Finance Bill to extend identical concessions to mining enterprises in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested in one mining enterprise in my own constituency&mdash;Ben Bulbin Barytes.  It is a new enterprise which holds promise of a great future and it has succeeded in developing a big export trade.  Of course, the conditions during the emergency favoured that export trade, and, now that peace has been restored, conditions have altered and it is quite possible that this company will find itself confronted with serious competition in the years to come.  I assume, of course, that for perhaps a certain number of years&mdash;for five, six or even ten years there will be a market for the products of this company, but, at the end of that period, and progressively during all these years, competition will certainly and very definitely increase.  I want as far as possible to respect the Minister's wish not to press him too hard until the Finance Bill is introduced, but I am most anxious to know now whether &ldquo;construction works&rdquo; covers exploration and development, because the company in which I am interested <Col N="2602" /> spent a great deal of money&mdash;in fact it lost a great deal of money&mdash;on exploration and development.  Barytes apparently is a difficult mineral to mine. The seams of barytes are rather elusive, and, in order to establish contact with them, it was necessary to expend more money than it would be necessary to expend in the case of any other type of mineral, and, for that reason, the initial expenditure of this company was exceptionally heavy.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion&mdash;in fact, on two previous occasions&mdash;I pressed the case which this company had made on the Minister for Finance for special consideration, but the Minister's predecessor was adamant and refused to make any concession whatever.  I am glad the present Minister has taken a different view and has agreed to make some concession, at all events, however small.  The amount provided here for mining enterprise and scientific research is certainly very small.  Considering the number of mining enterprises in the country and considering also the importance of scientific research in the present circumstances of the country, £10,000 seems a very small amount, and I assume from the amount provided that the concession to be made to mining enterprises will be very slight indeed.</P>
    <P>In addition to the concessions the company are looking for in respect of exploration and development, they are looking for concessions in respect of the principal asset, the mine itself, which, undoubtedly, is a wasting asset.  Mines in every country in the world are regarded as wasting assets and it is recognisel by the Governments of these countries in their taxation codes that these enterprises are entitled to special consideration, because of the nature and character of these enterprises.  This company is looking for nothing more than similar treatment to that meted out to mining enterprises in all other countries in the world, and, in view of the fact that we have so few mining enterprises in this country and the fact that it is the desire of the Government to develop these mines to their utmost capacity, I maintain that it is the duty of the Government to make the utmost possible concessions to these enterprises for the <Col N="2603" /> purpose of encouraging the fullest possible development.</P>
    <P>The pay roll of the enterprise in which I am interested amounts to £20,000 per year and they expect in a very short time to have an output of 20,000 tons per year.  Of that, there is a market for only about 2,000 tons in this country, the rest being exported, and the Minister will realise perfectly well the importance and value of the money realised for the minerals sold on the export markets.  I ask the Minister, therefore, if he would be good enough to give me some further explanation of the meaning of the words he used in his statement.  What exactly do the words &ldquo;construction works&rdquo; cover?  Do they include exploration and development, and is he prepared to make any concession at all to the mine itself, in the form of making provision and making allowance for wasting assets?</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry made one very important point in connection with the difficulty of inducing people to remain on the land.  It is the desire of the Minister, as it was the desire of his predecessor and as it is the desire of every member of the Government, to increase production, because he knows that, in the absence of increased production, it is impossible to continue the present scale of taxation, and that it is imperative, for the sake of the future of this country, that production not only in agriculture but in industry should be increased, and increased very substantially, that in fact there should be a progressive rate of increase in production in both industry and agriculture. But I agree with Deputy Corry, although I do not agree with very much else he said, about the difficulty of keeping people on the land at present. It is certainly a problem which the Government will have to face up to.</P>
    <P>It is recognised by everybody who is really interested in the welfare and progress of this country that there is a desire, among our young people especially, to get away from the land. There is, admittedly, a flight from the land, especially on the part of the young people, and that tendency is becoming more and more apparent with the progress of the years.  It is due to <Col N="2604" /> a variety of causes.  Perhaps during the emergency it was due to the talk which was so general about the high wages prevailing in Great Britain.  It is admitted also that it is due to high taxation and high rates prevalent in this country at the moment.  It is due, perhaps, to the hard work on the land and, perhaps, to some extent, to the loneliness of country life.  But whatever the real factors are, there is, admittedly, a problem there which must be tackled by the Government and which must be investigated.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Corry also that a solution of this problem must be found if we are to preserve intact the fabric of our agricultural life.  We realise perfectly well that, for the sake of the country itself, for the sake of our nationality, the rural population must be preserved, because, if we lose our rural population, we lose something which is absolutely irreplaceable in the life of the country, so that I suggest to the Minister in all seriousness that he should set about an investigation of this problem before the disease spreads any further.  The seeds of the disease are there, and now is the time to prevent its spreading and becoming dangerously contagious.</P>
    <P>I said a moment ago that one of the probable factors operating in this direction is the very high scale of taxation which prevails.  Looking through the book issued by Government officials on national income and expenditure&mdash;and I certainly agree that the praise which the Minister has bestowed on them in his Budget statement is highly and richly deserved, because it is an admirable production which contains a lot of very useful information&mdash;I find that, between 1938 and 1945, expenditure increased by £21,000,000.  In other words, in the seven years, there was a progressive increase at the rate of £3,000,000 a year in our scale of expenditure.  During that period nobody can say the Government did not spend money liberally and generously&mdash;too liberally, in my opinion, and in the opinion of every member on these benches, for the future of the country, because, during those years, real income did not keep pace at all with outlay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2605" /> In 1938 the country spent £51,700,000 on central and local government, and in 1945 that expenditure had leaped to £72,600,000, an increase of £21,100,000 in the space of seven years.  The amount raised in local rates increased from £6,800,000 in 1938 to £8,200,000 in 1945, an increase approximately in rates alone of £1,400,000.</P>
    <P>In the present Budget the Minister proposes to provide £1,000,000 for the relief of agricultural rates.  But that relief is offset by certain charges which ratepayers will have to meet under the new Public Health Bill.  My recollection is that it is estimated that the cost of that Bill will be about £1,000,000, without taking into consideration the money which the Minister will have to provide for the relief of tuberculosis cases.  So that, as a matter of fact, that grant of £1,000,000 will be offset by the cost of the Public Health Bill when it comes into operation, which I presume will be before the Summer Recess.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Cogan referred to the fact that one of the features of the Fianna Fáil Administration has been that each year, or several times a year, they add a burden which should be borne by the Exchequer on to the local rates.  The result, of course, was that even before the time of the county managers it was absolutely impossible for local councils to exercise any real control over the rates because of the tendency of the Minister for Local Government to add on burdens which should be properly borne by the Exchequer on to the local rates.  I do not see how that tendency can be arrested.  So long as the present procedure continues, it appears to me almost inevitable that there will be an increase year by year in the rates, unless some hard and fast rule is made about what constitutes a charge on the local rates and what constitutes a charge on the Exchequer.  Even county managers at present are beginning to cry out about some of the charges placed on the local rates, which they maintain are not charges which should be properly borne by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I assume it would be the duty of the <Col N="2606" /> Minister for Finance to draw such a dividing line or at least to segregate these charges, and it is time the Minister for Finance did decide what moneys should be properly charged on the local rates and what moneys should be properly charged on the Exchequer.  It is unfair that this practice of transferring burdens which should belong to the Exchequer on to the local rates should continue.  I submit that if the practice does continue there will be an outcry in the different counties against the payment of rates altogether.  An increase during a period of seven years of £1,400,000 in rate charges is abnormal, even allowing for the emergency conditions.  If you analyse that increase, you will find that more than 2 per cent. of that is represented by charges which should not properly be borne by the rates at all.  I therefore suggest to the Minister in all seriousness that he should look into that aspect of local rating and that he should establish some kind of list showing the charges which should be properly borne on the rates and the charges which should be properly borne on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I said that the civil servants who prepared this booklet on national income and expenditure deserved great praise for their industry and for the information they have supplied to us. It is a pity, however, that the figures which they have given represent, to some extent, the inflation which took place during the war.  The figures cannot be regarded as really representing bed-rock figures in respect of the different charges with which they deal. Prices have soared to an enormous extent, while production has fallen in almost every single department.  When we read that the national income expanded from £154,000,000 in 1938 to £252,000,000 in 1944, we know that that increase does not represent real wealth, but reflects the increased prices which were being paid for scarce commodities. I think the Minister referred to that symptom in the course of his Budget statement, his description being, I think, that too much money is chasing too few goods.  As I said, the figures bear a certain unreality.  It is rather unfortunate that that is so. <Col N="2607" /> That is the only criticism I have to level against the figures in that book, because they do not represent the real position at all.</P>
    <P>Just one last word about increased production.  If the Minister desires that increase of production which is absolutely necessary for the prosperity and welfare of the country, then I submit that one of the first things he must do is to bring down taxation to a much lower level than it has reached at present.  After all, it is quite conceivable that there will be a slump in prices after the war, as there has been a slump after every war which has taken place since the Napoleonic wars. If such a slump, let us say, took place this year, with our present low rate of production, we would find ourselves in a very dangerous position.  It is anticipated by leading economists in America that such a slump in prices will take place perhaps in four or five years.  Following the law of economics, I suppose it is almost inevitable that such a slump will take place.  In fact, such a slump must take place if conditions and prices are to get back to bed-rock again.  At all events, in preparation for such a slump, it seems to me plain common sense that the Minister for Finance should anticipate such a happening by scaling down taxation to a level which people will be able to bear when the slump does reach us.  I sincerely hope that such a slump does not take place.  But, as I said, such slumps and depressions have taken place following every war since the days of the Napoleonic wars. I do not know that the law of economics has changed since then to prevent such a slump following the recent war.  However, as I say, it is the duty of the Minister for Finance to anticipate such a development and to make adequate provision now, so that, when such a day does arrive, the country will be in such a position that it will be able to meet and survive it.</P>
    <P>The present scale of taxation is admitted on all sides to be too high.  It is creating unrest, uneasiness and, to a certain extent, unhappiness in the country.  It is creating unrest on the land and in industry and, <Col N="2608" /> until that scale of taxation is reduced to a level commensurate with the ability of the people to bear it, there will be neither real progress, real prosperity, nor real happiness in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>The Budget introduced by the Minister yesterday afternoon contains some positive gestures.  There is a substantial increase in the grants towards agricultural rates, farm improvements, a reduction in the price of petrol, and a reduction in income-tax. They are, surely, welcome gestures coming from the Government at this stage.  The country generally anticipated some form of relief in taxation.  To some extent, undoubtedly, the Minister has met them.  I cannot, however, agree that the reduction in income-tax is the best indication that the Government could give of any effort or desire on its part to relieve the generally necessitous conditions of the great masses of our people.  After all, the people who pay income-tax are comparatively few in numbers.  Even in the form of the relief suggested&mdash; 1/- in the £ up to an income of £1,500 &mdash;I personally cannot see any justification for such a very general level as that.  I think, in justice, there should be some scaling arrangement whereby the man in receipt of £600 would pay something less than the man in receipt of £1,500, and so up along the line.  It is, of course, a matter for the Department to consider.  I am sure it has occurred to them already.  Probably they see some objection to it.  But to the average man it is not an equitable form of taxation and it is not a form of taxation which is particularly favourable to the lower-paid salary man.  I wonder how many men in this country are in receipt of £1,500, or over, a year.  I do not think the percentage could be very high.  I do not see why particularly favourable conditions should be provided for those up to, or over, the £1,000 mark rather than for those up to, or below, the £500 mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the agricultural grant, there is no doubt about it that it is a very welcome gesture.  There is no doubt about it but that the farmer <Col N="2609" /> will be fully appreciative of it.  I do not think, however, that anybody could argue that, taking into consideration the increased cost of living and the increased cost of labour, and other items which go to form the make-up of the agricultural economy, that the grant of £1,000,000 would to-day compensate the farmers for the increased costs which they have had to bear in relation to the increased cost of living, etc.  It is true that it may be argued that the farmers have got increased prices for their produce and are making more money in their agricultural business.  I accept that; but I definitely assert that, while that is generally true, it is not true in regard to every section of the farming community; it is certainly not true in relation to the uneconomic holders in the congested areas in this country.  Unless the Government is prepared to go somewhat further in relation to that section of the community, even to the extent of subsidising them where they insist upon compulsory tillage, in order to enable the farmers to pay a reasonable wage to their workers, I cannot see that there is any justice being done either to the agriculturists themselves or to the agricultural workers whom the farmers have to employ.  Some form of assistance should apply where the farmer himself and the land which he is in occupation of are not capable of yielding sufficient profits to enable him to compensate himself reasonably for his work or pay proper wages to his workmen.  That does not apply in the better areas of the country and to the farmers who are in the happy position of occupying better land and are more advantageously placed geographically in regard to the marketing of their produce.  I see no provision made in the Budget for that.</P>
    <P>I do not see any provision being made in the Budget to deal with a very necessitous class in this country.  That class is referred to by the various members of the Government and by Deputies on the Opposition Benches more frequently than any other section of the population.  I refer to the old age pensioners.  I think that, if there is any element of injustice still outstanding on the part of the Government, it is their complete failure to <Col N="2610" /> deal with that very deserving class, in regard to whom every Deputy in this House, speaking his mind&mdash;as anyone would&mdash;whether at Party meetings or publicly in this chamber, has expressed the opinion that a fair deal has not been given to that section of our people.  They are forced to live upon 10/- a week and they even find it harder to get that 10/- a week in the last few years than they did previously. They are forced to live on the same allowance as they had pre-1939.  Could anybody, with any justice, claim that 10/- to-day is fair as compared with 10/- five years ago in regard to the purchase of food and the necessaries of life?</P>
    <P>Now it has been established and recognised by the Government that those employed in certain services of the State should have a cost-of-living bonus added to their ordinary salaries. Why deprive the poor and the aged, who are least able to indicate or voice their grievances, except through others, of any increase?  Why leave them neglected?  Why leave our pensioners, retired teachers, retired civic guards, retired army men on a standard of allowance which, if fair and reasonable six years ago, is no longer fair or reasonable to-day?  What justification can there be for that when the Government itself recognises that a cost-of-living bonus is applicable, and, not only applicable, but paid to certain sections of our services?  To my mind this Budget cannot be described as a democratic Budget in that respect.  There is admittedly a reduction in income-tax but, as I said before, the people who pay income-tax are generally regarded as a section of the community which is fairly well-to-do. That is a gesture towards them. There have been gestures in other directions in relation to agricultural grants and a reduction in the price of petrol, which many of us welcome and will enjoy.</P>
    <P>But the vast bulk of our people do not pay income-tax.  There is no provision for the poor and the aged to the extent which their needs demand.  Why leave them out of consideration altogether? There is no equity or justice there in comparison with those to <Col N="2611" /> whom a cost-of-living bonus has been made available.  I have a definite grievance in this matter.  I assert that in so far as the Budget has failed to make any provision for those or any gesture towards them it cannot be said to be a truly democratic Budget or a poor man's Budget.</P>
    <P>I can see that the Minister's and the Government's intentions are good in regard to housing.  Anything which helps the provision of houses at a cheaper rent is a good national work. I compliment the Minister on his scheme by which he is providing cheaper money and making it available for that purpose.  I wonder would it be possible to accord the same facilities to the private builders, apart from the local loans and county councils and such other public bodies for whom that loan is earmarked.  Would the Minister do something to provide cheap money so that houses could be built by private persons for their own use and by private builders in the ordinary way all over the country?  He probably has that in mind and has made some provision therefor.  I suggest, however, that in the new progressive development in house building regard should be had not merely to the present demand for houses in the cities and towns but also to the possibility of future employment for those who may occupy the houses.  There has been in recent years a definite trend from the rural areas, mainly to the cities but proportionately to the small towns.</P>
    <P>To build houses for an artificial population, created in that way, is definitely a waste of public money.  If it were possible, the Government should say to a number of the people who are trekking to the cities in these days: &ldquo;There is no prospect of employment for you here, but there is an immense amount of work to be done down the country; there are bogs to be drained, swamps to be cleared and valuable work of reclamation to be done&rdquo;.  It is difficult for a Government elected by our form of elections to adopt such an attitude.  If we could alternate democratic government by dictatorship every five or ten years, we would probably do a great deal to <Col N="2612" /> reform conditions and to regulate order to the best advantage of the State.  But, since we do not adopt such dictatorial powers, and since it is not expedient or wise that a Government should adopt them, even if they could, then, in providing amenities in the form of housing, strict analysis should be made as to the possibility of employment for the number of people for whom houses are built in towns or cities.  Otherwise, we are spending money that ultimately will represent a national loss and instead of providing the need we all know exists for better housing conditions for the people we will be creating something that will be adverse in its effects.</P>
    <P>The building of new houses should not be undertaken merely as a crusade. Wherever a house is built it should be done scientifically.  Above all, preference should be given to the building of houses in rural areas.  Higher grants and greater encouragement should be given in rural areas.  That has been done to a large extent by the proposed improvement in amenities under the rural electrification scheme and sewerage schemes and things of that sort.  In the housing scheme now to be undertaken on a national scale specific and particular advantages and encouragement should be given by way of State grants towards the building of houses in rural areas and towards encouraging the people to live there.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech last night stated that he was adverse to the policy of borrowing money on a large scale as it had a tendency to increase the demand for goods which at present were limited.  There is no doubt that he is right.  The Minister, of course, is aware of the fact that if he puts his hand into his pocket from time to time and takes out the money he has there, he will usually find that not less than one-third of the coins are foreign coins. Foreign coinage is in circulation here in a very definite way.  It is money that has been carried into this country in the pockets of persons and passed over the counter, demanding goods and services. One-third of the coinage in circulation here is foreign money.  It is money for which return has already been given in the form of goods or service. <Col N="2613" /> Is not that a form, and a dangerous form, of inflation?  Is there any provision being made to deal with that?  Should there not be some means by which that money should be controlled and not allowed to be circulated here in addition to our own currency, making demand on the limited supply of purchasable goods?  I assert, definitely, that that money is largely the medium by which black-marketing is encouraged here.  Steps should be taken by the Minister for Finance to ensure that some control is exercised upon that reckless circulation of money, which represents an increased demand on a limited supply of goods. These goods are supplied, not to the people of this country, but to people from outside and when these coins are handed back to the country of origin, we having rendered service and given goods for them here, we are told: &ldquo;We can give you no goods in return; you can hold our coins and some day we will probably pay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that the circulation of that vast volume of foreign money here is an indication of serious want in this country.  We are told that the quantity of goods our people are buying is based upon our purchases of 1939-40. Quite a number of our people cannot buy their quota of goods.  Otherwise, the supply of goods would not be sufficient to meet to the large extent it is meeting the demands of people outside this country.  These goods are being paid for in foreign currency, for which there is no return in the form of supplying us with goods when we demand and want them.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, there should be a closer examination of our economic affairs.  I assert that a great number of the people of this country are living under conditions that are not just or fair.  I refer to the attitude adopted towards our old age pensioners, our pensioned teachers and pensioners of various kinds, who are compelled to live upon an allowance that the Government admit is no longer just because they have allowed an increase in the cost-of-living bonus to active servants of the State.  Why should they compel those who are no longer active, who are no longer able to defend <Col N="2614" /> themselves or to fight for their rights, to live on a pittance that is no longer admitted to be right or equitable? Look at the money paid to our agricultural workers, to our road workers and to our bog workers.  I ask any man to examine the cost of living and then ask himself can anyone provide for himself and his family on 37/- or 38/- a week.  Unless the situation is faced up to, one of the most dangerous positions that was ever created will be created in this country.  The soil is being tilled to perfection for the sowing of the seeds of revolution and communism and it is the Government's duty to ensure that the lower paid standards of workers will get sufficient to enable them to live in moderate decency.  They are not receiving that at the moment.  This Budget does not make adequate provision in that respect and, accordingly, I cannot regard it as a good Budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Budget. It will be welcomed particularly by the rural community in constituencies such as the one I represent.  I welcome especially the provisions for the relief of rates on small farms.  There has been, over many years, a lot of loose talk in connection with the derating of land.  Some of the Opposition Parties wanted total derating.  I am very glad to see that in this Budget we have relief to the extent of three-fifths of the rates on agricultural land under £20 valuation.  That will be of considerable benefit to the small farmers in the area I represent.  The reduction of 1d. in the lb. of sugar and the grant of £5 to families in the Gaeltacht, for the purpose of promoting the Irish language, will be welcomed very much in my constituency.  It is a step in the right direction and I think it will be much appreciated throughout the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather amusing to listen to the attacks which have been made on this Budget by some members of the Opposition.  Deputy McGilligan talked about acrobatics.  The greatest acrobatic performance I have seen in this House, since the speeches on this Budget began, were the attempts of the <Col N="2615" /> gentlemen on the Opposition Benches to create arguments against the Budget.  They have done everything they could do to find fault with the Budget.  No matter what these gentlemen say, it is a Budget that will be nationally popular.  They have endeavoured to create artificial grievances and they pushed forward certain arguments here on the ground that the Minister has disregarded a number of things.  We have heard some criticisms about matters that have not been included.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to see Deputy McGilligan shedding tears about our external assets.  It is difficult to reconcile his attitude about our external assets in Britain with the policy his Party has enunciated over a number of years.  What has become of the wonderful British Empire during the last 12 months?  That is the country that has been held up to us by the main Opposition as the one with which we should act in close collaboration.  It is the country in respect of which the Opposition has demanded, through its Leader, that we should go so far as to have an offensive and defensive alliance.  Is this British Empire a goodly apple, rotten at the core?  Is it just now that Deputy McGilligan has discovered that our external assets in the British Empire constitute a grave national danger?  Does Deputy Mulcahy agree with Deputy McGilligan in this matter, or has Deputy McGilligan suddenly discovered that Deputy Mulcahy was wrong in advocating, for a number of years, and more especially in recent times, much closer collaboration with Britain?</P>
    <P>According to Deputy McGilligan, any external assets we hold there are a national menace, a national danger. When Deputy McGilligan talks about acrobatics, I think that, on behalf of his Party, he has performed some very peculiar political acrobatics when dealing with the question of our external assets.  It is true that these assets arose, as one might say, through no fault of our own.  It is true that over the emergency there were many articles, various types of goods, which we could not get from them, and, <Col N="2616" /> therefore, these external balances accumulated.  It is equally true to say that there were many of us who would prefer to see these assets accumulating in that way, because we have a greater hope, a better chance, of getting a return for those assets when normal trade starts to flow throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I welcome particularly the provision of £5,000,000 to be applied, among other things, to farm improvements. The farm improvements scheme has proved very popular through the country and there is a genuine demand in rural areas for more money to be spent under that heading.</P>
    <P>I might suggest to the Minister that he should consider another expenditure for the benefit of the rural community. I refer to fertilisers, which have been extremely scarce during the emergency.  There is a demand for more and cheaper fertilisers.  I suggest that if there is more of this money available, the Minister should encourage farmers to put greater quantities of fertilisers on the land in order to increase productivity.  I suggest more money should be made available to encourage the farmers, not alone to put out normal amounts of fertilisers, but to induce them to double and even treble the quantity of artificials that they put on the land.  That would be a good capital expenditure for the farmers.  From the point of view of the State, it would be a good investment and I believe it would bring results. There is one matter upon which most agricultural experts will agree and that is that the secret of successful farming is, above all other things, intensive manuring.  I would like to see an intensive manuring campaign and if there is any money left out of the £5,000,000 provided for useful schemes, I would like the Minister to consider the suggestion I have made.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Cogan and some other members of the House suggesting that the farmers are down and out. That has been the continual cry of certain sections of this House.  I do not believe that industrious farmers want to be so described.  I do not believe that the working farmer who is making a success of his farm and <Col N="2617" /> who always has made a success of farming wants to be described as an individual who is useless or incapable of fending for himself.  Every indication goes to show the contrary.  The expansion of farming income, the fact that to-day, according to the Budget Statement, the total savings of the public have increased by £148,000,000 over the figure in 1939, are things that give a definite indication.  I believe that sum has been accumulated largely by the savings of farmers and it is not an indication that the farmers are down and out.  Anybody who has anything to do with land is aware that the price of land has increased by over 100 per cent. during the war period. That is not an indication that the farmers are down and out.</P>
    <P>The farmers are as hard and efficient workers as will be found in any country.  Given a reasonable chance, the farmers here will show as good results on the land available to them as any agricultural community in the world.</P>
    <P>It amuses me to hear some Deputies talking about the flight from the land. If they were familiar with a constituency like mine they might change their views about the flight from the land.  There is no flight from the land in the County Mayo.  On the contrary, wherever there is land to be divided, wherever a small farmer can get the capital together, he and his sons want to acquire more land.</P>
    <P>It is true that we have migration to a large extent in County Mayo. We have migration for the simple reason that we have over 8,000 families in the county living on uneconomic holdings, with valuations under £10. When you have families on uneconomic holdings in which there are six or eight children there is nothing for them but to get out, unless some employment or land is made available elsewhere. I am glad to see that the Minister takes a serious view of migration in this Budget.  I am also glad that the Budget, at least, provides some remedy for migration and that some provision is made to deal with the problem.  It is a national problem.</P>
    <P>If I may put it this way, it is confined <Col N="2618" /> in a large degree to congested areas.  We cannot take the migration figures during the recent war as being reliable because migration was then on a completely artificial standard.  The position was that the English people were at war and they wanted workers for war industries.  The wages paid were also on a completely artificial scale.  We had migration from this country during the war that would not occur in a normal period.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy will agree with that. If we go back over the position for a number of years we find that migration has been in the main confined to congested areas.  In the report of a committee on seasonal migration to Great Britain that was set up in 1937 figures dealing with districts from which the migrants came are given.  We find that from Connaught in 1911, 6,848 persons migrated; in 1912, 6,867; in 1913, 6,547; in 1914, 5,438, and in 1915, 5,258. From Ulster in 1911, 1,824 migrated; in the peak year of 1912, 2,097, and in 1915, 1,845.  From Munster in 1911, 168 left; in 1912, 230; in 1913, 136; in 1914, 145, and in 1915, 204.  From the province of Leinster the figures ranged from 38 in 1911 to 47 in 1915.  From the province of Connaught for these five years you had the largest number migrating.  These migrants were all landholders, but they came from uneconomic holdings.  Of the 7,354 migrants enumerated in 1915, 6,388 were landholders or the sons and daughters of landholders.  An examination of the figures for the year 1915 shows that of the 5,258 enumerated as having migrated from Connaught, 4,274 were from County Mayo.  These figures in normal years go to show that the main volume of migration is from the congested areas.</P>
    <P>Government policy considers migration to be a national problem.  I suggest to the Minister that Government policy should be directed towards alleviating the position where there are these great land slums like those in congested areas.  These are the areas out of which the main body of migrants come.  They are the areas out of which the main body of migrants must get, because they have not economic holdings on which to exist. <Col N="2619" /> I do not know whether it will be Government policy to do what was done in the black areas in Wales, to concentrate industries in these areas to absorb the natural surface population, or to encourage industries on small farms that are peculiar to these areas.  That is where I suggest a start must be made.</P>
    <P>It is true that the main energies of this State from 1932 to 1938, from the Government point of view, were directed to the fighting of an economic war, with an outside power, and during those years the nation had to concentrate on winning that fight.  No sooner was that war over than the world war started, and again the energies of the nation were concentrated on seeing that the people were put into the position of being able to keep out of that war.  We have now what I call our first post-war Budget and the main energies of this State can be directed towards dealing with internal national problems of which migration is one of the most serious.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I doubly welcome such a scheme as the Farm Improvement Scheme, the provision for which has been increased in this Budget.  I go further and suggest that from the point of view of providing more work in these areas, the other schemes announced by the Minister, such as national drainage, rural electrification, and turf development should be concentrated as far as possible in congested areas, so as to provide at the source employment to stem the national sore of migration.  While concentrating their energies during the war period on safeguarding the food situation, the Government were not able to deal with the problem, but immediately that war ended we have proof in this Budget of what they propose to do.  We have these schemes announced by the Minister and to those who complain about higher expenditure forecast in the Budget I say that I am very glad of that higher expenditure. I am very glad to see that the Minister for Finance has agreed to face this national problem.  &ldquo;Peace hath its victories no less renowned than war.&rdquo;  If money could be found for purposes of destruction, there is <Col N="2620" /> no reason why we, as a nation, should not endeavour to find as much money as possible to cure the ills from which this nation suffers.  An examination of the figures in the Budget shows that a great part of the increased expenditure is due to the extended social services that are now being provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not like to hear that, nevertheless it is true.  It is all very well for Deputy Morrissey and his friends to talk about increased expenditure, but when the Deputy and his friends had control of the national purse, there was no provision made for widows and orphans. There was no provision for social services except in a skeleton form and the Deputy knows that very well.  The Minister, like his predecessors, is making increased provision for coping with the national housing shortage, as well as increased provision for social services.  Increased provision is also being made for public health services. National problems such as the ravages of tuberculosis are being tackled, as well as the ravages of rheumatism, which are to a large degree even greater than those of tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>It is all very fine for the people opposite to talk about the increased amount of money involved.  I do not mind Deputy O'Higgins or the vitriolic comments which he made here and which he usually makes here.  The trouble with Deputy O'Higgins is that, unlike those of some of his friends, his blue shirt, instead of fading out, faded in, poisoning his whole system, so that he takes a cock-eyed view of any propositions emanating from these benches.  Simply because they come from the Fianna Fáil Benches, they are bound to be wrong, according to Deputy O'Higgins.  The people of this country have proved to Deputy O'Higgins and his Party that Ireland no longer needs them and we are consequently not very much concerned with what Deputy O'Higgins may say about this Budget or any legislation which is introduced here for the benefit of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2621" /> I again wish to congratulate the Minister on this, his first, Budget.  I think it was Deputy Cogan who said that the Budget was like an election speech.  I think that no greater tribute could be paid by any member of the Opposition to this Budget.  It is a Budget on which any Party or any Government could be proud to go to the country.  I have no doubt as to what the verdict of the people would be, if it were a matter of judging the policy of the Government on this Budget.  The Budget is, to my mind, a declaration of war on emigration, a declaration of war on the drudgery in rural Ireland and a declaration of war on disease.</P>

      <P>The last speaker started out to convince the House that there was no flight from the land and then proceeded to inform the House that there was a flight from the land, and that the greatest incidence of that flight was to be found on the western seaboard and in the congested districts. His whole discourse was as illogical as his opening remarks.  I do not want to pursue the Deputy through every avenue and boreen of the County Mayo, but I should like to quote for the Deputy the words of a Western Bishop, the Bishop of Galway, in 1938. He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The real strength and wealth of this country, human beings, is disappearing at such a rapid rate that if it be not changed, the next century will see the extinction of the Irish people on the land of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that it is immaterial whether we worry about our connection with the British Commonwealth of Nations, whether we worry about the phantom Irish Republic we have to-day, or whether we worry about a 32-county republic for the whole country, because, in the next 100 years, there will be no Irish people here to defend this territory and nothing is being done <Col N="2622" /> by the Government to stop that trend.</P>
    <P>I said before in this House, and I say it again, that I do not propose to lay the blame on the present Government for the emigration which has taken place&mdash;emigration has been with us since 1847&mdash;but I do blame the Government for this, that, since they came into office, they have done nothing to stem the tide of emigration; that they have merely turned the tide from the west, from America, towards the east, towards Great Britain, and that their policy is a policy of palliatives and temporary expedients calculated to cause a temporary relief here and there, but, in the ultimate, to allow the drift of our people, of the brawn and the brain of our people, to continue indefinitely.  That is the kernel of our entire position here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry, a member of the Government Party&mdash;I do not know whether the last speaker was in the House at the time&mdash;deplored this position and put it to the Government that something would have to be done, and drastically done, in order to cure it. Deputy Moran says that there is no flight from the land.  In 1936, we had 633,000 males employed upon the land; in 1938, we had 537,000 employed on the land; and in 1939, we had 531,000 employed on the land.  There was an increase in 1940 and 1941, when we had, respectively, 544,000 and 556,000 employed on the land, but since then, we have had a progressive reduction in the number of people so employed. In 1942, we had 541,000; in 1943, 536,000; and in 1944, 526,000.  I quote from the document &ldquo;National Income and Expenditure&rdquo; issued by the Minister's Department in March of this year.</P>
    <P>That is the position we face here and, in addition, our population is declining. In 1943 as compared with 1941, there was a diminution in our population of 42,321, and, in 1944, as compared with 1941, that diminution had increased to 48,034.  I am not going to say that I have a cure-all for this position, nor am I going to say that I have a plan to solve unemployment, as Fianna Fáil said before they came into office; but I will say this, that despite all the temporary reliefs and <Col N="2623" /> schemes which Fianna Fáil has tried upon the country, that is the result.</P>
    <P>The Minister to-day questioned a statement made from this side of the House as to the numbers of our people who left this country in the war years and he conveniently quoted the most favourable years for this purpose.  He included, so far as I can see, the year 1939 in the figures by which he arrived at the figure for our net emigration of 78,600.  I submit that the year 1939 should not have been included, and that, if that year were excluded, we would get an entirely different figure, a figure which would be something over 90,000.  I want to put it to the Minister that we have no statistical record that I am aware of by which we can calculate with any degree of accuracy the number of our people who crossed the land frontier to join the British Army, the British Navy and the Air Force.  It is only since 1942 that we have any record of the passenger movements between Northern Ireland and ourselves.</P>
    <P>In this House, as late as April last, in answer to a question by Deputy Norton as to the number of travel permits issued for work in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, we got a figure of 215,904 men and women who left this country between the years 1940 and 1945 and, mark you, merely for work.  These were travel permits issued for work in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, not permits issued to men to join the forces engaged in the war.  Now I believe that there is good reason to assume that the figure is somewhere in the neighbourhood of 250,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will consult the Registrar-General's figures for 1943 and compare them with the figures for 1944, he will find an extraordinary position.  I have not the documents before me, but I went through them to-day and I found extraordinary errors.  I want to know from the Minister what figures are we to rely upon.  I would ask his advisers to check the two reports and they will find that there is an extraordinary discrepancy in the figures given for these war years in the 1943 report as compared with the 1944 report.  There is a complete hash of figures there.  I mention this matter because I feel that one of the essential problems which we have to face in this country is the settlement of our people on the land. The first question before this House and the Government is to find some solution for providing for the old people on the land, so that the sons and daughters of these old people may settle on the land before they reach middle life and at a time when they will be in a position to rear families. That is one of our crucial problems.</P>
      <P>The second problem, as Deputy Corry quite rightly pointed out, is to provide amenities in the country that will compare favourably, and more than favourably, with the urban amenities.  That will, I hope, come in due time as a result of rural electrification and other projects at present under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, we have to face up to the problem of our industrial position here and definitely decide how far we can go towards a policy of full employment in industry.  At the present time a considerable percentage of our national income is going abroad in foreign investments, something perhaps in the neighbourhood of £25,000,000 to £30,000,000 per year. Certain experts calculate that no less than 10 per cent. of our national income is going abroad in investments. I put it to the Minister that here is a fund which can be utilised for the development of Irish industry and also of Irish agriculture.  I do not want to see the State becoming the fairy godmother for every service and need and want in this country.  I do want to see <Col N="2625" /> the State giving a directive so that Irish investors will realise that it is as remunerative and certainly less risky to put their money into Irish enterprise as to send it to the far-flung corners of the earth.</P>
    <P>So far as I can make out, the amount of investment in Irish industry would be in the neighbourhood of between £6,000,000 and £7,000,000 per year.  I submit that the amount going abroad in investments is in the neighbourhood of £25,000,000 to £30,000,000 per year. I suggest that, given a proper directive by the Government and by the policy of the Government to ensure that stable productive industries and enterprises were started, there would be a possibility of checking that flow of investment abroad and directing it home. I am not suggesting that the Minister should intervene to control investment, as has been done in other countries, but I would go so far as to say that he should take steps to ensure that our investors appreciate the problems that are here, and that our Government, if necessary, should go even so far as to engage in propaganda on behalf of Irish industry, not on behalf of a particular firm or industry, but on behalf of industry as a whole.  If these two matters were tackled, we could get somewhere towards solving our unemployment problem and keeping our people at home.  But I submit that a drastic surgical operation is needed and that these temporary palliatives of social sops will lead us nowhere.  They are not leading us anywhere.  Our population is still going despite all these sops.</P>
    <P>Now, I want to fit this Budget into its proper perspective as against the background of the social and economic position as visualised by this document published by the Minister in March of this year.  Apart from the fact that we have a declining population and that we have, in addition, considerable emigration to Great Britain, anybody studying this document will discover that our cost of living has increased in the war years by 70 per cent., that wages in industry&mdash;I am taking the table as a whole&mdash;in non-agricultural employment have, as a result of Government policy, increased only to the extent of between 20 and 25 per cent. <Col N="2626" /> In other words, these people employed in industry have to tighten their belts to make up for the difference between a 70 per cent. increase in the cost of living and a 25 per cent. increase in salaries and wages.</P>
    <P>You will find that this works out in a very peculiar way.  For example, taking food, you will find that, despite all the talk we have here about feeding ourselves, putting our food prices on the same level as 1938, we are spending on food £2,000,000 odd per annum less than we spent in 1938. What does that mean?  It does not mean that the gentleman who pays surtax or excess profits tax or the gentleman who can afford to pay the extra 2/7 per bottle on champagne or the 2d. extra for a glass of whiskey is pulling in his belt.  It means that those below the £150 limit who do not come under the survey of the Revenue Commissioners at all have to pull in their belts and do with less food to-day than they had in 1938.  That is one aspect of it.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of it is that these same people, whom I shall call the poor, for want of a better term, are spending less to-day on clothing than they spent in 1938 to the extent of £7.9 millions.  Again, I say it is not the gentleman who can afford to pay 2/7 extra on champagne who is not buying the suit of clothes, or the shirt, or the pair of socks, or the pair of boots, but the unfortunate people below this level who do not come under the Revenue Commissoners' surveillance at all. Again, you will find that they are paying £5.7 millions less than in 1938 on fuel and light, so that we get this position&mdash;they are underfed; they are underclothed; they have no heat; and they have very little light.  That is the position as I see it.  That is the position that we have to put into its proper perspective when we consider this Budget.  Seventy-two per cent. of our people earn less than £250 per year.  We have something like&mdash;I am quoting all the time from this document&mdash;198,301 people above the limit of £3 per week, and it is these people who will have to find the money for this Budget.  That is the position in this country to-day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2627" /> Now the Minister for Finance very suavely says to the farmers: &ldquo;You are prosperous&mdash;so prosperous that you have money in the bank; not only have you sufficient money in the bank to put your farms into a properly serviced condition and to improve your capital equipment, to buy machinery and fertilisers and all that sort of thing, but you are able to provide for future prosperity and hand down prosperous farms to your sons and daughters; and, in addition, you have enough money to pay the £470,000 odd that you owe by way of arrears of annuity.&rdquo;  I submit to the Minister that again his own figures are against him.  During the five or six years of this war, it is stated in this document, capital development suffered to the extent of £15,000,000 per year in 1938, and in the current figures to the extent of £20,000,000 per year; and that, applied to the farmer, means that he was working his farm with his capital during this war, that he was working the land without fertilisers and manures, and that he was sowing and reaping his crops with out-of-date and battered machinery, and that, whatever he did put into the bank, as a result of any increased prices during this war, he will have to outlay that immediately fertilisers and machinery become available. Therefore, instead of having any money in the bank, when this job has to be done now, or as soon as materials become available, he will have to outlay more than he has put into the banks.  It is no good our priding ourselves on the fact that we have increased deposits in the banks, and post office savings, and so forth.  The position is that we require a gross capital development in this State, according to this report, needing £100,000,000; and the experts who prepared this report say that they are very doubtful if that £100,000,000 will meet the bill.  I will quote from the document itself as regards this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the figure of £24,000,000 for 1938 be regarded as &lsquo;normal&rsquo; there has clearly been a considerable falling off in capital formation, as defined, <Col N="2628" /> during the emergency period The average during the years 1942-44, indicates a deficiency of £15,000,000 per annum at 1938 prices, or more than £20,000,000 per annum at present day prices.  The deficiency over the whole period would seem to be of the order of £100,000,000 at present day prices.  No doubt, it would be possible to dispense with some of the capital goods on works as defined for the purpose.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, in addition, they say that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These figures, accordingly, set in a new perspective the value of the forced savings of this State during the war.  It is doubtful if these savings will suffice to make good the capital deficiency which has piled up during the war years, let alone provide for more intensive capitalisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, what I have said with regard to agriculture applies with a greater degree of intensity to industry.  There the job, if the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not painting too rosy a picture, will be that the industrialist will have to capitalise within the reserves which he was forced to put by during the war period; and, again, I submit that, whatever reserves were put by by industry during the war period with a view to eventually investing in industry here, they will not be sufficient to do the job.  So much for the savings and the prosperous conditions of the farmer, the industrialist and the worker.</P>
    <P>Now, what are we asked to do in this Budget?  We are asked as taxpayers in this country to find an extra £3,000,000, less £5,000.  That is £2,995,000 more this year than we had to put up last year and that, mind you, despite a reduction of 1/- in the £ in income-tax, and despite the fact that there is 1d. off sugar and 10/- off the turf.  We in this country have in Central Fund services to meet an extra £313,000 and in Supply Services an extra £263,000; and on the entire Budget an extra £2,995,000.  Despite a reduction of 1/- in income-tax the Minister is estimating an increased yield of £1,250,000, or thereabouts, from income-tax this year, according to the paper he has supplied to us.  He <Col N="2629" /> is also expecting an increased yield of something like £2,000,000 from customs. Now, who is going to pay the customs &mdash;the ordinary householder, the ordinary worker, and the ordinary housewife.</P>
    <P>This is a spurious Budget.  It has a false front.  When you get behind it, you will find that the social and economic condition of this country is very far from the rosy picture that this Budget would suggest.  May I put it to you this way: if Atlas were relieved of the burden of carrying the world on his back he would certainly give a great sigh of relief, but Cathleen Ní Houlihán has been carrying almost as heavy a burden as Atlas did, and because Cathleen Ní Houlihán's back has been eased slightly of this grievous burden that was breaking her back until now, we are expected to throw up our hands in a pæan of praise, and song, and glory, and say: &ldquo;Thanks be to God, or thanks to the Minister for Finance, or thanks to this great Fianna Fáil Administration for giving us those reliefs.&rdquo;  We have got very, very little relief in this Budget.  As far as I remember, the Budget of 1939 was about the £33,000,000 figure and it was regarded as a phenomenal Budget, calculated to break the back of the country.  Here we are getting a £53,000,000 Budget and the war has been over for more than a year.  Let us not delude ourselves that because we were asked to carry an almost impossible burden during the war that this is any considerable relief now. This is no great relief to industry.  I admit there is some relief in it, but I respectfully submit that the relief is nothing like what industry expected and what industry needs if the programme visualised for us by the Minister for Industry and Commerce is ever to reach the practical stage.  As to the farmer's relief, again I say, let the farmer not be deceived by this. There is considerable temporary relief given in this £1,000,000 by way of derating to the farmer but it lasts only for two years.  It stops at the end of two years and the farmer is told quite bluntly: &ldquo;Set your house in order within these two years.&rdquo;  That is the only inference to be taken from the Minister's statement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2630" /> He tells them they are prosperous and will be in a position to do great things, that everybody must be reasonable, industrialists must not expect too great profits, neither must the farmer; the worker, above all, must not expect too great wages; we must all pull together.  But I can see a position at the end of two years, if this present relief is stopped and, according to the Budget statement, it may be stopped, in which we will be faced with a very serious load of taxation.  Because, whatever may be said for the present Budget, we are facing abnormal, increased expenditure for the next five years in this country.  We are facing a position in which we will have to find £1,000,000 for public health.  I do not know how many millions we will have to find for sanatoria and tuberculosis clinics.  We have to find £350,000 this year for the tourist industry and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on the Second Stage of the Tourist Bill indicated to the House that he proposed to embark upon a scheme of fixed-term loans for people engaged in the tourist trade and told us quite clearly that there was no limit to the amount of loans that may be demanded of this House. When you consider that these loans are based on advances made to the Tourist Board which can be wiped out with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, wiped out as regards principal and interest, I would ask the House seriously to consider where we are heading.  We are definitely faced with increasingly heavy demands year after year by the local authorities and I have no doubt in my mind that the local authorities' rates will go up and up and up for the next five years and until such time as many of the schemes now adumbrated become operative.  So that, if there is any temporary relief given here, I respectfully submit it is merely given as an offset to that spiral of increase in rates that the Minister foresees.</P>
    <P>As to the reduction in the price of turf, I want again to say to the Minister that I am not in the least turf-minded. I come from an area where we raised coal for the past 300 years and I confess that I am entirely coal-minded. <Col N="2631" /> But when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was introducing his Turf Development Bill to the House, he clearly indicated that the cost of machine-won turf on the bog would be in the neighbourhood of 20/- to 25/- a ton, and he also clearly indicated, in reply to Deputy McGilligan, that at least some quantity of that turf would find its way to Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan asked what would be the cost of shifting it from the bog to Dublin.  He did not get a very clear answer but the Minister seemed to agree that it would not cost more than 10/- to shift it from the bog to Dublin, so that we would have the turf in Dublin, wholesale, at 35/- a ton and it would not be unreasonable to add another 5/- for the wholesalers' profit.  On that basis we would have our turf in Dublin at £2 a ton.  I respectfully submit to the Minister that turf at 54/- a ton of the kind that we are getting at the moment is uneconomic, extravagant and altogether beyond the means of the smaller householder to meet and I hope that this is but a beginning, that in next year's Budget the 14/- will come off and that we will have this turf in Dublin at £2 a ton.  We would want to have it in Dublin at £2 a ton if we were to have a fuel in any way comparable with coal, even the worst quality coal.  Taking the worst quality coal which we are getting to-day, Welsh anthracite from the Welsh coalfieds, one ton of it is equal to two tons of our turf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I had certain questions on yesterday's Order Paper relating to the same locality.  I felt I was compelled to put down those questions because of the peculiar method adopted in connection with land acquired by the Land Commission and distributed amongst various allottees.  It was not the distribution that I was so much concerned with as the fact that certain people who should be entitled to allotments on these two estates did not get any land.</P>
      <P>The first question I put to the Minister was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Lands if he will state by what method the valuation of allotments is determined in cases of sub-division.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister was in the Seanad yesterday and the Minister for Justice answered for him.  I would like to get a clearer answer than the one I did get.  Evidently the Minister was a bit perplexed by the way I worded the question, because it would seem that three different interpretations could be got from it.  I tabled that question in order to find by what means a particular allotment of land is valued for the purpose of the poor law valuation before it is given to the allottee. I should like the Minister to explain that and let me know whether it is the officials of his Department who value the allotment or the officials of the General Valuation Office, under the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>The second question I put to the Minister was:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Lands if he will state the names of those who were allotted additions on the Fitzgerald-Kenney and Brennan estates in County Mayo; the acreage and <Col N="2634" /> valuation of the additions; and the valuations of the holdings of these allottees prior to the allotment of the additions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister refused to supply a certain part of the information I asked for in that question.</P>
    <P>In the next question I asked the Minister:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Lands if he will state the reasons why Martin Quinn, Thomas Murphy, Patrick Joyce, Michael Prendergast and Michael Mooney were not granted additions in the recent distribution of the Fitzgerald-Kenney and Brennan Estates in County Mayo.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In one particular case on the Brennan Estate a man who was entitled to a holding, because he was a herd or caretaker, got a holding of approximately 31 acres.  That is all very well, but it seems a rather strange thing in a district where, among 37 land-holders, the highest valuation that I can find is £10.  There are only four persons approaching the £10 valuation and that would leave 33 tenants, some having as low a valuation as £2 15s. 0d.</P>
    <P>There is one particular case, that of Michael Prendergast.  He is a married man and he has six children.  He has a valuation of £3.  He did not get an addition of land, although he is actually resident on the Fitzgerald-Kenney Estate.  I spoke to some Land Commission officials about that and the reply I got was that this man sold an addition he got previously.  Perhaps I misunderstood what they said, but I was told that this man never got an addition.  That was his statement to me.  He sold a portion of land by virtue of the terms of his father's will.  He sold it in order to discharge a legacy due to one of his sisters under his father's will.  If it was wrong for him to sell that land, why did the Land Commission give him permission to do so?  If it was wrong for him to sell, they should not have given him permission to do so.  The valuation of the piece of land sold is £2 15s. 0d.  That would have left him with a total valuation of £5 15s. 0d. if he did not sell it. As I have said, he sold it in order to clear off a debt due under the terms of his father's will.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2635" /> I submit that the Land Commission did wrong when they gave him authority to sell it.  They should not allow sub-division. I have repeatedly stated here that the main purpose of the Land Commission should be to bring up uneconomic land-holders to a certain economic level and prevent sub-division of the holdings, such as happened in the old landlord days, resulting in the rundale system and the uneconomic plight of many land-holders along the western seaboard.  Those are the particulars of Michael Prendergast's case.</P>
    <P>Take the case of Martin Quinn, a man with £2 5s. valuation.  He is the man who bought the land from Michael Prendergast some seven or ten years ago.  He is a single man, middle-aged, about 40 years or so.  He got no addition of land.  There is one man in the locality with a valuation of £7.  The Minister may say that he has not a £7 valuation.  This man has got an addition of 32 statute acres, side by side with 31 acres.  This man's son owns land, bringing the total valuation to £7.  This particular farmer has as good as handed over the place to his son.</P>
    <P>A man with £7 valuation has got an addition of 32 statute acres, which will leave his total valuation something like £15, while the man with £2 15s. valuation is by-passed.  The married man with the six children is by-passed. Then there are three persons, Thomas Murphy, Michael Mooney and Patrick Joyce, with valuations round about £5, £5 10s., or £5 15s., and they are all by-passed.  If that is not unfair distribution I do not know what it is.  I should like the Minister to make a clear statement on this matter.</P>
    <P>It is rumoured amongst those people &mdash;they told me about it, but I do not know whether it is true or not&mdash;that there was a plan originally drafted by the Land Commission to allot the land evenly among the tenants, bringing them all to a certain level, and then they would wait until further land became available for division.  Is that true?  Is it true that the original plan to give land to all of them, bringing them to a valuation which would <Col N="2636" /> amount to £6 13s. each, was scrapped and, if so, why was it scrapped?  Was there such an original plan and, if so, what were the terms of it?</P>
    <P>It seems a very strange thing that one man can get 35 acres and another 32 acres.  One was a post office official, who should be debarred from getting lands.  Another post office official in a nearby locality was debarred from getting an addition on the Moore estate, simply because he was a postal official.  Is there a Land Commission regulation which prevents postal officials or people drawing salaries from Departments of State from getting additions of land?  If so, why is it this man got 17 statute acres?  I submit there has been very unfair discrimination in these cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied to a further question, when I asked him whether the Irish Land Commission have in view the acquisition of additional land for the relief of congestion in the Newtown and Clogher areas of County Mayo.  The Minister said: &ldquo;The Land Commission have made preliminary investigations in regard to the acquisition or resumption by them of lands totalling 152 acres in the Newtown and Clogher areas, County Mayo.&rdquo;  I wonder where these lands are.  I reside in that area and I do not know any other land unless the demesne land of Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney.  If the Minister goes into the valuation of that he will find it is so high that he will have a job to get anybody to take it.  In passing I might mention that if paper is not too scarce in the Irish Land Commission, they might supply answers which are a little clearer to Parliamentary questions.  Although my eyesight is good I find it difficult to read some of the typescript.  I want to know why some people got a huge division of land while others were by-passed.  I want to know why five men were turned down and did not get land. That is unfair discrimination.  If 31 statute acres of Brennan's farm were considered good enough for a holding why did a man get 32 statute acres beside it, the land being of the same quality?  It is good land and runs across the valley.  Why did a post office official get 17 statute acres?  I admit that he surrendered four on his <Col N="2637" /> old holding.  Is there a regulation against that in the Land Commission? Frankly it is difficult on many occasions to follow their activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan) Seán Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not responsible for the selection of allottees, for the distribution of land or, within the regulations, as to how the Land Commission propose at any time to distribute it.  I was not present in the Dáil yesterday when the questions were answered.  Question 34 reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Lands if he will state by what method the valuation of allotments is determined in cases of subdivision.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That question has a definite meaning and might be answered in a very few words.  Presumably in putting down the question Deputy Blowick was not quite clear as to the exact information he needed.  In order to clarify the position the word &ldquo;valuation&rdquo; might be used or accepted as forming part of his question and is answered very clearly.  I do not know what lack of information there is in the answer. This is the answer:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Deputy's question is open to a number of interpretations.  If by &lsquo;valuation&rsquo; he means &lsquo;poor law valuation&rsquo;, such is determined by the General Valuation Office with reference to each individual parcel provided by the division of lands acquired by the Land Commission.  If the information sought is the resale value of parcels on which the agreements for repayment of stipulated purchase moneys or advances are based, this is obtained by an acre-by-acre survey of the land.  Or the Deputy may be concerned with the comparative value of parcels as allotted to one applicant as against another in somewhat similar circumstances. This aspect of the matter is governed by general land settlement policy, conditioned by local and personal factors, and having as the primary aim the creation of the greatest number of suitable economic holdings possible.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be a very cranky and unreasonable person who would think such an answer inadequate to the question <Col N="2638" /> put down by the Deputy.  Question 35 was as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Lands if he will state the names of those who were allotted additions on the Fitzgerald-Kenney and Brennan Estates in County Mayo; the acreage and valuation of the additions; and the valuations of the holdings of these allottees prior to the allotment of the additions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This was the reply:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An area of 125a. 2r. 5p. on the Fitzgerald-Kenney Estate, Record No. S.7508, acquired by the Land Commission under L.A. 1923 was divided in March last into 11 parcels and all allotted to tenants of uneconomic holdings.</P>
    <P>Three migrants' holdings and the resumed holding of Mrs. C. Brennan on Fitzgerald-Kenney Estate, Record No. C.D.B. 155, together with a migrant's holding on the McDermott Estate, Record No. C.D.B. 58, were simultaneously divided amongst 14 persons, 13 of these being tenants of uneconomic holdings and one being a former employee on the Brennan holding.  Of the 25 parcels allotted, 20 were given by way of addition to existing holdings, one was in exchange for a portion of an existing holding surrendered by the allottee and four were new holdings in exchange....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Land Commission in dealing with land is to provide as many economic holdings as possible. Here you had a limited quantity of land and practically an unlimited quantity of congestion.  The 152 acres were divided between 14 people.  The amount of land that could be allotted to each of these people could not be very large.  On the two holdings there were 24 additions, four new holdings were given in exchange, and one worker on the estate was given a piece of land.  I have spoken here in regard to the recent Land Act.  I pointed out to the House that there were certain categories of people, applicants for land, who could be considered by the Land Commission.  The first category is those people who lose their employment because an estate has been acquired by the Land Commission. <Col N="2639" /> They have a prior claim to any other applicant.  I explained my personal view in regard to that system of priority.  I told the House that, in my experience, men employed on estates acquired by the Land Commission and proposed to be divided, should be compensated by some other method than by giving them land.  Numbers of them have made good, but it is my personal experience that most of them do not make successful farmers.  But it is the law.  They have priority over every other claimant.  The man employed on the Fitzgerald-Kenney estate had priority over all other claimants.  He got a holding, according to the law, and according to the regulations of the Land Commission, and there can be no argument about it.</P>

All the rest of the estate, all the land that was to be divided, was given as additions to their holdings to uneconomic holders.  Has the Deputy any grievance because that was done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try, certainly. The Deputy's question reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Lands if he will state the reasons why Martin Quinn, Thomas Murphy, Patrick Joyce, Michael Prendergast and Michael Mooney were not granted additions in the recent distribution of the Fitzgerald-Kenney and Brennan estates in County Mayo.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The applications of the persons mentioned by the Deputy were considered, but the Land Commission were satisfied on the information before them concerning their circumstances and the circumstances of other applicants, and having regard to the area of land available for division, that it was not possible to allot parcels to these people.  When there is a limited amount of land and when there is an unlimited number of applicants, surely somebody <Col N="2640" /> must be out of luck.  The Deputy does not believe that I or the Land Commission can work the miracle of the loaves and the fishes. There is a certain limited amount of land.  Every man who got a holding, other than the man employed on the estate who was entitled to get priority, was a congest, lived on an uneconomic holding and had an addition made to his holding, as is good practice, which the Deputy should know and does know.</P>
    <P>Everything was done according to law, according to regulation, and, in this particular case, no matter what difficulty I am in about any other matters, I am standing on quite firm ground.  The leader of a political Party in this House, whatever other qualities he may lack and however poor his Party, should at least have some glimmer of an idea of political strategy. He should select a field where there is some cover, some protection, and the possibility of a safe retreat, but Deputy Blowick seems to have never heard of political strategy.  He selects a field where there is neither cover nor protection, and from which he must, at best, beat an ignominious retreat.</P>
