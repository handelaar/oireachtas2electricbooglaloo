    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Incidence of Silicosis.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he has received a communication, from the trade union representing the miners in Castlecomer, stating that some of those men are believed to be suffering from the industrial disease, silicosis, and requesting him to make provision, under Section 79 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, for such cases; whether he has caused inquiries to be made into this matter, and, if so, what was the nature of the report he received; whether the doctor who attends these miners was interviewed in connection with the matter, and if not, if he will now make further inquiries, so as to obtain the necessary proofs of the existence of silicosis amongst the miners in the Irish anthracite coal industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received a communication from the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union stating that some of its members employed as coal miners in the Castlecomer area were believed to be suffering from silicosis and requesting that a scheme be established under Section 79 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, for the payment of compensation in respect of this disease.</P>
      <P>This matter has been fully considered, although I did not regard it as necessary to interview the doctor who attends the Castlecomer miners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that there is little <Col N="150" /> likelihood of silicosis being contracted in coal mines in this country.  Silicosis is a miner's industrial disease in Great Britain, but that is due to the fact that coal workings there are very deep and necessitate boring through silica rock, which contains more than 80 per cent. of free silica.  In this country coal mines are shallow and any boring is done through shale, which is practically free of silica.</P>
    <P>The number of alleged cases of silicosis from all causes reported during the past ten years was four.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that conditions do not require the taking of action as proposed by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider it worth while to make further inquiries?  The doctor who is attending many of the miners is a man of very wide experience in the Welsh coalfields.  Of the 28 deaths in this mining area in the last seven years, almost one-half have been certified as being due to bronchitis which, of course, the Minister knows, has been a bad description in this country for some years past for silicosis in the mining industry.  I should like the Minister to be fair to these men.  Will the Minister not agree that it is difficult to get men for coal-mining in this country and that it is becoming increasingly difficult?  If he fails to make fuller inquiries as to the effect of the work on the young men there, he is not likely to have the industry carried on. The men feel very strongly about the Minister's action in the matter.  They are anxious that he should make further inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the circumstances that could produce silicosis do not exist in Castlecomer, certainly not in such manner as to justify making silicosis an industrial disease under the Workmen's Compensation Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the doctor has certified in recent times at least one definite case of silicosis at the Castlecomer mines, would the Minister not consider making further inquiries?  The Minister will not compromise himself in any way by making <Col N="151" /> all the inquiries which would appear to be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of cases of deaths alleged to be due to this disease in ten years was four and, in the circumstances, there does not appear to be need to institute an insurance scheme such as is contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not only a matter of the Minister scheduling this disease? It does not involve the State in any expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no, but it is making the employer liable for compensation where death is attributable to that cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister does not want more than four deaths in ten years before he schedules a disease as an industrial disease?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not fair to put upon an employer an obligation to pay compensation on the death of a workman unless it can be clearly shown that the death was due to a disease associated with the workman's employment. There is nothing associated with coal-mining employment in this country which would make this disease one which should be regarded as an industrial disease associated with that industry under the Workmen's Compensation Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Minister's intention to be more considerate for the employer than for the miner, the workman?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter of being considerate; I am trying to be fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Where does the Minister or his advisers believe that the miner inhales silica, if it is not in a coalmine? He does not inhale it walking down the street in Kilkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a number of diseases and people die of diseases of various kinds but they are not industrial diseases for the purpose of the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  In Great Britain this disease is an industrial <Col N="152" /> disease for the coal-mining industry because of the circumstances under which that industry is carried on there. These circumstances do not exist here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose the Minister finds that there is a number of cases of chronic pulmonary congestion resulting from the ingestion of silica and that these occur amongst persons who are coal miners, does he propose to base his refusal to schedule this as an industrial disease on the assumption that by coincidence a coal-miner in this country did what no human being ever did in the history of the world before, that is, ingest into his lungs, while walking down the main street of Kilkenny, a quantity of silica sufficient to give him silicosis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems obvious to me that Deputy Dillon does not know what he is talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Coal-mining in Great Britain involves boring through silica rock.  That is why this disease is scheduled under the Workmen's Compensation Act there.  That does not apply here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister ever examined it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>How many inspections has the Minister carried out there in the last 12 months within the meaning of the Factory Acts?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Were the dependents of the four persons who died paid compensation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the importance of expanding poultry and egg production, he will make an allowance of kerosene available during the summer months for incubators and brooders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="153" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the kerosene supply position has improved, supplies will still be restricted and it will not be possible to meet the full requirements for all essential purposes.  I am not in a position to make an allowance available for incubators and brooders which, I am advised, is not essential during the summer months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it was impossible for poultry-keepers to obtain new incubators during the winter season, because they were not in supply?  At present, they are obtainable from merchants and a number of persons have purchased them.  It is very discouraging to those who purchased incubators and brooders to find that they can get no kerosene. Surely the Minister should make an allowance of kerosene for those who purchased new incubators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFlorenceODris" hpid="Mr. O'Driscoll Mr. O'Driscoll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>Has not the Minister for Agriculture repeatedly advised farmers to go in for poultry-keeping on a big scale?  If the farmers cannot get kerosene for those incubators and brooders, what will be the position?  We cannot have one section of the Government advocating poultry-raising and another section blocking it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFlorenceODris" hpid="Mr. O'Driscoll Mr. O'Driscoll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he will be in a position in the near future to increase the allowances of tea and sugar to catering establishments in tourist districts; and whether the supply position is such as to permit him to grant similar allowances to persons who are anxious to start catering businesses in such districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Allowances of tea for catering establishments will be increased proportionately with the increase of the domestic ration, recently announced, which will come into operation next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supply position does not permit <Col N="154" /> of an increase in the allowance of sugar for catering establishments.</P>
    <P>The answer to the second part of the Deputy's question is in the negative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFlorenceODris" hpid="Mr. O'Driscoll Mr. O'Driscoll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say why the ration of sugar cannot be increased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there is not enough sugar.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFlorenceODris" hpid="Mr. O'Driscoll Mr. O'Driscoll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give any consideration to the West Cork district, which, in the circumstances, is in special need of an allocation of sugar?  I advise the Minister to go down there himself when he gets holidays.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>The question on the Paper is as to the amount to the credit of the Hospitals Trust Fund and how it was invested.  As Deputy O'Leary mentioned, there is a great deal of what I believe to be irresponsible talk about this fund.  Would it not be well to issue an authoritative paper setting out how much is in the fund, how it is invested, how it has been expended to date and the decisions taken as to its future expenditure, so that rumours of the character referred to by Deputy O'Leary may be dealt with effectively?</P>

      <P>Most of the information for which the Deputy asks has been published in one form or another from time to time.

      <P>The new standards of road construction provide for the inclusion of margins which could be used by horse-drawn traffic where the carriageway is for any reason unsuitable for such traffic.  A considerable time may, however, elapse before the new road plans are fully implemented. In the meantime, the question of adapting roads that have a waterproof surface for horse traffic is constantly under the consideration of both the county surveyors and the Department.

      <P>The estate of D. G. Fitzgerald, one of the former Congested District Board's large estates, comprises holdings in 38 townlands including the lands of Drunganagh. Many of the holdings are in rundale and before resale can take place a comprehensive scheme of rearrangement will be necessary.  Some migration has already taken place and the vacated lands are being used by the adjoining tenants, but to effect any considerable improvement in conditions more is necessary and the Land Commission propose to migrate more tenants when suitable lands can be made available for them elsewhere. The process of migration and rearrangement is difficult and tedious and has been hampered in recent years by shortage of staff due to emergency conditions.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported last night, I was dealing with the question of relief of rates on land, the medium of agricultural production and one of our primary national assets. I stated that not only would it be a great encouragement to the agricultural community, and particularly to the smallholders, but also that the concessions given to ratings over £20 would be an incentive to those who are giving more employment on the land. It will also assist them in providing employment for members of their own family who, after reaching a certain age, would remain on to help on the land until they got suitable employment elsewhere.  The increased grant in that respect is undoubtedly welcome and perhaps long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the concession in regard to the tax on petrol, some Deputies remarked that petrol used for pleasure should be charged at a higher rate than petrol used in works of national development, such as for <Col N="166" /> the carriage of turf and transport of that kind.  I pointed out the difficulty of administering any such variation in charges and expressed the opinion that it would only give a new lease of life to black marketeers and that a system of control by quantity rather than by price is the more desirable.  The point was raised as to whether Córas Iompair Éireann and other carrying companies would pass on the reliefs they were getting in that regard.  We know from Press announcements that Córas Iompair Éireann have already notified the public that not only will there be reduced charges but that they hope for improved transport conditions from July onwards.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the concession given in order to encourage mining and scientific research.  We all know the importance of produce from the surface of the land but I think the mineral wealth of the country has not been sufficiently explored.  As a specific instance of that, there is an area in my constituency, Ringabella, where some five or six years before the famine 400 hands were employed in the lead mining industry.  The mine is still there and is marked on the map.  I do not know whether the famine was responsible for the collapse of the industry but I should like to have the question examined as to whether that mine is in a workable condition and whether its present-day development would be likely to be remunerative.  I should like to have that question and other matters of a similar nature examined.</P>
    <P>Concerning the tax on dancing which was referred to by Deputy Anthony and some other Deputies, whilst I welcome the relief given to organised bodies such as sporting and charitable institutions who keep a certain control over these functions, and who are able to raise funds to finance notable local projects as a result of these dances and ceilidhthe, I do not think that the relief should be extended to the commercial dance halls.  Those who set up such dance halls should, I think, continue to pay the taxes.  Whilst every encouragement should be given to the activities of such bodies as Muintir na Tíre, sporting, hurling and football <Col N="167" /> clubs in the various parishes, I think this form of commercialised dancing should be definitely discouraged.  The taxes that would be derived from such dances and amusements I would be inclined to devote towards the assistance of the widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions.  These are of a diminishing number and certainly the present award to them is very small indeed.</P>
    <P>I welcome particularly the provision of loans for housing and I hope local authorities will be able to proceed as quickly as possible with housing schemes, particularly in the rural areas.  Some Deputies made reference to the difficulty which the agricultural community experience in procuring labour to carry on their industry.  That is a very well-known fact and the provision of labourers' houses throughout the country will do something, at any rate, towards keeping people on the land and providing labour for that important industry.  I wish to congratulate the Minister again on the vigorous tone of his pronouncement and the very confident note he struck in recommending the Budget to the House.</P>

      <P>The main good feature of this Budget is the relief which is to be afforded to the agricultural community. It certainly goes to show that the Government have accepted the view of all Parties in this House as to the necessity for making this concession. Still I believe the Government could have extended this relief somewhat further.  I think they have not gone far enough by merely relieving rates on holdings up to a valuation of £20.  If they had extended this relief to another £50 of the valuation, the benefits of the concession would have a much wider application and would tend to encourage the bigger farmers to make more use of their land and to provide much more employment.  Still, as I say, the relief is a step in the right direction, one that will encourage the farming industry generally and encourage the people on the land to remain on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the reduction in petrol tax, I do not exactly agree with the <Col N="168" /> Deputy who preceded me, that the reduction will give general relief.  It certainly will not relieve to any great extent the most deserving section of the people.  It will give a much larger measure of relief to the combines and the big users.  It will give comparatively little relief to the smaller users. I believe that if the tax were left on petrol and the road tax were abolished, the relief would be more evenly distributed and its administration would cause no serious inconvenience to civil servants in calculating the way in which it should be distributed.  If the road tax were abolished and the petrol tax were allowed to remain, those using petrol would then have to pay taxes proportionate to the use which they made of their vehicles.  In the same way those who would use their cars only once or twice in the week would pay only a proportionate share of the taxes.  The firm with the big business would be paying its full share of the road tax, simply because it was doing a big business in the country. That is my view as regards the road tax.</P>
    <P>The 1d. per lb. which the Minister is taking off sugar will give a certain amount of relief to the poorer sections of the people.  Still, the amount of relief given will be small.  If one takes an average family of five it will work out at only 17/- a year.  Therefore, one is driven to the conclusion that the poorest section of the community, labourers and others, are only getting relief under this Budget to the extent of between 15/ and 17/6 a week, while the wealthier sections of the people are getting relief in their income-tax, surtax payments, and in other ways. In my opinion, a greater amount of relief should have been given in the Budget to the poorer sections of our people.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to find that the Minister, in his Budget statement, made no reference to the old age pensioners. He is not doing anything to add to the original amount given to them.  He did not take into account in his Budget statement the motion relating to old age pensions which was discussed in the House four or five weeks ago.  No consideration has been given <Col N="169" /> to that motion.  As regards the supplementary allowance given to old age pensioners during the emergency, I think that the Minister should have made provision in the Budget to make that a permanent increase to the old age pensioners, and not have continued the method of distributing it which was adopted during the emergency. The method by which the old age pensioners have to collect that little supplementary allowance is not at all pleasing to the people who are depending on it.  It also has to be remembered that, during the emergency, the Government put a tax on the county councils so far as this supplementary allowance is concerned, to the extent that the county councils have to meet one-quarter of the cost of it in their own areas.  In my opinion, the Minister should have abolished that Order altogether, and made provision in the Budget to pay this supplementary allowance to old age pensioners in the same way as the supplementary allowance is given to widows and orphans.</P>
    <P>As regards the additional duty of 12/6 a gallon on whiskey, I am sure that the Minister and members of the House are aware that the quantity of whiskey available to supply the needs of the various licensed traders is certainly not more than 80 per cent. &mdash;it is possibly a good way under 80 per cent. &mdash;of what would be necessary to meet normal sales.  While that is so, the Minister is putting a tax on that 80 per cent.  In other words, it would appear to me that he is really putting a tax on an article that he has not got.  He is simply putting it on the quantity he has to meet what would be the full quota for the trade if that were available.  Therefore, I think that this additional tax of 12/6 a gallon on whiskey is one which should not be imposed.</P>
    <P>These are the only remarks that I have to make on the Budget which has been so well debated.  While the Minister is giving a few million pounds by way of a reduction to the taxpayers, he is making provision in his Budget to collect an equivalent sum, or perhaps more, in the way of customs duties.  In that way, the <Col N="170" /> amount of the tax levied on the people in the coming year will be practically the same, if not more than, it was last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Domhnall Ua Donnchadha</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like other Deputies, welcome the provision in the Budget which proposes to give an abatement in the rates.  I do so because it will give the county councils an opportunity of making provision for two great needs.  A number of Deputies have mentioned one need, namely, the provision of more and more labourers' cottages.  I am sure that if Deputy O'Donnell were speaking he would remind the House of the necessity of making provision for more and more water supplies.  If Deputies look at the map they will observe that about the wettest part of Ireland is in my constituency.  That is the district from Killarney to Glengariff, but may I remind them that, as far as drinking water is concerned, it is remarkably deficient.  This provision in the Budget will give the county council an opportunity of going ahead with water supply schemes.  I agree that it is a pity the Minister did not think of the old age pensioners by abolishing the means test and making the supplementary allowance which they have been receiving a permanent addition to their pensions.</P>
      <P>The Minister has decided to remove the tax on dances.  The reason given for its removal is that it led to practices which are not to be commended &mdash;that it led to dishonesty.  Therefore, the Minister thought it wiser to abolish it altogether.  Wherever there is a means test, which gives an opportunity for the making of a reasonable excuse, people are inclined to resort to the same practices as those which led the Minister to abolish the tax on dances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has reduced the price of turf in the non-turf areas by 10/- a ton.  I have no doubt the people in those areas will welcome that reduction. I think that 54/- should be quite sufficient for a ton of turf anywhere. May I say that in the turf-producing areas the Minister's announcement created something bordering on a scare, because it was generally believed <Col N="171" /> that if not at the moment, then in the immediate future, there would be a corresponding reduction in the price of turf to the producer.  The Minister says that the reduction in the price of turf in the non-turf areas will cost the Exchequer £250,000.  I take it that he is going to subsidise the production of turf to that extent, and that at the moment there will be no appreciable reduction in the price of turf to the producers.  It would be disastrous if, at this season of the year and under such favourable weather conditions, a scare such as I have referred to, should prevent the maximum amount of turf being produced.</P>
    <P>Not very long ago we had in this House a Bill dealing with turf.  I have in mind a matter that I referred to when I was speaking on that measure, which dealt with the production of machine-won turf.  I reminded the House on that occasion that the maximum amount of machine-won turf produced, even when it would reach the peak in 1955, would be barely over 1,000,000 tons.  For years to come, even with the turf rationed as it is at the moment, that will leave a gap of 4,000,000 or 5,000,000 tons to be produced in the form of hand-won turf. We have two sources of supply of hand-won turf, the county councils and the private producers.  The county councils were never meant to be turf producers. It was purely as an emergency measure that they, having certain machinery at their disposal, were called upon by the Government to exert themselves.  They were addressed by the Taoiseach and appealed to by the leaders of the various Parties in the country to put their best effort into the production of turf and they did a great job.  What worries me, however, is the control of hand-won turf.</P>

      <P>Reference was made to this matter by the Minister for Finance.  He said that there will be a sum of £250,000 devoted <Col N="172" /> to the reduction of the price of turf.  I do not think I am going outside the subject under discussion if I refer briefly to that.  We have the private producers and the county councils producing hand-won turf side by side.  The county councils can very easily dispose of their turf because they have a guaranteed price and their turf is bought by the organisation set up here for the purpose of filling up dumps in the city.  That is quite all right, but the turf produced by private producers is not produced on an organised basis and that is why I should like to remind the House that if the maximum results are to accrue, immediate steps must be taken to see that the private producers are encouraged, that the production of turf by private producers will be organised on a proper basis and that it will not be left to local agents and T.D.s to be going from one Department to another, from the railway to the Turf Board, and from the Turf Board to Fuel Importers and, maybe, to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the object of having wagons provided for the transport of the turf. That matter could be easily organised.</P>

      <P>This Budget, the first to be presented by the present Minister for Finance and, incidentally, the first I have listened to in this House, has, as one would expect, been welcomed by some Deputies and criticised by others.  How much heed the Minister will give to the criticisms that have been made with regard to the Budget's limitations and how much attention he will pay to the appeals for more encouragement and help, I do not know.  I regard this Budget as far in excess of what this little country can afford to pay.  It would be quite all right to have a £53,000,000 Budget if we had 5,000,000 or 6,000,000 people to pay it.  The position at the moment is that we have a declining population of 2,500,000 or 2,750,000 people to shoulder this burden and I think it is a bit heavy for them.  The Government are asking too much from the people. It was all very fine during the war period.  We then had to face extraordinary things and we had to bear very heavy burdens.  Perhaps we were very lucky that we did come out of it that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we had some assurance from the Minister for Finance and other members of the Government that when the war was over there would be some easing up.  All the easing up we have got is the little consolation that instead of this Budget being increased by £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 it has gone up by only £1,500,000 or £2,000,000. Perhaps we can look at it in this way, <Col N="174" /> that instead of driving the country to bankruptey at 100 miles an hour, they have cut the pace down to 50 or 60 miles an hour.</P>
    <P>In his haste to please different sections of the community, the Minister has made some reductions in various things.  First, he had to give some concession to the moneyed classes and that came in the shape of 1/- reduction in income-tax.  Then he had to give a certain concession to the section of the people who were beginning to show their teeth a bit within the last few years&mdash;that is, the agricultural community. He gave them a slight concession in the form of a reduction in rates.  He did make an honest effort to please all classes of the people, but I can assure him that he will have to make a greater effort before he satisfies the people in the way they wish to be satisfied.</P>
    <P>The reduction given in rates could have gone a little further.  I think we could have complete derating up to the first £20 of valuation.  If the Minister had gone a little further and had taken a full leaf out of the book of the Clann na Talmhan Party, he would not be sorry because he would find that such a proposition would be received with greater enthusiasm by the agricultural community, by big farmers and small farmers.  I must say, however, that the concessions given, while they do not go all the way, are at least some little relief.  The honour and glory for the introduction of this relief has been claimed by all sides.  Fine Gael maintain that, in their time, they often hammered at this question, but received no satisfaction.  I think, however, that the motion put forward by this Party a month or two ago must have made a very strong impression on the Minister for Finance because he took such a remarkable jump away from the answer he gave on that occasion to the answer given in his Budget in the form of this relief.</P>
    <P>As agriculture is our greatest source of national income, it should get even more consideration, but there is no doubt that it is very hard to give any advice as to the best way in which to improve agriculture.  One section may <Col N="175" /> say that nationalisation of the land, State control of everything, would give excellent results; another section may say that it is not possible to have that and that State marketing of all goods would be the best policy.  I think there should be closer co-operation between the Government and the producers under the present system, and that that co-operation would greatly improve marketing conditions and the prices secured by the agricultural producer.</P>
    <P>There is at present a demand from all sides of the House for increased rates of wages in agriculture.  It was pointed out here yesterday that men on the land would gladly pay increased wages if production could afford it.  I know that, in my constituency, there are very few farmers owning less than 20 acres of land who can afford to employ any man.  It is not possible for them to employ men on their farms with the prices they are getting for their produce.  When large farmers, in order to comply with the Tillage Order and so on, have to employ men, it is only right and fair that they should be forced to pay a certain wage. The wage being paid is not, and cannot be classified as, a living wage, and there is an awful lot to be learned by one section and taught by another before we can bring agriculture up to a standard equal to that prevailing in certain agricultural countries on the Continent.</P>
    <P>A Deputy yesterday put his finger on the real cause of the poverty of this country, and the Minister, in introducing his Budget, also put his finger on it &mdash;emigration.  I do not know whether this emigration problem is to remain with us or whether it can be stopped. That is a question which requires a very careful answer, but the manhood and womanhood of this country flying from this land represent the flight of the real wealth of the country.  Somebody has estimated that every human being who leaves this island represents a loss of £1,000; others say he represents a loss of £600; but if the loss were only £100, it is too big a drain.  The only way that I can see in which emigration can be checked is by <Col N="176" /> putting a greater number of people into agricultural production, or, in shorter and plainer words, putting more people on the land&mdash;by creating more land through schemes of drainage and so on and by getting one industry to interlock with another.  In that way, we could provide work for a greater number of our population.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that he has already listened to this and that it is propaganda, as he was inclined to say yesterday, but it is not propaganda, and it is no credit to any Government that the citizens of a country should have to migrate.  While the war was in progress and while there was inflation and high wages in England, nobody would stay at home.  How could anybody expect the agricultural worker or the road worker to stay at home in those circumstances?  The road worker receives 36/-, £2 or £2 2s. per week which would be all right if it were a steady wage all over the year, but how many road workers can say on New Year's Day that they will have steady employment, week in and week out, until Christmas Eve of that year? There are not 100 of them in the whole of Ireland and how can such a man keep a wife and children on 36/- or £2 a week which is all he is allowed to get, and that on the basis of casual employment?  While any system of that type is allowed to operate, the problem of emigration will continue.</P>
    <P>I noticed that various good intentions were expressed in this Budget&mdash;&ldquo;we must do this and we must do that.&rdquo;  What we should say, instead of &ldquo;we must,&rdquo; is &ldquo;we can and we will&rdquo; do such and such a thing, because it is no use putting off until to-morrow what should have been tackled ten years ago.  It is no use whatever to say that the people are satisfied with the different Departments or the manner in which they are being conducted.  Past events should have opened the eyes of the Government and should have made them realise that something will have to be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given a reduction in the price of petrol, a concession which will be welcomed by everybody who <Col N="177" /> owns a motor car.  To a certain extent, it will be welcomed to me, but how many members of the community will be affected by that reduction?  Is it not a relief for the rich man, for the man who can afford to keep a car?  It is no relief whatever for the man who cannot.  Why should he worry about the price of petrol?  What would it matter to him if petrol was 15/- a gallon?  It is, perhaps, as has been pointed out, a little concession to a certain company.  Whether that is so I do not know.  While on the question of petrol I should like to ask what will be the position of petrol retailers, garage proprietors, etc., who will be carrying forward stocks of petrol from April and May into the month of June.  How will they be affected when the reduction comes into operation? Will they have to bear the loss of the 6d. per gallon or will there be any allowance made to them by some new system which will be brought into force?</P>
    <P>Everybody welcomes the reduction in the price of turf.  I think it was the Deputy who spoke last who said that when the reduction comes into force the producer should not be affected.  There is a great difference between the price paid to the producer of turf and the price paid by the consumer. From £5s. to £1 10s. is paid to the producer, while the turf costs the consumer £3 4s.  I hold that this reduction in price could have been made during the last four or five years and that there would have been ample profits for all.  I think that Fuel Importers, Limited, or whoever controls the sale of turf, could have supplied turf at 50/- per ton and still have a sufficient profit, considering the thousands and thousands of tons that have been dealt with in the last four or five years.</P>
    <P>Another concession which would have been of more benefit to the poorer section of the community, as was pointed out by a Labour Deputy yesterday, is a reduction in the price of flour.  Why has there not been some reduction in the price of flour?  The poor man with a large family finds that buying flour costs him a very big sum every month.  I think it should <Col N="178" /> be possible to make some concession in that respect.  Then there is another section of the community over which there are more tears shed than any other section and I am sure if the Minister is anyway generous he will make some provision for them.  I refer to the old age pensioners.  Every Deputy who spoke, no matter from what side of the House, has made an appeal for them, and it is hardly necessary for me to say anything on their behalf.  There are some 146,000 old age pensioners of whom 22,500 receive less than 10/- per week.  If the 146,000 were in receipt of 10/- per week it would not be so bad.  If the Minister would allow 10/- per week, little as it is, to these 22,500 it would be some concession at any rate, or if he would make the extra 1/6 or 2/- permanent it would go some way to satisfy those people.  We have not seen any move in that direction.  On account of the general feeling in this House I think the Minister sooner or later will have to make some concession to that section of the community who seem to have been forgotten for such a long time.</P>
    <P>As to the removal of the tax on dances and ceilidhe, I will neither criticise nor praise that.  That will cost £65,000 this year and £95,000 in a full year.  I notice that some of that is offset by a reduction in travelling and other expenses of customs and excise officials who had to visit these dance halls and occasionally attend the district court.  From that it would seem that a good part of the money which was collected as a result of the tax on dance halls did not find its way into the Exchequer but into the pockets of officials who had to be paid for collecting it.  I think we should learn a lesson from that.  We could abolish a lot of taxation without any great effect on the Exchequer, because the Government could get rid of a lot of officials in that way.  The country could be run on a different system and at a far less cost if we had less officialdom. I do not want to criticise the civil servants as I know that the average civil servant starts at a low salary which goes up by small increments, so that he has to spend many <Col N="179" /> years in the service before he reaches what can be called a satisfactory salary.  Nevertheless, I think there is too much expenditure and extravagance in connection with administration.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I think this Budget has caused people to give a sigh of relief.  The general feeling is that it is a bad Budget but that it could be a lot worse.  It is not as good as we expected, but it is slightly better than we have been used to.  I do not know whether it would be possible to bring taxation in this country down to £50,000,000 again, much less to bring it below £50,000,000.  If we can increase our industrial and agricultural output to meet this taxation all will be well.</P>
    <P>In this Budget the Minister has forgotten another section of the people that I have not heard any speaker say anything about&mdash;perhaps it may seem strange for a Clann na Talmhan Deputy to say something on their behalf&mdash;and that is the town tenants.  They have got very little relief in their rates.  In fact, they have got no relief in their rates from any Government, and in the urban areas and in the large towns where the rate is considerably higher than the agricultural rate is in the rural areas those people definitely have a great grievance.  They have got no relief of any kind and the possibility is that they will get no relief in the future.  At least that is the position under this Budget.  No provision whatsoever is made for them.  My only regret is that the Minister, when he was providing for the derating of agricultural land, did not at the same time insert some clause whereby the urban dweller would get a certain measure of relief in his rates too.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to make it quite clear that this is not a Budget suitable to a country like this.  This is a Budget which could be presented in a country of 5,000,000 to 6,000,000 people with an intensive agricultural output, or, on the other hand, a country with mineral resources and mineral wealth.  If the Minister can hold the Budget at its present level and not permit it to rise about £53,000,000 odd, it will certainly be a slight improvement on the <Col N="180" /> Budgets presented by previous Ministers for Finance, even though his figures are the highest we have had so far.  I am afraid, however, that he will not be able to hold it at that level and that he will not be able to give full value for it, and the result is that this Budget cannot be said to be a successful Budget, or one which the people of this country could accept and approve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is usual on an occasion like this to say a few words on the Budget which is, after all, the outward sign of the policy the Government intends to pursue in the coming year.  Let me say at the outset that in this imperfect world it would be impossible to find a perfect Budget.  Taking things on the whole, however, and speaking quite generally, the present Budget I think is as good as could be framed when one considers the existing circumstances of the country and the conditions that prevailed during the past five to six years.  The Minister can take credit for and is to be congratulated on the fact that he has reduced many of the impositions formerly imposed on the people of this State during the emergency and also for the reliefs he has granted in other directions, the most notable being that given to the farming community. Agriculture is, after all, the chief industry in this country and an industry upon which in fair weather and in foul the success of this country depends. The reduction in petrol will have favourable repercussions in many directions because where overhead charges are reduced that reduction will naturally be passed on to the people for whom the service is provided.  The reductions in sugar and in income-tax are equally satisfactory.  The reduction in income-tax will benefit not alone, as many people seem to suppose, the rich but also the great bulk of the working classes.  Under present legislation in this country, just as on the other side, many thousands of working men are compelled to pay income-tax.  If the old people of long ago could come back to-day and see this Budget and observe that this little country is able now to put up a sum of £53,000,000 a year they would raise their hands in holy horror, comparing it with their time when they <Col N="181" /> considered the country was over-taxed within the ambit of the entire 32 counties, some 35 years ago, when taxation reached £11,000,000.  But it would seem that all the old theories which governed finance in the past have been exploded and, notwithstanding the high burden of taxation at the present time, the country seems to be able adequately to carry on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point that I would like to emphasise in regard to this Budget &mdash;that is, financing as it affects housing in the future.  The Minister stated that interest charges would be reduced from 4¼ to 2½ per cent.  Amongst other things he stated that a payment of 1/4 weekly would be sufficient to meet the interest charges on £100 per annum. That statement is somewhat misleading inasmuch as that 1/4 really means £3 10s. 0d. per annum and, in order to get the really true picture of what housing is going to cost, it is necessary to multiply the 1/4 by anything from seven to eight because the cost of houses now is somewhere in the region of £700 to £800; that would mean eight times 1/4, which amounts to 12/8, or something in the region of £25 or £26 a year in order to meet interest charges alone.  When one considers the present cost of building&mdash;and this is something of which the Minister is well aware&mdash;there has been a very progressive and steep rise in the costs of building in the last year.  By making a calculation of the cost of building at the present moment and comparing it with the cost some few years back one will find that there is really very little difference and very little relief even though interest charges are reduced from 4½ to 2½ per cent.  Some eight or nine years ago it was possible to build a house for £450 or £500.  That house to-day will cost £800.  The Government will only pay a subsidy of £300&mdash;so far as I can gather from this Budget&mdash;and in the urban areas of £350, of the capital cost of the house which means that the urban dweller will have to carry the difference between the £350 and the total cost. That would be somewhere in the region of £400; the urban dweller will have to carry the full interest charges on that.  I would like the Minister to <Col N="182" /> explain in greater detail what is really meant by this transition development fund.  As far as I can understand this is a fund out of which the Minister will advance to the urban authorities or the county councils, as the case may be, a sum sufficient to meet the increased cost of building above what might be considered a reasonable price. Now the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is very broad in its interpretation.  Nobody can know what is really meant by it. With a view to speaking of the erection of houses I think the Minister should explain in greater detail what exactly he means by that.</P>
    <P>Whilst welcoming the reduction in so far as the interest charges are concerned one must again take into consideration the progressive increase in building that has taken place.  I think the Minister is well aware of that fact because in his Budget one can see a little reference, which is thrown out as a sort of S.O.S. to those engaged in the building of houses, whether as builders, workmen or anyone else, that they, too, must make some contribution in addition to that which has been made already by the joint stock banks in so far as they have agreed to reduce the interest charges.  I think that is very important.  It will have repercussions in many other spheres. Housing is one of the things that vitally affects public health and it is one of the things which is vital to the Public Health Bill at present before the Dáil.  Anyone who has any practical experience of mixing with the average working-class family knows that it is money wasted to pass Public Health Bills in this House and at the same time build houses, the rents of which will be 7/-, 8/- or 9/- a week.  I am one of those people who have believed always in feeding a family well. It is no use prescribing medicines or making provision for the medical examination of children if, at the same time, they are unable to procure proper food.  In my opinion, it will be impossible to achieve that object if the people for whom these houses are being built are asked to pay 8/-, 9/- or 10/- a week.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that will have very serious reactions in this country especially <Col N="183" /> having regard to the fact that side by side with these people there will be people, for instance, agricultural labourers, living in agricultural houses, at a rent of 1/-, whereas the rent of the new house may be 8/- or 9/- a week.  I can see trouble there. Therefore, I would ask the Minister what he proposes to do with the transition development fund in so far as the cost of building is concerned.  Instead of increasing the subsidy, he is adopting the procedure of having this fund, and I presume he will make advances to the various public bodies who desire to build houses.  In that connection I would advise the Minister to consult with the Minister for Industry and Commerce with a view to having building materials provided as cheaply as possible.  Although I am enthusiastic about the encouragement of home industry in every direction, yet if it is necessary to have cheap houses provided in this country, the Minister should open this country to all the ports of the world and let in building materials as cheaply as possible so that the building industry may be put on its feet again.  There is no use in talking about home industry when, in the case of bricks, the price is in the neighbourhood of £10 a 1,000, and the average house takes from 1,500 to 2,000.  That represents; for bricks alone, a cost of £15.  Bricks must be produced by the million.  Manufacturers of building materials must recognise that they have a duty to the people of this country and to the Government in helping to cope with the terrible problem of providing houses for the people at a rent that the people can pay.  With all respect to the Minister, who has done his best in this Budget in having loan charges reduced, I cannot see any possibility of having one house built so far as the Dundalk Urban Council or any other corporation in Ireland is concerned at the present time.  I know the Minister and the Government will be handicapped by certain matters over which they have no control, such as shortage of timber and other materials.  But the Minister should make the position much clearer in regard to his proposition for the financing of houses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="184" /> While I heartily welcome the reduction of loan charges, loan charges are not the only factor in the high cost of building.  To those who quote loan charges as being in the main responsible for high costs, my answer is: Can you explain why it is that a house which could be built for £450 ten years ago, now costs £800?  There must be some other factor than interest charges.  Therefore, while I welcome the proposal to reduce loan charges, I would impress upon the Minister the necessity of consulting the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Local Government so that this matter may be clarified and public bodies may know where they stand in relation to the financing of houses and the rents at which those houses can be let.</P>
    <P>We deplore the fact that it costs £53,000,000 to run this little country but I am conscious of the fact that in many respects possibly we ourselves have been responsible for the great increase in taxation.  There has been a tendency lately to ask the Government to do everything.  For some years past the Government have been asked to do things which could be done more efficiently by the people themselves if they had the will to do it.  The time has arrived when we must get away from that system and when we must cultivate greater independence. So far as the future is concerned, when the nations that have been at war return to normal conditions, it may not be so easy for us to find £50,000,000 or £53,000,000 per annum.  We may have to have more intercourse with the outside world. Many people who think they could live here and build a wall around this country may get a rude awakening, possibly within four or five years, which will be all to the good.</P>
    <P>This country was not created for ourselves alone.  My neighbour is all mankind.  I should like more intercourse with the outside world and to get away as soon as possible from the isolationist policy by which an effort is made to convince people in this country that they can live irrespective of what is taking place outside.  The facts are that we could not even support ourselves <Col N="185" /> at any period were it not for the things we got from other countries. It must be admitted that we could not even feed ourselves, that we did not grow sufficient wheat.  Therefore, I welcome in this Budget a return to more normal and common-sense practice. In speeches made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce he is issuing a warning to the people to be prepared, that so far as the future is concerned, we will have to meet more severe competition than we have met in the past.  The only way to do that is to practise what those on the Government Benches were so fond of preaching years ago, that is, self-reliance, the policy of Sinn Féin, which many of us are practising at the moment. Taxation could be reduced if the people did a great deal more for themselves instead of looking to the Government for everything.  The Government have themselves to blame for a great many things.  On the occasion of an election it is a case of the highest bidder.</P>
    <P>The only criticism I have to offer to the Minister in connection with this Budget is that nothing is being done for that section of the people with whom I have the greatest sympathy. I refer to the old age pensioners and widows and orphans.  There are people in receipt of pensions who have other perquisites&mdash;their family may be working for them; they may have small farms&mdash;but there are others, old men and women who have to live on 10/- a week.  Thirty-five years ago the old person could get a half-glass of whiskey for 2d.  Now it costs 1/1.  The old person is as much entitled to a half-glass of whiskey as any other person There has been no increase in the pension. That is due to a great extent to the selfishness of people.  It would be a grand thing if people tried to do something for those who are not so well off.  The tendency in this country and in the world is to make those who are comfortable more comfortable and those who are poor, poorer still.  That is particularly true of old age pensioners and widows and orphans. Just imagine a widow trying to rear a family on 6/- or 8/- a week.  There is a section in the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act which stipulates that, <Col N="186" /> unless a widow is 55 years of age, she must have a certain number of children under 14 to be entitled to a pension. It is about time the Minister for Finance had a word with whomsoever is responsible for that section with a view to doing away with it.  A widow with one or two of a family over 16 cannot get a pension unless she is 55 years of age.  That is a very harsh section and, to my own knowledge, it has imposed hardship.  I know women who have been denied the pension because they had no children under 14 and were not 55 years of age.  I appeal to the Minister to do all he can to alleviate the lot of the old age pensioners and the widows and orphans.</P>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of criticism of the remission of entertainment tax contained in the Budget.  I read the Minister's notes on that and they are perfectly true.  Some people were not paying the tax at all, while others were honest enough to pay it. A great many people were trading on their patriotism.  Because they were patriots, they were not supposed to pay the tax.  There should be no such thing as differentiation in these matters.  We should all be treated equally.  Some of us may be looked upon as imperialists, but I believe in paying all just debts and I believe that any sum owing to the State should be paid.  Up to a point, I think that the Minister was wise in regard to the removal of this tax.  The cost of collection was such that it was hardly worth while. For that reason, I welcome the remission.</P>
    <P>It is hardly open to us to criticise the Budget, or any other Budget for that matter.  I have long experience in this House and I know that the Minister has a very good answer to any criticism which may be advanced as to the cost of running the country.  We have all been sinners by asking the Government to introduce new services or enlarge present services.  Until we cease to do that I cannot see any hope of a considerable reduction in the cost of government.  I notice by the Budget, however, that we are to move a little bit away from the isolationist policy of self-sufficiency.  That policy has been responsible, to a large extent, <Col N="187" /> for the high cost of living.  The sooner we make up our minds to hold our own with peoples of other countries, the better for all concerned.  Some of the tariffs which have been imposed were too high.  They were, in fact, an admission&mdash;there is no use in hiding this&mdash;that we were an inferior people. I have some experience of hard work, and if I were seeking a job in England, I should not like to tell the man from whom I was seeking employment that I would not be able to do as much work as the other employees.  If I told him that, I should not be likely to get a job.  In fact, I should have to convince him that I was a better man than the others in order to get the job.  I believe that we are as good workers as the workers of any other country, if we are not better.  That is my personal experience.  I never wanted protection in order to get work in any part of the world.  I hope that the Minister will make his voice heard in the counsels of the executive so that the material for house-building will be allowed in, instead of manufacturing little bits of things and selling them as if they were gold dust.  You will not reduce the cost of living by pursuing a policy of that kind.  Anything that impedes the progress of house-building should be removed.  The Minister will have the support of everybody if he upholds the view I have expressed on this very vexed question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have debated this Budget resolution for the greater part of three days. I have taken a large number of notes of points made by different Deputies but, when all are boiled down, I find that little was said by way of constructive criticism.  Most Deputies did what Deputy Coburn has just done &mdash;adverted to the size of the bill which we were presenting to the country, and asked that something be added for the benefit of sections in which they were interested.  Yesterday, a Deputy suggested that a couple of hundred thousand pounds should be spent upon a harbour in the town of Wexford.  He said that that sum would be too large to be borne by Wexford and that it should be given by the State.  I should <Col N="188" /> like Deputies to tot up the cost of the various proposals which are made here by them from time to time and ask themselves whether the total, if added to the Budget items, would not be too large for the State to bear, having regard to its present level of production. Wexford cannot afford to pay £200,000 for the building of a harbour because it is of a certain limited size and has a limited population and income.  If Wexford were a much larger centre, it could take this £200,000 in its stride. If our production, and business generally, were on a bigger scale, not only could we take £50,000,000 or £55,000,000 in our stride but we could take a much larger sum.</P>
      <P>A peculiar statement was made here yesterday by Deputy Coogan.  He pointed to the savings effected here, particularly during the war years, and said that those savings were an indication of lack of enterprise.  He contended that the growth in bank deposits was a sign of lack of enterprise. If we are to regard large bank deposits as indicative of lack of initiative and small bank deposits as indicative of vigour and enterprise, then a country such as America should have no bank deposits.  Quite a number of deductions made here during the Budget debate were as absurd as Deputy Coogan's deduction in that regard. However, I shall come to that matter later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I desire to deal, in the first place, with a couple of hares started by Deputy Dillon and Deputy O'Higgins and chased all over the place by the different Deputies who followed them in the debate.  Deputy Dillon made the allegation that the 6d. reduction in the price of petrol was made in order to benefit Córas Iompair Éireann.  He said that it would bestow a &ldquo;substantial benefit on Córas Iompair Éireann because the present consumption of petrol by them equals that of the rest of the population&rdquo;. In making that allegation, Deputy Dillon had about his usual margin of error, because the fact of the matter is that all the railways&mdash;Córas Iompair Éireann, the Great Northern Railway, the Lough Swilly Railway and others&mdash; get between them less than one-seventh <Col N="189" /> of all the petrol imported.  Of the fuel oil imported, the railways, canals, ships and road vehicles get a little over one-fourth.  Of the kerosene imported, the railways and tramways get one gallon out of every 160 gallons. If we take the three fuels combined, the railways and ships get less than half the fuel given, say, to agricultural tractors, and they get less than one gallon of fuel out of every nine imported.  Those are the facts of the case and they show that Deputy Dillon, in making his allegation that Córas Iompair Éireann gets one-half of the petrol, was exaggerating to as great a degree as he usually does.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins took it up, of course, and thought this was too good a point to miss.  He went one step further and said&mdash;I am quoting his exact words, as given in column 2557 of the Official Report of May 9th:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The most fabulous and fantastic fortunes that ever were dreamt of in this country were made in the turf transport racket and are being made at present in that racket of dragging turf up from the country to the city. ...We know very well that, even with this petrol coupon system in operation, any one of them&mdash;the turf hauliers&mdash;will give 25/- for a gallon of petrol any day and convince you that it is good business; and that, by buying at 25/- a gallon, they still make money on the day's haulage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>First of all, I want to say that there was practically no limitation on the distribution of petrol to those who wanted to haul turf or wood.  I do not know whether many of the hauliers made great fortunes or not, but I know that very many of the people engaged in the hauling of turf worked very hard. For some years, I have never gone down the country late at night, in the early morning or in the middle of the day, without seeing them hauling away; and the miracle of the turf dumps in the Phoenix Park, the fact that this city was able to keep going, was due to the hard work they put in. If they have got enormous profits, the profits were there for anybody, since anybody could contract if he had a lorry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="190" /> I want to point out that this statement made by Deputy O'Higgins is as completely untrue as Deputy Dillon's statement about the percentage of petrol that went to Córas Iompair Éireann.  He said the turf hauliers were prepared to pay 25/- a gallon and still could make a profit.  That represents 7½d. per ton mile in an ordinary four-ton lorry&mdash;that is what Deputy O'Higgins says turf hauliers could afford to pay and make a handsome profit.  What are they getting per ton mile?  Recent contracts were 3d. a ton mile and no contracts have been issued for some years&mdash;or, I think, at any time during the war&mdash;at more than 5d. a ton mile.  Therefore, Deputy O'Higgins' proposition, boiled down and examined, is that a turf haulier can afford to pay 7½d. a ton mile for petrol and receive from Fuel Importers, Limited, from 3d. to 5d. a ton mile and still make a profit.  That is the usual Fine Gael method, but, as Deputy O'Higgins himself said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An assertion made with a loud enough voice and a sufficiently brazen manner, at all events, if it is not true, it carries conviction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is given in column 2557 of the Official Report of the same day.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon made a general attack on the policy of turf production and spoke in very favourable terms about camel dung being a much better fuel. For a number of years he condemned the policy of wheat growing&mdash;he would not be got dead, he said, in a wheat field&mdash;but if there had not been sufficient wheat fields for Deputy Dillon to die in in comfort in any parish in the country before the war, a lot of people during the war would have died in grass fields.  If he thinks that camel dung is a better fuel than turf, he may burn it if he likes.  I wish to goodness that ostrich feathers were good fuel as, judging by the way he sticks his head in the sand and waves his feathers around, they are easily grown down around Ballaghaderreen.  We have to face the fact that the fuels we imported heretofore at very cheap prices are not likely to be available in large quantities at low prices in the future.  We have to turn to our own resources, if we want to ensure that at all times we <Col N="191" /> will have a reasonable supply of fuel at the lowest possible price at which we can produce it.</P>
    <P>That leads me to say that I wish Fine Gael would make up its mind about turf.  Where do they stand?  If this country is to debate a policy and arrive at decisions which will be a guidance to the people, they should at least know where the major Parties stand as Parties, on the various big questions of social and economic policy. Deputy Coogan, as a Front Bench member of the principal Opposition Party, has on various occasions in this House attacked the policy of producing turf.  Does Fine Gael stand for that? Are they for or against this country trying to utilise the resources God gave it in abundance in order to produce fuel for our people?</P>
    <P>If they are for it, why do they allow one of their principal spokesmen, one of their principal Front Bench members, Deputy Coogan, to attack it and to tell wild untruths about turf?  Deputy Coogan here the last day, Deputies will remember, alleged that the fuel which the Electricity Supply Board were getting in the Pigeon House during the war had three times the calorific value of turf.  In actual fact, the calorific value of the fuel that the Electricity Supply Board got into the Pigeon House during the war was very much less than that of the pre-war coal that they imported.  Forty per cent. of it would pass through a one-eighth inch sieve.  They had on occasions, I have heard, to spray it with oil in order to get it to light.  One of the biggest organisations in the country, the sugar company, tell me that they could not have carried on with the fuel they were getting if it had not been for turf. They say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we did not use turf, we would not have been able to reach the high average which our factories maintained throughout the past campaign. Over the four factories this was a record in the history of the company and was also a record for three of the four factories taken individually. We also made a new record in the total throughout for any one day.  The <Col N="192" /> high volatile content of turf as a fuel made it possible for us to dry the immense quantities of pulp involved. No amount of coal of the quality at present available would have permitted us to do this, apart altogether from questions of cost.  At two of our factories it was established by experiment that we could utilise more fully the calories available in turf than we could in the case of coal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is also within the experience of all Deputies who travel on the railways that turf briquettes made it possible for the railways to keep going. In these circumstances, why should a principal member of the Fine Gael Partly be allowed by that Party to get up and try to create a feeling of hopelessness in the country in regard to the question of turf?  We know that turf per ton has not the same number of calories as good coal, but we know that, not only in this country, but in Germany, Russia, Holland, Sweden and various other countries throughout the world, large industries are running on it.  The industrialist does not burn fuel for the sake of its appearance.  He burns it because it is available and because he gets more calories per 1d. or per 1/- out of it than he can get out of an alternative fuel.  Judging turf by that test, I believe that in future, if the turf industry is properly organised, we shall get more calories per 1d. or per 1/- by burning turf than we shall get by burning imported coal.</P>
    <P>Another allegation made by Deputy Dillon and others was that we took off the tax on dances in order to benefit dance hall proprietors.  I hope that not a single penny of the tax remitted will go into the pockets of dance hall proprietors.  Those who attend dances have a right to see that the prices of admission are reduced by 20 per cent. If they are foolish enough still to pay that 20 per cent., I cannot help them. They are entitled on the basis of the figures to get a reduction of 20 per cent. in the admission charges.  The tax on dancing was hitting more than the dance hall.  It affected every village and every parish throughout the country.  Whenever any organisation, <Col N="193" /> political, cultural or of any other type, wanted to hold a function of this kind, if they were a charitable organisation, they had all this writing to go through and all these accounts to prove, in order to get back the tax. If they were not a charitable or an educational organisation under the Gaelic League they had to pay.  I think that it was an impediment to local initiative.  I think it is a good thing to encourage local people to raise funds for local purposes.  We were able in this particular year to get rid of this tax and, when we offset the cost of collecting it, we are not going to lose the total amount. Therefore, I think it would be a good thing for the country to abolish it, and I hope Deputy Dillon will not continue to speak against a reduction in taxes which I think will be valuable to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>One other item that was criticised was the provision of £1,000,000 which we propose to spend in order to enable farmers to increase the wages and to give complementary reliefs to those under £20 valuation.  I pointed out in the Budget statement that the employment portion of that sum&mdash;the £6 10s. 0d. per head&mdash;would last for two years, and that thereafter the Government would bear three-fifths of the rate on agricultural land under £20 valuation and on the first £20 of the larger holdings and on one-fifth of the valuation above £20.  This £1,000,000 was given not as derating but to enable farmers to increase wages.  I stressed that in the Budget statement and I want to stress it again.  The Government have agreed as a permanent measure to bear three-fifths of the rates on the first £20 and on one-fifth over that in order to guarantee to local authorities that they have an interest in the height of the rates in the various counties.</P>
    <P>I think that is all that we should do in this matter.  Personally, I would rather see farmers enabled, by reasonable prices and by their own industry in production, to pay their rates rather than that the State should pay all their rates as has been suggested from time to time, with no incentive left to the farmer to improve his methods or to <Col N="194" /> improve his output.  We have here a system of price guarantees for agricultural production in regard to many products, and I think it is much better that farmers should be paid according to what they produce for the community rather than by the area of land they hold.  Derating <i>in toto</i> means simply giving a man, out of the pockets of the general taxpayer, a bounty according to the area of land he holds and not a price according to the number of units that he produces. Portion of this £1,000,000 will be devoted in the next two years to enabling farmers to increase the wages of their workers.  The remainder of it has been devoted to giving complementary relief to farmers under £20 valuation, and the three-fifths under the first £20 and the one-fifth over £20 valuation, is intended to be a permanent measure.  That, of course, will not cost anything like the total of £1,000,000.</P>
    <P>I want to go back to what Deputy Hughes said yesterday in relation to agricultural wages.  He said the difference between farm wages in Britain and this country was immense.  I cannot understand Deputy Hughes, who represents himself to this Dáil and to the country as a farmers' representative, making propaganda to encourage farm labourers to leave this country and to go abroad.  Not only did Deputy Hughes make that particular form of propaganda&mdash;he is very active in promoting it&mdash;but his example is being followed by the members of the Clann na Talmhan and other Parties. When comparing rates of wages and salaries paid here with the salaries in other countries we have to take into consideration the level of taxation, as we had to point out, in relation to a salary demand, quite recently.  Deputy Hughes should not encourage agricultural labourers to leave this country in the belief that they are going to get a higher effective wage over in England without warning them, at the same time, of the costs and taxes that have to be paid by the people of Britain and Scotland.  A very big number of people who were induced to leave this country during the war and since then, because of that type of <Col N="195" /> propaganda, have returned, much disappointed that England was not the El Dorado painted by Deputy Hughes and other farmers like him.</P>
    <P>It was contested here the other day that the figure of 78,600, which I gave as being the net emigration figure of the last five years, was too low.  That figure is the result of a very close scrutiny of all the facts available to the statistics branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce, and it is a true figure so far as they can discover it.  Deputy Hughes and some other farmers in this House are disappointed that it is so low.  I am disappointed that it is so high.  We will want to build up this country in the future.  We want the services of a great number of the skilled men who left this country in the last five or six years because the work that they were engaged in had to shut down owing to a shortage of materials.  The savings that this State has made, with the increase in its foreign assets that has taken place, represent not a lack of enterprise, as Deputy Coogan said, but a shortage of supplies of the essential materials that would have enabled us to keep these emigrants at the work which a large number of them were engaged on before they left.</P>
    <P>For the seven years before the war, we were engaged here on a very big housing campaign.  It was rather difficult to get that campaign started because a number of our people throughout the country in key positions, representatives of local authorities and others, had the same general outlook that Fine Gael displayed during their régime as a Government. However, we got the campaign under way, and in five or six years, notwithstanding the stresses of the economic war, and notwithstanding the doleful prophecies of Fine Gael, we did build and reconstruct nearly one-fifth of the entire houses of the State.  I feel that, having proved to ourselves that not only could we survive the economic war and build that number of houses but that we could survive the greatest military war in history and be as well off in a physical way as practically any other country in the world: having <Col N="196" /> proved that much, in future years we will be able to absorb the skill and energy of our people in order to build here somewhat better conditions for all our people.</P>
    <P>There is no use in Deputies demanding very large increases in social services unless they can show that we can afford them, and the only measure we can use to see whether we can afford a higher level of social services is the index showing the level of our production.  If we can increase our production during the next five or ten years, if we could add 25 or 50 per cent. to it, we could still give sufficient awards to those who produce to encourage them to continue in production and have something left over to take care of those who cannot take care of themselves.  In that regard we should be content to move with the times, to move with the production. If we attempt to move in front of it, to ask our people as a producing community to bear burdens which will retard their efforts in production, we might very well kill the goose that lays the golden eggs and have nothing to distribute.</P>
    <P>I gave certain figures in the Budget statement which go to show that if we have the will to work here, to use our energy and skill on the resources which God gave us, we can produce an increased standard of life for our people.  We have certain capital assets.  If we use prudently our external assets and the assets we have in lands and factories and in the skill of our people to increase our production, all will be well with us.  But if we go on a spending spree, simply to dissipate the assets we have accumulated, neglecting to use them to increase our capital wealth, then sooner or later will come an end to our ability to support even the existing services.</P>
    <P>I believe that in this year our community can afford the burden of taxation that we have placed upon them.  It is a high burden.  I do not believe that they should be asked to pay more; otherwise I would not have proposed to the Government that we should reduce taxation, but would rather have proposed that we keep up <Col N="197" /> the level of taxation and use the money in various ways.  Taxpayers of all sorts had a heavy burden to bear during the war and I must say they bore it without too much growling. They growled a bit, as is very natural, but they did not stop work in order to growl.  They growled while they worked, and we do not mind that. But if we were to continue the burden of taxation through the present financial year that the community has borne willingly during the last four or five years, I am afraid some of them would stop work in order to growl.</P>
    <P>The reductions that were made were for the purpose of encouraging all sections of our community to bend their energies to greater production, so that the total of our national income would be increased.  Deputy Dillon, I think it was, or one Deputy on the Fine Gael Benches, made the suggestion that instead of taxing to get the £3,000,000 necessary to send supplies to Europe, we should have borrowed it.

      <P>Deputy Cogan suggested we should have borrowed to meet the £3,000,000.  I believe from every point of view that it is preferable that we <Col N="198" /> should tax to meet it.  I do not think any of our people begrudge what they pay in taxes in order to do what we can to send relief to the unfortunate peoples of Europe who are facing death from famine.  Not alone is it right that we should tax in order to send money abroad, but if we were to borrow and to distribute money for this purpose, we would only be adding to the volume of money in circulation here while the goods would disappear out of the country, and the £3,000,000 additional spent in that way would tend still further to bring a greater volume of money pressing upon a shortage of goods.  From every point of view, therefore, I maintain that it was the correct thing to tax this year in order to send that £3,000,000 by way of relief to Europe.</P>
      <P>We will have, of course, a number of other debates in connection with finance business in the next couple of weeks so I think what I have said will do for to-day.  I believe the country can afford the taxation that we have imposed upon it for the services upon which we propose to spend the money. I hope that the community will bear the burden of taxation, large though it is, with a good will.  I do not know whether reliefs can be given next year, whether we will be fortunate enough to be able to announce further reliefs then; but even if the present taxation were to continue, I think the community can carry it.  They will be able to carry it as a light burden if, during the coming year, we can increase our national income by getting an increased output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard, I join with Deputy Coburn in hoping that we will get the co-operation of builders and building workers in getting a good output and reasonable tenders for houses.  There is still a very big job of work to be done in the building of houses.  It is one line of production in which we can see rather more clearly than we can see in other lines the effect of the various factors of costs.  We have been able to make arrangements to give local authorities money at reasonable rates of interest in present circumstances.  No one wants to see the effect of that step frittered away by inefficiency in the building of houses, <Col N="199" /> or by one section of the community trying to grab for itself the benefits of the advance made.  I hope that builders and their workers will cooperate to reduce the cost of erecting houses to something like the extent to which the interest charges have been decreased.</P>
    <P>Out of the transition fund we will be able to make, for the next couple of years, in addition to the normal pre-war basic subsidies, grants to meet the extra cost due to the very high cost of building materials, at the moment. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, as Deputies are aware, is searching the world for building materials.  Some of them are being procured, but they are in short supply and at very high prices.  We hope that within a couple of years these costs will have come down very considerably, and I do not want to see put on either to the rents or local rates that portion of the cost which is attributable to the very high cost of building materials.  That possibly will continue for another year or two, and it is that extra cost which will be met out of the transition fund, leaving to be paid for only the rents that are appropriate to the present level of wages.</P>
    <P>If wages were to continue to increase, inevitably the cost of rents would go up.  Rents have to be paid for by somebody and rents are a result of the wage factor as well as the interest factor.  I hope our working men&mdash; artisans and building workers generally &mdash;will be wise enough to realise that it is in their interests to see that the greatest possible output is given for the wage unit in the building of houses. Looking at the figures of costs of the building of houses here and in other countries before the war, one would conclude that we had a lot to learn in giving a bigger output for the £ spent in wages.  We have something to learn. and I hope the lesson will be learned and will be applied, and that, with the co-operation of the master builders and the workers, we will have an increasing supply of houses being built every year at lower costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to repeat a plea I made last year in connection with what can only be described as the wretched incremental scales in the Post Office which, I regret to say, have not been improved during the year.  These scales, as Deputies generally know, are a legacy of a very bad past and my complaint against the Minister and his Department is that they have apparently taken no steps to improve them along the lines on which they should be improved.  I refer to the type of increment which still obtains in the Post Office&mdash;and more so there than perhaps in any other Department&mdash;ranging as low as 1/-, 1/6 and 2/- per week.  I need hardly say to the House that these amounts bear no relation whatever to financial values as we know them to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="201" /> I have here a couple of instances of what is involved in these scales.  In the case of a Post Office clerk who starts as a learner at a basic wage of 8/- per week, it takes him 27 years to reach his maximum of 70/-.  The same thing applies to a Post Office clerk in the B scale&mdash;he starts at a basic wage of 8/&mdash;and it takes him 22 years to reach his maximum of 61/-.  A postman, grade A, starts as a boy messenger at 7/- per week basic wage and reaches a maximum of 50/- basic wage after 25 years.  Reference has been made to the position of what are styled auxiliary postmen.  Some Deputies interested in that grade may not be aware that that particular type of postal official starts on as low a scale as 6d. per hour basic wage.  He has to serve what is the equivalent to a probationary period of five years, after which he gets the substantial advance of ½d. per hour to the figure of 6½d.  After a service of ten years he gets 7½d. per hour. Thereafter he gets no more, even though his service may extend to 40 or 50 years.  I appeal to the Minister, with others who are interested in this question of auxiliary postmen, to have that disgraceful state of affairs wiped out.  The Post Office had a very bad name in the matter of wages generally down the years, and the practice obtaining in the Post Office militated against anything in the nature of an increase so far as outside firms were concerned.  I hope that when the Minister presents his Estimate next year he will be able to indicate to the House that the very bad precedent which has been established will be done away with and that it will not be necessary to refer again to these very bad scales.  I need hardly say that there is very little. incentive to a man who has to take such a long period to reach his maximum to give of his best.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister that I was in correspondence with his Department sometime ago about early deliveries in certain sections of the city.  While a great deal has been heard about deliveries throughout the country, I can say that in some sections of the city the arrangements are not quite satisfactory either as regards the time at which some of the deliveries <Col N="202" /> are made.  There may have been certain difficulties arising out of the emergency.  One of them, I understand, was that any change would involve an increase of staff.  The Post Office is working for the public weal and, whatever may have been said about it in the past when it was working on a deficit, that position does not obtain to-day when it is making a handsome profit.  That profit should be utilised in increasing the staff where that is necessary.  I hope that if any revision is pending it will be expedited along the lines of giving that early delivery which certain sections of the city require.</P>
    <P>I also directed the Minister's attention last year to the question of providing kiosks.  It is obvious that the people are getting telephone-minded. The demand on the telephone system has expanded very rapidly during recent years.  The trouble in connection with kiosks last year was the lack of equipment.  I understood from the Minister recently that the position had improved.  I am particularly interested in the erection of a kiosk in a very important area in the north side of the city, that is in the built-up area at Cremore Park, Glasnevin.  That matter was the subject of correspondence between the Department and myself.  If a fire occurs in that district or a person gets seriously ill, people have to go a very considerable distance to a 'phone in a private house to avail of any service that they may need. There is a necessity for the provision of further kiosks throughout the city At present there are queues waiting outside the kiosks at all times of the day.  Anything that the Minister can do by way of providing further kiosks will be very greatly appreciated by the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Little) Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Little)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Little)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps as Deputy O'Sullivan came in at the last minute I had better deal with him first.  The question of incremental scales has been under examination and, indeed, some of the other categories of wages have also been under careful examination. It must be remembered, however, that the standstill Order is still in force and that any revision in the matter of <Col N="203" /> wages for the various classes that we have under consideration would involve considerable increases and it will take some time before I will be able to give any definite reply in these matters.  Although I indicated last year that I intended to examine this problem, it will be understood that nothing could be done until the standstill Order comes to an end, because the Deputy will appreciate what a reaction it would have on firms in general outside if we were suddenly to plunge into a new set of scales.  Therefore, it cannot be done for the present.</P>
      <P>I think the Deputy is exaggerating the question of these scales generally for postmen.  These are very much desired positions.  When persons get into them they give excellent service and, on the whole, they do not seem to be anxious to give them up.  Of course, the Deputy emphasised the fact that he was dealing with basic scales.  That brings me to the question of bonus, which has to be pointed out.  The bonus, of course, did meet the difficulty to a very considerable extent and made the wage a very fair one on the whole.  I am sorry Deputy Norton is not here, because I would have liked him to be here when dealing with this matter.  Sometimes officials of his organisation have emphasised in public the low wages scales without adverting to the fact that a bonus was paid as well which, I think, was extremely unfair to the Government, because it did not give the full picture.  Even if they have a grievance, which in a few cases I do not deny they may have, I think they ought to be fair to the Government. The rate of bonus on the whole has been not ungenerous, having regard to the fact that we have to keep an eye to the general economy.  After all, we are the custodians for the taxpayers. It would be easy to be generous towards certain classes in the community and to treat the taxpayers unfairly.  We have to try to keep the balance carefully between all classes of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of kiosks, I have already mentioned in my opening statement that we are going to have a <Col N="204" /> very general development of the telephone service all through the country and, of course, we will, as far as possible, use kiosks, because, although they are rather expensive to put up, they give a continuous service.  We will put them up wherever possible. The Deputy also raised the question of early deliveries in the city.  We have some difficulty about that, because it means that we would have to bring in our staffs very much earlier in the morning.  We have been slow about pressing too hard on that matter, but it is one which we will probably have to examine very carefully to see whether we will not have to do it in the course of the next year or so.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins was good enough to express gratitude to the Department for its efficiency and for the promptitude with which it attended to complaints.  It is very satisfactory to me to know that, because it is only by public expressions of that sort that one can judge how Government policy is being carried out.  On the whole, I think the Department is to be congratulated on the way in which it has carried on, especially during the most difficult period of the emergency.  Complaints were made about what is called the primitive and out-of-date conditions in the post offices throughout the country. I am sure everybody realises that, so long as the emergency was there and there was a shortage of supplies and of staff, it was impossible for us to extend any more than we have done. As a matter of fact we did manage to put in a great many more telephones during the year in spite of all our difficulties. Of course there will be a much bigger opening up, as I have already indicated in the Estimate, and I need not go over the ground again.  One matter, which I did not mention in my Estimate but which would be implied in what I said, is with regard to night services.  That is a matter which we shall have to take into consideration as far as possible throughout the country in order to give as extended telephone services as possible.  In a few of the larger centres we shall put in automatic telephones; in other places we shall put in semi-automatic telephones, as they are called; and in <Col N="205" /> other places we shall be obliged to increase our staff to some extent.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins raised the question of Mountrath.  That will come under immediate notice for special investigation with the other matters. In a way I am very glad to see this demand for telephones, because it makes things a little bit easier for us. I happened the other day to be looking through a letter that was written by the then secretary of the Post Office in 1907 to a very prominent firm in the Midlands in which he was more or less begging this firm to take a telephone because all the surrounding towns had refused to take the telephone at all.  That indicates to some extent the enormous change that has taken place in public opinion in the last 40 years.  Now you have people in the most out-of-the-way places, who never dreamt of looking for a telephone, regarding it as a grievance that they have not got it because it is to them to-day a sheer necessity.  That is a good thing, because when we know the demand is there we can go out on much broader lines and take the risk&mdash;one always has to take a chance in going out and hoping to get a return which will make the service self-sufficient.</P>
    <P>Many of those who contributed to the debate referred to the £180,000, or so, of profit that we make.  At the same time, it must always be borne in mind that that profit is on our commercial account; that is to say, it takes into consideration the services that are given to the other Departments of Government.  They are charged, and rightly so, against the Departments. But, again, it must be remembered that the money is coming out of the tax-payer's pocket, so that we are not exactly making a profit in the sense in which an independent firm makes a profit.</P>
    <P>On the question of rural postmen, some of the speakers exaggerated the position very much in regard to them. Really one would be led to the conclusion that these people are very much sweated.  That is not true.  The temporary part-time postmen are paid on an hourly basis somewhat better than the local wage paid to the agricultural <Col N="206" /> worker.  That, of course, is necessary because you cannot have a big disparity between the wage paid to the man who is doing 30 hours a week on postman work and the wage paid to the normal labourer in the locality &mdash;the normal rural worker.  The idea is, of course, that the temporary part-time postman gets other work to do as well and that he is not entirely dependent on the work of the post office.  On the whole it has been our experience that they are a very satisfied class.  We cannot, of course, burk the fact that the cost of living at the present time is a headache to everybody. It is impossible to calculate exactly what is a fair wage to give people, having regard to the fluctuations in the cost of living.  That is a matter that we have only been able to deal with so far by giving a bonus. We shall have to keep watching that situation.  In spite of the violent protestations made to the Minister we have to keep an eye on the taxpayer as well as on the individuals who are in receipt of the wages.</P>
    <P>Many of the Deputies in the House raised individual questions which would be better raised with the Department and which could be dealt with by the Department in a more satisfactory way.  Deputy Blowick made a suggestion with regard to the colour of the uniforms.  He said that dark blue is not suitable in the country districts and he advocated a greenish-grey, or some such colour, which would not soil so quickly.  We shall have the matter of the colour examined into to see whether there is anything in the suggestion or not.  He asked me what I meant when I said he was &ldquo;bullying&rdquo; some postmaster.  The point I wished to make is this: when an appointment of any sort is being made it is most undesirable that representations should be made direct to any of the officials concerned, or that any attempt should be made to find out what the official's advice is to the Minister, because it puts the official into an extremely awkward position and could easily have an intimidating effect upon an individual in an isolated country place if a person in the important position of a Deputy goes and speaks to an official in a severe manner or tries to <Col N="207" /> influence him.  The person whom he should try to influence is the Minister, and nobody else.  That is why, in the case of Deputy Blowick, I wanted to warn Deputies against wrong procedure in dealing with matters of that sort.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy raised the question of Mullingar.  Mullingar, from the telephone point of view, is a bottleneck at present and we shall have to deal with that when we put down more carrier cables.  Mullingar happens to be the centre between the East and West and it presents us with a problem which shall have to be dealt with as soon as possible.  He also mentioned the position with regard to postal deliveries in that area.  That, too, will receive very careful consideration and attention.</P>
    <P>Deputy Heskin mentioned the pillar box at Ballysaggart.  I intend to look after that matter.  He also complained about Ballyduff.  I shall have that examined.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Redmond referred to Grange and Ardmore.  Being a T.D. for that area myself, I am well aware of the difficulties there; but, like many of our other difficulties, it is due to shortage of supplies, and will receive consideration in due course.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roddy and Deputy Norton raised the question of buildings&mdash;Sligo and several others.  All these are due to the shortage of supplies, as the House already knows very well.  The question of building supplies is one which has to be dealt with on the basis of priority.  In every case I found, on looking at the records&mdash;I do not propose to go into details now&mdash;that we are either at the stage of making very definite plans and working with the Board of Works on them, or else we are actually ready to start building as soon as we get supplies, or else entering into agreements to extend the premises.  In any case, there is no absence of activity in that respect. At the same time, I propose in the Department to devote a separate section to building in order to deal with this building problem as expeditiously as possible.  It is going to be a pretty big problem in the coming <Col N="208" /> years.  I am now going to divert some of my best men to that work in order to get on with the work as quickly as possible.  We fully realise the importance of the position, not merely because of the emergency which held up everything for so many years past, but also because the country is now beginning to develop at a pretty rapid rate and we want, if anything, to be ahead with our work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton mentioned Pearse Street Post Office which, considering everything, is not in very bad condition. It will be a sad day for Deputy Norton when it is rebuilt because I do not know what he will then have to talk about on the Estimate.  It has been a kind of &ldquo;King Charles's head&rdquo; to him in every Estimate that I have been connected with up to this.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary raised the question of Enniscorthy.  Last year he raised it and we examined it and found there was nothing in the complaint, that there was adequate staff and that the work was being got through.  It is true that the various payments that have to be made must be spread over the whole week, some taken on one day of the week and others on other days, and I suppose, in the case of some of the payments, the office is crowded.  There is no doubt about it that the payment of children's allowances has added enormously to our work but, with the course of time, I am sure it will straighten itself out and that we will be able to get the work into a more satisfactory condition.</P>
    <P>In regard to the complaints about the rates of pay, we are going very carefully into the whole question of the payment of sub-postmasters and of the scales and unit rating and when the proposals have been put to the Department of Finance I hope to be able to come back with reasonable improvement in all these matters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison raised the question of Irishtown, Kilkenny.  That is a matter that I would rather was not raised because I do not want to enter into discussion of the merits of the different people whom he and other people suggested should be appointed, <Col N="209" /> because it is not fair to them, but I could easily satisfy him, in private conversation, that the choice made was not an unreasonable choice.  It is not fair to act on the rumour that some Fianna Fáil club made suggestions that so-and-so should be appointed. Any representations that anybody, especially a Deputy, makes to me are taken into consideration together with all the representations of the officials of the Department and the appointment is made accordingly.  To sneer at any political organisation is in itself a very undesirable thing.  I might answer back and talk about some group of Clann na Talmhan, or the Labour Party, or others, who also made suggestions, but I do not think that is a reasonable line of country. Personally, I have great respect for my own organisation, naturally enough.  I think the Fianna Fáil organisation is the backbone of the Government and the Government is the Government which has protected us through the years and, for that reason, I am proud of the organisation which keeps the Government in existence.  I often look back, when a question is raised about a particular post office, to see what I have done and I am often surprised to find how unbiassed I have been in the appointments made and wonder whether I was right or not.</P>

He also raised the question of mail-car contractors.  My experience is that if they make out a good case showing that their costs have gone up too much, our people are always prepared to deal with them.  I do not interfere myself in this.  It would not do for me to interfere in mail contracts but I find our experts in that matter are always prepared to deal with them in a reasonable way and to meet any extra expense.  Of course &mdash; and this applies not merely to mail contracts but also to postmasters &mdash; the people they employ <Col N="210" /> are not under our control.  There is in the case of mail contracts a fair wages clause in our contracts with them.  In the case of the postmasters we try to insist upon their paying their assistants properly.</P>

      <P>That raises a very large question, the whole question of sub-postmasters. The principle on which it is based in this country and in neighbouring countries is that it is assumed that there is other work done, that it is a shop as well, generally speaking. I have gone into this question closely, because I was very uneasy about it and I found that in the vast majority of cases there is a shop attached and that the people find that it brings goodwill to the business to have a post office there.  If there is an assistant in that shop, the assistant is doing work partly for the shop and partly for the post office, and it is very difficult for us to prescribe what wage should be paid, but we try to insist on a reasonable wage.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider the case of sub-offices in a thickly populated area, where there is very heavy foreign mail?  Would not the postmaster there be entitled to a little more remuneration than the postmaster in a quiet place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  These post offices are under constant revision and if we find that business increases enormously then there is a corresponding raising of the amount paid.  Our trouble is more in the rural areas than in the bigger centres of population, which are easier to deal with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any power, when increasing the remuneration, to see that the clerk working for that postmaster would get a corresponding increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we could try to persuade the person to do it, and use all the moral influence we have but, beyond that, we have no power.  There is no sanction that we could impose. We try to use as much influence as we can to see they are properly paid and, on the whole, I think they are.  I think it is the exceptional case where they are not.  Deputy Moran raised some questions which I would rather deal with individually.  He also complained of incivility.  We are very strict about anything like that in post offices because our national repute depends upon getting civil treatment in our post offices perhaps more than in other places.  We take very grave notice of any complaints of that sort.  The steam kettle that he mentioned is confined, I think, to the Abbey Theatre.  I do not think it is so much in being.  People like to talk about it but, on the whole, I think the post offices are carried on in an honourable fashion and that letters are not opened and are not interfered with.  If any individual case should come to the notice of any <Col N="212" /> Deputy, he should draw our attention to it at once and we will deal with it because the essence of our postal service and the credit of our service depend upon making sure that privacy is observed in these matters.</P>
      <P>The question of staff was raised. There was a shortage of staff during the whole period of the emergency because there was a restriction on recruiting during the emergency owing to uncertainty as to the trend of post-emergency conditions, and a continuance subsequent to the termination of the war of abnormal telegraph traffic, especially in the matter of telegraph money orders, and the unprecedented growth of work involved by the new services which had to be undertaken by the Post Office and which could not have been anticipated.  Every possible effort is now being made to improve the situation by recruitment of the maximum number of candidates for whom training facilities are available. That takes a little time, because training will occupy from 18 months to two years.  We are trying to speed it up as much as possible.  Then, there is the question of the men who left the service to go into the Army and whom we shall have to take back.  That will affect the whole position of having so many people in acting positions rather than in permanent positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of part-time postmen, Deputy Norton pleaded that we should have established men rather than temporary men.  There are two sides to that question.  In county areas, local people very often resent somebody being sent in there from the city to take up a position which may have been held for a number of years by a local man on a temporary basis. Once the established man comes along the local person is ousted.  On the whole, I think that it is better to keep a fair balance between the established and unestablished and temporary men &mdash;to keep the balance, more or less, as it is.  The Deputy objected to part-time men.  If you have a postal service which requires only 20 hours' or 30 hours' work a week, surely we should not spend the taxpayers' money in paying men as if they were engaged on a whole-time service.  I do not think <Col N="213" /> that the Farmers' Party could stand for that.  I do not think that the general taxpayers would want to be extravagant in the operation of postal services by making payments to persons who have not sufficient work to do for it.</P>
    <P>I have an uneasy feeling that I am forgetting a number of things which were mentioned, but as the Estimate debate has been dragged out, I am afraid that I shall have to leave these matters over.  I mentioned in the Estimate statement that I was extending the postal services.  Seventy per cent. of the country has a postal service on six days of the week and I propose to spend £20,000 on increasing the number of days' service for those areas which have only a three-day or four-day service.  After that we may move on to another extension.  I am not making any promises, but we can experiment in the way I have suggested and see how we shall succeed.  If the total deliveries justify it, we can arrange the matter easily.</P>

      <P>I ask the Deputy to make representations in particular cases to the Department and we shall have them looked into.  Deputy Cafferky raised a particular question which, I think, was not improved, from his point of view, by the speech he made. I may as well deal with the matters he mentioned.  I suppose it was perfectly natural for him to do so.  He objected to my publishing a letter which he had written to me.  His letter was not marked &ldquo;confidential&rdquo;, and I am perfectly certain that if I had appointed the man he suggested, he would not have kept it secret either.  It was quite natural that he should recommend a relation, I suppose.</P>

      <P>A relative by marriage, who happened to be a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  That showed his largeness of spirit but it also showed that I was not very biased when I did not appoint him.  The Deputy made a <Col N="214" /> statement in which he denied that he had made strong representations to me. That report appeared in the Press.  It was what appeared in the Press I was adverting to when I pointed out that he had strongly recommended this person.  I do not think that Fianna Fáil Cumainn should be sneered at and I do not think that, if rumours get about that they have made recommendations, those rumours should be used here.  The persons appointed in these cases were very efficient and well recommended.  I think it will be found that they will give excellent service and that nobody need be concerned about them.  It is not pleasant for me to attack any Deputy.  I have indicated the spirit in which, I think, they should approach consideration of the Estimate and, if they want to make personal recommendations, they are at liberty to do so.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins referred to the notification of changes of address.  If persons want to change their addresses and to have telegrams forwarded to the changed addresses, they should fill up a form, for which there is a special charge.  Telegrams will then be sent to the new address.  I should like to conclude by stating that I appreciate the gratitude expressed from different parts of the House for the good work done by the Department as a whole.</P>

Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil an ceart iomlán ag an Teachta.

Do réir mar a thuigimse an scéal bhí níos mó eolais aige maidir leis an nGaeltacht ná a bhí aige maidir leis na huaireadóirí ná na horáistí.

Tá cruth nua ar an saol agus tuigeann muintir na Gaeltachta an t-athrú atá tagtha ar an saol.  Ní bheidh siad sásta a thuilleadh le bochtanas agus cur-síos go deo.  Ceist ar leithligh ar fad is ea ceist na Gaeltachta agus níl réiteach na ceiste sin i dtalamh na Gaeltachta ná in aon roinnt a dhéanann Coimisiún na Talún ar an talam ann.  Caithfimid níos mó ná sin a dhéanamh agus caithfimid aon tionnscal is féidir linn a chur ar bun ann agus na tionscail atá ann anois a leathnú agus a mhéadú chun gach obair is féidir a chur ar siúl sa Ghaeltacht agus chun na daoine go bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu a choimeád sa bhaile.

    <P>Más fíor a ndúirt an Teachta Mac Phartholáin go bfuil an obair atá ar siúl sna monarchan nó in aon áit a bhfuil daoine ag obair faoi na scéimeanna, go bhfuil an obair sin róthrom do na cailíní&mdash;agus ní dóigh liom go bhfuil, ach más rud é go bhfuil aon dabht ann ba cheart feacaint isteach ann agus é a chur i gceart.  Ní mhaith liom bheith ró-dhian ar aon duine a bhíonn ag obair, ach do bheinn andhian orm féin sar a ndéanfainn aon rud i bhfoirm obair ró-throm a chur ar chailíní.  Ní fearr ban mise in aon chor.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Teachta Ó Maolchatha go raibh rudaí bun-os-cionn i gContae Chiarraighe.  Tá sean-fhocal ann maidir le cailleacha mallaithe agus is dóigh liom nach bhfuil na cailleacha mallaithe imithe ar fad as Ciarraighe fós.  Ba mhaith liom rud éigin a dhéanamh chun an caladh i nDún Chuinn a chur i dtreo agus ba mhaith liom an bóthar ar dhein an Teachta tagairt dó a chur i gceart.  Ba cheart rud éigin a chur ar siúl ach ní leis an Roinn seo a bhaineann an obair sin in aon chor.  Bíodh fhios ag gach teachta ó Chiarraighe go bhfuil baint ag Comhairle Chontae Chiarraighe leis an obair sin.  Is féidir liomsa dul go dtí Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí arís, ach nuair a dhiúltaíonn an Chomhairle i gCiarraighe aon rud a dhéanamh i gcás inarb iad atá freagarthach, ní féidir le hOifig na nOibreacha Poiblí tús a chur ar an obair.  Ní ceart an mhuintir sa Bhlaoscaed a bheith mar atá siad anois gan caladh oiriúnach i nDún Chuinn agus ní ceart iad a bheith gan bóthar san áit sin ach oiread.  Is féidir an caladh a dheisiú agus is féidir an bóthar a réiteach, ach caithfidh Comhairle Chontae Chiarraighe bheith freagarthach ina gcuid féin den obair.</P>

      <P>Before referring to the programme of works proposed for the current financial year I shall give a brief review of the work done in the year ended 31st March last.  The amount provided by the Oireachtas for employment and emergency schemes in the financial year 1945/46 was £1,250,000, of which £1,197,204 was expended within the financial year.  To this expenditure should be added the contribution by local authorities amounting to £182,851, making a gross expenditure of £1,380,055.  Subject to possible amendments in detail, the expenditure on the various sub-heads was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A. -E. Salaries, travelling expenses, etc., £42,575; F. Public Health Works in Urban Areas, £89,700; Housing Sites Development, £20,788; Road Works in Urban Areas, £171,263; Amenity Schemes in Urban Areas, £39,000; G. Public Health Works in Rural Areas, £2,813; Road Works in Rural Areas, £177,668; Amenity Schemes in Rural Areas, £219; H. Minor Employment Schemes, £99,000; I. Bog Development Schemes (Landholders' and other private producers' bogs), £111,300; J. Reconditioning or repair of Public Roads subject to heavy turf transport, £31,665; K. Farm Improvements Scheme, £388,000; L. Seed Distribution Scheme, £61,300; M. Lime Distribution Scheme, £6,900; N. Rural Improvements <Col N="219" /> Scheme, £129,300; O. Miscellaneous Works, £8,564.</P>
    <P>Of the expenditure of £1,380,055 approximately £467,000 was expended during the period 1st April to 30th September, and the balance of £913,055 during the winter months, when unemployment is at its peak.  The maximum number of workmen employed at any one time during the year was: Farm Improvements Scheme, 10,691; other schemes, 16,165; total, 26,856.  The average number employed each week on all schemes during the period up to September was 8,379 and from October to March, 18,442.  Of course, approximately 44 per cent. were workmen who would otherwise have been entitled to unemployment assistance; but if the figures for farm improvement, bog development and rural improvements schemes, on which the numbers of unemployment assistance recipients engaged are relatively low, be excluded, the proportion of workmen who would have been entitled to unemployment assistance if not engaged on employment schemes was approximately 73 per cent.</P>
    <P>The average period of employment given to individual workmen varies with the class of work, and in the different areas, but the total amount of employment afforded in 1945-46, apart from the Farm Improvement Scheme, which is of a different order, is equivalent to 31,000 men each receiving part-time employment for four or five days per week, for the average period of 12 weeks.</P>
    <P>The total number of applications received for minor employment schemes during the year was 2,207 and about 5,300 proposals were investigated and reported on, including proposals already partially carried out.</P>
    <P>During the spring and summer, approximately 500 minor drainage schemes were carried out at a cost of £32,000, principally for the development of bogs used by landholders for the supply of their domestic requirements of turf.</P>
    <P>The total number of effective applications received up to 31st March, 1946, was 4,306, of which 3,165 had at that <Col N="220" /> date been investigated on the ground by inspectors and reported on.  Of these, 345 were for various reasons found to be unsuitable, and offers of grants were issued in 2,737 cases.  The number of such offers accepted in the course of the year was 906, for which grants totalling £108,270 were sanctioned towards a total estimated expenditure of £138,205, the balance of £29,935 being contributed by the applicants.</P>
    <P>Good progress was made during the year in carrying out works &mdash; the total expenditure incurred being approximately £129,300.  By the end of the year under review the number of individual works completed since the inception of the scheme in 1943-44 had reached 1,000, while a further 390 schemes were in progress.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the rural improvements scheme is supplementary to the farm improvements scheme, and enables groups of farmers to carry out various kinds of works for their joint benefit, principally small drainage works, and the construction and repair of accommodation roads to houses, lands and turbary.  The usual rate of contribution by the landholders is 25 per cent., but this may be reduced in special cases where the work, in addition to being of benefit to the landholders immediately concerned, also serves members of the outside public.  The increasing popularity of this scheme is an evidence of its usefulness to the farming community.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that there was an under-expenditure of approximately £53,000 on the Vote in the last financial year.  In explanation of this I should state that the employment schemes programme consists each year of upwards of three thousand separate works, administered by several agent departments, and carried out by local authorities all over the country; and that, in addition, the works in the rural areas must for the greater part be carried out within the space of the winter months: in those circumstances it is virtually impossible to achieve the expenditure of the exact amount voted for employment schemes.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as the actual schemes on which the year's programme is <Col N="221" /> based are not lodged until after the beginning of the financial year, it is generally impossible to make a close estimate beforehand of the amount required for each sub-head of the Vote. A considerable degree of latitude is, therefore, required in adjusting the amounts between the sub-heads, as the year progresses.  I should also point out that in a vote designed to cover emergency services it is necessary to keep in reserve until a late stage of the financial year a certain proportion of the moneys available, in order to provide against contingencies.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the programme for the financial year 1946-47, it will be observed that the provision in the Vote remains the same, at one and a quarter million pounds.  In this regard I should mention that the allocation of those sub-heads of the Vote which are provided specifically for the relief of unemployment amongst the various urban and rural units of area is broadly in proportion to the number of unemployment assistance recipients in each such area, and the programme for each financial year is based on a census of unemployment assistance recipients, including former recipients working on employment schemes, taken in the beginning of each year, usually in January or February, at a time when unemployment is at a maximum.  The total number of men returned in the census taken in January, 1946, was approximately 57,000, as compared with 60,000 in January, 1945.  The figure for the census taken in February, 1940, before there was any significant movement of workmen to Great Britain, was about 111,500, compared with which this year's figure shows a reduction of roughly 49 per cent.</P>
    <P>Of the sum of £1,250,000 included in the Estimate for the current year, £752,500 will be spent on the continuation of schemes sanctioned before the 31st March, 1946, leaving a balance of £497,500 available for expenditure on miscellaneous new schemes.  To the amount of the Vote must be added contributions from local authorities and beneficiaries under the rural improvements scheme, estimated at £200,400. This gives an aggregate of £1,450,400 available for expenditure within the financial year 1946-47; and to enable <Col N="222" /> this expenditure to be achieved as far as possible within the time limit, it is proposed to authorise schemes to the extent of £712,000 (State Grant) in excess of the amount of the Vote.  This sum, together with a proportionate amount for local contributions, will be carried forward at the 31st March, 1947, to form part of the ensuing year's programme.</P>
    <P>In this regard it is desirable to remind the Dáil that a large portion of each year's Vote is allocated to local authorities and the expenditure of the full amount of the provision depends largely on the acceptance of the grants on the terms offered, and on the prompt submission of schemes by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Subject to the foregoing remarks, the proposed allocation of State Grants for each class of work in the current year's programme is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Schemes administered by the Department of Local Government and Public Health:&mdash; Public health schemes in urban areas, £20,000; housing site development schemes, £20,000; urban road and amenity schemes, £180,000; public health works in rural areas, £20,000; rural road and amenity schemes, £120,000; reconditioning and repair of public roads subject to heavy turf transport, £50,000.</P>
    <P>Schemes administered by the Department of Agriculture:&mdash; Farm improvements scheme, £400,000; seed distribution scheme, £70,000; lime distribution scheme, £12,000.</P>
    <P>Schemes administered by the Special Employment Schemes Office:&mdash; Minor employment schemes, £100,000; bog development schemes, £90,000; rural improvements scheme, £90,000.</P>
    <P>Administration expenses are expected to amount to £46,760, leaving a balance of £31,240 for miscellaneous schemes of an emergency character, or for the relief of unemployment and distress.</P>
    <P>With regard to the foregoing allocations I should call attention to the fact that there is very little change as compared with last year, the principal variations being as follows:&mdash; The provision for the farm improvements scheme has been increased by £50,000 which is necessary to meet the very <Col N="223" /> large increase in the number of applications under the scheme; while the provision for rural road and amenity schemes has been reduced by £40,000 owing to the fact that the number of units of area in which there are sufficient unemployment assistance recipients to form economic gangs has shown a considerable reduction in recent years.</P>
    <P>The figures I have just given make up the full amount of the Vote, namely, £1,250,000, and as previously stated a further sum of £200,400 is expected to be forthcoming in the form of local contributions towards the cost of certain types of schemes, making a grand total of £1,450,400 available for expenditure in the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Parliamentary Secretary's statement.  When one looks at the items which make up this Vote one finds that they differ very much in character and must be approached from rather different angles.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary said that the lime distribution scheme for this year was estimated to cost £12,000.  If I remember correctly, the Committee of Inquiry into Post-War Agricultural Policy recommended in their report that millions of tons of lime should be put on the land.  I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary agrees with that, but if the committee's report represents the actual position, then I suppose one may say that this proposed expenditure on lime distribution only touches the fringe of the problem.  There is another item, the farm improvements scheme, £400,000. If this farm improvements scheme is worked properly, it ought to produce excellent results.  Of course, the farms are the food factories of this country. I expect the Parliamentary Secretary realises that if this is merely camouflaged maintenance, it is a very different proposition.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that the grants had to be proportional to the number of people employed in a particular area.  We could all agree with that, in so far as it goes, but I am just wondering whether the Government ought not to apply a little more imagination <Col N="224" /> to the whole of this grant.  I think it has figured, for the last five or six years, during the war period, as a sort of Vote that could be expended if any extraordinary and unforeseen emergency in relation to unemployment occurred.</P>
      <P>I can remember discussing this question with the late Parliamentary Secretary, Mr. Hugo Flinn.  He always stressed that they had to try to pick out schemes in which the labour content was very high.  That was perfectly right from his point of view, but we are now passing out of the war emergency period.  We may, of course, be passing into the post-war emergency period, and that has to be faced.  I think we ought to approach a Vote like this from a new angle.  I think that where there is no element of improvement in the Vote, the money is really being voted for the relief of unemployment. I am not going to press the Government to increase their spending because, goodness knows, it is high enough, but I think that they could approach some of these schemes with a little more vision and possibly throw their net a little wider to see whether other people or bodies could not be brought in on these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will tell you what I have in mind. I was out in Holland some years ago. I mention Holland, not because I think they are unique there, but because I happened to see what was going on there to a greater extent, possibly, than in some other foreign countries.  Remember that the country lends itself to this sort of work.  They appeared to be dredging the canals and dykes, pumping the mud out of the canals where it was interfering with shipping and spreading it over land which was too low to be of any use, and they were steadily reclaiming land at a very low cost.  I mention that because there was some idea that there is one place here where apparently that could be done.  I believe that is in Dublin Bay.  There was some idea that from the Pigeon House Fort to Merrion you could have some sort of retaining wall.  With improved appliances, I do not know whether they could not put up some sort of wall as was put up in the <Col N="225" /> Channel on D-day and do it much cheaper.  Then they could pump the material out of the River Liffey and reclaim what would be ground for an aerodrome, etc.</P>
    <P>I mention that because that scheme was referred to at the beginning of the war period, and I understand the Port and Docks Board wanted to have something to say about it.  They were afraid that if there was considerable reclamation in Dublin Bay, it might interfere with the currents in the river.  They were approached as to what their attitude was and they were asked what would enable them to make up their minds.  They said they would have to make some sort of model of the bay, which would cost a couple of thousand pounds.  I remember raising the matter about six years ago and I was told that the scheme was actively under investigation.  I suppose it has been under investigation for the past six years.  I do not think there is any reason why that scheme should not be brought out and blessed or cursed as a long-term scheme for the improvement of the amenities of the city and also for the relief of unemployment.</P>
    <P>There is another thing that is somewhat peculiar, but I will not say that it is peculiar to the County of Dublin. I am afraid I am approaching this matter more and more on the lines of a person who lives in County Dublin and possibly the remarks I make about County Dublin could be made applicable to other parts of the country.  We have a problem in County Dublin, namely, coast erosion.  The tide is a very fickle thing and it is receding in some places and coming in in others.  At Clontarf some years ago the corporation wanted to widen the roadway and they did what I think was a very sensible thing.  They erected a wall on the outside, a sort of retaining wall.  I believe I am correct in this statement, but on investigation the Parliamentary Secretary will find out whether I am right or not.  They had to bring over a Dutch firm of contractors who pumped mud off the slob-lands into what was really a tank. They left it to settle for some months and then came back and filled it up again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="226" /> I wonder whether, if the harbour people all around the coast got together with the staff who administer this Vote, and possibly some of the county council engineers, some scheme could not be formulated under which a tug would be common property and would go around the country and carry out improvements on the basis of moneys provided for these schemes.  I mention this because I feel, and many other people feel, that there is a very great difference between the dead weight of an Employment Schemes Vote which does not return anything to the country except the alleviation of the distress of these people and a scheme with any improvement content which would steadily improve the amenities and facilities of particular areas.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that that could be done.</P>
    <P>Another matter in relation to which I do not think sufficient vision was shown is the matter of some of these road improvement schemes.  I live on the coast and I come into and go out of the city morning and evening, passing along the road to Dún Laoghaire. The main road from Dublin to Dún Laoghaire and beyond Dún Laoghaire could all be widened.  There are built-up areas along the road and nobody will suggest that you should go into the city and start to hack a wide traffic artery through the city, but the road was widened at Booterstown where the reclamation costs were low, and probably they were very wise in that.  But we have had a war, during which employment was very desirable at particular periods.  Why did they stop at the People's Park in Blackrock?  Surely they could have cut a slice off it and could then have planted trees to take the place of the other trees.</P>
    <P>I can tell the House why they did not do so.  There is a fairly extensive bridge over a river alongside Blackrock Park and what probably frightened them from widening the road there was the idea that, to extend the main road for about 20 feet, would involve the expenditure of a couple of thousand pounds.  That, however, would probably have kept a stone mason from going across to England and would have kept him busy.  He could then <Col N="227" /> turn to work on the houses which are being built, now that materials are more freely available.</P>
    <P>I mention these points because I feel that we have arrived at a sort of milestone, and, while I can sympathise with the position of the Government, and while we must consider the number of unemployed in a particular area and must consider the labour content of any scheme, I want to make a plea to the Parliamentary Secretary to examine the situation with a view to seeing if there is not a field outside which ought to be explored by the experts of his Department, in association with bodies such as I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Deputy will agree that the farm improvements scheme, the rural improvements schemes, and the minor relief schemes are valuable assets, but unfortunately we find that, in seeking to have these schemes applied to particular areas, there are certain snags, and that, good as the schemes are, when we seek to get the benefit of these schemes for the people in certain localities, we find that the grants are not available. Quite recently, I went to the rural improvements schemes office in connection with a road into a bog.  I have been for a long time trying to get this road in an area which is a turf producing area.  One reply I got was that as there were not a certain number of unemployed registered in the area, the people in the area did not qualify for the grant unless they contributed 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>This road leads into a bog on which last year between 3,000 and 4,000 tons of turf for private use and for sale were produced.  The unfortunate position is that, although this road would be a great benefit to the people in the area, a grant will not be given for it, and it is very hard to ask people who live five, six or ten miles away from the area to contribute to the construction of a road from which they will derive no direct benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I handed in a list to the Office of Public Works setting out the number of unemployed in the area, and, so far as I could ascertain the particulars from the people in the locality, the <Col N="228" /> amount of turf produced there last year.  I got a reply yesterday stating that more detailed information with regard to this road should be given, which means that I have to go back again and seek more particulars from the people, even though I am quite satisfied that the amount of turf produced and the number of people taking turf from that bog ought to be sufficient to satisfy the Parliamentary Secretary that there is a need for this road.</P>
    <P>With regard to the number of unemployed registered in the area, the position is that when a man is employed in such an area, he is usually employed more or less around the town.  In the particular district where the road is required there are a number of very small farmers who are working out an existence more or less on turf production.  It is very unfair to these people that they get no chance of making their living.  Last year hundreds of tons of turf remained on the side of the road near the bog because they could not manage to get lorries up there to haul it away.  If they had a proper road, private lorry owners would be able to haul the turf away from that area.  Not very far away from that there is another road to which the same thing applies.  It is very difficult to ask people who live at a distance from a particular road to contribute anything towards its reconstruction.</P>
    <P>Where a certain amount of turf is being produced in an area, I think that provision ought to be made for the people who have to depend on the bog to make their living.  A few years ago when the fuel situation here was serious for everybody, the people in these areas were satisfied to work early and late to provide that fuel.  If proper facilities were provided for these people, turf production could be made a post-war industry.  They are not looking for very much.  All they want is a small piece of road through the mountain. They have to contribute their share of taxation as well as anybody else, and in fairness to them they ought to be provided with a road. There is a heading in this Vote: &ldquo;Rural Employment Schemes: Provision  <Col N="229" /> for Roads and Amenity Schemes, etc., in Rural Areas.&rdquo;  Would culs-de-sae come under that heading?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They would be rural schemes proposed by county surveyors, cutting off corners, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will remember that for the last two years I have been interesting myself in a particular cul-de-sac.  There is no hope of getting the work done on that road, even though all those living on it, except one, are satisfied that the work should go ahead.  There are seven farmers living on that road and six of them were satisfied to have the work carried out and to pay their contribution under the rural improvements scheme.  But, because the person at the entrance to the road refused, they could not get a grant.  If the county council were able to take over that road, the county surveyor would do the work.  But here you have six farmers held up like birds in a cage and they can do nothing.  Unless the man at the entrance gives permission for a threshing machine to go through his garden the other six farmers cannot thresh at all.  That is a very unhappy state of affairs for those farmers who are engaged in food production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there was the question of another cul-de-sac which I brought up at the last meeting of the county council.  Last winter that road was flooded.  On one occasion a sick person had to wade through the water.  The county council have no power to take over roads like that.  Turf has also to be carted over that road.  I tried to get a grant under the minor relief scheme and the reply I got was that there was not the required number of unemployed registered in the district and therefore a grant could not be given. There are 12 families living on that road.  These small farmers would be very glad to earn a few weeks' wages working on the road in order to qualify for the grant.  You cannot, however, expect them to register as unemployed. They are not unemployed; they are small farmers.  Nevertheless they could earn three or four weeks' wages at a time when their other work would be completed, particularly at this period of the year.  I think a proper road <Col N="230" /> should be provided for these small farmers. They are paying their rates, rents and taxes, the same as those who enjoy what I may call the speed tracks. If the county council are debarred from doing this work I think the Board of Works ought to see that provision is make for these farmers.  We are told that a certain number of unemployed must be registered in these areas.  I think that small farmers with a valuation under £5 should be recognised as unemployed in those areas and, if there is a certain number of them, that the work should be carried out.</P>
    <P>In connection with the rural improvement schemes, I think that where over 50 per cent. of the people are satisfied to carry out a certain work the others should be compelled to agree.  I raised that point by way of a Parliamentary Question, but the Parliamentary Secretary was not prepared at that time to agree to the suggestion I made.  I do not think it would be any hardship to the other 30 or 40 per cent. to ask them to contribute on a valuation basis.  It might not be fair to ask everyone to contribute an equal sum, but if the contribution was based on the valuation there could not be any grievance. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will see, where such schemes are asked for in certain areas and over 50 per cent. of the people concerned agree that they should be carried out, that the others are compelled to agree so that the schemes can go ahead.</P>
    <P>In my district also we find that a lot of applications for improvement grants are held up owing to delay in inspection. I think the Parliamentary Secretary should see that certain areas are not left unattended for a very long period in that respect.  In one case two farmers had improvement work done to a particular road over 12 months ago.  They are still waiting for an inspector.  Up to a week ago he had not come.  I think that is very unfair because during the slack period now these two farmers could have had the work carried out and put the hay and harvest in.  As it is they will not be able to do that particular work and they will have to carry on for another year in that position.</P>
    <P>Some years ago when a number of <Col N="231" /> relief schemes were under way, in order to provide employment in particular areas, bog roads and bog boreens were begun; some of them were completed but some of them were left over and have never been completed since. Whether that was due to lack of money or scarcity of men I do not know, but I would ask the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that that work will be carried out and that the grants will be made available.  In the western parts of the County Waterford there are two or three such roads which ought to be completed in my opinion.  I would suggest, too, that where such roads and works are completed they should be taken over and maintained by the county council.  In the year 1934/5 an expenditure of very nearly £1,000 was made on a certain road in the area.</P>
    <P>Quite recently a further application was made for a contribution to carry out improvements on that road again. We have now agreed that the county council will take over the road, but I think it most unfair to the ratepayer and the taxpayer that money should be expended on roads and that those roads are then allowed to deteriorate for a number of years, or until such time as it becomes necessary to expend more money on them.  The local authority should take over all such roads when they are completed either under a road improvement scheme or a minor relief scheme.  When they are completed naturally they are up to the standard required by the county council, and I think it is at that point that they should be taken over and maintained by the county council; otherwise it is a waste of public money when the roads are allowed to deteriorate afterwards.</P>
    <P>At the present moment there is one great difficulty.  Certain grants have been made available in the County Waterford.  Repeatedly at meetings letters come in from people asking the county surveyor why the work is not being proceeded with.  The reason is that the workers will not accept work on these schemes at a lesser wage than that paid to county council workers.  I think that system is very wrong.</P>
    <Col N="232" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  That is quite true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>The county council workers are expected during the slack periods in county council work to go out and work on these schemes.  Now you cannot expect a man to do work at a lesser wage than that which he has hitherto enjoyed when working for the county council.  Very often there is actually county council work which could be carried on, but because of the urgent demand for this other work the men are almost forced to undertake it because if they refuse to do it it is tantamount to sacking or dismissing them.  That state of affairs should not exist.  If that difficulty could be overcome I think much more could be done in the area.  At the second last meeting of the county council we had a letter from a very prominent man in the area asking why certain work was not being carried out.  The reason why it was not being carried out was because of the discrepancy in the wages paid to the workers and their disinclination to accept it at a lower rate of wages.</P>
      <P>I find it very hard to blame the workers for that attitude.  After all, £2 a week is very little to a man when you take into consideration the cost of living and the exposed conditions under which he has to work.  The position is different on the farm.  There, if the weather is bad, the farmer can nearly always find indoor employment for his employees.  The road worker suffers the disability of broken time when the weather is inclement.  As well as that, he has to provide his own bicycle to travel to and from his work and he sometimes has to travel a very long journey indeed.  I think every facility should be given to men working on the county council schemes and every effort should be made to bring their wages up to the appropriate level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the farm improvement scheme, that certainly is an excellent one&mdash;the erection of out-offices and the construction of passages or roads to the farm.  But I doubt if there is enough provision made and I feel that the amount of material required by these inspectors is somewhat too heavy.  I think it is too expensive and <Col N="233" /> too heavy for the type of grant that is given.  However, I suppose that is a matter for the Department.  I am not disputing that the scheme is a good one.  In the long run it will make for better and more pleasant farms generally than have existed heretofore. Now there is one matter in which I have some little cause for regret.  On several occasions I have asked the Minister for Agriculture to make provision for the sinking of pumps in order to provide water on the land.  I think that is absolutely essential and I think that some provision should be made in the farm improvements scheme to provide water for the farms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but perhaps I may be allowed to say a little for myself. I am sure that it would be a very difficult matter to estimate the cost of such a provision but at the same time I think some move should be made by the Department in that direction.  It might be possible to make such provision for, say, a group of two or three farmers in an area and it might also serve to give water to the agricultural labourer in his cottage.  I think the Minister would be very wise to include in his Estimate some provision for the sinking of pumps in order to provide water in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all I really wish to say about these things.  I hope that the Minister will see his way to providing the remedies I have suggested, particularly in regard to the roads.  As regards turf, we are not out of the wood yet in relation to the emergency period.  I think a very long time must elapse before coal will again be available in this country.  Meantime I would be sorry to see the men and women in the rural areas&mdash;in Ballysaggart and the other places I have mentioned, who have gone into the production of turf during the last five or six years in order to provide fuel during the emergency&mdash;thrown completely overboard.  I think every reasonable precaution should be taken to see that their work is not forgotten and to ensure that it will be one of the essential items maintained in the <Col N="234" /> post-war programme.  I think it would be very bad policy on the part of the Government to let those people down. They were the people who provided us with fuel and now that the emergency is over they must not be lost nor forgotten.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like at the outset, Sir, to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and his staff on having spent an unusually large proportion of the amount of money voted for these various schemes.  I think that during the last year the percentage spent was considerably higher than that spent in any other year.  In saying that of course I am not to be taken as agreeing that the amount voted is anything at all like what I think it should be.  But it is comforting to know that the Parliamentary Secretary and his staff are endeavouring to spend in the most useful way and at the appropriate seasons of the year the maximum of what this House votes.</P>
      <P>The thing that makes me despair of any intelligent approach by the Government to the problem of unemployment or to the development of works which will be productive and which will pay a dividend to the State is to see in a year such as this the same amount voted automatically again.  The Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor was fond of boasting in this House that his trouble was, not to find the money&mdash;he had no trouble whatever in finding all the money he wanted&mdash;but to find useful schemes on which to expend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder is that still the outlook of the Department responsible for the administration of this Vote?  It would seem to be.  If it is, I am surprised. If there was a will to do it, it would be possible to put practically every unemployed man in this country at useful work to-morrow morning, at work which it would pay this country to carry out.  The Parliamentary Secretary would be the first to claim&mdash;and I would agree entirely with him&mdash;that one of the most useful schemes promoted in recent years was the farm improvements scheme.  We know that the only thing that is preventing more <Col N="235" /> and more work being done in connection with that particular scheme is that there is not enough money being voted for it.  We are told in the Budget statement that that is to be remedied this year.  That is a statement which I personally welcome because, as I have said before in this House, I have seen good crops of wheat grown on ground which a few years ago was useless.  For the last 24 years we have been talking, and sometimes some of us have wept about the housing situation in this country.  We are continually affirming our intention and our desire to wipe out the slums and to provide a decent home for every citizen in this State. Unfortunately, when the houses could have been built at perhaps one-third or one-half of the present-day cost and with infinitely better materials, we did more weeping than building.  I am not so sure that, if a proper survey were made of the country to-morrow morning, our housing situation would be found to be any better to-day than it was 25 years ago, notwithstanding the efforts made in the last 25 years.  If there is a genuine desire to carry out useful work and to create employment, I want to know why it is that we have not every available able-bodied man in this country at work to-day in development schemes and housing schemes.  I know we have not the materials for building the houses.</P>

      <P>I am talking about relief schemes and emergency schemes.  I am not talking about housing. I have said that I am perfectly aware that the materials required to build houses are not available.  I am talking about developing sites upon which I hope houses will be built.  Why not develop the sites and have them ready and give employment to the men, so that when the material becomes available we can start to build the houses right away?  There is an essential scheme and a useful scheme.  It is work that will have to be done and which I suggest should be done now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not wait to develop and <Col N="236" /> lay out our ground, make roads and footpaths and lay on water and sewerage when the bricks and the mortar, the timber and the slates and the steel are available and are lying on the site. That is work that will pay for itself and it is work which, if properly developed and properly carried out, will give employment to thousands of men and they need not be restricted to three or four days a week.</P>
    <P>Although I come from an inland county, I have a note here of another matter&mdash;coast erosion.  A passing reference was made to this matter by Deputy Dockrell.  When it is known to a Deputy like myself, who was born and reared in a county 80 miles from the sea, it must be known to every Deputy that erosion is taking place not only on the east coast but particularly on the west coast.  Do not we know that there are certain villages and even towns that are being eaten away?  Is there any reason why we could not have men at work on that? We have the cement factories, we have the sand and the stone, we have most of the material that would be required for the work.  Why is it not being done?  Is it to be left to the local authority?  If it is, I venture to suggest it will never be done because it is beyond the capacity of the local authority in very many cases to deal with it.  The country is being eaten into by the sea and it is crumbling away all around our coast and no attention is being paid to it.  No effort is being made to stop it, notwithstanding the fact that not only would it be a useful work but it is work which would give a great deal of employment. If we are to-day paying out money through our labour exchanges to men for doing nothing, I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that it is our own fault.  Let me suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;I am sure he is fully aware of it, but we will have to keep pressing until something is done &mdash;that it is infinitely better to have men employed preparing housing sites, trying to check erosion or on any other useful work than to have them lining up at the labour exchange for a miserable pittance.  It would be better for themselves and for the nation if they were getting a week's wages and giving <Col N="237" /> useful work in return.  From what I know of unemployed men in general in this country, I am perfectly sure that they would far prefer to be working than to be lining up at the labour exchange for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>We are told that there is a hard core of 60,000 unemployed.  Why are not some of the thousands of unemployed that are lining up at the Dublin labour exchanges put to work removing the unsightly shelters from the middle of the streets of this city? Twelve months after the war, in some of the main thoroughfares in this city, which are terribly congested, there are these unsightly and dangerous buildings. I cannot understand it.  There are innumerable other&mdash;perhaps smaller&mdash;schemes which I could mention upon which men could be employed with benefit not only to themselves but to the nation.  Why these opportunities are not availed of, I fail to understand.  The Government seems to have come to the conclusion that 60,000 or 70,000 or 80,000 unemployed persons in this small State, with a falling population, must be looked upon as normal because it has been going on for years.  Unfortunately, we have to admit that, if our unemployment situation had not been relieved by another country, instead of having 60,000 or 70,000 unemployed, as the Minister mentioned in his Budget speech, we should, probably, have about 130,000. That is a state of affairs which need not and ought not exist.  I hope that, before the Parliamentary Secretary comes before the House on similar business again, we shall have some evidence that this matter is being tackled in a serious way.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I want to say that, in my opinion, the moneys which the House is asked to vote for the various services by this Department are well administered.  Apart altogether from the relief of unemployment, the State is getting an excellent return for its money under this Vote.  The money is spent upon schemes which are helpful to the whole community and, in particular, to the farming community.  In many areas, the amenities have been improved under these schemes and they have brought some little comfort and <Col N="238" /> ease to residents.  My only objection to the Estimate is that the House is not voting enough money for that type of work, which is not only beneficial to the unemployed person but beneficial to the State.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dockrell raised the question of reclamation.  I am sorry he has left the House.  He referred to certain schemes of reclamation in Holland and he told us that they were cheaply done.  I wonder if the Deputy is aware that, before the first world war, the reclamation schemes on the Zuyder Zee cost £100 per acre?  The Dutch thought they were getting good value.  That work would cost considerably more now.  As Holland was congested, they thought that scheme was good business and they carried it out.  I rose because of a reclamation scheme in which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle took some interest &mdash;in Minane Bridge area.  It was undertaken before the first world war but has not been effected yet.  A revised estimate in 1936 put the cost at about £25 per acre.  That would erect a causeway which would reclaim between 600 and 1,000 acres which are being gradually submerged.  I agree with what Deputy Heskin said that, if you go on looking for unemployed on the registers, it will be years before these things will be done.  These schemes would be a godsend in districts where you have men with small farms and a number of sons working on them.  They could earn a certain amount of money during seasons when they would not be so busy on their land.  I think that it is shortsighted to be looking for unemployed on the register.  These farmers' sons would do as much work in a week as the others would do in a month, because they are used to that type of work. There should be a new approach to this question of rural improvements.  If farmers' sons are enabled to give a hand, they will have their carts and horses available at times of the year when they are not busy.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to take up these schemes, which will be of permanent advantage to the community and the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apropos of this matter, in the case <Col N="239" /> of schemes outside the borough boundary in which a county council is interested, idle men inside the city boundary are not allowed to work on them. That is because the county council is interested and may have made some contribution to the scheme.  I tried, during the past year, to get work on these schemes for unemployed married men who were working inside the city.  I argued that they had some claim inasmuch as they were working allotments in the county in their spare time.  The engineer could do nothing in the matter as the scheme was a county one and these were city men.</P>
    <P>If the problems in the city were tackled, there might be no necessity for these men trying to get work in the county.  Men reared in the county will give twice the return that city men will give on work in the county. They know the type of work.  In Cork City, and I suppose in other areas, there are, as Deputy Morrissey said, large derelict areas where houses have been demolished.  These are shameful blots on the cities.  Men are unemployed and nothing is being done to clear those areas.  I do not blame the Parliamentary Secretary or his Department.  I blame the local officials &mdash;whether they be county manager, city managers, or engineers&mdash;who are not putting up those schemes to the Department for sanction.  Half the men who left the country need not have gone if those things had been undertaken. The time to tackle them was when building was not proceeding and when men were available.  In the course of 12 months, building schemes will be progressing and then men will not be available.  The men who had been engaged in drawing coal from the port were idle during that period and there was this work to be done. This was pointed out to the city manager more than once but nothing was done to put these men into employment. It seems to me that some of those people do not want to push those schemes ahead at all.  If a particular work is going to cost £100 more than we think it should cost, that should not deter us.  Men should be taken off the dole and given useful work and these petty restrictions <Col N="240" /> should be removed.  In Cork, the road grants were exhausted in some cases last January and these men were unemployed until the new ratings came into operation.  If they worked on those unemployment schemes they would have to accept 30/- instead of the £2 they were getting.  They would have to work the same number of hours and why should they be asked to work at a lower rate of wages than the regular rate?  The permanent employment of a man at a reasonable return makes him content.  When a man employed on the roads says to himself: &ldquo;These grants will become exhausted at a certain time and we will then be thrown on the Unemployment Fund,&rdquo; you will not get the same return from him as you would from a man who can say to himself: &ldquo;The work is there; we can work to the end of the year content in the knowledge that we shall have the same weekly return to maintain ourselves and our families.&rdquo;  I think there are some restrictions in regard to these schemes which could reasonably be removed to the general advantage.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the farm improvement schemes.  All these schemes are excellent and everybody admits that since the present Parliamentary Secretary assumed office more and more of these schemes are coming along.  We know from the Minister for Finance that he is making more money available for such schemes than was ever provided before and I think that is all to the good because any man travelling rural Ireland will at once be struck by the large number of shacks of barns and unsightly hay sheds.  As well as giving money for the making of floors and work of that kind, I think the Department should provide more opportunities for farmers to construct barns in which they can store their grain or keep sufficient seed for themselves for the following year.  This country is crying aloud for development and the sooner we remove any restrictions which set up distinctions between men in towns and cities, because of some small little city boundary, the better it will be for all concerned. Any work that is of permanent advantage will have the effect of increasing <Col N="241" /> the revenue from rates and at the same time will have the effect of increasing our potentialities as regards the production of food and the provision of work generally.  The local authorities should give more support to the Department by putting up useful schemes and they should be encouraged to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose my county makes one of the heaviest calls on this Vote, particularly for schemes under three headings&mdash;minor relief schemes, rural improvement schemes and farm improvement schemes.  There is no doubt but that the farm improvement scheme is a wonderful one.  To take that first, I think I could not make any recommendation except that the scope of the scheme might be extended.  I was not present when the Parliamentary Secretary was making his opening statement and I do not know whether it is intended to extend the farm improvement scheme to include the erection or the renovation of out-office buildings or to make it apply to improvements other than the putting in of flooring and minor changes of that kind.</P>
      <P>The last speaker said that the country is crying aloud for development in this respect and I fully agree with him. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary has travelled many times through the west of Ireland and knows that we are only just beginning to develop there, gradually getting our feet as it were, and that there are very few farms that are equipped with sufficient out-office accommodation.  Hay sheds and buildings of that kind are very necessary on account of our wet climate.  Even to the casual observer, it must be apparent that the loss in farm implements, tools and machinery must be pretty considerable, due to the fact that there is not sufficient storage accommodation for them.  I should like to see the improvement of farm out-offices brought within this very excellent scheme of farm improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards minor employment schemes, the condition which makes a scheme dependent on the number of registered unemployed in a particular electoral division I regard as a humbug. I think that should be abolished <Col N="242" /> as soon as possible.  I know quite well that the aim of the Minister is to provide employment or some means of relieving distress during the winter months in districts where there is a big number of registered unemployed but, on the other hand, that must have the effect in the long run of the same jobs being done over and over again because it is practically the same electoral division that has constantly the large number of unemployed that qualifies it for a minor employment scheme. I am certain that must have the effect of jobs being done again and again in a particular electoral division whilst an adjoining electoral division that has not the requisite number of unemployed never gets a job done at all.  The result is that many by-roads and other schemes which could be attended to during the winter months have been allowed to deteriorate into a truly shocking condition.  I can vouch for the fact that in some areas by-roads have fallen into such a state that traffic on them is practically impossible.  It is a huge question, I will admit, but nevertheless something must be done about it.</P>
    <P>In the case of rural improvement schemes, again we find that unfortunately schemes which are likely to benefit eight, ten, or 20 persons are frequently held up by reason of the fact that one crank in a district stands out and will not agree to the work being done although the vast majority of his neighbours are in favour of it. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take powers now to override an objection of that kind if no serious hardship is imposed on the objector by putting through the scheme.  In 99 out of 100 cases the scheme is concerned with the making of a road or it may mean the easing of a corner.  One man living very near the main road may not give a foot of ground to enable the scheme to be carried out.  In such cases I think the man should either be compensated for ground which is required or the Minister should take powers to put the job through in spite of him where the Board of Works engineer sends in a report to the effect that no serious inconvenience or permanent loss will be <Col N="243" /> caused to that man by the carrying through of the scheme.  The same remarks apply to drainage as to the making of roads.</P>
    <P>The carrying out of drainage schemes is a burning question in my area.  In that case again you may find a man through whose lands a drain runs.  It is good arable land and for that reason the drain may have been sunk with the result that that particular man never suffers from flooding.  Just through sheer downright carelessness he refuses to contribute to a scheme of which all his neighbours are in favour. In some cases he goes so far as to oppose the whole scheme.  I think that frivolous objections of that kind should be swept aside as soon as possible. Such objections prevent the carrying through of useful works in connection with by-roads and drainage and it is next to impossible to get them done under the existing regulations.  I know quite well that it is not easy to find money to finance all these schemes. For minor relief schemes a sum of £100,000 is being provided and for rural improvement schemes a sum of £90,000, the same figure as last year. I think £90,000 is a very small provision for schemes of that character.</P>
    <P>I should also like to bring under the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary the fact that in my county valuations are generally low and the contributing beneficiaries are sometimes very poor. I know that a certain amount of latitude is given to Board of Works officials to increase the amount of the grant where they are satisfied that the conditions justify it, but I think that there should be a general rule that, where necessary, the grant should be 87½ per cent. instead of 75 per cent. In that case the beneficiaries, who might be called upon to contribute £8 or £10 to a scheme, would have an opportunity of earning back three times more than they would be called upon to contribute to the scheme. Very often people would find it very hard to make the contribution that would enable them to earn that amount.  They do not like to expose their poverty, as they cannot contribute unless they sell <Col N="244" /> stock or do something like that.  The result is that they generally object to the scheme rather than expose their poverty.  I think that in all cases where the valuations are under £10 the grant should be increased in the case of those beneficiaries from 75 per cent. to 87½ per cent.  That would be £12 10s. 0d. per £100.  In the case of all these farm improvement schemes my experience of them has been that they have been excellent jobs.  The Board of Works has done lasting jobs and given complete satisfaction in every case.  I have never heard a single complaint in regard to any of them.  They were wonderful jobs as compared to the minor employment schemes.  With regard to the latter, there is a reason for that which I am not going to go into now.  I would like to see as much money as possible devoted to these rural improvement schemes.  I would be glad to see the Parliamentary Secretary take greater latitude in regard to them, especially in the case of beneficiaries under a certain valuation who are in poor circumstances. That is the position that obtains over practically the whole of County Mayo.  There are certain districts, of course, in which the valuations are fairly high.  The persons concerned in those cases can get the work done quite easily themselves.</P>
    <P>There is one other point that I wish to put before the Parliamentary Secretary. The Mayo County Council levied a sum of 4d. in the £ on the rates and collected in or about £5,000. The idea was that that sum should be divided equally between the councillors to be devoted as a contribution towards the carrying out of rural improvement schemes in many areas. When we interviewed the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in connection with the matter, he turned it down and said it was illegal and not in order.  I would like to stress the need for this scheme.  It would provide a reasonable sum of money which could be utilised for helping beneficiaries under the scheme.  That was the intention of the county council.  I asked the Minister for Finance to legalise a contribution of 12½ per cent. from the levy of 4d. in the £ and 12½ per cent. from the beneficiaries to meet the total <Col N="245" /> contribution of 25 per cent.  I would like if this levy of 4d. could be legalised so as to allow councillors to contribute half the cost towards the carrying out of a rural improvement scheme which, like the farm improvement scheme, is calculated to produce excellent results.  Many of the people who would benefit under it are in a desperate plight, and this contribution if it were legalised would enable councillors to come to their rescue.</P>
    <P>The present position of those people is that they have to transport turf and farm crops across the fields.  They cannot make use of the roads which are washed away.  On many of them there are big boulders of rocks sticking up which break cart wheels and endanger the lives of people guiding horses along them.  The councillors concerned would only use this money in the very worst cases to help tenants who are very badly situated.  I cannot see what would be illegal in doing that, especially when the general bulk of the ratepayers are prepared to contribute this 4d.  After all, a great many ratepayers are themselves living on by-roads while they have to contribute to the upkeep and maintenance of the county roads which they use very seldom, perhaps only when they are going to Mass on Sundays or to attend fairs or markets.</P>
    <P>I might point out that the mileage of by-roads in my county far exceeds that of the main roads.  That shows at a glance what a huge problem the maintenance of main roads in my county is for the general body of the ratepayers.  The same is true of practically every other county.  I want to say again that if this levy were legalised the ratepayers would not object.  They are prepared to contribute towards providing the amenity I speak of for their less fortunate neighbours who are living on by-roads.  The only other way in which this work could be done is under a rural improvement scheme, and very often you may get some cranky person who will object and so prevent the scheme from going through.</P>
    <P>Drainage is a burning question in my county as I think it is in many other of the western counties.  The Parliamentary <Col N="246" /> Secretary should do everything possible to facilitate the starting of drainage work at as early a date as possible.  Appeals have been made to farmers in the Dáil to further food drives.  Only yesterday morning I met a farmer who told me that, due to the lack of drainage, he had lost 22 sheep and four cattle through fluke.  That is only one instance, but I could give many more.  In my speech on the Budget, I suggested to the Minister for Finance that a good deal of drainage could be done in the upper catchment areas. The rivers could be drained without any danger of causing flooding lower down.  In the case of a big drainage scheme it is natural, of course, to start at the river's mouth, but if what I suggest were done it would not cause any trouble lower down.  If the drainage of the upper areas were undertaken it would mean that there would be so much less work to be done when the Arterial Drainage Act is put into operation. It is a fallacy to say that, if this drainage were undertaken, it would result in flooding lower down.  If the drains are made in dry weather the water will go through and will not cause flooding.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCarthy referred to the reclamation work carried out on the Zuyder Zee at a cost of £178 per acre.  He mentioned that enormous benefits accrued from that work. I do not know that conditions in this country are similar to those which obtain near the Zuyder Zee.  A tremendous amount of silting may have occurred there before the drainage works were carried out.  There you have a rich alluvial soil.  Our trouble is that we have a great deal of erosion on a number of our rivers which is washing <Col N="247" /> away the fertility of the land.  In the Minority Report of the Drainage Commission, the economy of drainage work in this country was questioned&mdash;as to whether or not there was any economic advantage at all to be gained from drainage.  The question is one which cannot be passed over in the simple way that Deputy Blowick is inclined to pass it over.  While I am not very much worried about that, I do want to say that the social aspect of the question cannot be ignored.  People cannot be expected to live for ever under the conditions in which many are living to-day. In this Parliament we ought to be concerned not merely with the economic aspect of the question but with its social aspects as well.  As regards any problem you cannot ignore the economic aspects of it since they have a direct bearing on its social aspects.  For some years after I became a member of the House I questioned the policy in operation at that time for dealing with unemployment. The approach then was to ignore the economic aspects of it and merely provide works to solve unemployment.  I think our capacity to produce wealth is not so great that we can ignore completely the economic aspect.</P>
      <P>I think the carrying of the unemployed on doles and subsidies and the employment of people to do work that has no improvement aspect and that is not productive of wealth, is a very short-sighted policy.  I want to stress that very strongly.  The tendency in recent years to find a better type of scheme, a scheme that has an improvement character and that will eventually produce wealth is a step in the right direction.  I think I can congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary that much useful work has been done, but far more can be done and our unemployment problem could be solved to a great extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many aspects of our economic life that are still open to improvement.  I can give one instance that has not been referred to up to the present.  A tremendous lot of work has been done in Great Britain during the emergency on what is known as hill improvement schemes.  The economic <Col N="248" /> possibilities of hill improvement are far greater even than the possibilities of bog improvement.  Sir George Stapleton of Aberystwith converted the hills of Wales.  The white, worthless turf on many a hillside in Wales was converted into a fine green sward.  That can be done in this country, too.  There are any amount of hills here capable of development.  They are not all of very high altitudes.  They are almost barren and will respond to proper treatment.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, we have neglected a potential asset, one that we ought not further to ignore.  Our attitude ought to be to work out schemes that will provide employment for our people.  It is an extraordinary thing that during the emergency, in a country like this, whose primary purpose is the production of food, when food was at a premium, we exported the best of our people and we had to carry large numbers of unemployed.  If we only looked round us we could have developed our country in many ways.</P>
    <P>It is to be regretted that little or nothing has been done in the way of rural development and land reclamation, not only the reclamation of bogs but of hills as well.  However, it is better late than never and from this onwards the Parliamentary Secretary ought to devote his attention to farm improvements and rural development on a more extensive scale.</P>
    <P>One thing that is hampering rural improvement is the low wage, because with a low wage policy you are getting a low output.  We must consider the hardship to the individual and the low income going into a family.  There is the other aspect, that you are getting a low return.  The man who is paid a low wage is not always the cheapest man; in fact, he is very often the dearest man.  Measuring the benefit of any scheme of this sort from a wealth point of view, leaving out the employment aspect, you will find you are getting greater benefit through a high wage policy than a low wage policy. That is my experience.  There is a scheme in operation not far away from where I live and the man output is appallingly low.  The men are discontented. They are not satisfied with the wages they receive and they are not <Col N="249" /> going to do any serious work.  They are slinging the lead all the time.  I think that obtains all over the country.</P>
    <P>I was amazed at some farmer Deputies advocating compulsion.  When will we realise that we want freedom? Surely we have enough examples from Europe of the all-powerful State and of State intervention.  We do not want regimentation here.  I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary has been successfully appealed to in this connection. I am glad that he has been slow to adopt compulsory methods so far as rural improvement schemes are concerned. Let there be methods of persuasion. Have recourse to any methods but let the last method be that of compulsion.</P>

      <P>I merely raised it in passing.  I am not in agreement with any Deputy who advocates that we should apply this farm improvements scheme to housing.  That ought to come under a different scheme.  I believe if we bring housing under this scheme the bulk of the money will go towards housing and we will neglect a very important matter, that is, land improvement.  We should continue to devote this money to land improvement. This money was directed in the first instance to drainage, land improvement and the making of roads <Col N="251" /> or arteries through the farm.  We should ensure that the money will continue to be earmarked for that purpose. If we throw farm buildings into the scheme I believe 85 or 90 per cent. of the money will go towards the improvement of farmyards.  We are bringing in walls and floors in out-offices and I do not think that that is a step in the right direction.  We would need a further scheme in that connection.</P>
      <P>We should be prepared to invest considerable sums in our primary industry. There are two aspects to be considered, firstly, the improvement of the land and, secondly, the improvement of the farmyards and out-offices. The British Government have a very elaborate scheme at present for the improvement of farm buildings.  They have prepared a variety of plans and specifications to suit a variety of farms.  I think we would not be very far wrong if we adopted their method, but I am definitely in disagreement with a couple of farmer Deputies who have suggested that this should be extended to farm improvements.  I think we will regret it later on.  The things which we have neglected for years, and even before this Parliament came into existence, are drainage and land improvements.  When we are earmarking a sum of money for farm improvement, our idea ought to be land improvement, and if we narrow down the scope of this Vote to land improvement, we will eventually reap the reward. In saying that, I must say that I agree that farmyards generally throughout the country are not of modern type and not sufficient for modern conditions.  The State will have to intervene in that respect and will have to provide some stimulus to encourage the farming community to improve their farmsteads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say a few words now on the administration of the scheme. Some of the scales laid down are wrong.  They are being gradually &mdash; I suppose, from experience &mdash; adjusted and corrected.  Last year, there were included in the scheme shelter walls to encourage the making of farmyard manure, walls beside which cattle could be sheltered.  The specification <Col N="252" /> for the wall was absurd.  It was to be a foot wide, and the Department was not prepared to sanction anything less than 12 inches of concrete.  The Parliamentary Secretary has enough practical experience to realise that that was humbug.  It is not necessary to have a wall a foot wide &mdash; a wall of nine inches or ten inches is ample.  A number of people who are anxious to avail of the scheme to build a concrete wall spoke to me and said that the inspector put down his foot and insisted on the specification set out.  I am satisfied that that did not show any practical experience.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is making it very weak.  He is thinking in terms of 20 to one. Deputy Dockrell did not realise that the bulk of the money in respect of the lime scheme is provided in the Vote for Agriculture.  There is a small sum in this Estimate and the Deputy criticised the reduction in the amount provided.  He is entitled to criticise, and justified in doing so, and, from what he said, I appreciated this much, that he has read the report of the Agricultural Post-War Planning Committee because he told us that the report recommended a very substantial increase in the amount of lime which should be applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is so, and it is not wise policy that this figure should be adjusted downwards.  There should be a substantial adjustment upwards.  There is a huge acid problem in the country and <Col N="253" /> I do not think the people responsible for improving soil conditions realise the magnitude of that problem.  Some of the people who referred to these conditions in the report of the commission alluded to by Deputy Dockrell, did appreciate its magnitude, but it appears to me that the people who prepared this Estimate had not any appreciation of what the problem is, or of how essential it is from a national point of view to ensure that the farmers are encouraged to use calcium to the maximum.  In New Zealand, even before the war, lime was available on every farm &mdash; a ton of lime at 7/- per ton &mdash; but we are merely touching the fringe of the problem and I am alarmed to see a downward adjustment in the amount provided for congested districts.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into the matter and not to be cheeseparing.  If there is any pruning to be done, surely it ought not to be done on the money provided for such an important scheme.</P>

      <P>It is very unfortunate and certainly very unsatisfactory.  I agree with Deputy Morrissey in his criticism of the small amount of preparation made for building &mdash; the preparation of sites, clearing of sites and so on.  We have a lot of derelict conditions in many towns.  We can see them as we drive through every town and it is a shocking state of affairs. Many of our unemployed could be put to clearing them and having the ground ready, once materials are available, for going ahead with building. Building is a very big problem. Numbers of our young people are anxious to marry and settle down in <Col N="254" /> life, but, because they cannot get a home, they are precluded from getting married.  I am not blaming the Government for that unfortunate state of affairs, but I say that we should have all preparations made and any site suitable for building purposes ought to be cleared and made ready for the moment that materials become available.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary being complimented.  There is no doubt that he deserves it.  With regard to minor employment schemes, it would appear as if it was never intended that the maximum amount of benefit would be got from the amount spent on them, but, as one Deputy has said, unless the men are paid the amount which they are paid on other schemes, it is hard to expect that the results will be as great.  We know that the amount set aside for these schemes in any electoral division depends on the number of registered unemployed there, and I am sorry that excluded from that number are the sons of farmers whose valuation is over a certain figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in my limited experience had knowledge of a number of divisions where there are plenty unemployed, but where these schemes cannot operate.  Some of the unemployed there are not registered and they cannot be registered because the means test operates against them.  The sons of a farmer who has a valuation of £5 or £6 can be registered and he himself can be registered, whereas if a farmer with a valuation of £20 has five sons, none of them can be registered.  That is an injustice and this is not the first time the matter has been brought to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I hope it will sink in this time.  Rural improvements schemes undoubtedly give the best returns.  I think that one of the reasons they do give the best return is that the contributing parties have more or less a vested interest in them.  Furthermore, they get an opportunity of earning what they contribute, and sometimes more.  There is no fear that there will be any watching of the clock or evading of the ganger because, in many cases, where one of them is competent <Col N="255" /> to see after the work, he is put in charge of the scheme.  I think it is a very wise procedure.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the scope of the rural improvements schemes extended. At present they embrace only the making of roads and drains.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to keep in mind the fact that there is something more important than roads and drains in my county, even though it may not be so in other counties, and that is, the provision of an adequate water supply in the rural areas.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to bring the provision of water supplies within the scheme for the coming year.  Where there is a local contribution it is just as well to spend some State money on that as on the making of roads and drains.  One Deputy referred to the fact that there was too much water in his area and that in consequence a farmer lost a certain amount of his stock.  Last Sunday a farmer told me that, for want of water on his farm, for years back he has lost one animal every year and that in one year alone he lost three or four.</P>

Are not the hills being improved by another Department?  Is not that part of the scheme which the Minister for Lands has undertaken in his forestry drive?  It has been suggested in connection with the farm improvements scheme that the erection of buildings should not be included and Deputy Hughes is inclined to agree with that suggestion.  In the part of the country I represent the people are not nearly as well off as those in Deputy Hughes's constituency.  There is a demand there that the erection and improvement of outhouses should come within the scope of the farm improvements scheme.  I throw out the suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary that <Col N="256" /> that should be included in the farm improvements scheme for the coming year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at some of the things that Deputies on the Government Benches have said on this Estimate.  As a representative of the working classes and knowing these schemes as I do I should like to tell the Parliamentary Secretary that instead of being called emergency schemes they should be called hardship schemes.  They are put into operation in the worst time of the year, namely, in the winter time.  Deputy McCarthy said that the farmers' sons would be able to do more work in the rural areas.  After all the talk about there being no men in the country to do agricultural work, I am surprised to hear that one of the Government Deputies wants farmers' sons to take on work on these miserable schemes and to work for less than the farmer himself is paying his labourers.  If a grant is to be given to the town of Enniscorthy, the ratepayers must put up so many hundreds of pounds in order to get that grant.  If that is not done the grant is not given.  In addition, the grant must be spent according to the directions of the Department. Although public conveniences and sewerage schemes may be required, the grant must be expended on footpaths and roads.</P>
      <P>The Government should do away with the late Deputy Hugo Flinn's scheme of three days' work a week for the unemployed and give at least six days work in the week.  When a man is put to work on one of these relief schemes he may get a few shillings more than he is receiving in unemployment assistance, but he does not get any food vouchers.  When that man is finished with the work, his boots are worn out and the wages he gets would not provide another pair for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary knows, great flooding occurs north and south of the town of New Ross.  A deputation from the Chamber of Commerce made representations in regard to that matter and I saw in the Press that the Minister for Agriculture went down there.  Nothing has been done about that flooding since, although the <Col N="257" /> time to do work on the banks of the river is when the water is low.</P>
    <P>The rural improvements scheme is used as a means of evading responsibility for the maintenance of laneways and by-ways.  When the question of the maintenance of a laneway or byway comes before the county council, the engineer says that that is a matter for a rural improvements scheme.  In order to avail of that scheme, a certain number of people must take the responsibility of putting up so much money for it and seeing that the work is carried out all right.  The result is that a lot of farmers would not have anything to do with the rural improvements scheme.  On one of these laneways on which there may be only one farmer's house there may be three workers' cottages with large families living in them who are three or four miles from the school or the church and all these people have to go across the fields because they cannot go up the laneway.  Although these people are paying rates, the county council gets out of the responsibility by saying that it is a matter for a rural improvements scheme.  That is going on all over the country.</P>
    <P>Another point is that there must be 16 men idle in the area and those 16 men must be signing on either in the local labour exchange or in some Gárda barracks.  If you look for a grant the first query from the Department is: &ldquo;Are there 16 men signing on the register or in the Gárda barracks?&rdquo;  If there are not 16 men idle in the area then no grant will be made available and you can do no work.  That is a type of policy which I would describe as &ldquo;sending the fool farther.&rdquo;  Now you have all classes of men signing on at the labour exchange. You have the type of man who probably is not strong physically; the majority of them are not properly fed; they may be idle for six months in the year trying to live on the dole and the few food vouchers that are given to them to feed themselves and their families.  At the end of that nine months it is proposed to bring a scheme into operation.  For the first couple of days on that scheme those men exist on dry bread.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> Some of the people have said here in this House to-day that these men do not pull their weight and do not give a return for the work.  At the same time the Government states that it is satisfied with 10 per cent. of the work. I do not for a moment hold that the ratepayers should be mulcted in a sum of £400 in order to meet a grant and at the same time have no say in the employment of the men concerned. Then, again, the men are told that they can only get three days' work in the week.  The sooner an end is put to that system the better it will be for these unfortunate men.  It is not in the winter time that these schemes should be put into operation.  These schemes should be carried out in the fine dry weather of early spring and summer, when more satisfactory work can be done and when the men themselves will not have to suffer the hardships of winter, cold and snow and frost.  The majority of them are badly clothed, badly shod and badly fed.  If this is the way in which these schemes are going to be operated then I warn the Government that they should go out of office before they are put out of office by these unfortunate working class people.</P>
    <P>Added to all these disabilities is the further disability of Party pull.  The foreman is appointed because he happens to be a member of a local Fianna Fáil club.  He is put over these men. It has happened in my own area that men were employed on these schemes as ordinary working men while on previous schemes they were actually acting as foremen.  Some of them happened to be men with large families, but they did not get a chance.  I understood that preference was supposed to be given to these men in the labour exchange.  Quite definitely political influence has some say in the matter, because some of the men are kept on for 12 months, if the scheme lasts that long, while others are dispensed with and have no opportunity of saving a few stamps in order to obviate their being brought before a court of referees.  I have had personal experience in this matter, because I am a member of that court myself.</P>
    <P>The first question the chairman asks <Col N="259" /> is: &ldquo;Where were you when the schemes were going on?&rdquo;&ldquo;I was signing, sir.&rdquo;&ldquo;How is it you were not taken on the scheme?&rdquo;  I have had to supply the answer to that question&mdash; because somebody else was getting the preference.  If the schemes are going to be worked at all they should be worked on a proper rotational system through the labour exchange.  As I said before, if we are going to do satisfactory work it must be done, not in the middle of the winter, but at some more suitable period of the year.  The Parliamentary Secretary was down in my constituency and he visited a scheme that was in operation at the time.  What did he find?  He found the men were practically being washed away on the bank of a river in the depths of the hard winter that has just gone by.  These unfortunate men were brought out in the middle of the winter for three or four days' work, as the case may be.</P>

      <P>Some of them get five days.  They are told then there is not enough money.  Recently I had to raise a matter with the county manager. Men were brought out on our national holiday when every other worker was free.  The Government declared the 18th of March a national holiday; yet these unfortunate workers had to turn out on that day.  I consider that a disgrace. When I raised the matter with the county manager and said to him that these men should be paid for that day I was told that they could not be paid.  Some of these men, I was given to understand, had already worked 150 hours prior to that &mdash; not all of them, but some of them &mdash; and they did not get paid.  Something similar happened on another scheme where, because they did not work six days a week, they were not entitled to be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are Deputies in this House who have simply no conception of what the working man has to go through. One must have come from the ranks of the workers themselves to appreciate their needs.  There is no farmer Deputy in this House who is entitled to get up and speak on behalf of the unemployed.  Neither is any farmer <Col N="260" /> Deputy in this House qualified to criticise the unemployed.  It has been said here in this House that the farmers' sons could do more work.  It is very easy for the farmers' sons to do more work because they are well fed. It is not an easy matter for half starved men.</P>
    <P>Last year we had the very same debate; in May, 1943, the same.  The emergency has passed now.  Are we still going to remain on the three days a week basis or are we going to do away with that?  If these men refuse this work for three or four days in the week they are automatically cut off from the dole.  If they accept the work and the work is completed, what happens then?  They sign on at the labour exchange once more.  But there is a waiting period of six days.  How are they supposed to exist for that six days? They have to go down to the relieving officer with a docket for 6/- or 8/- and wait for another six days, perhaps for a fortnight, sometimes for five weeks, before their claim comes back.  Why is there not some proper system whereby a man who is engaged on a scheme could go back into benefit immediately that scheme ceases?  That waiting period should be cut out completely. There should be no delay where men have stamps to their credit in the labour exchange.  If they sign on Monday they should go into benefit the following Friday.</P>
    <P>I think that I have covered most of the ground as far as the workers on these schemes are concerned.  If something is not done I see very little hope for the people whom I represent &mdash; the working class people, the unemployed, and the workers generally.  Under the present system they are being steam-rolled out of existence.  They are not treated as if they were human beings at all.  I ask the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, if they are going to carry out schemes, to carry them out in a proper manner and at a proper season of the year.  First we are told that we are going to get a grant.  The grant arrives in the month of November and very often the actual work starts on Christmas Eve.  The result is that the men have nothing at all for Christmas.  I appeal to the Parliamentary <Col N="261" /> Secretary to have these schemes carried out in fine weather. That would be much better for the Government, for the local authority and for the men concerned than that they should be carried out in the rain, sleet, frost and snow.  If the Parliamentary Secretary can have that put into effect, I appeal to him to do so and, if not, to tell us here and now that it cannot be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to rural improvement schemes.  Deputy Blowick said that county councils should be allowed to contribute towards rural improvement schemes.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will not agree to that because I think it would be quite bad if local authorities start contributing to rural improvement schemes.  Unless they contribute the full amount, nothing at all will be done.  Once that is started, who is to choose between the different applicants for a rural improvement scheme in any county?  Who is to decide which of them should have a contribution from the county council and which of them should not?  That is what I want to know.  Deputies would be wise in leaving rural improvement schemes outside the ambit of local authorities and in getting all the work that can possibly be done carried out on the present basis.  If there is to be a contribution from local authorities, nothing will be done.  At the present time local authorities are reluctant to provide sufficient moneys to maintain the roads that they have to maintain. It is generally felt that much more money is required to be spent on the roads for which they are responsible. To ask them to take on a new responsibility would be to damage the good work that has been and is being done under the rural improvement schemes. There is the question of the exceptional person on a drainage scheme or on a boreen who will not contribute anything.  I agree with Deputy Blowick that there should be some way of dealing with that case.  I would not be afraid, like Deputy Hughes, of using compulsory powers, if necessary, to make that man contribute in his rates.  We are not entitled to advocate legislation on a Vote, but in my <Col N="262" /> opinion a better way of collecting this contribution would be to collect it in the poor rate, if that were possible. Where persons are reluctant to pay their just contribution to a rural improvement scheme, it should be collected in their poor rate in the following year, and if the county council were given authority to do that it would solve the whole problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No scheme that has been put into operation in this country for a great number of years has given such satisfaction and done so much good to the rural community as the rural improvement scheme.  There were people living along boreens, to which there was no access, and the work carried out under the rural improvement scheme has made life more tolerable for them than it was for their forefathers.  I hope the rural improvement scheme will be carried on in future as it has been over the last few years.  It is giving satisfaction everywhere and much good work has been done under it.  The standard of work done under the scheme is very high. The Office of Public Works are to be congratulated in that respect.  It is quite different from the work that was done in the past under the minor relief scheme.  In connection with the latter scheme it was a question of giving a certain amount of employment over a short period and spending a small sum of money in an area, but under the rural improvement scheme the standard is much higher and much better work has been done, of a permanent nature.  Every encouragement should be given and every pressure brought to bear on local authorities, where the work done may be made into a public road, to get the local authorities to take it over for future maintenance. These schemes will deteriorate if somebody does not take responsibility for their maintenance.  Under the minor employment schemes in many cases people undertook responsibility for maintenance but did not maintain. There is a danger in connection with some of the rural improvement schemes, on which large sums of public money have been spent, together with the contribution from the benefiting owner, that unless some provision is <Col N="263" /> made for future maintenance, a great deal of the money may be wasted.  I do not see how that can be provided against if those who have benefited and who have sunk some of their money in the work are not sufficiently wise to maintain it.  The only hope is that where the laneway is wide enough and where it adjoins two public roads, the local authorities would be willing to take over.  I am sure, if they were encouraged by the Parliamentary Secretary, they would be willing to take over many such roads.  I disagree altogether with Deputy Blowick in his proposal that the local authority should be allowed to contribute 25 per cent. of the cost.  It would be bad in principle and absolutely wrong and would kill the rural improvement scheme in no time.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will not agree to that proposal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes, of course, talked about democracy and compulsion.  I do not see the relationship.  &ldquo;Democracy&rdquo; is a word that is used in this House much too frequently and in a way in which it should not be used.  It is not undemocratic to take sites that have to be taken compulsorily in many cases, to build houses.  It is not considered undemocratic and should not be considered undemocratic to take a perch or half a perch of land from anyone who is holding up a useful scheme that would benefit many of his neighbours and himself.  I suggest that Deputy Hughes should not use the word &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; so loosely.  That word is bandied about here on all occasions, especially by Deputy Hughes.  With regard to the urban employment schemes to which Deputy O'Leary referred and giving employment to unemployed persons in towns, we would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary his opinion as to the future of those schemes.  I agree with Deputy O'Leary that if it were possible, and I think it should be possible, these schemes should be carried out when the weather is favourable rather than during the early winter months. Many of these men are unemployed.  Some of them are only on the border-line of being employable <Col N="264" /> at all.  They may have been in delicate health for many years. They may not have been getting much employment over a long period.  If they could be employed in the summer weather, a higher output would be got and it would be much easier for the men to work in that season than in the winter months.  I cannot see any advantage in the present position.  The men may be earning a little more money, if the weather is favourable, but, if the weather is bad or broken, they will, probably, earn less than if they were on unemployment assistance.  I think that I am right in saying that.  I have seen them break stones with hammers in December and January.  It is a great thing to see men working at any time but it is a hardship on men who have not been well fed and who may not have the best of clothing to have to work in those winter months.  The general experience is that these men have to be a number of weeks working before they become fit to work at all. During their first few days' work per week over the first few weeks, they are not fit for work.  They do not harden up until they are about a month working and the job is almost over by that time.  If the job were one extending to three or four months, there would be a better output towards the end.  The output at the beginning is poor because the men are not in practice, It requires practice to give a good output at any work.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us the experience of output on relief schemes over all the years those relief schemes have been in operation.  What has been the standard output per man?  Is it low or medium or does the standard improve if the job is extended?  I am sure it will be found that, in the second month, there is a higher output than in the first month.  That is the experience of engineers with whom I have discussed the matter.  All these are big problems.  In the towns, there are a number of men who, during a great portion of their lives, have not been employed and who are now virtually unemployable.  We do not know what the reason for that was originally. They seem to have been down on their luck all the time.  At a certain age, <Col N="265" /> they get to a stage at which they are unemployable.  They are registered at the employment exchange but it is very doubtful if some other provision should not be made for them.  It is doubtful that men should be on the register for employment if they are not fit for work at all.  They are a liability on the community and on the State.  In the future, I think that some other provision will have to be made for them.  Some of them are delicate, some are old and there are a hundred and one reasons why they are not employed or why they have never fitted into constant employment.  That is generally accepted in large centres of population.  These schemes have been a long time in operation and there must be a fair appreciation of that problem.</P>
    <P>Everybody would like to see the people in the towns fully employed. How it can be done, we do not know. It often occurred to me that, for the amount of business done in a town, and the size of the business, ordinary traders employ a relatively small number of persons.  I am sure that people in business employ all the hands they need but the total employment given in a town, apart from industries, is very small.  You see fairly substantial businesses employing only one man. Probably, some of them employ nobody at all.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would consider that aspect of the matter.  If an appeal were made to business people in the towns to give more employment of the light type, a number of these permanently unemployed men might be absorbed. It will be found that in towns, apart from industries, the amount of employment given is not great and many of these men would give better service to shopkeepers than boys.  These men have lived in these towns all their lives and I think that they are entitled to be maintained, more or less, by the business people and better-off people in the towns.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see if there is the possibility of a partial solution of the problem along those lines.  It would be a sounder solution than annual bits of relief schemes.</P>
    <P>There is a certain amount of work to be done in laying streets and making <Col N="266" /> improvements but that is part of the permanent work of a local authority. Unemployed men should not be held in readiness every year for such work. There should be some way of reducing their numbers by getting them into permanent employment.  Trade unions could help in that respect.  Some of these men may not be capable of earning full trade union wages.  The trade unions could help by arranging with the employers regarding the wages the men are capable of earning.  The trade unions could help very much in getting more employment for the people if they approached those problems from a different viewpoint than that from which they usually approach them. They argue that, no matter what the type of work is, a man should get trade union wages.  Oftentimes, there is work to be done in gardens and around business houses which these men, who are almost unemployable, could do. That might help to get them back into form and enable them to take their place with the ordinary workers in a short time.  The work being done under these rural improvement schemes and other similar schemes deserves the approval of the House.  I have no doubt that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Office of Works will do everything possible to speed up the work on these rural improvement schemes.  I should like to hear if there has been any delay that should not have taken place in putting these schemes into operation. I would like to know if all the applications made in the last six months have been inspected or if there is undue delay.  A few complaints have been made to me that some time has elapsed from the time the form of application was filled in and no inspection has taken place.  I wonder if that is so in many cases or if the Parliamentary Secretary has an adequate staff for doing the work as quickly as possible. There is a huge amount of work to be done in rural areas in that respect.</P>

      <P>I would not intervene if it were not that the last speaker appears to have misunderstood a suggestion made by Deputy Blowick that, particularly in regard to the smaller holders, the Department should contribute 75 per cent., the county council <Col N="267" /> 12½ per cent., and the individual benefiting the other 12½ per cent., that is to say, the 25 per cent. should be divided between the local authority and the individual owner benefiting by the scheme.  A very good case could be made for that proposal, particularly in the areas which Deputy Blowick has in mind.  I have not found any demand for such a scheme in my constituency or in the County Carlow, which I represent in the county council, but in those counties the holdings are very considerably larger than in the West.  I think Deputy Allen honestly misinterpreted the suggestion which has been put forward by Deputy Blowick.  Certainly, if one were to propose that the individuals on a lane or the beneficiaries of a drainage scheme should contribute nothing, very difficult problems would arise and I agree with Deputy Allen that the rural improvements scheme would then be very difficult to work. I have no fault to find with the rural improvements scheme, except that in my constituency and in County Carlow it has not been availed of to its fullest extent.  Possibly farmers are finding it difficult at present to cope with the increased amount of ordinary farm work on account of the emergency and are unable to take full benefit from this scheme.  Those farmers who have availed of it are satisfied, as far as I know, that it is very beneficial.</P>
      <P>I am in agreement with Deputy Hughes in regard to the reclamation of hilly land.  As Deputies know, in my constituency we have a very large percentage of hilly land and while a considerable amount of it has been taken over by the Forestry Department there is still a very considerable acreage, in the hands of farmers, which gives a very small return.  In many cases, it is overgrown with furze and bracken and even where it is not so overgrown it produces a very poor type of pasture. That is a type of land which is capable of reclamation and improvement, particularly in the immediate future, when fertilisers will become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to emphasise again what I have said on previous occasions in regard to the construction and improvement of fences.  Whether they are provided <Col N="268" /> on accommodation roads under rural improvement schemes or minor employment schemes or under the farm improvements scheme, it is absolutely essential that they be provided with suitable hedgerows &mdash; whitethorn, for preference.  On travelling through the country, particularly in Leinster, it is regrettable to note the number of fences which are absolutely ineffective and insufficient to protect the crops.  There cannot be good, rotational farming unless there are proper fences.  I notice that, in much of the very good work done under the farm improvements scheme in regard to the reconstruction of fences, those fences are still bare and have not been planted with quicks of any kind.  That makes for insecurity and does not give permanence to the work which has been undertaken, as these earth fences will crumble away in the course of a couple of years.  The same is true in regard to Land Commission fences.  A large proportion of the earth ditches throughout the country are overgrown with furze. War should be declared on furze, which is an unmitigated nuisance: not only does it make a bad and insecure fence, but it has a tendency to spread over the agricultural land and is one of the worst types of weed we have. As far as it comes within the sphere of this Department to provide work on fences under their supervision, some steps should be taken to have those fences provided with whitethorn quicks or some other type of quick which will secure the fence, provide shelter for live stock and be useful and ornamental to the country.</P>
    <P>In the very comprehensive census forms recently issued, there were a lot of inquiries regarding various types of accommodation and amenities in private houses.  I hope that, when the information is collected and digested, steps will be taken to remedy some of the shortcomings and lack of amenities in our rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the line I am inclined to take, notwithstanding unhappy experiences over a very long period with the present Government. Certainly, farmers in many rural areas suffer grievously from lack of an adequate water supply in their homes and yards.  That is a matter which should come under the farm improvements scheme.  I do not think that to bring it under the farm improvements scheme would offer any great difficulty. In many cases the work could be done to a great extent by unskilled labour where it is not necessary to go down to a very great depth.  In other cases it should be possible to utilise a stream in some adjoining area and, with a little assistance, the farmer would be able with practically unskilled labour to provide this amenity.  I do not see why it should be an emergency scheme at all.  We must all realise that even though the unemployment problem will be eventually solved &mdash; we hope it will be, although there is not much indication of progress in that direction &mdash;there will always be a certain floating percentage of unemployment. There should be a well planned and well directed permanent department to deal with that floating unemployment problem.  We ought to have the best and most efficient method adopted to design useful employment for such of our people as are out of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite sympathise with Deputy Allen in his suggestion that light work might be provided for those who are unsuited, owing to physical reasons, for heavy work; I also feel that the greatest possible care should be taken in the selection of the people who are to supervise work carried out under any of the schemes under this Vote. We should all the time seek to get the most competent and efficient foreman to direct men in carrying out works for which so much money is provided.  An incompetent or inefficient ganger is an absolute menace to the success of any scheme of this nature.  When I say that a ganger or a foreman should be efficient, I do not mean that they should be slave drivers.  A good efficient leader of men can get work done without <Col N="270" /> being tyrannical, cruel or unjust. I think that is a matter upon which the officials of this Department and the officials of the local authorities should co-operate with the object of getting the most efficient supervisors on any scheme of work which is undertaken under those Votes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I am in thorough agreement with the suggestion put forward by Deputy Blowick and I feel rather disappointed that Deputy Allen does not agree with it but perhaps there is a reason for that.  Deputy Allen speaks from his experience of the roads in County Wexford while Deputy Blowick speaks from his experience of the conditions of the roads in Mayo.  The condition of the roads in Mayo is perhaps somewhat different from that of the roads in Wexford but I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to understand that in the first place there is a huge mileage of main and trunk roads in Mayo.  Then there is a very large mileage of by-roads.  Secondly, there is a big mileage of by-roads which are not eligible at any time for contract owing to the width of these roads. Each of these by-roads provides accommodation for three, four or five families.  The by-road provides the only entrance from the main road to the houses of these families and they are continually using these roads.  They may be small farmers who may have a small portion of their land on the other side of the main road and in passing from their houses to that portion of the land, they are continually using these by-roads.  In fact the by-road may be considered as a main road for them but in order to bring it under an improvement scheme these people will have to contribute one-fourth of the cost of the scheme under the present regulations.  It may happen that three out of the five people concerned will agree and two will object or that four may agree and one object.  The main trouble that I see is that these four or five people have to contribute one-fourth of the cost of repairing that road which may extend for a mile or half a mile.  The people in that area may be fairly big ratepayers and have to meet a large outlay yearly in the <Col N="271" /> way of rates.  Compare the conditions in that area with those obtaining in an adjoining area in which there is a big number of registered unemployed.  Because of the existence of these registered unemployed, the adjoining area is qualified to get a full 100 per cent. of the cost of any work carried out on a road in the area with the result that the condition of the road is improved almost to the same extent as a trunk road.  That is the difficulty that arises in parts of Mayo.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blowick is as well acquainted with the circumstances of people living in these areas served by such roads as I am and we can say that a large number of these roads in Mayo will never be repaired under the present regulations.  The people will be left without any road to serve their needs unless the Department or the county council through the Department introduces some scheme to help people in areas such as I have described.  These people will be left without road accommodation of any kind unless some such scheme is formulated to meet their special needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the period during which these relief schemes are operated, I am well aware of the fact that the reason that the money is expended in winter time is that in summer time and in harvest time, the registered unemployed may be able to get employment at farm work.  The idea of the scheme is to provide them with some assistance during the winter months when there is no other employment available. I still think, however, that the Parliamentary Secretary could devise some arrangement by which some of the work on these roads could be done in harvest time at a period when labour would not be so badly needed on the farms.  In conclusion I would say that if the Parliamentary Secretary makes some inquiries or carries out a general survey of the roads in Mayo, he will have no hesitation in agreeing with Deputy Blowick that there is a very big area of roads which it is necessary to repair under relief schemes because they will never be eligible for repair by contract.  Somebody must face the responsibility of giving all sections of <Col N="272" /> the people similar accommodation as far as road entrances to their houses are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>A few Deputies in the House seem to think that when they make any allusion to water, they are intruding on my problems.  I have been boring here for a good while, boring for more things than for water but if you get water you cease boring. I have here a little circular that came to my house about four days ago and during a touch of insomnia I was looking through it.  It has a great bearing on this question.  It is entitled &ldquo;The Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland &mdash; Census of Population, 1946, by Stanley Lyon, Director of Statistics Branch&rdquo;.  This paper was read on Thursday, the 25th April, 1946, but where it does not say, by the Director of Statistics, Department of Industry and Commerce, Statistics Branch, Lower Castle Yard, Dublin.  There is a note on it which says: &ldquo;see page 6, <i>re</i> your motion in Dáil in October last&rdquo; and initialled by, I take it, Mr. Lyon.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary was not present on that occasion. I think it was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health who was in the Dáil for my motion.  I am glad to see that my boring has had a little effect.  I propose to read the following extract:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Human progress consists in the improvement of the social conditions under which the population pass their daily lives, as well as improvements in their economic position. Attention has for a long time been focussed on the housing of the people and a large mass of statistics are available on this subject.  At the 1946 Census an attempt is being made for the first time to investigate some other aspects bearing on the general standard of living, particularly of those who reside in rural areas and who have not the same amenities of civilisation that are available to the population residing in the larger urban areas.  Éire's rural population is very scattered: over two-thirds of the total population live outside &lsquo;census&rsquo; towns, which are described as &lsquo;a cluster of <Col N="273" /> not less than 20 houses&rsquo;; accordingly, the degree of isolation in which the majority of the population live will be appreciated.  The rural population or the agricultural community deserve well of the State and some attempt should be made to provide them with such amenities as can be provided.  The Census will show the extent of the problem to be faced and the areas in which it is most acute.  It is for others to suggest or devise ways and means.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first of what may, for convenience, be termed the social or health questions relates to the source of water supply used by the members of the household for cooking and washing purposes.  Drinking water is not mentioned. It goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The inclusion of the questions on the Census schedule relating to water supply and sanitary facilities is to be welcomed, as only by this means can a national survey, based on information supplied directly by the householder, be made of these important matters affecting the daily lives of so large a proportion of the population.  The constant fetching and carrying of water in all sorts of weather conditions, is one of the items of drudgery and discomfort attaching to residence in rural areas as contrasted with the towns.  The lack of a piped water supply to dweliings in rural areas and the provision of modern lavatory accommodation is, perhaps, also one of the reasons for the continual drain of migration from the country to the towns... In urban areas the provision of adequate water supply is a matter for the local authorities, who have constructed either reservoirs or else storage tanks of large capacity from which, through gravity, a piped water supply is laid on to houses.  In such cases the head of the household is asked to state if the supply to his dwelling is used only by members of his household or whether it is shared in common with other households. Sometimes occupiers of a house or cluster of houses have a piped water supply into the houses, coming from a reservoir or storage tank which is not controlled by the <Col N="274" /> local authority but is the property of an individual and for which they do not pay a public water rate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it that may be regarded as a forerunner of a national survey. Whether the instructions for that came from the Department or not I do not know, but if the survey is carried out it will mean a lot in the life of rural Ireland.  I do not want to repeat what I said on this subject last night, but I venture to suggest that there is not one water supply in every 50 from a well, pump, stream or river that would pass an analytical test as to its purity.  Hence we have the highest rate of tuberculosis of any country in the civilised world.  There is not any malnutrition in rural Ireland. There may be in the larger towns and cities, but as regards rural Ireland I do not know anybody who is hungry, certainly not in my native county or, I suppose, in any of the other counties.  There may be an odd case here and there, but I do not know of any in my county.  Coming down from the mountains we have the greatest water supply in the world.  In my native county we have the Galtees, the Knockmealdowns, Slievenamon and Slieve Bloom.  The number of streams that emerge from these mountains would, I think, run into many hundreds.  The water in the streams, as it emerges from the mountains, is pure, but most of these streams find their way to the River Suir.  On the Dublin and Cork road, between Cahir and Mitchelstown, there is water in a stream that emerges from the mountains. That same water supplies the town of Cahir.  You have an island midway down the valley on which you have 30 families living.  There is a school there.  The water supply which is available for the children attending that school was analysed by the late Sir Charles Cameron about 35 years ago and he certified that it was not fit for human consumption.  That is typical of all these streams to which cattle have access.  I would suggest that they should be paled in and that a cement tank with a ball-cock should be provided to supply the needs of the cattle.  If the streams were protected the farmers and cottiers in their areas would get a supply of water that <Col N="275" /> would be as pure as when it emerged from the mountains.  I am sure Deputy Fogarty and Deputy Loughman will bear me out in this, that the best men are on the plains where the water supply is from the wells.  In some cases, however, due it is said to lack of a mineral in some of our water supplies, the people who drink the water suffer a good deal from goitre. A lady doctor that we had in the county for some years conducted some tests as to the cause of that.  It is a remarkable thing that on the plains, however, where we have the wells we have none of that.  Deputies know that the best men and the best horses, too, come from the limestone areas.  It is not by accident that we produce Grand National winners in Tipperary or Olympic champions.  All that shows what a pure water supply means to the people.  It is related to public health.</P>
    <P>In Tipperary we have the best water in Ireland.  I hope I am not boasting. The best water, according to the analyst, is to be found in Tubberadora, where all the great champions come from.  There is a fairly good number on the modern county team, too.  The second best water is to be found at Kedra, between Rockwell College and the town of Cahir.  There is a new road there and it cost many thousands to construct, because it goes through a kind of bog.  The townland is known as Kedra; according to the local dialect, it means the hundred streams or wells, and those are there.  About 400 yards down all that water enters the Suir. The natives emphasise the h's and r's, but in Rathmines or Ballsbridge the name would rhyme with &ldquo;sewer&rdquo;.  Perhaps they would be nearer to it.  In the old Irish maps we had the &ldquo;e&rdquo; at the tail end.  The &ldquo;e&rdquo; is now deleted. Orthography may not be my strong point, but I can make a fairly good shot at it.  I am reminded of the bride who wrote home to her mother asking if there were two &ldquo;f's&rdquo; in elephant. Spelling was not her strong point. They should stick the &ldquo;e&rdquo; into the middle of it and then you come near &ldquo;sewer&rdquo;, which would be the pronunciation in Rathmines or Ballsbridge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> It is really a stink-pot by reason of the sewage entering it from Thurles down to Carrick.  There are six towns there and this water is largely used for drinking purposes.  A water scheme is being considered to carry a water supply from the Galtees through Bansha, Kilfeacle and Thomastown on to Cashel.  The water supply in the County Hospital and Home in Cashel is very poor.  That is quite a big scheme.  That whole area is thirsting for a good water supply.</P>

      <P>That may be my mistake, Sir, but I shall endeavour to relate them.  So much for the water. I have been upon that subject before. The census papers are being filled in and reference to water comes under five or six headings there.  I suggest that it would be much better to fill in the need of water than to indicate how many ducks or geese you have, how many heads of cabbage you may have eaten or how many eggs you may have consumed.  The poor, unfortunate Guards have to go around collecting all that stuff.</P>
      <P>Many questions are being asked, but I think it is important to make particular reference to water supplies.  I am glad to see that someone is moving in that direction, because it is a move in the right direction.  Now I come to hedges.

      <P>I was rather intrigued with one remark made by Deputy Hughes.  I suppose he is very well informed.  I was intrigued with his remark about the levelling of hills. We have fairly good land in Tipperary. The Old Testament tells us that the hills will be levelled and I expect we will have to wait until the Day of General Judgment for that.  There would not be much purpose served by levelling the hills in Tipperary, because the yellow clay would not be of much use.  I was not very struck with the Deputy's suggestion, but I did not like to interrupt him.  I would like to have a few words with him privately about that matter.  What the yellow clay from the hilltops would grow, I wot not of, as Shakespeare would say. It would not be useful for growing anything.  I think we can wait until the Day of Judgment for the hilltops to come down.</P>
      <P>Allusions were made to lorries and the lack of transport.  I am not very happy about that.  The number of men who want licences for lorries and hackney cars is extraordinary.  I do not know if there is not a racket in connection with lorries.  There are not enough of them there at times when the work has to be done.  I drew the attention of the Minister for Lands to a certain matter recently and he partly declined responsibility for it. It had reference to forestry, but he is a dual Minister.  I mentioned about certain rivers being flooded and tree-planting along the mountain sides might have a direct bearing on that. There is quite a lot of tree-planting on the Tipperary mountains, the Galtees and the Knockmealdowns.  The water coming down from the mountains swells the rivers; they overflow, and in many cases houses are inundated.</P>

      <P>Very well.  Deputy Cogan made an interesting observation with regard to furze, which Goldsmith described as &ldquo;unprofitably gay.&rdquo;  These things should be grubbed out and you could put the scraw back again with your foot.  Furze should not be allowed to spread.  In different parts of the country you will see fairly good land gradually getting covered with furze.  The elimination of furze could be the basis of a useful scheme.  In parts of my county, they grow them on the ditches and they cut them every third year.  This might be new to Deputy Cogan but I assure him that I am not trying to do the agricultural instructor.  They make wonderful manure.</P>
      <P>With regard to main and trunk roads, I suggest that it was the men on the land who built the roads in the rural areas and it is the descendants of those men now who are the sufferers. I like a run in a car as well as anybody, but I pity the man who has to travel these roads with a horse and cart now.  Going to a fair with a sow and litter of bonhams or a quantity of fat pigs is an adventure, because you may wake up in Heaven.</P>

      <P>In my county we have a certain number of minor relief schemes and rural improvement schemes in operation.  We have been trying to get the people used to rural improvement schemes, but so far we <Col N="279" /> have had very little success.  The reason for that is that a job for which a 100 per cent. grant is given may be completed at one side of the parish while, on the other, the people are entitled to only a 75 per cent. grant, with the result that the people there ask how it is that the whole amount of the money can be given in the other district.  That is one of the big troubles we have to face and that is the reason an effort was made recently by the county council to put into operation the scheme referred to by Deputy Blowick and Deputy Browne.</P>
      <P>Further, these important schemes are fairly often held up because of two or three defaulters in a locality.  I have had experience of a number of people signing an agreement to contribute towards the cleaning of a river, but, because of defaulters, the work could not be gone on with.  I have also seen cases in which six people agreed in respect of a road, but, because three defaulted, it was not possible to do the job.  There is no doubt that works completed under these rural improvement schemes are much superior to those completed as minor relief schemes, because persons who contribute a certain percentage and who get employment on the work realise that it is in their own interest to put the little extra into the work which helps to make the job much better.  On the other hand, work can be done quite well under each of the schemes.</P>
      <P>The big fault I find is that there is scarcely enough money allocated to complete half the schemes placed before the Parliamentary Secretary.  I know that if he dealt with all those which I have put before his Department, it would put a very big hole in the one-and-a-quarter million pounds set aside for these schemes.  I am sorry that there is not a bigger allocation of money, but I hope that, whatever allocation is made, it will be given in areas where there is the greatest need for it.  There are roads which have not been attended to for 20 or 25 years and there are rivers and drains which have not been cleaned for the same period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to having good foremen <Col N="280" /> and gangers, I agree that it is necessary, because a good foreman or ganger will do almost one-and-a-half times as much with the same amount of money as another man, and I suggest that surveyors who have experience of good foremen should see to it that these men are retained, because they are undoubtedly an asset.  Another matter to which I want to refer is the estimate put on certain jobs of work by the engineer who inspects them.  I know of one place where £157 was estimated for the completion of a road.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>For what kind of job?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>The repair of a road under a rural improvement scheme. The people there were willing to provide about £120.  They tried to convince the engineer, but he insisted on his own figure, with the result that the work has fallen through completely. On the other hand, there is no use in underestimating, and, if such circumstances arise again, the Parliamentary Secretary should try to get some agreement as between the parties concerned and should give consideration to the views of the people concerned as well as to the report sent in by the engineer, with a view to getting both sides to come half-way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter is the delay in inspecting works mentioned by Deputy Allen and Deputy Browne.  I know schemes which have been sent in since last December, but which have not yet been inspected.  If the Parliamentary Secretary would arrange to have these works inspected without so much delay, it would facilitate the people greatly and enable them to get on with the job at the time which they have set out for it.  With regard to the time of the year at which works are carried out, there is no doubt that if big jobs are sought to be started in summer or spring, it will be impossible to get men for them, but on the other hand, we hear complaints about men having to go out in bad weather. Still, one usually finds that a job of work has never to be left undone for want of labour.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will bear these two matters in mind, that he will arrange a sort of compromise between the <Col N="281" /> parties concerned in relation to works on which a higher estimate is put by the engineer than the people are prepared to contribute, and that he will have the works lodged in his office inspected as quickly as possible and will see that the big delay is avoided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the main, I am inclined to agree with most of what the previous speaker said, but I should like to take issue with him on a few of the points he made.  In the first instance, I would not like the recommendation which he has made to the Parliamentary Secretary in favour of the rural improvements scheme, as against the minor improvements scheme, to be taken too seriously.  I feel that the rural improvements scheme is rather pushing out the minor improvements scheme, but I do not agree with Deputy Commons that the work done on one scheme would not be as well done as on the other.</P>
      <P>It is the same type of people who are doing the work and the necessary supervision ought to be provided so as to ensure that the completed work will be as good under the minor improvements scheme as under the rural improvements scheme.  As I say, I feel that there is a preponderance of rural improvements schemes, owing to the provision being made, to the exclusion of works that would only fit into a minor improvements scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleading for a continuance of the minor improvements scheme.  I think that many places have been neglected because of the tendency to relate the amount of money spent in an area to the money spent by the Local Government Department on the main roads.  The main roads have claimed a good deal of attention and will be claiming a good deal of attention because of the deterioration which has taken place in recent years.  If that policy is continued, some areas will not be able to get money for minor relief schemes, for boreens and passages to farmers' houses, because so much money has been spent on the main roads in these, and great hardship will be inflicted on the farming community. I think the schemes ought to stand on their merits.  The maintenance <Col N="282" /> of the main roads is a national matter and should not be allowed to interfere with the necessity for doing the boreans and passages into the farmers' houses.  In East Limerick, for several years no minor relief scheme has been undertaken because the money was being spent on main roads.</P>
    <P>There is another point on which I disagree with Deputy Commons. Where an engineer has made an estimate and the local people suggest that the sum to be expended ought to be lower, the Deputy suggests that there ought to be a compromise between the two.  I think that is a dangerous thing to suggest.  If you allow non-technical men to dictate what ought to be the cost of doing the work, you will have unsatisfactory work, I do not think a professional engineer ought to be dictated to in that way, even if only a shorter length of road can be done. The engineer has to see that a good surface is laid down and that good value is given for the money contributed either by the ratepayers or from State funds.  I am sure that no engineer will make an exaggerated estimate.  If the engineer's estimate is £150 and the local people say, &ldquo;That is too much; we will go as far as £120,&rdquo; you will not get good work done.  It is not like selling a cow.  I hope therefore that the Parliamentary Secretary will not adopt the suggestion of Deputy Commons in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>An engineer can make a mistake as well as anyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>He is less liable to make a mistake in making an estimate for the repair of a road than an ordinary person.  I certainly would not like to pit myself against a qualified engineer in making an estimate for doing such work.  The point I wish to make is that we should make a good job of it when we are getting it done.  If not, we will be coming back to the Parliamentary Secretary in 12 months' time and saying that the road has deteriorated and he will want to know why we came back after such a short time. I think it is more profitable in the long run, even if the estimate of the engineer appears to the local people to be a bit high, to do the job in the <Col N="283" /> way he has specified even if a shorter length of road has to be done, rather than to do a patched-up job which will show signs of wear and tear in 12 months.  I should like to see more minor relief schemes carried out.  The system which has militated against many minor relief schemes in the past, by which if money is spent on main roads in a particular area the by-roads must go by default, should be abolished.</P>

      <P>As these are the first of these Votes since the war ended I suppose one should say something about them.  Really I feel depressed about the approach of this House to these Votes.  Only two of these Votes are material so far as unemployment is concerned and the total sum to be expended under them is £190,000.  In the new era that we are facing after the war, with world conditions as they are, we are approaching the problem of unemployment in this country with a proposed expenditure of £190,000.  The thing is a joke.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>They relate to individual farms in the main, roads on farms, etc.  I shall deal with these later on if the Parliamentary Secretary will give me time.  Surely everybody in this House and outside will agree that this is an undeveloped country and that we have the money to develop it.  Year after year we have Votes of this kind introduced and we spend time discussing them as a solution for the unemployment problem in this State.  The thing is a patent absurdity. We are not going to solve the problem with an Estimate of this kind. Now, when capital goods are becoming available, this young State should be able to approach the problem of unemployment on a broad and permanent basis.  It is idle to suggest that we can solve the problem with a sum of <Col N="284" /> £190,000.  That is no approach to the problem at all.  It will not solve the problem or do anything substantial for the country.  In this first year of peace, I should like to see the Government approaching this matter on a basis which would lead to a long-term policy, which would in fact do something to solve the unemployment problem and, instead of giving men a miserable few pounds for a few weeks' work in the year, would put them into permanent employment at good wages. There is no approach to this problem except on that basis.  This is not even tinkering with the problem.</P>
      <P>While I am on that, I should like to say that, while a lot of the work has been quite well done, I have had to complain for years as to the way in which, in the main, it has been done. That is to say, separate sums of £100 are thrown into an electoral area for the purpose of having certain specified jobs done, but the amount expended does not complete the job and it is left there, half-finished.  There are half-finished jobs throughout the country and I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that an inventory should be taken of them and that, irrespective of what is being done anywhere else, or of what pressure is being brought to bear upon him, these unfinished jobs should be carried forward and the next year's Vote should be applied to the completion of them so that we would have a completed job somewhere.</P>
      <P>I am utterly without hope of this House making a decent approach to the problem of unemployment in this country by expending such a sum of money as is provided in this Vote. This is the old, tuppence-halfpenny attempt to throw a few pounds here and there to some poor man, in the worst period of the year, as has been complained of here.  You cannot expect efficiency or output per man from the poor man who has probably spent the rest of the year doing nothing at all, who is badly fed and badly housed, badly clothed and who is taken out to work in the worst period of the year. It cannot be done.  In the main, minor employment grants are applied to the poorer districts and congested areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> The small farmer in these areas, under £2 valuation, is signing for the dole for the weeks of the year other than the week or two in which he works.  He is the first man called upon to work under one of these minor relief schemes.  The father of a family, who is 64 or 68 years of age, who is obviously past the age of efficiency so far as labour is concerned, is the first to be called out on the job while his sons, who are efficient and capable of output, are not called upon, although they are at home.  That arises out of the Unemployment Act.  That is an unfortunate state of affairs.  There should be co-ordination between the two Departments.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I should approach this question on the broader basis here at all or not.  Perhaps I had better do it somewhere else and on some other occasion.  I would seriously suggest that the House, irrespective of Party, should approach this problem as a national problem and bring in a national scheme to give employment, under which men will be regarded as human beings, having human dignity and entitled to live.  Men cannot live unless they get the means of livelihood. In brief, that is the kernel of this problem.</P>
    <P>In my opinion there is no approach being made to the problem that confronts us.  Are we to continue leaving it to Great Britain or some other foreign country to solve a problem that we are capable of solving?  We have the means to do it and there is urgent necessity to do it.  This is an undeveloped country.  We have the money to purchase equipment.  We have the men to carry out the work. There are all the essential ingredients to do this job.</P>
    <P>Is this country not fit to rise to the occasion and to do it?  Let there be no doubt for a moment, it is an insult to the intelligence of this country to suggest that this problem can be solved by the expenditure of £190,000.  The Parliamentary Secretary interrupted me to say that £190,000 is not the only sum involved in this.  There are the other two sums the expenditure of which is left in the main to individual farmers or to two or three farmers. <Col N="286" /> In the main, these farmers carry out the work themselves with the help of a man they have permanently employed and with their sons and their own horses and carts.  But, so far as the general unemployment problem is concerned, the only sum in this is £190,000.</P>
    <P>Complaints have been made here about hedges and suggestions have been made as to what the Department should do about them.  When I listen to that type of thing I ask myself what this country is coming to.  It is the common law duty, apart from anything else, of every person who owns land to fence it or otherwise to protect it against his own live stock and against trespass.  I do not like to mention &mdash; not that I am ashamed of it &mdash;the age at which I went out to make fences.  This country was much poorer at that time than it is to-day but we never thought of asking for public money to put up fences to protect our land.</P>
    <P>I was born in a poor part of this country but we would not think of going to the county council or to the Government or anyone else to seek money for fences to protect our land. One of the earliest jobs that I was engaged on was the making of fences. Fencing land and that kind of work is very valuable.  In that connection, it would be better to give the money to the farmers &mdash; much more than is allocated in the Budget &mdash; to put men into permanent employment for the whole year.  In that way, the farmers could employ men permanently for drainage, fencing, cleaning gripes and cutting down hedges and that type of work.  The men would be permanently settled on the land, attached to a farm or farms, and would settle down in the district, being assured of 52 weeks' work in the year, at good wages.  Some Deputies, I notice, according to whether they are farmers or something else, seem to fear that an increase in wages means inflation and means that they could not bear the charge.  That is an entirely false philosophy and an entirely wrong approach to this problem.  The capital of any country is its manpower and not the amount of currency that is in <Col N="287" /> circulation or available in the country. There is plenty of that.  There can be no inflation so long as you equally distribute the amount of money that is available between all the citizens and provide those citizens with work or services which they can render in return for that amount of money.  If you do that there is no inflation. I think it is an entirely wrong approach to consider this problem on a financial basis.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the future of this country will see a marked increase in the wages paid to the workers.  That does not and cannot lead to inflation. It merely means an adjustment and proper redistribution of the amount of money that is available between the workers and the employers.  This problem of finance seems to terrify people. It is not a problem at all.  The only problem that has to be faced is the putting of the men of this country into productive work so that they will be in a position to make goods or render service.  The carrying out of that is a simple matter, but it is one which requires some elaboration and I do not propose to discuss it here to-night.</P>
    <P>In my opinion we should approach this matter on entirely new lines and not on the contemptible basis that it is put before us here.  I think it is an insult to this House to suggest that we can build up this country by putting wretchedly clad, wretchedly shod and wretchedly fed men to work in the depths of winter on bog roads.  Those men may perhaps have to walk three or four miles to their work in pouring rain or snow.  The whole situation is impossible.  It is inhuman.</P>

      <P>This, of course, is just a red herring.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary suggesting that the farmer, no matter how tyrannical he may be, is going to send out his ploughman and a pair of horses to work in wet weather?  It simply cannot be done.  The thing is absurd.  Would any farmer send out a man with a tractor to plough land in wet weather? The thing is an absurdity.  It cannot be done.  That just illustrates the Parliamentary Secretary's knowledge of farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I want to make is that if we in this House are going to solve the problem of unemployment we must not deceive ourselves, or attempt to deceive the country, into believing that it can be done with a Vote of this kind. A new line of thought is essential on this matter.  There must be some new <Col N="289" /> conception of the duty we owe to the citizens of this country who are forced to seek a livelihood either by means of work or through services rendered to others.  To believe that we can solve the problem by the Vote that is before this House at the moment is an insult to our intelligence.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary, when he comes before us again next year, will have thought over this matter and that it will be approached from the point of view of a national conception of what the problem is; and that the Government will have the courage and the conviction to solve the problem as it should be solved.  If that is done then there will be some hope for the young men and women of this country beyond the mere hope of getting a passport or a visa to leave this country and making their way as quickly as they possibly can to the pier at Dun Laoghaire.  How long are we going to allow the present situation to continue?  How far are we going to let the rot proceed?  The day is fast approaching when there will be no longer any efficient labour in this country. We are allowing our young people to-day to go away and build up the happiness, prosperity and greatness of a neighbouring State.  I often thought the greatest tragedy of our past was the fact that our young men and women who left this country in such great numbers from 1847 onwards and went to America, instead of going out on the land flocked into the cities and towns of America because they wanted to make money quickly.  If they had settled on the land, the soil of America to-day would be Irish-owned.  But, as I say, unfortunately they wanted money quickly and they remained in the cities; ultimately they passed away without leaving any permanent mark upon the land of America.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to take the broad national view on this matter and put before this House a programme which will solve that vexed question of providing work for our people and paying them a decent wage for that work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, I do not know <Col N="290" /> whether it was in this century or the last that Deputy McMenamin was engineering the hedges and fences.  I will say, however, that if Deputy McMenamin had been in my constituency some ten years ago and took a look at the hedges and fences, the bog roads, and the laneways he would not have much cause for complaint to-day.  Ten years ago there was a bog in my area which was just one vast expanse of water, where nothing could be seen but snipe. To-day that bog has been developed to supply the country with fuel.  To-day, as a result of the schemes put into operation by the Office of Public Works, we have the bogs in my constituency producing fuel to keep the City of Dublin and the people all over Ireland supplied with good turf.</P>
      <P>I think that this Vote is one of the most important that comes before this House.  Before I go into detail with regard to the work that has been done by the Office of Public Works I would like to say that I think some Deputies in this House may be inclined to confuse farm improvements schemes with schemes undertaken by the Office of Public Works.  Now Deputy McMenamin has referred to the dignity and the great sense of civic spirit displayed by the people of Donegal when they go out and attend to their own hedges and do not ask for any assistance or any help from the county council or the Office of Public Works.  I admit that is a great spirit and I think it is a pity that that spirit does not prevail throughout the country.  The Deputy has criticised the lack of proper fencing and the need for providing funds for fencing.  But we must give the Government credit that under this scheme in relation to farm improvements they have made provision whereby the farmers will have the necessary fencing carried out under the farm improvements scheme.  I move to report progress.</P>
