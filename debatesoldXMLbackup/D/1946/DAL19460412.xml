      <P>The business that it is proposed to finish to-day is No. 2&mdash;the Public Health Bill.  I move that the Dáil sit later than 2.30 p.m. and that the Order for the adjournment be taken not later than 10.30 p.m. to-night.  If that motion is agreed to, it is proposed that the Forestry Vote, No. 53, be taken between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. and between 6.30 and 7.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>I protest against the proposal to sit late to-day&mdash;to do between this and 10.30 p.m. what cannot be done between these hours. That is the first ground of my protest. My second ground is that I came into the Dáil this morning without any notice that such a proposal was going to be put before us.  There was ample opportunity for consultation and discussion as to what it was possible to do in relation to the Committee Stage of the Public Health Bill between this and 10.30.  Nobody who has considered the amount of work that requires to be done on the Public Health Bill could think for a moment that the Committee Stage could be completed between this and 10.30 p.m. without implying very substantial closures.  We assisted in every way last night.  In deference to the wishes of the Parliamentary Secretary, we ceased the discussion on the amendments dealing with the mother and child that were before the House. We took it that we would have an opportunity of going back over them. As regards the important amendments moved by the Parliamentary Secretary in substitution of Section 85, we actually passed them through the House without getting the information that we wanted to get.  I, personally, wanted to get more information <Col N="1892" /> in regard to them, but in deference to the Parliamentary Secretary's wish to get the thing finished last night, as far as that particular section was concerned, we did not carry on the discussion, because I realised that if we carried on the discussion on that section yesterday, especially in view of the importance of the information required about it, the discussion would take practically the whole day.</P>
      <P>I felt that such things as had been said to us on that yesterday by the Parliamentary Secretary could perhaps, with advantage, be put before us when we came back.  For that reason, and not because we got the information that we would all desire to have, we allowed amendment No. 83, which replaces Section 85, to go through.  I submit that the Government have given no consideration at all to the proposal that they are now putting before the House, and that we will not finish the Committee Stage of the Public Health Bill between this and 10.30 p.m. to-night. It is unreasonable to ask people who have been sitting every week since the end of January and who in relation to the Public Health Bill have been in committee on 15 consecutive days discussing different aspects of that measure&mdash;it is unreasonable to ask them at this hour, and without any notice, to sit late, especially in view of the short adjournment there is to be over Easter.  As I say, we have been sitting continuously since the end of January.  We are having a short Recess, and we are going to be sitting continuously for a very long period immediately the House reassembles after Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="An Tánaiste Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be possible to have foreseen the need for a long sitting to-day until the progress made on the Bill had been ascertained. The Deputy will understand that it will make an appreciable difference as regards the organisation of business after the Easter recess if the Committee stage of the Public Health Bill be disposed of to-night.  It will enable amendments which arise out of the Committee Stage discussions to be prepared, and the Report Stage to be taken early in the next session.  If the <Col N="1893" /> Committee Stage is not finished to-night it will mean much more congestion of business in the next session than even at present appears to be likely.  It is desirable, therefore, that the House should finish the Committee Stage of the Bill to-day.  If, in the course of the discussion, it is indicated that the Committee Stage may not be finished to-day, then the House will sit on Tuesday of next week to finish it.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have protested time and time again against the imposition of important legislative measures on top of financial measures at this time of the year.  If the Government are going to take up the attitude that they are going to sit next week in order to finish the Public Health Bill, then that Bill should either have been introduced long ago or not introduced at all.  If the Government are going to do that, they are simply humiliating and reducing Parliament to the position in which it cannot do its work. I have done my best to allow as many members as possible of our Party to remain in the country to look after the important and urgent business connected with food production.  I intend to continue to do that.  At the same time, I intend to keep in the House, in a reasonable way, any members of the Party that can usefully assist the Government and the country in transacting its legislative business.  We have withheld no attendance here that was necessary in order to see that the work of Parliament was carried on properly. I intend to continue to do that, but I am not going to agree without a very serious protest, and I will have to consider what form that protest will take &mdash;I am not going to continue to acquiesce in a scheme of carrying on Government business that gives no consideration to any Party in the Dáil, and that gives no consideration to the importance of the measures that are passing through the Dáil or of the difficult situation that exists in the country, a situation that requires a large number of people to look after food production.  I submit very seriously to the Tánaiste that this is an unreasonable proposal and that it <Col N="1894" /> is an unbusinesslike proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is foolish to try to rush the Public Health Bill now. There is still a large number of sections to be dealt with and they are very important sections and some of them are very contentious.  There is a number of amendments in the name of the Parliamentary Secretary and in the names of Deputies of other Parties which require very careful consideration and discussion and any attempt to rush the measure now or to closure discussion on it would be an insult to this House and would make it impossible for the House to do business as it should.  The Tánaiste should withdraw that proposal and allow discussion on the Public Health Bill to take its normal course.</P>

      <P>I do not think anybody could seriously suggest that the Public Health Bill is being rushed and there is certainly no desire to impose a closure of any kind, but, obviously, public business must be done and if the programme for the session has been upset, we must try to make up the deficiency in some way.  The only possible way of making up the deficiency is by giving extra time.</P>

      <P>You are not going to do it by sitting late to-day.  I beg to be clear as to what the Government's proposals are.  The Tánaiste has indicated that he is going to sit until 10.30 to finish the Public Health Bill and he has intimated that if it is not finished by 10.30 the Dáil will be asked to sit next week in order to try to finish it before Easter.  Is the motion being moved now, Sir?</P>

      <P>I did not understand that.  I understood that we were getting an intimation that the Government had that in mind.  I am hoping to induce the Government to a sense of reason with regard to it, so that they will take between now and 11.30 or 12 to consider it before they would move such a motion.</P>

The amendments that are down in my name or in the name of any member of our Party will not be moved.  We will give the Parliamentary Secretary plenty of time to consider them between this and Report, and we will put them down again for Report.  I am not going to sit in the House where the Government conducts its business in the way in which it is conducting it.  We have been sitting here since the end of January and we have been giving very close attention to business.  The Government indicated to us that they were going to adjourn to-day until 30th April.  The Tánaiste has now indicated to us that if we do not finish the Public Health Bill by 10.30, we are going to sit next week.  You cannot finish the Public Health Bill by 10.30.  You cannot do it and the Government either know that and are deliberately acting like this, or they have given no consideration to the matter at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 93:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) Notwithstanding sub-section (1) of this section, whenever and so long as the Minister is satisfied that adequate arrangements for medical inspection and treatment are being carried out in relation to the pupils of a school, he shall not make an Order under the said sub-section in relation to the school and, in case the school is of a class in respect of which an Order is made under the said sub-section, the Order shall except the school from such class and shall have effect accordingly.</P>
      <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill and subsequent to the Second Reading discussion representations were made to the effect that we should not automatically apply compulsory school medical inspection to all schools other than elementary schools.  On full consideration, there seemed to be reasonable grounds for making some concession in this regard.  At the same time, it did not appear to me to be judicious to exempt entirely and completely schools other than elementary schools from supervision as to the manner in which the physical needs of their pupils were being looked after.  On the other hand, I felt that, if the Minister was satisfied from time to time as to the adequacy of the arrangements that were being made by any particular school in the matter of safeguarding the health of the pupils, he should not apply compulsory medical inspection to such an institution.  That, I think, ought to remove and I believe, in fact, does remove any objection there might be to the operation of medical inspection in these schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will agree that from time to time complaint is made that in schools other than elementary schools the physical needs of the pupils are not always adequately safeguarded.  It does seem to me appropriate that, if <Col N="1899" /> we are not satisfied as to the provision being made and if the school authorities are not in a position to satisfy us that they are in fact making proper provision, we must in the interests of public health and of the general community step in and say: &ldquo;If you do not maintain an adequate service out of your own resources, if you do not take part in the Government campaign to build up a healthy race, we shall insist on the acceptance of our scheme. If you do make satisfactory provision, we have no intention of interfering with it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody can say that that is an unreasonable provision.  I think that in certain instances it is a necessary provision.  However, there it is.  If Deputies have any criticisms to offer on it, I should be glad to hear them.  While there was a certain amount of disturbance in the public mind, particularly in the minds of the proprietors of schools other than elementary schools regarding this provision, on the whole I think that they are pretty well satisfied as to the distance I have gone to meet their criticism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of this section, will it be within the competence of a parent to notify a school authority that the family doctor is adequately looking after the health of the children and will a parent be entitled to withdraw his children from the compulsory inspection now provided for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is perhaps confusing two issues.  This particular amendment refers to schools other than elementary schools.  They will, in the main, be residential schools where, because the child is not living at home, it will not be open to the parents to provide medical supervision and attention. It will be the responsibility of the school authority.  The Deputy is probably more concerned with the right of the parent to have his child exempted from inspection in an elementary school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision I am <Col N="1900" /> making by another amendment in relation to that matter is that, on production of a certificate from a registered medical practitioner in a prescribed form to the effect either (a) that the child is ill and cannot attend for inspection, or (b) has been examined by a medical practitioner within the previous seven days and that its health is being looked after by a medical practitioner, such a child is automatically excluded from inspection.  That is a provision that is now being incorporated in the Bill for the obvious purpose of ensuring that, where a parent adequately and properly discharges his responsibility to his children, we will not interfere.</P>
      <P>We have no desire to interfere, but, at considerable cost to the communiy, a health service for children is being provided. That service is being provided in order to try to secure that diseases will be brought under control, under observation and under treatment in the earliest possible stage, and if that scheme is to be a success, we must satisfy ourselves that if children are exempted from the scheme, their health is in fact being supervised.</P>
      <P>People may say that that is a matter for the parents, and, in a general sense, it is, but everybody must agree that all parents do not properly discharge their parental responsibilities. The State interferes, and has a right to interfere, in the matter of cruelty. A parent is not allowed under the law to brutally ill-treat the children.  The State interferes and says: &ldquo;No, you will be liable to certain penalties if you maltreat your children.&rdquo;  Again the State interferes and says: &ldquo;You will be under a statutory obligation to educate your children&rdquo;, and nobody accuses us, in either the one regard or the other, of interfering with the rights of the parent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that if there is nothing morally wrong, nothing in conflict with ethics, in saying to a parent: &ldquo;You shall not maltreat your children&rdquo; or in saying: &ldquo;You must educate your children&rdquo;, there cannot be anything wrong with saying, if necessary, to the same parent: &ldquo;You <Col N="1901" /> must provide for the physical needs of your child.&rdquo;  The community are subscribing the necessary money to provide a service in the interest of the community, for the protection of the community, and in order to ensure, so far as it is possible to ensure, that the burden of invalids which the community have to maintain, because of the fact that the ailments of children have not been looked after in time, will be eased ultimately.  For all these reasons, it is claimed, and the claim cannot be challenged, that we are entitled to ensure that, if children are not brought within our scheme of health services, their physical needs will be looked after.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke (County Dublin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the Parliamentary Secretary agrees with regard to one point on which I have heard a good deal of discussion outside the House, that is, that, where parents are in a position to have their children treated by the family doctor, they may do so.  That is a very welcome contribution.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary on the national need for children to be thoroughly examined in the school and for seeing that everything will be done to ensure that children will grow up healthy and strong and that any impediments they may have will be treated.  We know that, in the case of a number of children, had the impediments from which they suffered been treated in early life, they would have grown up into useful citizens.  I am glad to note the democratic way in which the Parliamentary Secretary approaches it in agreeing that if parents are anxious to have their children treated by their family doctor, they may do so, and in exempting these children from school inspection and so on.</P>

    <P>The effect of this amendment is that, if school authorities desire to have treatment as well as medical inspection provided for the pupils of their schools by a county authority, the county authority can make the necessary arrangements, subject to the school authorities paying for the cost of such treatment.  Otherwise, only the cost of medical inspection provided at the school can be recovered by the county authority.  Here, again, we are dealing with pupils and pupils are to be found in secondary schools.  In some instances, the management of a secondary school may desire inspection only.  In other instances, the proprietors of a school, other than an elementary school, may desire to have treatment for their pupils as well as inspection and examination.  If they desire to have treatment, it will be made available.</P>

Most of these schools would be residential schools, with pupils drawn from perhaps a wide geographical area entirely outside the jurisdiction of the local authority, and it would not be right or fair that the local authority should have to bear the full cost of such a scheme.  The cost will be recoverable from the school.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 101:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 87, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The expenses incurred by a county authority in providing any medical inspection or treatment provided for the pupils of a certified school under the Public Health (Medical Treatment of Children) (Ireland) Act, 1919 (not being expenses incurred in relation to pupils from the functional area of the county authority) shall be paid to the county authority by the person carrying on the school and such expenses shall be recoverable by the county authority from such person as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>(2)  Expenses payable by virtue of sub-section (1) of this section in relation to pupils of a certified school shall be deemed for the purposes of Section 74 of the Children Act, 1908, and Section 21 of the Children Act, 1941 (No. 12 of 1941), to be part of the maintenance of such pupils.</P>
      <P>(3)  In this section, the expression &ldquo;certified school&rdquo; means a school which is a certified school for the purposes of the Children Acts, 1908 to 1941.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to empower a county authority to recover from the authorities of a certified school&mdash;that is, a reformatory or industrial <Col N="1904" /> school&mdash;the cost of providing medical inspection or treatment for the pupils of such school other than expenses incurred in relation to such pupils from the functional area of the county authority.  The section also provides that the expenses which are payable shall be deemed for the purpose of the Children's Act, 1908, and the Children's Act, 1941, to be part of the maintenance of such pupils.  In a few words, the amendment proposes that, in the case of reformatory and industrial schools, the cost of the inspection and treatment of children from a geographical area outside the area of jurisdiction of the local authority in which the reformatory or industrial school is situate will be recoverable by the local authority.  It is the same principle as I have just enunciated in relation to the secondary schools.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (1) and substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) The parent of a child, unless an exemption in relation to the inspection is granted under sub-section (2) of this section in respect of the child, shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) in case the child is under the age of six years, submit the child to any medical inspection provided for the child under Section 86 of this Act at the child's home, or</P>
      <P>(b) in case&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) the child is aged six years or more and less than fourteen years, or</P>
      <P>(ii) the child, being aged fourteen years or more, is attending school,</P>
      <P>submit the child to any medical inspection provided under the Public Health (Medical Treatment of Children) (Ireland) Act, 1919, or under Section 86 of this Act, for the child, whether at the child's school or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fears have been expressed that the reference in Section 87 to the submission of children for medical inspection under Section 85 makes it obligatory on parents to send children under the age of 6 years for medical inspection at schools or other places.  I have dealt with this matter already by way of general explanation of the effect of certain amendments to the Bill.  The proposed amendment has been drafted with a view to allaying the fears that have been expressed.  The intention in regard to the medical inspection of any child under the age of six years is confined to the granting of power for medical inspection of such child in its home. During previous discussions on this section, some Deputies appeared to be under the impression that children <Col N="1906" /> under six years of age would be brought, under compulsory measures, to a clinic for inspection.  That is not intended.  If any inspection of such children is necessary, if the medical officer of health of the district has reason to believe that they are not being properly looked after and if he is not finished with a certificate to the effect that they are being looked after, he can inspect them at home.  Those are children who have not reached school-going age.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 108:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) The school medical officer having charge of the arrangements for a medical inspection provided pursuant to the Public Health (Medical Treatment of Children) (Ireland) Act, 1919, or Section 86 of this Act shall grant an exemption in the prescribed form from the inspection in respect of any child in relation to whom there is produced to such officer a certificate in the prescribed form signed by a registered medical practitioner stating either that the child, owing to illness the nature of which is stated in the certificate, is unable to attend the inspection or that the registered medical practitioner has examined the child within the period of seven days preceding the inspection and that, by arrangement with the child's parent, he will be responsible for any treatment required by the child until the next such inspection to which the child should be submitted takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment incorporates the principle we have been discussing to-day of providing for the exemption of a child from medical inspection on the production of a certificate from a registered medical practitioner.  I have already explained the purpose of the amendment on previous amendments.  It definitely excludes from compulsory inspection in schools any child who is certified to be ill or in respect of whom there is a certificate that the <Col N="1907" /> child has been examined by a duly qualified medical practitioner within seven days.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 116:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2) and substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) A notice under sub-section (1) of this section to the principal of a school may be addressed to &ldquo;the manager&rdquo; or &ldquo;the principal&rdquo; (as may be appropriate) of the school and may be given by delivering it to such principal, or by sending it by post to the school or by leaving it at the school with an adult person who undertakes to deliver it to such principal.</P>
      <P>This amendment is intended to provide for the delivery of the notice required by this section either to the principal of a school or to an adult person who undertakes to deliver it to the principal. The alternative would be to send the notice by post to the school addressed to the manager or principal of the school.  The sub-section which it is proposed to delete sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A notice under sub-section (1) of this section may be addressed to &ldquo;the manager&rdquo; or &ldquo;the principal&rdquo; (as may be appropriate) of the school to which the notice relates without naming him and may be given by sending it by post to the school or by leaving it with some person at the school.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was felt that the provision to leave the notice with some person at the school was scarcely adequate, because the &ldquo;some person&rdquo; might be a child or a person without much responsibility. For that reason, it was thought that the person should be, at least, an adult.  We came across this principle earlier in the Committee Stage.  In the discussion in Committee I indicated to <Col N="1908" /> the critics of this Bill that I would further examine it between now and Report Stage with a view to further amendment.  One of the methods to be considered for notifying the inspection is notification by registered post.  It should not be necessary in all cases to notify by registered post inasmuch as it often happens, as Deputies, particularly from provincial areas are aware, that the medical officer may be in close contact with the manager or with the principal of the school and may very often be able to tell him verbally: &ldquo;Well, I am coming around to inspect on next Tuesday&rdquo; or whatever day be names.  However, I shall look into the machinery somewhat more closely in the meantime, but the House might accept this amendment which may have further to be amended on the Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we have to consider.  We have to try to avoid cluttering up our medical officers with too much clerical work.  They are men with specialist qualifications, professional men, whose time could be used to greater advantage at professional rather than at clerical work.  Deputies may ask me: &ldquo;Why do you not give him the necessary clerical assistance&rdquo;? That is all right, but there is a limit to that, too.  No matter what clerical assistance you have, I think it wise to avoid loading up the machinery with clerical work that can be avoided. However, I shall look into the suggestion. Ordinarily, it should not be necessary to notify both the manager and the principal.  I think we may assume that, if the manager is notified, he will convey the good news to the principal and, if the principal is notified, he will probably notify the manager that everything will have to be in good shape the following week, when the inspection takes place.</P>

      <P>I know of a case where a manager got a notice of an examination for a particular school, and he happened to be on holidays when the letter arrived at his house.  The same <Col N="1909" /> thing might happen in the case of the school inspection.  In support of what Deputy Ó Briain has stated, I might point out that if the principal were definitely notified he would get an opportunity of notifying the parents to have their children at school.  It would then be somebody's business definitely to do that work.  The suggested sub-section is all right in its way, but I should like to see the matter pinned down more definitely than it is.</P>

      <P>When making the suggestion I had rural areas particularly in mind.  The principal and the manager might live very far apart in rural parishes.  It would be very desirable that the moral support of the manager should be available for this scheme of school inspection, which has not been as effective as it might in certain areas up to the present.  It would be very desirable to enlist the support and help of the manager.  He may not know that the inspection is taking place unless he is definitely notified.</P>

      <P>A perusal of the documents relating to this Bill shows that we have a very lengthy list of <Col N="1910" /> amendments.  Many of these amendments have come from the gentlemen who should occupy the empty benches opposite&mdash;in fact, I should imagine most of the amendments.  These amendments have been responsible for the slow passage of the Bill through the House and now these gentlemen leave the House and say that they will not have anything more to do with the Bill, when a proposition is put to prolong the time of the sitting in order to deal with the amendments.  In other words, they are the people who are largely responsible for the delay in putting through this Bill and now they are the people who object to the sitting being extended.  They want to have it both ways.  This is an important section and it has a bearing on what I want to say about the amendments.  I am sorry if I have to refer to what happened on Second Reading.  Ill-advisedly, they made the political blunder of opposing this Bill in principle.  A smoke screen is now being put up to cover their own retreat, a retreat which is a reality as you will see, Sir.</P>
      <P>If you will scrutinise amendments Nos. 122 and 123, and if you look at certain amendments to the previous section, which has already been passed, you will observe that they would delete provisions that would make those sections effective.  In other words, while not able to come out and oppose what is intended to be done by these sections, resort is had to the subterfuge of trying to delete provisions which would make the sections effective. These are not different tactics from those followed on Second Reading. They could not oppose the principle of the Bill but they have been attacking provisions which would make the Bill effective.  In other words, they are blowing hot and cold at the same time with the general idea of sabotaging the whole scheme of the Bill.</P>

      <P>(5)  It shall not be lawful for a person to advertise a restricted article.</P>
      <P>These are drafting amendments and they do not introduce any new principle into Section 89.  The section will require some further examination between this and the Report Stage. It applies to a very limited category of articles that it is necessary definitely to restrict the sale and the disposal of in this country.</P>
      <P>I do not think that Deputies will ask me to particularise, inasmuch as there are some delicate aspects related to the articles contemplated.  Certain instruments and appliances and other preparations can be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which they were obviously manufactured, and that purpose is very often an objectionable purpose and sometimes borders on a criminal purpose.  It is in order to have power to deal with these articles that Section 89 has been incorporated in the Bill.  As I have said, the category of articles will be very limited, but there does not appear to be any other effective means&mdash;the criminal law cannot deal with this situation&mdash;of dealing with it than the machinery set out here.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is taking pretty wide powers with regard to restricted articles.  I take it one of the problems he has in mind is the problem of contraceptives. I think everybody will agree with the section, but will the Parliamentary Secretary say whether he has in mind any other type of restriction or whether there is any question of a restriction on one particular brand of excellence as against another because it may not be quite so excellent?  If that is not contemplated in this section, I understand it is in other sections&mdash;that is, the question of control of the standard of the article. Is this section dealing with such things as contraceptives and things that might be perverted, or is it meant to cover the grading of the excellence of medical articles?</P>

It is not intended that this particular section should have any wider application. We have sections dealing with proprietary medicines and patent medicines and all that other wider category where the claims of these <Col N="1913" /> articles to have curative or restorative or other desirable qualities will be the determining factor.

      <P>Arising out of the amendment, I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether in the wide power he is obtaining here he will consider the question of licensing or authorising reputable general medical practitioners to obtain such things as they want.  Whereas we all see the necessity for such a section, and for the extensions provided for in the amendment, every reasonable person will sympathise with the Parliamentary Secretary in his view, and will feel that these powers are necessary, but like all such questions, there are two sides to the story.  The difficulty I see is that you will have reputable moral medical practitioners such as we have who <Col N="1915" /> will have their own views, perhaps, about new preparations which they will want to prescribe.  I should like to see adequate provision made to enable these reputable medical practitioners to secure such preparations which, undoubtedly, will only be used for very moral purposes.  The difficulty is to have power enough to curb abuses and, at the same time, make adequate provision for the legitimate use of these substances.</P>
      <P>That is the first question I wish to ask the Parliamentary Secretary. Would he be able to tell us that there will be no fetters whatever put upon reputable medical practitioners in this country in securing preparations for their own legitimate ends, or for that matter in prescribing them?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The point raised by Deputy de Valera is one that will call for further examination.  I can foresee difficulties in adequately providing for the type of contingency that the Deputy has in mind, and I would be very anxious to try to find some machinery to meet the important viewpoint to which the attention of the House has been directed.  When the Deputy mentioned reputable medical practitioners, we are all in agreement with him that, in general, medical practitioners are reputable.  Occasionally you meet a medical practitioner who is disreputable.  It is not just so easy to provide facilities for the reputable without allowing the disreputable to abuse these facilities.  I know some of the reputable members of the fraternity, and a good deal about the disreputable members, and I may be able to devise some plan to meet Deputy de Valera's difficulty, They are all registered.  I direct the attention of the House, and of Deputy de Valera in particular, as he raised the matter, to Sections 11 and 12, particularly the latter section, sub-section (1) of which reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  It shall be lawful for the Minister by Order to establish consultative councils to give to the Minister, in the manner prescribed by the Order, advice and assistance in connection with such matters affecting or incidental to the health <Col N="1916" /> of the people as may be specified in the Order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On a matter such as this it would be necessary to establish an advisory council to advise the Minister as to the operation of this section.  Undoubtedly, the administration of the section will present great difficulties.  There will be no complete uniformity of view amongst medical men as to the effectiveness of a particular remedy. One medical man would have the fullest confidence in a particular preparation, while another medical man would scoff at it, and say it was useless.  If he had antiquated views about things or was an old fogey he would not recommend such a remedy at all.  There will always be that difficulty. I agree with Deputy de Valera that a reputable medical practitioner must be allowed the fullest freedom of choice of remedy when he accepts responsibility for the life of a patient, and believes that it is the best remedy to apply in a particular illness.</P>
    <P>In fact, this matter will have to be examined with the greatest care and in the greatest detail.  It seems to me that if this is to be properly and conscientiously administered, with the greatest possible safety to the public, and to the general satisfaction of the medical profession, some of these remedies will have to be submitted to clinical trial before they can be excluded, if they are new remedies of which our practitioners have not much experience.  On the other hand, we will all be in agreement at the outset that there is quite an extensive category of patent medicines and proprietary preparations, the sale of which constitutes a fraud on the community at the present time.  We read advertisements in the newspapers about these cure-alls.  They are pretty expensive cure-alls.  Our people are in some respects easily imposed upon. They have a very astute political sense I grant, and are not so easily imposed upon in that regard but, in matters such as are under discussion now, people who are suffering from any kind of chronic ailment when they take up a newspaper see a picture of a man with a hump on his back and his head down, and they read that he got all <Col N="1917" /> right after taking some preparation for a short time.  These people would sell the last cow in order to buy that remedy and try it.  The amount of money that is extracted from the people in that way runs into millions. I want to try to stop that.  It will be a difficult job, but I am going to have a try.  It is an effort that should have the support of every member in every Party that ought to be in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Further to the remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary in reply to my query, I should like to ask a few other questions on this section.  Everybody will agree that the control of medical and chemical preparations that are liable to immoral or perverted use is not only desirable but a necessity for the welfare of the community as a whole.  In so far as this section takes power, in support of the powers taken elsewhere in the Bill, everyone is unanimous in supporting the section.  There is no criticism of that.  We all admit that provisions of this nature are necessary. The Parliamentary Secretary, however, mentioned a second ground, that of fraud, and stated that he will seek control of certain medicines on the ground that they are a fraud on the public.</P>
      <P>He has made his case.  Everybody sympathises with it.  There must be control of preparations that are liable to be foisted on the public.  But straightway a difficulty arises.  What authority is to determine that a particular preparation is useless, and that it is a fraudulent means of extracting money from the public?  It is quite clear that the Parliamentary Secretary has seen the difficulty when he mentioned that he may have to resort to a clinical test in order to exclude them. I see great difficulty there.  There is the question of the freedom of the medical profession in dealing with the problem of life and death, which is involved.  As the Parliamentary Secretary stated it is going to be very hard to say in some cases whether the medicine in question has any virtue or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who is going to decide?  Is it going to be some officer in the Minister's Department, or some particular <Col N="1918" /> analyst, or will it be referred to some board?  There you have a great difficulty, because it is just in these controversial cases that practitioners will differ.  One practitioner may think that a certain preparation is very useful in a certain condition while another may think it is useless.  The fate of that particular preparation will then depend on the views of the man to whom it is then referred.  The real danger that I see is this: supposing the machinery is set up in the Department, or under the control of the Minister it will virtually amount to a vetoing Department, with the power of saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to what is prescribed by medical practitioners. In matters relating to public health everyone will agree that the Minister has in his Department a number of experts.  The Parliamentary Secretary, I know, will not claim to have in his Department all the experts in eye trouble, gynæcology, chest and brain surgery and other things.  The experts in these lines lie outside.  Is the Minister, within his Department, going to take upon himself to decide these important matters&mdash;what is going to be allowed and what is not?  In a nutshell, the pressing danger, as far as I can see it, is this: that it would amount to circumscribing the freedom of the medical profession, and, to a certain extent, telling them just what remedies to use.  I realise that, in speaking in this way, I am performing the functions of the absent members.</P>

      <P>Still, it is absolutely necessary if democracy is going to work, to have a constructive Opposition, but the people who talk most about democracy have created this difficulty by not being present to perform their functions.  That, however, is neither here nor there.  The point is, and I am sure the members of Clann na Talmhan and the Fianna Fáil realise it, is this: that there is a problem in this section, and that there are two points of view on it.  All that I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary is, in what way can he meet the difficulty? He referred to Section 12.  I think there is a solution there if outside <Col N="1919" /> people are consulted.  I would like him to say that he is not going to confine the administration of the powers that are contained in this section solely to his own advisers who are admittedly experts on public health, but I think that he would be the first, and that they would be the first, to admit that they are not experts on every branch of medicine and surgery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this question, amendment No. 41, which is to come on later, bears, I think, very much on the matter under discussion. There is grave danger that if the Minister is to take complete control over the sale and advertising of various medical preparations we may reach the stage when there may be unfairness or injustice as between one firm and another.  I would like to know how confidence is to be established in regard to that matter.  Deputy Dillon has an amendment on the Order Paper which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Save in so far as is provided for in sub-section (3) of this section no restriction shall be placed on the sale of medical preparations or of substances with proprietary designations by way of confining their distribution to members of specified traders to the exclusion of other wholesale and retail distributors.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary intends to accept that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anticipating that it may not be moved.  I think the principle in it does apply to the matter that we are discussing.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is going to take such far-reaching control it is necessary, as Deputy de Valera has pointed out, that he should be equipped with the necessary specialist advice before taking such action.  I think that I have discerned from listening to the Parliamentary Secretary that there is a strong prejudice on the part of the medical profession against all outside medical preparations which are advertised. <Col N="1920" /> There is no doubt whatever but that a large proportion of such preparations are of very questionable value.  It is possible that amongst such preparations, there may be remedies which are of considerable value, of perhaps as great value as the prescriptions recommended by the medical profession. I remember on one occasion going into a chemist with a prescription for something of a treacle nature. I found that it was very expensive and here was the view that he expressed to me.  &ldquo;Those doctors are all faddists; they read up something in a medical journal and they immediately prescribe it because it is new.&rdquo;  Perhaps some of the old-fashioned remedies which our fathers and grandfathers knew would be much more effective.  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that there are reputable and disreputable members of the medical profession.  He admitted, and it was a significant admission I hope, that the disreputable members of the profession are not those who take part in politics.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary admitted that people are easily imposed upon.  Having regard to the kind of a Government that has been imposed on our people for the last 13 years, I am inclined to concede that point to him, that people are easily imposed upon.  I think it is a good thing that there should be some protection against fraudulent and deceptive remedies being foisted on the people.  I remember an old man coming to me with a preparation which he had&mdash;a remedy for some kind of <Col N="1921" /> rheumatic trouble which he had obtained from Great Britain.  He was a very poor man.  In answer to an advertisement he applied for and received this preparation free.  The instruction with it was that if having tested it he found that it was not doing him any harm he could apply for more and send on a subscription.  The man was illiterate, and he asked me to write on his behalf for a further supply. He showed me the material he had received and which was described as having been taken from a spa well which had great remedial properties. It was actually red clay which had been taken from the bottom of a well.  That man absolutely believed that it was doing him good and that if he could get a further supply it would make him completely well.  That is just an instance of how simple, uneducated people can be imposed upon.  I advised him against having anything further to do with it and told him he could get it in any ditch or dyke.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is absolutely true. That material was advertised in the public Press and this man's attention was drawn to it and he got somebody to write for a supply.  The first sample, of course, was free, but then he was encouraged to continue using it and to pay for it.  I see a difficulty and a danger that some particular firms may be favoured as against others.  We all know of the case of a gentleman named Sigal who was given a licence to import material into this country and to profiteer in its distribution over other people.  It is possible that gentlemen of that type may approach the Government and get, perhaps, a monopoly in the distribution of some of these medical preparations.  That would be very undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of the pharmacists who would be greatly concerned with this particular section. When we first read it we had our doubts about it but the Parliamentary Secretary very kindly met a deputation which was representative of the entire <Col N="1922" /> pharmaceutical trade, including both the academic and trade interests.  We had a long discussion with him but the Parliamentary Secretary completely satisfied the deputation that what he was doing was just and reasonable. We dislike, of course, anything that puts a restriction on the articles which we can sell and I think that when the Minister for Public Health embarks on protecting the people against fraud he is going a bit far.  At the same time I agree that it is not right that people should be at liberty to advertise articles which are in themselves fraudulent and do not conform to the claims made for them but I think it is a matter for another Department to consider whether a particular commodity is a fraud on the public or not. I agree that if the article advertised is harmful in its effects there is a case for prohibiting the sale of that particular article.  In regard to the case referred to by Deputy Cogan of the man who paid a fabulous sum for a rheumatic remedy, he has a grievance in that respect, but a man might read an advertisement offering to name the winner of a race for £1 and it might cost him another £1 by the time he was finished with the transaction and he might have nothing for it except experience. However, as far as our trade or profession are particularly concerned, I think we have expressed ourselves as completely satisfied with the Parliamentary Secretary's explanation and representatives of other interests in the House might be satisfied with that recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera has again emphasised the requirement of having advice on this highly technical and difficult matter from persons outside the Department.  Of course, the type of advisory council that is contemplated under Section 12 of the Bill would embrace persons outside the Department.  In fact, advisory councils will in the main be constituted of persons who are not in the employment of the Government.  In this particular matter the advisory council, of necessity, will have to be drawn from men with the highest and most detailed knowledge of these proprietary articles and their probable therapeutic effect if <Col N="1923" /> consumed by human beings.  As Deputy Loughman has said, I had the fullest discussion with representatives of the Pharmaceutical Society and representatives of the druggists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We spent quite a long time on this section and, following the discussion, they were quite satisfied as to the policy that has inspired this particular innovation in the Bill.  We all realise that there will be difficulty in effectively operating the section.  We are breaking new ground in that regard in this country but it is not new ground in neighbouring countries.  In the United States of America and in Canada such control has been instituted long since and very rigid control. If it was found to be necessary there where, perhaps, the people might not be as easily imposed upon as Deputy Cogan has found them to be in this country, it should be necessary here.  It is, in fact, necessary and everybody agrees on that.  The chemists and druggists were in full agreement also. The difficulty of operating it will only be overcome by experience but in this regard, more than in any other, the advisory council that will advise the Minister as to the restrictions he ought to impose and the articles on which he ought to impose them will have to be drawn from medical scientists, medical practitioners and medical consultants having the most intimate knowledge of the use and effects of such articles.  The question that has been raised by Deputy Cogan would arise on a later amendment if the Deputy in whose name that amendment has been put down were here to move it.  The possibility of interfering with normal trading relations is apparently contemplated in that amendment. The Minister for Local Government and Public Health will be concerned only with the article in question, with its suitability, with its curative or tonic or restorative powers, and with the determination of the question as to whether it is in the public interest that such an article should be available to the public.  His interest begins and ends there.  If an article is restricted, if it is prohibited, well then, nobody imports it.  If it is not restricted, well then it will be imported <Col N="1924" /> through the ordinary trading channels and the Minister for Local Government and Public Health will not be concerned in that regard.  In so far as the objectionable article might be manufactured in our own country, the point raised in the amendment will not concern us at all.  It will not concern the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  Therefore, the question of that type of favouritism, whatever the inspiration might be behind it, will not in fact arise.  The article will be judged from a scientific point of view, from its estimated effect on the human beings who use that particular article in the hope that it will cure a particular ailment.  On that, we will require the widest consultation and the fullest scientific advice.  But it is on such a basis and on no other basis that the matter will be determined.</P>
    <P>It may be necessary, and I think it will be necessary, to examine this further from a purely technical point of view arising out of its impact on the Therapeutic Substances Act and I may have to make a further amendment on Report Stage that will be purely of a drafting nature and will not in any way affect the general purpose of the section.</P>

      <P>Thousands.  Even if only pounds were spent on them, the section will prevent that type of business. In rural areas, as Deputies know quite well, at fairs and markets you find certain individuals standing up on a stool with people gathered round them, people who are easily imposed on.  If a person suffering from some illness has tried many doctors without being cured, he may be easily imposed on by one of these individuals.  In my part of the country before the war we had an individual going round known <Col N="1925" /> as the black doctor.  He never missed a fair or market in the West.  He used to take in a lot of money for these mock preparations.  He had a cure for everything; no matter what it was, he could cure it without the slightest trouble.  I believe people like that are doing much more damage than the advertisements in the newspapers.  If the section prevents people like that from carrying on this class of business, it will be a very good job.  If there is any direction in which progress should be made as rapidly as possible it is in connection with that matter.  Sometimes it is surprising how quickly people progress.  It is a surprise to me to find this Party now the chief and only Opposition in this House. That is progress.  That is more than I expected for some time, and I am delighted.</P>

Of course, as Deputy de Valera said, there may be a danger of the Department being the sole people to decide on the effectiveness of this medicine or that medicine.  But, of course, the time will come, I am sure, if things work out in that direction, when there will be people in this House&mdash;in case we do not happen to be in it&mdash;who will probably bring in some changes, because it is from experience in connection with these matters that we all learn.</P>

There are, of course, a <Col N="1926" /> number of reputable patent medicines that have been recognised by doctors as having curative properties.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary and the medical council will treat them as they should be treated.  There is another point in connection with this.  Well-known medical practitioners import certain medicines or ingredients for medicines and I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give them every facility to do that.  Arising out of their experience, some doctors make up a certain medicine to suit a certain person.  The ingredients in that medicine may have to be changed in order to suit some other patient.  I should like to see complete freedom allowed to the medical profession to formulate their own opinion as to the effectiveness of a particular drug if they think it is necessary in the case of any particular patient.</P>

Clearly it would be necessary that the Minister should have at his disposal samples of the articles in question in order that he may be in a position to have them analysed and tested and to satisfy himself as to whether in fact the licences should operate.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (2) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make regulations for the control of the advertisement or sale of medical preparations.</P>
      <P>That is all very well, but who will enforce the regulations?  What body will determine the matter?  Will it be the Parliamentary Secretary's Department or some independent advisory body, such as is provided for in Section 12?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with that point a few minutes ago, but, briefly, the advice which the Minister will require for the operation of this section will not be available to him from the personnel within his Department and an advisory council under Section 12 will have to be set up for the purpose.  As I explained previously, that advisory council will have to be widely based and drawn from medical scientists immediately concerned in different branches of medical science.  It will also be necessary to have available to the Minister the advice of consultants, medical practitioners, pharmacists and analytical chemists.  As Deputies appreciate, we are breaking new ground here, and we will have to operate this section on an experimental basis until such time as we find we can make its terms effective within the machinery provided here.  If we find that we have not given ourselves adequate powers to deal with the problem with which we are trying to deal, we will have to come back to the House and ask for extended powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, this matter of the control of patent medicines and proprietary articles has been developed to a great extent in America, Canada and European countries.  We propose to study carefully the machinery set up in these countries and the manner in which they operate control.  If it is necessary to modify the powers we have here, we will have to seek any further statutory powers we may require, but within the powers given us in the Bill we can make a substantial inroad on this type of problem, and <Col N="1929" /> thus gain the necessary experience to be able to convince the House that further powers may be necessary in order to make a desirable policy fully effective.</P>
    <P>Deputies need not have any concern as to the possibility of the Minister acting in a hasty way in a matter such as this, or interfering to any undue extent with the proper discretion and the exercise of the independent judgement of any medical practitioner who takes it upon himself to treat a patient and who, perhaps, from his own limited experience has found that particular remedies have given him satisfactory results.  While a neighbouring doctor might contest the value of the preparation, we must always give the fullest consideration to the experience of any individual practitioner who has satisfied himself that a particular remedy gives particularly satisfactory results.</P>
    <P>In the early stages, we shall be immediately concerned not with the remedies concerning which there is a difference of opinion amongst medical practitioners, but with the purely fraudulent remedies concerning which there will be little or no difference of opinion amongst medical men.  In that field, from my own knowledge of the subject, I think there is fairly wide scope for the operation of the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his answers and I hope he will bear with me a little longer.  I should like to say that one of my purposes in pressing this matter is to discharge the function of the Deputies who have not moved their amendments, but, in doing so, I do it as a duty to the Parliamentary Secretary because a certain amount of suggestion and innuendo has been put up and the opportunity for his replying to it has been taken from him by the non-moving of these amendments.  I wished to give the Parliamentary Secretary a chance to reply to these very important points which he has clarified and I think everybody will be satisfied with the answer he has given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In effect, he has told us&mdash;he does not propose to rely completely on the experts in his Department &mdash; that he will take into his confidence and be <Col N="1930" /> guided by outside medical opinion, where appropriate, and will not act in any hasty manner.  He has also reassured us that this is aimed at the fraudulent type of patent medicine&mdash;in other words, the selling of the bottle of water, with a little colouring matter, as a cure-all, because that in many cases is what it boils down to&mdash;and the whole medical profession will agree with him.  He has gone further and has assured us that, in the case of any medical practitioner who has found from his experience that a particular remedy is efficacious, even where his brother medical practitioners would not agree with him, he does not propose to interfere with him and that the necessary facilities will be available to him.</P>
    <P>I need put only one further matter to the Parliamentary Secretary then. His answer caters for tried remedies, but there is still the position with regard to new remedies.  In the medical journals, the scientific journals, there will be continuing research work, suggesting new remedies, and new drugs will be described, and, as is usual in these cases, some writers will praise them and others will discuss their limitations.  These preparations will be largely experimental.  As I understand it, they are usually circulated by the manufacturing firms as samples, with the usual literature, to medical practitioners who are invited to try them. I take it that nothing in the provisions of this section will hinder the freedom of reputable medical practitioners to avail themselves of new discoveries and to apply them therapeutically as they may think fit, in the course of treating their patients.  In other words, I take it that this section will and can in no way be used to restrict the present freedom which medical practitioners enjoy&mdash;reputable medical practitioners, of course&mdash;to prescribe these preparations for their patients.</P>

      <P>This is a very important section of the Bill.  I agree with Deputy Donnellan in his reference to the activities of the &ldquo;black doctor&rdquo; in the West.  I can assure Deputy Donnellan and the House that we, the supposed wise guys of the East, have met the &ldquo;black doctor&rdquo;, too.  There is <Col N="1931" /> another matter about which I am somewhat perturbed.  I refer to the well-known and successful herb cures, prepared, if you like, by old women. If this Bill will prevent those people from assisting their neighbours, it is a very serious matter, because many of those cures have, beyond yea or nay, been successful where the medical profession have failed.  There is no doubt about that.  I can see in this provision danger to people who, at no cost to their neighbours and very little cost to themselves, have successfully relieved suffering.  I should like an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that he will not take strong action to prevent those people from assisting sufferers.  That is all I have to say except to comment on the empty benches opposite.  I am rather surprised that, in respect of an important piece of legislation, such as this, the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Mulcahy, should decide upon joining in what I may call the national pastime of going on strike.  It is pretty evident that he cares little for the success or failure of this Bill so far as the interest of the masses of the people is concerned.</P>

      <P>I am not so sure.  Deputy de Valera has raised the question of trial samples for medical practitioners and expressed some anxiety as to the possible curtailment of the trial of new drugs and new preparations by medical practitioners.  That is not contemplated under this section.  We are well abreast of developments and heading fair to lead our neighbours in matters of public health administration. <Col N="1932" /> We do not intend to do anything either by way of statute or administration, which would in any way limit the advance of medical science.  All our activities will be in the opposite direction, so that Deputy de Valera, speaking on behalf of the Opposition, need have no particular anxiety on that score.</P>
      <P>I regret the departure of Deputy Mulcahy and his team.  I have been engaged with that team for the past few weeks and I had got more or less accustomed to their ways.  Now, I have a new type of opposition and it will take me some time to study their particular approach before I acquire the same degree of skill in handling it.  A position will develop under the Bill in which there will be a general consensus of opinion amongst medical people that the use of particular remedies which are being extensively advertised, distributed or sold should be restricted or, perhaps, prohibited. When such a public opinion, or localised opinion, amongst professional men comes to be presented to the Minister, he will naturally pay attention to it.  He will have at his disposal an existing body&mdash;the Medical Research Council&mdash;to whom he has on more than one occasion referred scientific matters for advice.  He will have machinery to set up the other type of advisory council to which I have referred.  Within that machinery, there are many safeguards against danger to the community by the operation of this section in any narrow or ill-considered way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Deputy Walsh's problem, with his old ladies in County Louth who have cures for many things, I should not like to discourage him completely, mainly for the reason that these old ladies have a very limited area of operation.  While I might have to challenge Deputy Walsh's views as to the efficacy of those ladies' remedies. they are not sufficiently numerous and their practice is not sufficiently widespread to constitute any great danger to the health of the community. Instances could arise where it would be necessary to interfere in such matters. Most of us have some knowledge, if we have not experience, of domestic cancer cures that have done inestimable <Col N="1933" /> damage.  In fact, those cures have been responsible, in some instances, for the earlier death of the patient.  That is an example of a domestic, scientific activity with which it might be necescary to interfere.  I do not know that that is the particular development down in County Louth that Deputy Walsh is so anxious to preserve. I sound a note of warning that I will have to keep an eye on County Louth and see how extensive is this practice which Deputy Walsh is so anxious should not be interfered with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see definite danger in giving those wide powers to the Parliamentary Secretary in respect of types of remedy which have proved effective.  It has come to my knowledge that some of those home-manufactured remedies for cancer have proved very effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>And very radical.  They usually remove the patient as well as the cancer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The remedies to which I allude have proved successful in a large number of cases.  A case came to public notice a few years ago in which a patient died some time after using one of those remedies.  The unregistered practitioner was brought into court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the immediate results of that man being brought into court was that people came forward from a very wide area, people of education, and of high repute in the community, to subscribe publicly the necessary money to defend that gentleman because people felt, many of them as the result of personal experience, that this man was a public benefactor and that he should be protected. There is no doubt that some of the cancer cures have proved effective and the cures are not confined to a small area.  That is where the Parliamentary Secretary comes in because I think he indicated that where a person of this kind is practising in a small area he will not interefere but if practitioners are conducting operations over a wide area, he will take action.  The person to whom I referred practised over a wide area.  As a matter of fact, he was <Col N="1934" /> sending remedies to various parts of the United States and that is wide enough.  His practice was a practice based upon experience and merit.  I know how deep-rooted the prejudice of the medical profession is against such persons but I think it would be better if the members of the medical profession were to get on their knees at the feet of some of these practitioners and learn something from them because I do not think that anybody, even though he may have obtained many degrees from a university, has reached the stage when he cannot learn something more from somebody else. We know that penicillin is only a sort of mould which was utilised by quacks in years gone by, in a less perfect form perhaps but nevertheless used.  The medical profession have a good deal to learn from those who have brought about natural cures of this kind.  I think there is a public danger in having at the head of this Department administering a section such as this, a man with the mentality of the Parliamentary Secretary who has displayed, and has not hesitated to display, a deep-rooted prejudice against everybody who seeks to remedy human ailments by methods other than those subscribed to by the medical profession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker somewhat surprised me.  I think in all seriousness his remarks call for some kind of answer.  There has been as we all know in this country what we might call the local practitioner &mdash; the local &ldquo;wise man&rdquo; or &ldquo;wise woman&rdquo; who did a certain amount of medical prescription. There was also the bone-setter. We shall leave the bone-setter aside, because he is an artist dealing with something mechanical which depends on the skill of his hands.  He was really somebody who had a certain transmitted mechanical skill and he did some splendid work, being very often more successful than the ordinary medical practitioner who had only done his course.  Doctors would be the very first to admit that that is so.  I can see nothing in the Bill that is going to stop the work of a man such as that. There is nothing to prevent a man who is depending on his own manipulative skill carrying on his practice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  I think we will all agree with Deputy Cogan, Deputy Walsh and Deputy Donnellan in regard to that but there is a much more serious question.  You have the person who is going around with remedies&mdash;in other words an untrained, unskilled person who is really dabbling in pharmacy and prescription.  It is all very well to say he is a skilled man. All that he has got is that he has had transmitted to him for generations certain things that were found by experience to be helpful but the real difficulty is that he does not know the limitations of his own cures and, as the Parliamentary Secretary has very properly stated, he very often succeeds in killing as well as curing because of his lack of discrimination.  I think it is highly desirable to have control of such practices in these days.  It is one thing to say that cures have been effected and that these remedies have been effective.  They have, if they have been applied in the proper way.  We know that the drug digitalis, if applied properly, is very beneficial in heart cases but just how many of these quack practitioners know enough to appreciate the harmful effects of drugs when used by unskilled people?  Usually these people make up a certain decoction in a haphazard way.  The results may be sometimes effective but again the administration of the drug may be very harmful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the present availability of pharmaceutical supplies, and the services which are available from qualified medical practitioners under necessary controls, we have reached a stage when it is desirable to control the activities of quack practitioners.  The Deputy mentioned cancer.  It was actually the Parliamentary Secretary who raised that question first.  I think the Deputy opposite made some very extravagant claims for cancer cures.  There are large research bodies all over the world who for years have been studying this most serious human ailment under the most careful control with a huge number of subjects for observation. To a certain extent, experimental work has been done on animals <Col N="1936" /> also but, after all that, they have not been able really to get at the bottom of this terrible malady.  I think the Deputy is really being a little extravagant in claiming that some of our handy men have got a cure for cancer.</P>
    <P>Leaving out the question of the doctors at the moment, if we were a court who had to consider evidence, properly sworn and segregated, I think we should have to find that the killing exceeded the curing in the case of these alleged cancer cures.  There are other factors which have also to be considered. There is the psychological factor and, again, cancer in some cases may have been wrongly diagnosed. There may be the effect on the patient produced by the mental suggestion that these people are infallible.  These practitioners by instilling a certain amount of confidence may produce successful results, but that is no justification for giving them an unlimited licence for dispensing chemical substances. It is also claimed that some of the substances used in these cures have anticipated medical discoveries. The Deputy mentioned penicillin, and the moulds from which it has been evolved.  It is now found that some of the remedies of the old days, such as bandaging wounds with a most atrocious mess which medical practitioners nowadays would look upon as dirt, really incorporated some of these moulds out of which penicillin is at present made.</P>
    <P>I would like to tell the Deputy that research workers on these lines have a constant eye on these popular cures. Research medical practitioners and chemists are constantly interested in these traditional cures because of the possible line they may get from them. There is the case of ergot used by all the handy midwives in the old days. It was well known to them and was afterwards found to be an important specific drug.  Granting the Deputy all these things, I think he should admit that we have reached a stage of knowledge when control is necessary. It is quite obvious the Parliamentary Secretary will not send out an inspector to watch for a little dose of nettle juice, which is a common purgative or spring cure in various parts of the <Col N="1937" /> country.  Give him credit for being reasonable.</P>
    <P>Again, I have to draw attention to the absence of the people responsible for some of these amendments.  As in the case of the women clause in the Constitution, and the famous Transport Bill, we have all the bogies dangled before us, as if Ministers were the most outrageous bogies and unreasonable people that ever lived.  Experience shows us that these things are administered reasonably, and you must accept that attitude.  There is no use in waving bogies.  Certain powers have to be taken in order to make the administration effective.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary's answer should suffice.  The powers are necessary, but they will not be abused.</P>

But, little as I know about it, I swear I know more than a lot of those who have been blowing hot air about public health, about doctors and other things, for the past 15 days. I will give the Parliamentary Secretary this credit, that I consider he is one of the most reasonable members of the Government.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has been the subject of very severe criticism from members of the Opposition.  I agree fully with every step he has taken in relation to this and other sections of the Bill.  I have not voted against it; I have voted for the Bill, and I am prepared to stand by the Parliamentary Secretary on every section, because I believe that, with his medical knowledge, and also with the knowledge of his advisers, he will not put over any legislation unless, in his opinion, it is in the best interests of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan spoke about the so-called handy people who have effected <Col N="1938" /> cures.  I would like to defend these people in the strongest possible way. I have known cases where patients were given up by doctors and discharged from hospital and they were afterwards cured of cancer by handy men.  I know of one case, and I am sure if Senator Hogan, who at one time was a member of this House, were here, he would bear me out, because he knows the case just as well as I do.  A constituent of ours was given up by the highest medical authorities in the Midlands. He was suffering from cancer. He was left on one side to die.  We succeeded in discovering one of these people who might be called by the Parliamentary Secretary a quack.  We brought him there.  No bus or hackney driver would agree to bring that man any distance, he was in such a bad state.  He was brought into a public-house, convenient to Naas, but the publican refused to serve him with a drink.  He went to two hotels, and the hotels refused to serve him with a meal, his cancer was so bad.  A kind neighbour agreed to admit him, and give him refreshment.  Afterwards they broke up the vessels he had used.  That man was taken to a quack, and to-day he is working between the handles of a plough, enjoying the best of health.</P>
    <P>That is only one case.  I have known other cases where cancer was definitely cured by these people.  I believe it is not right to interfere with them.  I do not think that the law should be used to control this gift that Almighty God has given to those people.  It is a gift from God.  Although the Parliamentary Secretary has power to deal with people who possess that gift, I suggest he should be slow to exercise it.  People fortunate enough to have such curing powers should not be interfered with Instead of taking steps to make criminals out of them, they should be regarded as a great asset to the country.  They have the prayers of many people, because they have been responsible for restoring those people to normal good health.</P>
    <P>Not alone in the case of cancer, but as regards many other diseases that have been considered incurable those people have brought about cures by means of their marvellous gift, and the <Col N="1939" /> State should be very slow to take steps that might prevent such people doing the work that Almighty God put them on earth to do.  Many citizens are very grateful to those quacks who have the gift.  Those people are considered in their areas to be very lucky.  I know there are suspicious people who might not be considered as lucky.  In part of my constituency there is one person who has the gift, and, as well as curing people suffering from various types of complaint, if a beast becomes ill, he would be called to visit that beast.  Say a horse had some complaint.  The very moment that man would enter the stable, the horse would get up and walk around.  If the man refused to visit the stable, when the owner would go into it he would find the horse stone dead.  That type of thing is well known, and I am sure there are other Deputies from my constituency who have an intimate knowledge of the type of person to whom I refer.</P>
    <P>It is quite true those people have certain powers, and I would be slow to institute legal proceedings against quacks who have done good jobs.  The Parliamentary Secretary may say these quacks have been responsible for killing people.  The fact of the matter is that the people would die, whether they were attended by the highest medical authorities or not.  So far as these quacks are concerned, no doubt we will hear that they were responsible for shortening the days of one person, but we will hear nothing at all about the scores they have cured.  I believe that none of these quacks ever deliberately killed anybody.  I can safely say they cured scores of people.  The one or two who might have died would have died whether or which.  The Minister should be slow to touch the quacks.</P>

      <P>There are people who cure cancer.  I should like to know if it is by an act of God, which Deputy Flanagan mentioned, or by some method that they prescribe. If it is by something they prepared I have no brief for that.  I can testify to cases where certain people succeeded in doing so, not by the use of medical preparations, but by some act of God.  The Parliamentary Secretary has heard of what has been done by the seventh son.  I have known cases where the seventh son in a family, touched with his hands people who had certain complaints, on certain days of the week and a cure resulted.</P>

It is possible to remove the rust from iron, and it is probable that something like what removes the cancer that has been referred to would also remove a wart.

      <P>Is this section a repetition of a provision that was already in previous Acts dealing with public health and the control of animals in public places?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a specific provision under which sanitary authorities have power to make by-laws, but not quite in relation to the control of animals in public places.  That is set out in this section.  There are sections called to mind by this section concerning the control of fairs and markets on which Deputies might like to have some information.  This section empowers a sanitary authority to make by-laws</P>
      <P>&ldquo;imposing duties on owners of animals for the purpose of preventing danger to public health or injury to amenities arising from such animals when they are brought to or allowed to be in any public place&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It does not interfere with such market rights, or the rights to hold fairs as have statutory foundation at the present time.  As far as the holding of fairs and markets is concerned, and, as far as they are governed by existing law, that provision is not interfered with under the section.  Bearing in mind that local authorities make by-laws and that that is a reserved function, it can be assumed that this section will be biassed in favour of people anxious to hold fairs in the towns.  Public health reformers would prefer to see fairs held outside the towns, because of the nuisance that is sometimes created by holding them in narrow streets, where cattle are on the footpaths, and very often actually in shops.  The section does not empower local authorities to abolish the existing rights to hold fairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly a pity that there is not a direction in the section to local authorities to prevent fairs being held on the streets.  Fairs will continue to be held outside business people's doors until the authorities are compelled to prevent the practice. The first consideration of business people is not public health, or anything else, but the making of money on fair <Col N="1943" /> days.  As there is competition amongst business people, fairs will be held in the streets, so that greater crowds will be outside their doors.</P>
      <P>I regret that power has not been taken under the section to compel local authorities to provide fair greens and to abolish the holding of fairs on the public streets.  I believe that in time that will be done.  I know that it would not be a popular thing with business people, but from the point of view of the public health the sooner that reform is carried out the better.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Donnellan.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should have taken power to prevent fairs being held on the public streets.  As Deputy Donnellan has said the business people are in favour of that because it brings farmers and others all the nearer to their business houses.  We know that, when fairs are held on the streets, for two or three days after the streets are in a deplorable condition.  For the sake of the public health it is a pity the Parliamentary Secretary did not take power for the establishment of fair greens in all our big towns.  To have live stock standing for hours on the main streets of our towns is not good for the public health.  Local authorities should have the power to fix a venue for the holding of fairs, and to put an end to the present practice in so many of our towns and villages. When fairs are held on the streets the local authority should be compelled to see that the streets are cleaned up within 24 hours after the fair.</P>

      <P>In my opinion this section hardly goes far enough.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should make it obligatory on sanitary authorities to provide fair greens.  Only recently in my constituency we had very keen rivalry, such as Deputy Donnellan has described, between the traders there.  They actually fought the matter out to a division at a meeting of the local town council.  One section wanted to have the holding of the fairs removed from the streets, and properly so, in view of the fact that a fair green was already established in this town.  I think fair greens should <Col N="1944" /> be provided somewhere on the outskirts of towns for the holding of fairs. The Parliamentary Secretary should reconsider the section and compel all sanitary authorities to provide fair greens for the holding of fairs in their areas.</P>

For hundreds of years the fairs have been held on the streets and with no ill effects on the public health.  Immediately the fair is over the streets are put into a sanitary condition.  I think that if there was to be any change in the present system, the first people to protest would be the farmers who attend the fairs and not the business people.  I would be opposed to the granting of powers to a local authority to prevent the holding of fairs on streets, especially in districts where it is impossible to provide fair greens.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the view put forward by Deputy O'Driscoll.  We have many villages in which fairs have been held on the streets from time immemorial.  The public health interest is met in these cases by the provision which is made by the public health authority for the cleaning of the streets.  It would be unwise, I think, to have any drastic provision put into the Bill in regard to the holding of fairs.  If the public health authorities see to it that the streets are cleaned up after the fair, I think that should be sufficient.  I am not dealing with towns which are controlled by a local council, but rather with villages.</P>

      <P>In my area we have towns where there are fair greens and other towns where there are not.  In the latter case the fairs have to be held on the streets.  That is very objectionable. The streets are left in a deplorable condition.  The local authority, however, sees that they are cleaned up.  The position is reversed where you have a fair green.  We have one in Claremorris which cannot be cleaned up because the site is just a field.  There is no concrete or tar macadam surface.  That really creates a greater nuisance from the health point of view than when fairs are held on the public streets which can be cleaned up since they have a concrete or other firm surface.  Of course, I admit that in many places it is impossible to have fair greens provided. Down in my county we find it difficult to get land for the provision of burial places.  Where, however, fair greens are provided the Parliamentary Secretary should see that it is properly surfaced so that it can be cleaned unlike the one in Claremorris.</P>

      <P>Most of the points that have been raised have been dealt with by some of the speakers because every aspect of the question has been advanced by one or other of the Deputies who took part in the discussion. The fact of the matter is, first, that the provision of fair greens would not be appropriate to this Bill and, secondly, this is a much more complicated problem than appears on the surface. Market rights and fair rights are sometimes owned by private individuals, not always by the local authority.</P>

Tools are levied, and so on and, in the same way, in the areas where the market rights are owned by the local authority, these <Col N="1946" /> market rights are sometimes a considerable source of revenue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyhow, the Deputies who talked about the physical difficulty of providing fair greens hit a practical point right on the head. There is no use in talking about coming in in a wholesale revolutionary fashion and declaring: &ldquo;We will have no fairs in the towns any more; we will abolish all this thing, the after effects of which are very unpleasant and unsightly, and hang the consequences.&rdquo; You just cannot do that.  If there is not a fair green within reasonable distance of the towns, you just cannot provide a fair green.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You cannot take it down out of the sky.  That practical consideration has to be borne in mind.  It would be desirable to provide fair greens, and I agree with Deputy Commons that if we provide fair greens we should not provide a type of fair green that is going to be as big a nuisance as the nuisance we are trying to get rid of.  At any rate, that aspect of the question is difficult and complicated and, if it is to be dealt with, it would have to be dealt with by separate legislation.  It would involve a number of considerations that were not perhaps, present to the minds of Deputies when this matter first came under discussion.  while I say that, a reasonable degree of control of animals in <Col N="1947" /> public places can be exercised.  There are other public health complications, apart altogether from the accumulation of filth and excreta in a town or on a footpath or in the streets following a fair.  There may be, and sometimes are, animals present in the fair, or in the market, or in a public place that may, in fact, themselves be sources of infection and it may be desirable to protect the community from some of the effects of the possibility, at any rate, of contracting certain contagious diseases that we have been talking about. That may be only a comparatively small matter and I merely mention it as a possibility.  But the owners of the fairs, whether the market rights are owned by the local authority or owned by private individuals, have a responsibility for removing any nuisance that might be created as a result of the holding of a fair, and local authorities ought to get after them and see that when a fair has been held and the streets and footpaths and the whole appearance of the place have been messed up that the owners of the market rights or fair rights, if it is not the local authority, ought to be made to shoulder some responsibility for cleaning up the place, particularly if they are drawing tolls as a result of their having either acquired or inherited the market rights.</P>
    <P>I do not know that I can be of any further assistance to the House on the matter.  I have explained the position as clearly as I can and I think the House understands.  We are concerned here with the limited extent to which we can interfere in this matter.  To such extent as it is possible to control animals in public places, we propose to do it, but there are very definite limitations as to the extent to which this section can operate.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 92.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 143:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of sub-section (2) to add a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(d) ground attached to a place of public worship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1948" /> I put down this amendment for the purpose of ensuring that where it is proposed to bury the body of a deceased person-in this case it would usually be the body of a deceased clergyman-in the grounds of a place of worship, there would be nothing in the Bill to prevent that from being done. As I read the section it would appear to restrict the burial of the body of a deceased parish priest in the grounds of his own chapel.  I may be wrong in that.  That is my reading of the section, unless, perhaps, under paragraph (b) they could apply to the Minister for permission.  But it would be rather an irksome duty to have to apply for permission and the delay caused might be very inconvenient. There should be no objection to the burial of a deceased clergyman in the grounds of his own place of worship. It is not likely that the ground would be used for the interment of anybody else.  Therefore, I think there could be no objection to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment as set out could not be accepted, for very obvious reasons.  Section 92 provides that a person shall not bury the body of a deceased person in a place which is not a burial ground for the purposes of this section and in sub-section (2) it is set out that the following (and no other) places shall be burial grounds for the purposes of this section: a place which is in lawful use as a burial ground and which was, immediately before the commencement of this section, in lawful use as a burial ground, etc., and then, in paragraph (c), a burial ground provided by a burial board.  Now Deputy Cogan suggests &ldquo;ground attached to a place of public worship&rdquo;.  The particular difficulty that Deputy Cogan anticipates might require some examination.  Of course, it is not intended that the right of burial of clergymen within the church should be interfered with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is not safeguarded in the section, I am quite prepared to safeguard that in an amendment.  But the Deputy's proposal would authorise the burial of a deceased person in any ground attached to a place of public worship.  That could not be permitted, for the reason that burial grounds <Col N="1949" /> have to be selected in the light of certain considerations as to soil, drainage, suitability, and so on; so that the ground attached to a place of worship is not necessarily ground that could be recognised as a suitable burial ground from the point of view of sanitation and various other things.  If the limited point which the Deputy has in mind is not met in the section, I will meet it on the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with that. I should like to point out that it has been customary to bury clergymen in their own chapels, but I think the custom now is to bury them somewhere in the chapel yard.  There is no tendency at present to use chapel yards for other interments.  If they have been so used in the past, I think it is not customary now, and that the ecclesiastical authorities do not approve of it.</P>

In the neighbouring parish to that in which I live there are the ruins of an old church and within the walls of that old church two or three families have been buried, perhaps for sentimental reasons.

Apparently regulations are contemplated under which human bodies could be disposed of otherwise than by burial.  If it is proposed to provide for some other system of disposing of human bodies by burning or otherwise, we want to know what the section is all about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a new provision.  The object of the section, as must be apparent to Deputies who have read it, is to provide control of the disposal of bodies other than by burial.  Cremation of human remains has in recent years found favour with a limited number of people in other countries, <Col N="1952" /> but there has been no demand for it up to the present in this country. Such a demand may arise in future, but there is no law dealing with the matter and it seems desirable to provide statutory powers to enable such procedure to be controlled.  The regulations under Section 95 (2) would prohibit such procedure unless when carried out under licence issued by the Minister and under approved conditions.  At present, as Deputies are aware, we have no statutory power to regulate the manner of disposal of cremated remains or human ashes.  It has not arisen here from within, but it sometimes does occur, and is liable to occur in the future, that people who die in other countries might direct that their ashes be sent over to this country for disposal. In such a contingency, it seems desirable that there should be some control of the manner and method of disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that anybody in the House has any desire to enter into a discussion from the ethical aspect, but we must arm ourselves with some power, if human ashes are sent to this country to be blown to the four winds of the earth, to prescribe the conditions under which such may be done, if we agree to allow it to be done at all. This does not authorise cremation, but it does provide that the Minister may make regulations in relation to the disposal of the bodies of deceased persons, otherwise than by burial.  It may be said that, from the public health point of view, cremated remains are not a danger, and, on that particular aspect, I would have to confess that, following cremation properly carried out, the ashes themselves would not be a danger to the public health, but there are other factors to be considered.  There are Deputies, I think, who, while they might not concern themselves very much with whether the relatives of a deceased person thought well to cremate the remains, might concern themselves somewhat if there was a danger or a likelihood that the ashes would be blown in through their dining room windows.  That is the consideration behind this section.  I think it is a necessary provision.  It does not, of <Col N="1953" /> itself, authorise or recognise cremation, but it does arm us with powers to say something about it if human remains are cremated and it is proposed to distribute them in this country.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, there is a certain amount of indefiniteness about the law relating to the disposal of bodies and the Parliamentary Secretary aims at providing something more explicit.  In principle, we will all have to support him in this, and Deputies will agree that it is absolutely necessary that the disposal of bodies be controlled in such a way as will make it a regular public matter&mdash;that all precautions must be taken to guard against abuse in the matter of the disposal of bodies or secrecy in the disposal of bodies.</P>

      <P>Or disrespect. Everybody will agree that whatever disposal of bodies is to take place should be a public affair and should be in accordance with the accepted moral views of the community.  I think it is to provide fundamentally for that that the Parliamentary Secretary has put in this section.  There is also the factor that if loopholes are left in the law relating to the disposal of bodies certain facilities are afforded to people who wish to kill.  From the homicide point of view, it is obviously desirable to have very public and very definite control of the disposal of bodies, because murders could take place which could not be dealt with adequately if there were not control of the disposal of bodies.  That, in fact, is behind such things as the registration <Col N="1954" /> of death, inquests and so on, and this is merely designed to fill a loophole in the law.</P>

      <P>There is only one other matter I want to refer to in relation to this section and I regret that the amendment to this section and the previous section has not been moved, as I think we should discuss it.  It is the question of summary conviction. The amendment is not before us and I cannot move it, but I should like to ask if the Parliamentary Secretary has considered the desirability of treating these matters as so serious as to warrant their being made indictable offences.  I merely ask the question as to whether he has considered the point with regard to dealing with these offences, when it is in the public interest to secure the maximum formality and publicity, by proceding by way of indictment rather than summarily. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary has considered it as an amendment on the point as tabled, but I should be interested to hear his attitude.  It is merely a simple question; I am not urging it one way or the other; but it is a matter which we might have discussed if the gentleman who put down the amendment had moved it.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;throughout the amendments.  We had, at least, two discussions on the question&mdash; not very detailed.  The issues which were raised were largely of a constitutional nature.  Not considering myself competent to express a firm view on a purely constitutional question, I approached it merely from the point of view of a layman in matters of law.  Deputy McGilligan, <Col N="1955" /> and Deputy Costello, to a lesser extent, advanced the interesting thesis that we are acting unconstitutionally by putting various types of offences carrying heavy penalties&mdash;in one case up to £500 and in many cases up to £100, with an accompanying period of imprisonment&mdash;into the courts of summary jurisdiction to be disposed of. That thesis is founded on the assumption that the courts of summary jurisdiction can, under our Constitution, deal only with minor offences.  What constitutes a minor offence is a matter in respect of which constitutional lawyers will have to engage themselves. When this matter was raised by Deputies McGilligan and Costello, it seemed to me that, if we were acting unconstitutionally in this regard in the provisions of this Bill, we were acting unconstitutionally in many corresponding matters.  It suggested itself to me that the test as to whether an offence was a major offence or a minor offence could only be properly measured in relation to the penalty imposed.  That conception may be altogether wrong, as it is not the conception of a lawyer. Corresponding types of offence under various enactments&mdash;the Therapeutic Substances Act, the Road Traffic Act and various customs and excise regulations &mdash; carrying corresponding penalties, and in many cases greater penalties, have invariably been dealt with in the courts of summary jurisdiction. Consequently, if the test is to be the penalty that the offence carries with it, it seems to me that it is appropriate that the offences contemplated under this Bill should be deemed to be minor offences.  I do not know what the constitutional lawyers will say about that layman's thesis on a constitutional matter.  I undertook in the course of the discussion to have this matter fully examined with a view to making on Report Stage an authoritative statement, as advised by the legal advisers to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not wish to put the Parliamentary Secretary to the trouble of giving us what I may describe as the theoretical view.  I take it that, notwithstanding that the matter arises so many times, a question <Col N="1956" /> of this sort is one for individual decision in respect of each offence. The approach I take is that you decide, in the first place, whether the offence is so serious as to warrant the more formal and rigorous procedure or whether it is so relatively trivial that it should be a matter for summary jurisdiction.  The next question would, then, be the penalty.  I may have misunderstood the Parliamentary Secretary. I do not agree that one fixes the penalty first and then decides whether the offence is minor or major.  I take this opportunity of saying that there may be a tendency in modern times, in all countries, to resort to summary jurisdiction too readily in the case of certain offences.  I think that we should guard against that.</P>
      <P>The raising of this point is, I think, appropriate to the question before us. I do not want to digress any more than the Parliamentary Secretary on the question of the Constitution and the courts.  Examine the provisions under which district justices are appointed, the relative power which the Executive has over them, their status before the law and take, in conjunction with that, the judicial functions you are assigning to them.  In modern times, there is a tendency to refer too many serious matters to that court, to the exclusion of the higher tribunals.  In the interest of the State, as a whole, we should be careful that the jurisdiction of the higher courts&mdash;the Circuit Court and the Central Criminal Court&mdash;are not frittered away as multitudinous enactments bring in more crimes and as, what I might call, the fashionable crimes increase and the crimes prevalent in other days decrease.  That is the net point.  Since the Parliamentary Secretary does not propose to accept the amendment on the paper, I take it that he does not consider this particular offence to be of so serious a nature as would warrant indictment. I accept his answer on that but, in other cases, the broader question I referred to would arise.</P>

      <P>On the section, I should like to call the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the position that exists in the western portion of my constituency.  There are five jubilee nurses there.  They are serving a congested district.  The matter has been already placed before the Parliamentary Secretary but his answer did not completely satisfy some people, because I have some letters about it. These nurses are known in our district as jubilee and Lady Dudley nurses. Portion of their salary is paid by local subscription.  That is in the Castletownsend area.  Part of the salary is paid by the Somerville Trust.  A legacy was, I think, left for that purpose. Contributions are made by the local sports committee, by the Local Government Department, by the West Cork Board of Health and the tuberculosis committee.  I should like to know what the position of those nurses will be.  I should also like to know what the position of the local committees will be and what the position of the institutions responsible for the nurses&mdash;the Lady Dudley Nursing Home and the Saint Lawrence Hospital-will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that these nurses have done good work in the congested districts. They have given advice to expectant mothers; they have visited homes after the births of children, and given advice and instruction to mothers as to how to treat their children in a proper and necessary manner.  They have also given free advice and assistance to poor people, to aged people and to people who were sick in their homes and so often avoided the necessity of sending these people to already overcrowded hospitals.  I am anxious to know what the position of these <Col N="1958" /> nurses will be in future, so far as payment is concerned.  I expect that the nurses will be absorbed in the scheme to be operated under the Bill owing to the great scarcity of nurses at present, but I should like to know will the position be much different from the present position?  Will the local committees be recognised, or will the nursing institutions which were responsible for the introduction of these very efficient nurses who have done an immense of good in very poor districts, have any status?  One of these nurses is stationed at Castletownsend, another in Glengariff, another in Cape Clear Island, another in Adrigole and another in Castletownbere.  I would be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary would give some indication as to the future position of these nurses and if necessary introduce such amendments as might be needed on the Report Stage to secure the position of these nurses.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £215,120 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1947, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 5, c. 58, and No. 34 of 1928), including certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In presenting the Estimates for the Forestry Services for 1946-47, I had hoped to be able to announce that certain <Col N="1959" /> difficulties affecting planting programmes during the war years had been overcome.  Unfortunately I cannot do so.  Despite widespread inquiries it was impossible to secure any supplies of rabbit netting last year.  As a result, the planting programme fell to a figure of 3,500 acres, the same as was achieved as far back as 1930-31.  Nevertheless during the six winters which have elapsed since 1939 we have been able to plant a total of 33,330 acres which, in the circumstances, is a creditable achievement.</P>
    <P>I would like to be able to assure the House that next winter will see an appreciable improvement but up to now, although small quantities of barbed wire and of wire netting have been secured, we can get no guarantee for the delivery of the quantities required for a 10,000 acres planting which could be achieved if sufficient fencing materials were obtainable.  Our reserves of that commodity are virtually exhausted.</P>
    <P>The difficulties of the past few years in securing adequate supplies of seed for the re-stocking of the nurseries have not yet disappeared.  It has not been possible to obtain the full quantities required from the United States, Canada or the Continent.  In Great Britain certain varieties of seed that were normally to be obtained appear to be in such short supply that export is prohibited.  To make up as far as possible for the shortage of imported seed, the collection of home grown seed has been pushed as vigorously as possible.  A second seed kiln has been set up by the Forestry Division to deal with the extraction and cleaning of the native seed.  The principal varieties collected were Oak, Beech, Sycamore, Chestnut, Japanese Larch, Scots Pine, Mountain Pine, Pinus Insignis and Pinus Contorta.</P>
    <P>Deputies may wonder why the Department cannot obtain from its own and other native woodlands all the seed required.  The collection of large quantities of suitable seed from our comparatively small and scattered woodlands is a difficult and expensive business.  Certain varieties are not obtainable at all and quality is a prime <Col N="1960" /> consideration.  It is of the utmost importance that seed should be taken from the best possible types of tree. The quality of the parent trees is reflected in the produce of their seed and few of our remaining trees of seed bearing age are perfect specimens of their kind.  We are keeping in close touch with all possible sources of supply and it is possible that by next season there will be an improvement.</P>
    <P>The net estimate for the current year represents an increase of £17,000 over the amount provided for 1945-'46.  The increase is due to additional provision for staff and to a reduction in the receipts estimated from the scales of mature timber.  The stocks of mature timber in the hands of the Forestry Division have been so heavily cut over during the past five years that little now remains to be put on the market. The amount provided for the purchase of land remains at the same figure as last year.  There is a slightly better outlook as regards the possibilities of securing land for planting.  A total of approximately 8,000 acres was acquired last year as against a total of 6,137 in the previous year and approximately 5,000 in the preceding year.  This rate of acquisition is more than sufficient to replace the areas planted in the same years.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the details under the different sub-heads of the Vote as set out in the printed estimates, I propose to refer only to items which show an appreciable difference from last year's figure, or which seem to call for special comment.</P>
    <P>Sub-head A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances, £34,647.  The increase required under this sub-head is to provide for the cost of the additional staffs to which I have referred already. Since the Estimates volume was printed, it has been decided to set up for the Forestry Division an accounts staff entirely separate from the staff dealing with the Land Commission accounts.  The change involves, in the main, only a transfer of staff from the Land Commission accounts branch. The establishment of a separate accounts branch for the Forestry Division will enable the Department to produce, for the first time, accounts for <Col N="1961" /> the forestry service on a commercial basis and that task will be commenced this year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C (1)&mdash;Acquisition of Land &mdash;Grant-in-Aid, £25,000.  The provision under this head has been maintained at the same figure as last year.  In introducing last year's Estimates, I mentioned the difficulties which had been encountered in efforts to purchase land held in common by a number of persons.  In the Forestry Bill, lately occupying the attention of the House, proposals have been made for simplifying the compulsory acquisition of such lands, but this is not to be taken as an indication that the Forestry Division intends to launch out upon a drastic scheme of compulsory purchases.  Purchase by agreement is and will remain the normal and desirable course.  Compulsion will be resorted to only in isolated cases such, for instance, as where a majority of persons concerned in the ownership or use of an area of land more fitted for planting than for any other use is willing to sell the interests at reasonable prices and the greed or obstinacy of one or two of the parties associated with the property stands in the way of the improved use of the land in the general interest.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that a balance of about £30,000 will be carried over in the Land Acquisition Fund from the year 1945-46 which, with the provision of £25,000 now requested, will make available for purchases during the year a sum of £55,000.</P>
    <P>Subject to the completion of the usual legal formalities, the Forestry Division has agreed to purchase, from private landowners, at a cost of £25,196, areas totalling 9,169 acres and from the Land Commission areas amounting to 585 acres, at a cost of £1,624.  In addition, negotiations are in an advanced stage for the purchase, from private owners, of about 4,239 acres, costing approximately £13,136. Negotiations are in progress for the purchase, from the Land Commission, of about 6,125 acres, valued tentatively at £21,270.  In short, the probable purchases as foreseen at present amount to 9,755 acres and the possible purchases to 10,364.  Some of the negotiations may never come to anything and <Col N="1962" /> others will take a considerable time before agreement is reached as to extent, boundaries and price, so that the sum of £55,000 will probably be sufficient to meet all payments that fall to be paid during this financial year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C (2)&mdash;Maintenance and Cultural Operations, £260,089.  The provision required under this sub-head represents a slight increase upon the amount voted last year.  It is based upon a planting programme of 6,000 acres, which it had been hoped to attain last year, but which could not be carried out, and even for next winter it is not at all certain that more than a small portion of this programme can be completed.  Everything depends on the quantity of fencing materials secured during the next six months and, to a certain extent, upon the date at which it is secured.  To prepare for a large planting programme, without an assurance that the required stocks of rabbit netting will be available, would involve the risk of wasting most of the expenditure involved, whilst on the other hand, the late arrival of supplies would not permit of the completion of the full programme.</P>
    <P>For some years past, the Forestry Division has been carrying out a programme of road-making in the forests in order to facilitate the extraction of timber and poles from thinning.  It is proposed to continue this work during the current year, and also to accelerate the work of thinning.  Many of the earlier plantations laid down by the Department are now in urgent need of thinning.  This work is of immense importance for the future of plantations, and must be done carefully and thoroughly, and though there is a limited local market for the produce, the disposal of all the poles thinned out may present a serious problem as the work expands.</P>
    <P>The building up of increased nursery stocks in preparation for extended planting programmes in future years is being continued in spite of difficulties in procuring adequate supplies of seed.  A change has been made in the form of the Estimate and nursery costs are now shown separately.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1963" /> The Department now has 16 portable cross-cutting outfits for use in the preparation of firewood blocks from lengths of inferior timber.  In view of recent pronouncements regarding the fuel situation, it seems probable that a demand for firewood in this form may be anticipated for many years to come and will provide a remunerative market for scrub and inferior timber which, in pre-war days, was practically unsaleable. The use of these outfits would be justified, even if the returns from the sale of the blocks showed only the smallest possible margin over the cost of conversion, as the inferior timber used for the purpose must be cut out in order to replant the ground with trees of a more valuable kind.  Most of the firewood blocks turned out find a ready local trade, both for domestic use and for the firing of threshing engines.  In some cases, where the local demand is not sufficient, the blocks are advertised for sale whenever a sufficient quantity has been accumulated, and are sold to the highest bidder subject, of course, to any limitations imposed by the maximum prices Orders.  There has been a reduction in the provision under this heading, as the Forestry Division has now an adequate number of machines on hand for some time to come.</P>
    <P>Sub-head D&mdash;Grants for Afforestation Purposes, £1,000.  Applications for the grant of £10 an acre which, under certain conditions, the Department is prepared to pay to assist private owners to undertake the planting of trees on their own lands, continue to be received in increasing numbers, but no increase in the provision for the payment of these grants is likely to be required this year.  Very little publicity has been given to this scheme in view of the difficulties which, unfortunately, still exist regarding supplies both of plants and of fencing materials, but when conditions return to normal this will be remedied, and I hope to see, not merely the replacement of woods cut down during the war, but a considerable extension of the woodlands and groves of trees on private lands.  From the scenic point of view, more can be done in this way to improve the amenities of the country <Col N="1964" /> than can ever be achieved by the planting of large areas of mountain land by the State.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E (2)&mdash;Exhibits at Shows, £75.  In the main the provision now asked for is to defray the cost of a forestry exhibit at the forthcoming Spring Show of the Royal Dublin Society.  This is a resumption of a pre-war practice and provides a valuable means of bringing to the notice of the public the regulations in regard to tree felling, the details of the grants payable etc.  Smaller exhibits may also be provided at other agricultural shows throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Sub-head H.&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid, £46,140.  It will be observed that a fall of £17,000 is anticipated in the revenue accounted for under this heading.  This is due almost entirely to the fact that, as a result of the heavy fellings of both commercial and firewood timber for the past five or six years, the woods have been so cut over that quantities remaining for sale are both small in size, inferior in quality and in many cases difficult of access.  Such a decrease had been expected last year but, in view of the desirability of getting to the market as much timber of building quality as possible, a number of additional lots were put up for sale which otherwise would have been held over till this year.</P>
    <P>During the past year, about 73 large lots of timber, comprising 59,408 trees, were advertised for sale and 51 smaller lots comprising 4,992 trees.  Seventeen lots of poles totalling 26,394 were also sold by auction.  Approximately 3,500 tons of firewood mainly in the form of blocks were sold by public advertisement in addition to about 5,500 tons sold locally in one or two cord lots.</P>
    <P>The number of felling notices received last year shows a slight decrease as compared with the previous year but is still considered higher than the pre-war average.  This position is likely to continue so long as the woodworking industries have to rely in the main on imported timber and so far as information on the point has reached the Forestry Division it seems unlikely that imported timber will be available in the near future in quantities sufficient <Col N="1965" /> to meet the demands of the building industry alone.</P>
    <P>Reports of breaches of the regulations in regard to tree-felling continue to be received, but in decreasing numbers and there appears to be a more general appreciation of the fact that the plea that timber is urgently required for one purpose or another does not justify indiscriminate felling.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last year that, in view of the shortage of plants and fencing materials, persons who found it impossible to carry out replanting conditions imposed upon them as a condition of consent to the felling of trees on their lands would be granted any reasonable extension of time, in order to allow them to carry out their obligations. Though the situation has eased slightly in the meantime, supplies are still both scarce and dear, and I am, therefore, prepared to renew the offer made last year.  I must, however, repeat again that postponement does not mean abandonment, and that eventually failure to carry out an undertaking to replant will be followed by prosecution. That is the whole account of forestry for the year and in view of the fact that the Dáil has discussed the Forestry Bill recently before the House I do not anticipate a long discussion now.</P>

      <P>The Minister has very lucidly set out the programme of his Department for the coming year. We appreciate very heartily the great interest which the Minister is taking in national afforestation and in the encouragement and extension of nurseries and the growing of trees around homesteads as shelter belts, not only for the intrinsic value of the timber, but also in view of the requirements of our national game of hurling.  Complaints are made of the scarcity of ash in many counties where hurling is the national game and it is to be hoped that a reasonable proportion of ash will be included in the programme.  The Minister pointed out that all aspects of the question have been dealt with already.  Undoubtedly, any expenditure by the Minister and by the Department on forestry should be encouraged because it will provide a valuable national asset.</P>

      <P>As the Minister stated, there is not much to be said on the Estimate, because everything was covered during the discussions on the Forestry Bill.  I notice that there is an inclination to make progress in the development of forestry and I look forward with a certain amount of hope to things moving faster in the years to come.  It is understood that during the coming year the machinery of the Forestry Bill cannot be put into operation, but we have the assurance of the Minister that progress will be made during the winter.</P>
      <P>This country is a long way behind with forestry development and no matter how fast we move in that direction now, very few members of this House will see the results.  When trees are planted we have to wait until they develop.  Some people say that the life of a tree is from 25 to 30 years and others say that it is from 50 to 60 years.  If we take it that the average life of a tree is 40 years, it is doubtful if any of the Deputies who are now interested will see any result of our present forestry proposals.  However, that should not deter us from getting on with the work.</P>
      <P>It is time now to give every encouragement to the Government to get on with the job.  If it were not for the forests that were planted in this country, even though they were planted by a foreign government at the expense of the Irish people and on land that our people should be living on, we would have been in a bad way in recent years for timber.  We had as good schemes of afforestation under the British Government as we had in recent years.  In the district in which I live local landlords boasted that they would grow trees instead of having chimney stacks on houses.  How well they succeeded can be seen by anybody who goes through the country. It is some consolation to know that some of the landlords who boasted in that way are not there now, but many of the chimney stacks and the trees are there.  I think much more land could be acquired for forestry without much trouble.</P>

      <P>The Department could move faster in the way of acquiring common or bog land during the coming year.  Trees can be grown with great advantage on poor land and on cut-away bog.  There are thousands of acres of such land in Mayo which are suitable for forestry if a move in that direction was made.  There will always be a market for timber.  As there is also a great scarcity of wood pulp at present, every country is developing forestry.  In future there should be no indiscriminate felling of trees, otherwise the country will be denuded of timber.  The scenic beauty of shelter belts has also been referred to.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister give an assurance that the men who are cutting the trees in the forests will get a living wage?  They are being paid about 38/- a week, which is not even up to the agricultural rate of wages. As a big sum of money is being included in the Estimate for wages, I wish to point out to the Minister that the men employed on forestry in my constituency state that they would not remain there if they could get other work, owing to the wages being so small.  They are the lowest paid men <Col N="1968" /> in the country.  Their wages are below those of agricultural workers and county council workers.</P>
      <P>If we are to have forestry, at least the people who go out to plant the trees in the woods in the wintertime should be looked after.  Sometimes they have to walk long distances to the woods from their homes.  During the emergency, they had no bicycle tyres and had to get there as best they could.  It is only right that this section of the people I represent, the workers, should get some consideration under any Bill brought into this House. Unfortunately, in all the Bills brought in, it is very seldom a fair wage clause is inserted, except in the case of building contracts.  While the farmers are paying £2 a week, the State pays 38/-. That is a very bad procedure to set before the people who are footing the bill, the ratepayers all over the country, including those workers.  If they cannot get a living wage out of forestry or agriculture or any other industry, the industry is no good to that section of the people.  I appeal to the Minister to give me some guarantee that he will consider the wages of those people who have no bonus.  The industrial workers can get £3 or £4 a week and a cost-of-living bonus of 15/-. These men should be considered for a higher rate of wages, or the bonus should be applied to them.</P>

      <P>In regard to the agricultural shows, I imagine it would help very much if the Minister could arrange that, at all our shows in the country, especially in rural areas, there would be an exhibition which would interest the people in forestry.  Until we get the people forestry-minded, so that they themselves will try to do a little, we will never get to the pitch we hope to reach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a little too much to be expecting the Forestry Department to plant this, <Col N="1969" /> that and the other.  If we could get our people to think in that direction, there would be much greater progress in a very short time.  If the Department would consider the shows in the rural areas and send exhibits there, they would make progress, perhaps, as fast as some of us, including the Minister, would wish.  The Minister says he hopes to see the replacement of all the woods which were cut down.  I hope to see the same thing, but I am afraid it is only a hope and nothing more, as I am afraid we will never see it in our days at the rate we are going.  I do not blame the Department, as I know what they had to contend with in the last couple of years and I know also that, in the coming year, the progress cannot be anything like what it should be.  I regret to say that I feel I will never see the day when all those woods will be replaced and replanted.</P>
    <P>If I am not out of order, I would like to bring to the Minister's attention a matter concerning my own area.  It was before the Department's officials a few times last year.  The Minister should seriously consider certain areas, such as I have in mind, where the Department took over for forestry portion of land just beside a town, where the people were crying out for a park. That happened in the case of the Mountbellew Estate in County Galway and it was unfair.  Of course, it is all right saying with one side of your mouth that you should encourage forestry and acquire land for it and then, on the other side, saying you should not have acquired some piece of land which was taken over.  I realise that, but where people require a plot of ground beside a town for use, say, as a cow park, it should not be acquired for forestry.  There is quite a lot of suitable land elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Commons that every class of bogland and wasteland is going to grow trees.  It is not, in my opinion; the better the land, the better for the plantation.  However, in the Mountbellew case, that plantation was not the success it should have been and that was pointed out to the Department.  Still, the Department felt otherwise about it&mdash;that it was a success.  It is planted a few years now <Col N="1970" /> and it is not a success.  Of course, I know well it is not suitable for officials to say that some plantation of their own is not a success.  There certainly was a case of hardship as regards Mountbellew.</P>
    <P>Regarding the exhibits at the shows, the greatest thing the Department could do would be to get the people forestry-minded, as if we are dependent on the Department and the Minister we will never make the progress we hope to make in our time.  If we can get the people thinking and feeling in that way, so that they would strain a point to have some little plantations of their own here and there, it would be for their own benefit later on, or for those coming after them, and would beautify the countryside.  By that means, we may go towards the position the Minister said he hopes to see, where many of the woods that were hewed down will be replaced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that, from 1937 to 1946, the Estimate for Forestry has been about doubled.  However, I feel that the amount allotted is not sufficient.  I look upon forestry, not in the light that Deputy Donnellan looks upon it, as I believe the Department should be responsible for it and that it should not be left to the private individual.  I do not object to any private individual planting a few trees alongside his home for shelter, but the idea that we should encourage individuals to plant shelter-beds and that forestry should be looked upon from the beauty point of view, does not seem sound to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look on forestry from the point of view of the benefit it is going to bring to the country.  I would hope that in 20 of 30 years' time it will be a great industry, giving employment to thousands of young men and old men. I believe that we have millions of acres of land that are suitable for afforestation and that are not suitable for cultivation or grazing.  Experts will tell you that, on the western seaboard of Connaught, forestry will not be a success due to the hard winds from the Atlantic.  Other experts say that the outer belts of trees, if they do not reach a height of five feet, will remain <Col N="1971" /> static and may go back, but that the inner planting will succeed and will mature.  While the failure of the outer belt may be considered a loss, it may also be considered as a sort of protection for the inner planting.  It has afforded the inner belt protection against the hard winds.  In that way the successes far offset the failures due to hard winds and climatic conditions. The Department should not be afraid to take a chance.  They may not think it wise to run the risk of a loss of £500,000 or £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 in going ahead with a big scheme of forestry.  I do not believe that if a big scheme was embarked upon we would have a dead loss.</P>
    <P>The reason given for the moss found in the bogs is that timber was grown in them some hundreds of years ago. Some of the experts say that the moss would kill a plantation if put in the bogs.  Other experts hold different views.  I believe that a country denuded of forests is just as bad as a country denuded of its people.  I am very interested in this forestry question, because I believe that if it were tackled properly it would help to solve our unemployment problem.  I think that the Department should face it courageously, and that, even if there was a dead loss of £2,000,000, the Government would not be blamed.  I think that a big scheme such as I have in mind would get the backing of every Party in the Dáil, and that if money were lost we would not ask where it went.  Now that the war is over, and that wire and other equipment should be available shortly, I think we should make preparations for a larger production.  Afforestation should be undertaken on a national scale and not be left to individuals or groups of individuals.</P>
    <P>If that were done our ports and sawmills would soon be busy once again.  Timber can now be used for more than roofing and the making of furniture.  By the application of scientific processes, it can be used for almost anything.  It is a schame, I think, that we have to depend for our timber requirements on the Scandinavian countries, on the South American <Col N="1972" /> States and on Russia.  The experts tell us that we cannot grow trees in our bogs.  Others hold the opposite view, and I agree with them that we can. We find the roots of trees in the bogs so that hundreds of years ago these bogs were great forests.  If the bogs were properly drained they would grow trees again.  In conclusion, I urge on the Department to embark on a large-scale afforestation scheme, not a few hundred or a few thousand acres, but on the embracing millions of acres.  If we are able to provide ourselves with the timber that we require, then we will be in a position to have hives of industry in the country, with consequent employment and security for the people within the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that we had a debate recently on the Forestry Bill, it is not my intention to go over the same ground again. Deputy Cafferky has raised a very important question, namely, why we should not go out on a much wider scheme of afforestation than that indicated by the Minister, and be prepared to consider it in terms of tens of thousands of acres rather than in terms of thousands of acres.  I think there is a lot to be said for the Deputy's point of view.  If we are going to have a Forestry Department it ought to be a commercially paying proposition, and if it is it will not be any burden on the taxpayer.  We ought to hope to reach the condition of affairs when our State forests will become an asset to the State, a source of revenue to it rather than something which has to supported out of taxation. That raises the question as to how long the taxpayer will have to go on making contributions towards afforestation, as to when the point is likely to be reached when afforestation will become a source of national revenue. I would like to get some definite information on that point from the Minister: that is, whether he envisages that within a reasonable period of years the State forests will become a source of revenue.  If the Minister believes that they will, as I think he must, then he should be prepared to plan afforestation on the basis of a national loan, because it would <Col N="1973" /> certainly seem that the taxpayer of the present day should not be heavily burdened in order to produce a high revenue for future generations.  If the Minister believes that afforestation can be made a source of revenue to the State, as it must if it is a success, then he should not hesitate to borrow practically the whole of the capital required for the acquisition of land for planting.  It could be arranged on a long-term loan, payable when the plantations had reached maturity.</P>
      <P>I think I was misunderstood&mdash;I am sure I was not deliberately misrepresented&mdash;when I talked about the difficulty which the ordinary farmer had in undertaking planting to any extent worth speaking of.  I believe it is possible for the individual farmer to provide shelter belts on his farm on little pieces of waste land, such as in the corners of fields, but I think that is as far as he can go.  The idea of the ordinary farmer planting two acres or three acres on inferior land which happens to be on his farm is not one that, I think, can be entertained with any great confidence.  There may be a few farmers through the country who could undertake that work, but the most that the average farmer could undertake to plant would be a few perches here and there in the corners of fields.  That will not make much change in the number of trees in the country or the amount of land under plantations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know from experience that farmers are tending more and more to remove trees from hedgerows, Farmers do not want trees between fields which they have under cultivation.  In the old days the good landlords&mdash;and there was quite a number of them&mdash;did go out for plantation on a fairly large scale. In many cases they planted hard wood timber.  You see the trees to-day all over the country in the hedgerows, but the farmers of to-day do not bless the landlords who did that.  They rather curse them, I think, for their energy and enterprise, because these trees are a source of injury to all crops, even to permanent pasture.  Therefore, the countryside will be more and more denuded of hedgerow timber.  It is therefore necessary to do as Deputy Donnellan has suggested, that is, to <Col N="1974" /> encourage farmers to plant shelter belts where they would not be harmful to crops, that is, in corners of fields or in waste portions of their land.  I want again to appeal to the Minister to accept the view that we can never get the millions of acres of forests that we talk about unless we are prepared to plant small areas of from four to ten acres all over the country.  I should like to take the Minister to see a part of my constituency that is not extensively planted, that is, West Wicklow from Poulaphouca to Baltinglass. There are steep gradients there in more or less agricultural areas.  They are not very extensive but would aggregate to hundreds of acres.  They are in isolated areas of three to eight acres.  They are practically no use for grazing or agricultural purposes but would make excellent plantations and, if planted, would transform the appearance of the countryside in addition to providing a valuable commodity that is so urgently needed for industry and domestic purposes.  The Minister ought to consider that.</P>
    <P>I believe that compulsory acquisition is not necessary on a wide scale.  It may be necessary, in order to complete a particular afforestation scheme in a particular area, to acquire certain land compulsorily but in the main land will be acquired by voluntary agreement and, if it were possible to get farmers to agree to part with small portions of waste land on their holdings and allow the Forestry Department to take them over and plant them, that would make a valuable contribution to the scheme of afforestation and would distribute timber more widely over the country. At the present time the tendency is to concentrate on particular areas and the larger the better.  I suppose that is sound economy but, from a national point of view, it is desirable that woodlands should be spread far and wide throughout the length and breadth of the country.  While the objections that have been raised to that suggestion are real, they can be surmounted. There is, of course, the objection that it is more difficult to supervise and manage scattered plantations but there are advantages to be gained, first, that such land might be acquired more cheaply than a large acreage in one <Col N="1975" /> area, secondly, that there might be more co-operation on the part of the local community, and thirdly, the beautifying of the countryside.  These are matters that ought to be considered. There is another point which I have often raised, that is, the comparative value of land used for sheep-grazing and land used for afforestation. Some definite figure should be given in regard to that.  I forget at the moment the figure which the Minister gave in that connection but I do not accept it.</P>

      <P>We touched on it at any rate but I would like the Minister when replying to say that in his reference to the value of land for sheep-grazing he had in mind some particular type of land.  It is quite obvious that one acre of land may be worth only 3/- or 4/- a year for sheep-grazing while another acre, required for planting, may be worth £3 or £4 a year.  It is very hard to lay down a hard and fast rule and to strike an average.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us what is going to happen to the land on the Moore-Hall demesne that was provisionally taken over for afforestation purposes.  Is it intended to use all the agricultural land on the Ashford demesne for afforestation purposes?  I am fully in favour of afforestation&mdash;I agree with Deputy Cafferky to that extent&mdash;but I cannot forget that the overriding consideration in a county like Mayo is land distribution and acquisition.  Where the Forestry Department acquires even what might be considered inferior agricultural land it is bound to clash with local public opinion.  Before acquiring land they would want to be sure of their ground and to ascertain that there would be no local opposition. There are parts of County Mayo which, if subjected to intensive reclamation, could be converted for afforestation purposes but, even in the mountainy districts in Mayo, there is rough, inferior grazing, which might in other counties be considered as ideally suitable for afforestation but which would <Col N="1976" /> be the subject of local opposition if taken over by the Forestry Department. The people there have such a sense of the value of their land that they would look with jealousy and suspicion on anything that might encroach on what they would consider their right to have it for grazing. I disagree with Deputy Cafferky when he says that no encouragement should be given to the private planter.  I think every encouragement should be given to the private planter.  There is no use, however, in going on the basis of the old landlords in the way of planting, because they did not plant for commercial reasons.  They planted trees to beautify their demesnes and grounds. That was their chief idea.  They did not plant trees as a cash crop.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry that the Deputies who sit on this side of the House are not here.  I know that some Deputies who are not here are interested in certain amendments on the Order Paper.  I should like to make my position clear.  I was in the House, with Deputy Pattison, when these Deputies left the House.  I think if any Deputies have a grievance it is those Deputies who come from the country.  We book a room in a hotel for a certain time and if we are kept here beyond that time the room may not be available.  I am surprised that Dublin Deputies who are on the spot should object to remaining in this House.  We were all elected by the people to the Dáil and it is a pity that we have only a few Deputies present to discuss this most important Bill and to safeguard the interests of the people. I am very sorry that I am the only Deputy on this side of the House, although my colleague, Deputy <Col N="1977" /> Pattison, is in the building.  Yesterday we were informed by the Government that the Dáil would adjourn to-day.  That should not have been changed overnight.  I hope that in future Deputies from the country will be notified of what is going to take place in regard to the sittings of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Driscoll said, these jubilee nurses do very good work in our towns and cities.  They are supported by ladies who raise subscriptions for their association.  They give great service in the nursing of the poor and, in some cases, bringing them extra comforts.  I hope that under this section they will not be thrown on the scrap heap.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary, who is a professional man, will see that their work is not interfered with.  As to the dispensary midwives, I think that their position should be improved, because they are rendering very useful service.  If the services of a midwife are not available there is the danger of two lives being lost.  I hope, therefore, that under this Bill their conditions will be improved.</P>
      <P>Every encouragement should be given to young girls to take up nursing. Under this Bill a lot more nurses will be needed.  At present young girls are going to hospitals in Great Britain to be trained as nurses.  We should do all we can to encourage them and to help them to be trained at home.  At present if a young girl wishes to become a nurse there is no prospect for her except her parents can pay a fee for her training.  I should like to have provision made so that these girls could be trained without having to pay a fee to a hospital.  If the Parliamentary Secretary could do something to encourage such girls to take up nursing it would be a very good thing for the country.  I think there is some doubt amongst people outside about some of the powers being taken under certain sections of this Bill.</P>

These girls from the Gaeltacht would, by reason of their natural knowledge of the language, be very suitable for appointments in these districts, and they would be spared the initial difficulty of having to acquire the language while performing their duties.  I know that the Parliamentary Secretary is very sympathetic in this matter and takes a very keen interest in the nursing scheme which his Department operates, but the voluntary nursing associations are, in the main, the people who provide nursing facilities for the districts to which I refer.</P>

I cannot see, as was suggested by Deputy O'Leary, that any steps are being taken to interfere with the rights of members of the Jubilee Nursing Association in the discharge of their duties in the various districts.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary realises fully that the work done by these nurses in <Col N="1979" /> the different centres has been very valuable.  He realises that they have a very difficult job to perform and that they deal with the poorer sections, for whom we all have great sympathy. They have certainly done more than their share to comfort and assist these people in every possible way, and I would strongly oppose any action which might lead to a curtailment of the activities of these nurses.</P>
      <P>I have known these nurses to make calls as often as twice and three times a day to the houses of labouring men or agricultural workers in cases where there was serious illness in the family, and, in my own area, I know that these nurses have done great work and have brought very great comfort into the homes of working-class people. Furthermore, in the case of old age pensioners or other old people, who, on account of a certain amount of pride for which they must be respected, do not desire to end their days in the county home or other institution, and who remain at home to be cared for by a son or daughter residing with them, it is sometimes very difficult to deal with them, if they are undergoing a long illness in bed, and these nurses do very valuable work in these cases and they give as good assistance as any person in the medical profession could give. Very often the other persons in the household are not qualified to deal with a person who may be suffering from a long illness and who may become difficult to cater for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of these nurses is very much appreciated by all sections and I should be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would give consideration to providing that, where a sanitary authority appoints a nurse&mdash;and there is nothing to compel a sanitary authority to do so; they may or they may not&mdash;they will be compelled to pay a certain high rate of salary, so that that nurse will be able to give all her mind to the discharge of the duties she has to carry out in the district to which she is assigned.  As Deputy O'Leary has pointed out, nurses are very badly paid and the manner in which they have been paid is, I think, a downright disgrace to the Parliamentary <Col N="1980" /> Secretary's Department.  They are a section we cannot do without and a section which should be put in a position in which they will be able to live up to their responsibilities and to meet the high cost-of-living.  They should be in receipt of such remuneration as will enable them to live in decency and to perform their duties with satisfaction to everybody, and without having to depend on any allowance which they may get from a patient or the relatives of a patient.  If such nurses are to be appointed, provision should be included in the Bill whereby the sanitary authority appointing them will be required to pay them a decent wage.</P>

      <P>I approve of this amendment.  In certain parts of my constituency where these nurses carry out duties, they have rendered very valuable service to the community and I cannot see anything in the section, or in any other section of the Bill, which is designed to interfere in any way with any voluntary service.  The section says: &ldquo;may appoint or provide&rdquo;. I think that is pretty plain, and I cannot see any reason for the alarm which some Deputies seem to feel with regard to interference with jubilee nurses.  It might be well for us to throw our minds back and to recall the reason for the bringing into existence of the jubilee nurses.  These nurses were brought into existence <Col N="1981" /> following Queen Victoria's Jubilee as a beneficial service to the poorer community of this country, but the necessity for their appointment arose from the impositions of the conqueror and the economic system then operating in this country, and I would welcome the time when the necessity for such organisations had passed from our midst. The Parliamentary Secretary is doing nothing to interfere with the continuance of this service.  As a matter of fact, it is the duty of the local authority to provide such services.  In one part of my constituency&mdash;the town of Drogheda&mdash;the jubilee nurses have been replaced by the Ladies' Nursing Association.  So far as I can see, there is nothing in this Bill which will interfere with these voluntary services. There may be some overlapping.  That may be all to the good so long as the rates are not unduly mulcted.  Deputy Flanagan seems to have a short memory regarding the increased salaries for nurses.  It was the Parliamentary Secretary who introduced legislation not very long ago to provide increased salaries for nursing staffs&mdash; increases which were long overdue. These are considerations to which Deputies should attend before they jump to hasty conclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I might remind the House that Section 96 cannot operate, nor is it intended to operate, to divest any nursing organisations of the functions they at present exercise.  Section 96 states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A sanitary authority may appoint, for their sanitary district or a particular part thereof, a nurse to give advice and assistance on matters relating to health and to assist sick persons.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far from having any intention of depriving the people of any existing nursing service, the policy behind Section 96 implies very definitely an extension of the nursing services we have at present.  When we were discussing the mother and child scheme, I pointed out more than once that, when this Bill became law, it was intended to provide a nursing service in every dispensary district.  The provision <Col N="1982" /> of such a service is completely beyond the scope of any voluntary organisation.  I do not deny&mdash;nobody could truthfully deny&mdash;that voluntary nursing organisations have done tremendous work in this country. I submit that, regardless of any scheme of organisation that the local authorities and the central authorities may bring into operation and regardless of how we can organise our people for the protection of their health, there will always be scope in this country or in any civilised Christian country for voluntary effort.  That voluntary effort will always be welcome because, in so far as the effort is voluntary, in so far as Christian charity in the true sense is exercised, in so far as people voluntarily tax themselves for the relief of the distress of their fellowmen, that relief is much more acceptable than the relief we provide when, in the exercise of our statutory powers, we extract money from the people for the same purpose.  That is my outlook on the voluntary nature of the service.</P>
    <P>Our problem in the future will not be one of trying to get rid of nurses. Our problem will be to find sufficient nurses to man our services.  When one contemplates the provision of sanatoria in the early future with 2,100 beds, one must realise at once that a very big demand will be made upon the nursing organisation to supply the necessary nursing personnel.  When we couple with that the policy of the Bill before the House of providing a domiciliary nursing service in every dispensary district, we realise at once that the comparatively early future will necessitate the provision of probably over 600 additional nurses for the public health services, so that there cannot be any question of nurses being deprived of their means of living.  I ardently hope that when the time comes we shall be able to find the nurses in reasonable time to bring the services provided in the Bill into complete operation throughout the whole of the State.  I believe it will take time&mdash; probably a number of years&mdash;to train and recruit the necessary nursing personnel to give full effect to the public health policy which has inspired this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1983" /> Apart from the considerations that have been mentioned here by Deputies, who have very properly paid tribute to the result of the domiciliary nursing services that have been provided in certain remote areas, I ask Deputies to appreciate that extension of that service throughout the whole of the State must inevitably bring about an easing of the pressure on our institutional accommodation.  The tendency even 20 years ago was to remain at home when ill.  Deputies who are not so old will recollect that, even within comparatively recent times, the doctor's principal difficulty was that he could not get his patient to go to hospital because the patient had not the confidence in our local institutions that he has now.  We have practically gone the full cycle now.  By reason of the standard of the service we are providing in our institutions, we are being faced with the difficulty of providing sufficient accommodation in the hospitals. In so far as the nursing service will operate to induce people who do not require specialised service to remain at home during minor illnesses, it will be an ultimate economy, because the cost of maintaining a patient in hospital who might be equally well treated at home amounts to a substantial figure per week.  When I say that, do not let anybody suggest that we have in mind nursing anybody at home who should more properly be treated in hospital.  Sensible Deputies will agree with me that the tendency has now swung too far in the other direction.  Everybody wants to get into hospital and, if everybody gets into hospital, it will be an expensive business to maintain these institutions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan complains that Section 96 is not mandatory.  It is refreshing to hear that.  During the past three weeks, from day to day, I was attacked by the Opposition.  That was because of the powers of direction to be exercised by the Minister to the local authorities in respect of matters concerning not only the health of the people but the lives of the people.</P>
    <P>We have had epithets thrown across the House at the Government and the Party behind it.  We have had talk about Fascism, dictatorship and so on, <Col N="1984" /> because we take the necessary powers to ensure that the laws made in the people's Parliament will be obeyed, and that any policy the Government, democratically and freely elected by the people, may determine in the interest of the health of the community, will be made effective and that if there is any recalcitrant local authority, steps will be taken to bring that local authority into line.  That can be translated into dictatorship, if the principal Opposition want to use the proposals put before the House in relation to the provision of nurses, the provision of institutions or any other health service, for a purely political purpose, but Deputies who are taking a proper view of this matter, who view the provisions of this Bill from the point of view of the greater good of the greater number, will agree with me that if a policy has been decided on for the general good, it should be made to apply uniformly.  While we have not taken powers of direction in relation to the provision of nurses, of it is necessary to put pressure on local authorities to make the provision operative, I am quite sure that that pressure will be exercised and I do not care whether they call that dictatorship or not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bartley raised the question of Gaeltacht nurses and Gaeltacht services.  Deputy Bartley is aware that so far as it is possible to achieve it, we are trying to provide Irish-speaking nurses for the Gaeltacht and that a preference is given to such nurses for appointments in the Gaeltacht but it is not always possible to have the necessary trained personnel avialable He realises that that is Government policy and that his particular local authority, so far as the Gaeltacht area is concerned, is co-operating with us to some extent in the operation of that policy.  I think that his question relates more to the voluntary organisations. In the matter of sending Irish speaking nurses to the Gaeltacht we have not exercised any powers of direction towards these voluntary organisations, but they know Government policy in the matter and we would expect them to do anything that lies in their power to make Government <Col N="1985" /> policy in this regard operate satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>As to the ultimate position of these voluntary nursing organisations, I am not sufficient of a prophet to be able to indicate to the House what the position may be in five, seven or ten years but I do say that our immediate problem will be to provide nursing services corresponding to the services which the jubilee nurses are providing throughout the rest of the country. It seems to me probable that the future must see the absorption of these nurses into the local authority services but that is a matter we need not concern ourselves about now.  It is a development that cannot take place for some considerable time.</P>

      <P>I was waiting for the Parliamentary Secretary to make his statement, because I was anxious to have clearly outlined what the functions of the nurses will be under this section.  The section is a very short one, but it is very wide and general in its terms.  It seeks to provide nurses to give advice and assistance relating to matters of health and to assist sick persons.  I am anxious to know what classes of persons will be attended by these nurses.  What classes of persons will it be the duty of these nurses to attend?  It will, I know, be the duty of these nurses to attend mothers and children up to the age of 16 years under another section in the Bill. I assume it will also be the duty of the nurses to attend persons other than mothers and children who are dependent upon the dispensary medical service&mdash;that is, poorer persons.  I put down an amendment to another section of the Bill but, unfortunately, I was not in the House when it was reached and I did not get time to move it.  I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary accepted it, but I should like to make it the duty of such nurses, and also the duty of doctors, to attend aged and infirm persons who are living alone and have no one to take charge of them.  Such persons might not be dispensary cases if they own a small amount of land.  Nevertheless, they would be in a very peculiar and helpless position.  I am just wondering if <Col N="1986" /> this section will enable nurses to attend them.</P>

      <P>No.  The Deputy need not labour the matter.  It does not cover such persons, apart from persons who are entitled to public assistance under the Public Assistance Acts.  This is a public health measure, mainly confined, so far as the nursing services are concerned, to mothers and children. Nursing services can also be made available to public assistance classes by the local authority.  Other classes, except those affected by the tuberculosis scheme, are not included.</P>

      <P>The section to which I am referring would be a rather narrow section but, at the same time, such a system would be urgently desirable. Such people might not think it necessary to call in medical aid.  You might have an old person living alone, who would be a more or less chronic invalid. If those persons were to call in medical aid, it would mean paying for such assistance and they might not feel that they required it.  I feel that the medical officer or the district nurse would certainly know if they required assistance, if these poor people were in the position in which they might at any time lose their lives by reason of lack of attention.  I think that if it was at all possible to extend the scope of the Bill to such persons the Parliamentary Secretary ought to consider it.  It would be particularly necessary in rural areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 150:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) Where land is available a sanitary authority shall provide recreation grounds suitable for such games as football or hurling adjacent <Col N="1987" /> to all primary schools for the use of the pupils of such schools.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that, where land is available, it shall be the duty of a sanitary authority to provide recreation grounds attached to primary schools in all areas.  I think there is no need to labour the desirability of having such a provision in the Bill.  We all know that a great number of our primary schools have no accommodation for outdoor games.  In many cases children have to play on the public roads.  In other cases we find them, during the lunch interval, sheltering around by the walls, shivering with the cold, perhaps, and that is not a desirable state of affairs.</P>
    <P>I think nobody can underestimate the value of well-regulated outdoor games for children.  They are just as much a source of education as anything the children may learn in the schools, particularly if the games are well-regulated and conducted according to the rules.  The ability to take part in one of these outdoor games, particularly national games such as football and hurling, not only develops the physical health of the children, but it develops their characters, it gives them confidence and assurance and I think it is a help to them from every aspect in facing the battle of life.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should not hesitate to accept the amendment. In the section there is considerable provision made for the acquisition of land for recreational purposes.  In this amendment we are seeking to do what Deputy Flanagan pointed out in regard to other sections, and that is, to provide a definite direction to the local authority to make such land available.</P>
    <P>It might be contended that the acceptance of this amendment would place a severe additional burden upon the finances of the local authority.  I believe the problem to be faced is not so much a problem of finance as of power to acquire the necessary lands. The amount of land required will not be extensive, but it might be difficult to acquire it without legal power.  I believe that local areas, the parish or school areas, where such land is provided, <Col N="1988" /> will be quite happy to pay the cost, or a very substantial amount.  In many cases local authorities make separate charges with respect to expenditure of this kind.  I think the people in the local area will be prepared, in most cases, to put up a portion of the cost by way of subscription, as in the case of the building of schools.  Whatever cost is involved, it will be more than offset by the saving achieved in the better health of our growing population and in the realisation that a healthier population will not be as great a burden on our institutional services as at present.</P>

      <P>I have the feeling that Deputy Cogan is shoving an open door in this matter.  Being a representative of a local health authority.  I may say that in our case we have already done what Deputy Cogan asks us in this amendment to do.  We have provided playgrounds and football fields for the children of the town. Some of the smaller provincial towns have done so, too.  I am not quite satisfied that the public health authority will have to get specific power under this Bill in order to do that.  I would be very much surprised if the Parliamentary Secretary informed us that we have not got that power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I might, perhaps, point out that the power set out in Section 97 is a very extensive power.  The sanitary authority may provide facilities for games or other recreation and for that purpose may, in particular, do all or any of the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) acquire land in their district or at a convenient distance therefrom,</P>
      <P>(b) appropriate land held by them which is not required for the purpose for which it is held,</P>
      <P>(c) themselves manage any land so acquired or appropriated,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d) provide equipment, appliances, boats, animals and other things for <Col N="1989" /> games or recreation on any land so acquired or appropriated and make charges for the use of such things,</P>
    <P>(e) let any land so acquired or appropriated to any person for use for games or other recreation,</P>
    <P>(f) contribute, subject to such conditions (if any) as they think proper, to the provision of land in their district or at a convenient distance therefrom for use for games or other recreation and to the provision of equipment for games or other recreation on any such land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is very interesting to hear Deputies telling us that we are not doing enough about anything.  Once again the Opposition urges me to make it obligatory on the local authority, if the land is available, to provide playgrounds in connection with schools.  I anticipate that if ever the main Opposition Party comes back to the House, there will be a split in the camp; that the members of the Farmers' Party and of the National Labour Party will keep urging me to drive and direct and insist that local authorities will perform all their functions under this Bill.  If the people who will once again, presumably, occupy the benches opposite, accuse me of dictatorship should I exercise these powers, I look forward to protection and assistance from the Farmers' Party and the National Labour Party and the Independents, because, of course, Deputy Flanagan will assist me, too.</P>
    <P>I think we have gone a long distance in this section in so far as we are providing the statutory machinery for making available these recreation facilities to which I have referred.  I do not deny that the provision of recreation ground in the immediate vicinity of our elementary schools, and of our secondary schools for that matter, is very desirable.  Nobody will deny that.  But it is the function and duty of the educational authorities to provide that facility and not the function or the duty of the local authorities, acting either of their own volition or at the direction of the Minister. Hence, I think it would be desirable that members who have strong and enlightened views on this matter should <Col N="1990" /> make their views known to the education authorities concerned, particularly when they set out to acquire a new site, so that in acquiring the site for a new school the necessary recreation ground will be included in the site, if it is available.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will, presumably, exercise the powers conferred by this section in an intelligent way, and with a view to providing the greatest possible facilities for the people of their district, whether they be school children or adults.  Consequently, one would anticipate that local authorities, in exercise of the powers conferred upon them by this section, will proceed to acquire a site, if it can be acquired convenient to a school, so that the children attending can have the use of a playground that is also available to adults.  The intelligent members of local authorities will take these matters into consideration.  But, it will be found, as Deputies who recall their earlier days realise, that a pitch which would be suitable for hurling, football and games in which the adult members of the community participate, may not be available anywhere near a school site.  Local authorities, when spending the ratepayers' money in the provision of this amenity will naturally try to ensure that they should provide them with a facility that would be of some immediate benefit to them.  Their primary consideration will be to acquire a pitch.  If, well and good, it cannot be provided in the immediate a double purpose is served.  If is cannot be provided in the immediate vicinity of a school, we can scarcely ask local authorities to provide a playing pitch for adults, and, in addition, a sports ground for every school in their district.  I do not think it would be reasonable to ask them.  Where a new site has been acquired for a school, and where land is available, a smaller area that would provide the necessary recreation facilities for children ought to be acquired.  That is not a matter for this Bill.  It is one for the Minister for Education or for the managers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Public Health Bill and the Parliamentary Secretary realises that the health of the <Col N="1991" /> children is our greatest concern.  I am sure he will admit that when he goes to rural areas he finds schools and within ten yards of the foundation there is a high wall, inside which the children have to remain from 10 o'clock in the morning until they leave at 3.30 in the evening.  The Parliamentary Secretary will admit that that is not good for the health of the children, and that it will not help them to be stronger.  As to compulsion, I hold that we should go to any length in order to improve the standard of health of our people.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to a certain Party which left the House coming back, and spoke about a split. I know nothing about any co-operation. Any Party in this House can do what it likes.  That is their look-out.  The Party to which I have the honour to belong, I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary, is not led by the nose by any Party in this House.  We have independent minds.  The Parliamentary Secretary stated that there is a hope for this proposal when new schools are being erected.  It is happening to-day. The Land Commission in some parts of my constituency have helped in a few places by giving pieces of land for play-grounds. Deputy Killilea will confirm that.  However, it must be remembered that it would take years to deal with the question, and that we would have to wait until new schools are erected before getting additional land for such a purpose.</P>
      <P>The case has been made that a playing pitch for a school should be a first class one.  I do not agree with that. Children of 12 or 14 years of age do not require first class playing fields for hurling or for football.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary is looking too far ahead, when he suggests that these playing fields should be of standard size.  Children would not require such a standard in play-grounds.  As regards pitches for adults there is hardly a parish that has not a good playing field.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the amendment in the interests of the health of the children.  If children are kept for hours inside school walls that does not tend to improve their health, either in rural areas or in cities.</P>

    <P>The object of this amendment is to ensure that the officer of a health authority who has reasonable grounds for believing that a person has contravened a provision of the Public Health Acts, regulations or by-laws which he is authorised to enforce shall before asking such person's name and address inform such person in regard to such contravention of the provisions of the Acts, regulations or by-laws.

The effect of this amendment is to ensure that in such a case the officer of the health authority shall not apply to such person the powers granted in sub-section (3) of the Bill.

      <P>I move amendment No. 204:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete paragraph 3 and substitute the following new paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.  The requiring of adult persons to submit themselves, or the parents of children to submit such children, to specified measures in relation to <Col N="1999" /> the protection or immunisation of such adult persons or children against a particular infectious disease.</P>
    <P>In the Second Schedule powers are given to make regulations, and the particular matters in respect of which regulations may be made are set out in the Schedule.  Heading 3 of the Schedule sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The requiring of adult persons to submit themselves, or the parents of children to submit such children, to a specified treatment in order either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) to protect or immunise such adult persons or children against a particular infectious disease, or</P>
    <P>(b) to prevent such adult persons or children from infecting others with a particular infectious disease.</P>
    <P>The House has very fully discussed the matters involved in the Schedule, as drafted.  Various unreasonable interpretations have been put upon this heading, which is set out in the Second Schedule.  The suggestion was made, with an air of seriousness, that within the powers set out here the most drastic measures might be taken in respect of a patient who was a probable source of infection, in order to ensure that the infection might not be transmitted to another person.  Deputies who were then on the opposite benches asked the public to believe that we had in contemplation the removal of organs vital and otherwise. Well, there never was any intention to operate the powers in that way, and, in fact. there was nothing in the powers under heading 3 that was not already in the existing law.  As I pointed out to the House, when we met the principle involved in this on an earlier stage of the Bill, the regulations that had been signed by Deputy Mulcahy himself. when he was Minister for Local Government in 1929, empowered a medical officer to take such steps as were necessary or desirable for the purpose of, amongst other things, preventing the spread of an infectious disease.  He could take such steps as were desirable, if he considered it desirable or necessary, <Col N="2000" /> to remove vital organs; he had statutory power to do so, under Deputy Mulcahy&rdquo;s own signature. I am not finding any fault with the power, but I am finding fault with the suggestion that the present Government was embarking on a policy that would only be operated in some of those totalitarian States that we hear so much about.  That type of criticism can scarcely be accepted as honest in the light of the powers that Deputy Mulcahy himself gave over his own signature when he was Minister for Local Government to the officers responsible for the control of infectious diseases.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of public curiosity was created following the misrepresentation that occurred in regard to these powers, and in order that there could be no question or no doubt in the mind of anybody that the powers that we are proposing to exercise were merely precautionary powers to prevent the spread of disease, and did not include either medical treatment, as such, or an operation of any kind on the patients themselves, amendment No. 204 has been circulated.  It is to be taken in combination with amendment No. 211. Amendment No. 204 empowers the Minister to make regulations</P>
    <P>&ldquo;requiring of adult persons to submit themselves, or the parents of children to submit such children, to specified measures in relation to the protection or immunisation of such adult persons or children against a particular infectious disease.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The measures to which they would be called upon to submit are restricted to the measures that may be necessary for immunisation purposes, and in order that there could be no misunderstanding about the matter, a further Ministerial amendment has already been introduced and accepted to Section 29, providing that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;medical or surgical treatment shall not be given to the patient in such hospital or other place without the consent of the appropriate person.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have now definitely ruled out by statute medical or surgical treatment, and we have further modified the heading in respect of which regulations can <Col N="2001" /> be made so as definitely to confine the steps that may be taken, in regard to a person who is a probable source of infection, to immunisation measures. When Section 29 was under consideration in the House, and when it was suggested that, notwithstanding these two amendments, there still remained some doubt, I undertook that I would further examine this whole matter, and that, if it were necessary to further clarify the position, I would make it so clear that a blind man could not fail to see it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point that, referring back to the previous discussion on the section referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary, I wish to mention.  This provision empowers the Minister to make regulations providing for compulsory immunisation and all the safeguards that the Parliamentary Secretary has mentioned would apply.  In these regulations, is it proposed to make any particular allowance for individual cases, where, for instance. immunisation might be dangerous?  For instance. you would meet a particular case where, because of the bad state of health of the person or because of a peculiar condition, immunisation might be rather dangerous for the person concerned.  I take it the Parliamentary Secretary would cater for that in regulations, and that a provision would be made for, say, consultation with the person's medical attendant with a view to having taken whatever steps that might be appropriate to meet the individual case.  It is quite proper to have this provision. I do not see that the Parliamentary Secretary can have anything less than this provision in order to implement his Bill, but I think the case I have mentioned should be catered for when it comes to the question of making regulations under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised an objection to this matter on Section 29 of the Bill. I had an amendment down which sought to provide exemption for persons who claimed exemption on conscientious grounds.  I am still strongly of opinion that provisions should be made for such exemption. There is no absolute certainty that inoculation will be beneficial in all <Col N="2002" /> cases or that any particular form of inoculation or immunisation will be successful.  We have had long and painful experience of vaccination against smallpox. and I think it is generally accepted now, since compulsory vaccination is discontinued by this Bill, that it was not as effective as it was claimed to be.  As a matter of fact, I think it is now admitted that there was never any real vaccination against smallpox, because the effects of vaccination last for only six or seven years, and therefore the entire population over six or seven years were not vaccinated at all.  In addition to that, there was always a very substantial percentage of the population that never obeyed the law in regard to that matter.  Notwithstanding that, we have not been troubled very much with smallpox.  As a matter of fact, that particular disease has been eliminated over the past 100 years by the adoption of better housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy de Valera's contention is right, it is a rather strange thing that we should be discontinuing the provisions of the Vaccination Acts.  I believe it is more or less universally agreed that smallpox was not eliminated by vaccination but by better living conditions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the medical opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and a better standard of living and, I think, a better standard of cleanliness.  As far as diphtheria and other infectious diseases of that kind are concerned, better conditions of living and better housing will make for the elimination of the diseases to perhaps a greater extent than immunisation.  But even if we accept the view that immunisation is generally desirable, there may be, as Deputy de Valera rightly pointed out, certain persons in regard to whom immunisation might be fatal because of the condition of their health.  Deputy de Valera suggests the insertion of a provision which would enable, or which would more or less compel, the medical officer in the case to consult with the <Col N="2003" /> medical attendant of the patient.  I would be inclined to go further and to say that the person directly concerned, the person who is going to be inoculated or immunised, or the parent of the child who is going to be inoculated or immunised, should have the right to object in the first instance, if he so desires.  I think it will be found that people have a fair measure of common sense and, if it is proved beyond question that a particular form of immunisation or inoculation is effective generally, you will have the overwhelming majority of the people accepting it. There may be a few who will object on conscientious grounds but their number will be so small that it will not affect the general operation of the measure.  I am not suggesting that there should be easy methods of evasion provided but, if a person feels very strongly in the matter in regard to his own health or in regard to the health of his child, there should be some means of evading the measure and, particularly, there should be some exemption for people who are prepared on oath to declare that they have a conscientious objection to submitting to such treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to treat this in detail and I think Deputy Cogan will not expect me to, in the light of the fairly full discussion we had on the matter of immunisation in the earlier stages of the debate.  When that matter arose on an amendment by, I think, Deputy McGilligan, I went into the question of immunisation fairly fully.  I put on the records of the House certain figures and experiences that I think will impress Deputies when they find the time to read the debate, if they have not been present during the discussion.  The discussion lasted so long that very few Deputies were present throughout the whole of the debate.  I think, in the circumstances, that is very understandable and that it would have been a physical impossibility for anybody to remain all the time.  The wonder is how so many of us did survive for so long a time. Regarding the point raised by Deputy de Valera as to a provision in the regulations for exemption of persons who, <Col N="2004" /> because of their state of health, might be particularly susceptible to severe reaction as a result of any immunisation treatment, that will, of course, be provided for and discretion will rest with the chief medical officer.  Notwithstanding the fact that a scheme might compulsorily apply to an area, there will be provision for the exemption of persons on medical grounds. That usually works out all right in practice without much statutory intervention. Professional etiquette and the relationship between the family doctor and the chief medical officer of health succeed in getting over many difficulties that are very difficult to provide for in a code of law.  The less interference in some of these matters that there is in a statutory way the better it is for all concerned.  However, the regulations would provide for the exercise of special care in the selection of persons who might be exempt from an immunisation scheme.  In fact, what we are doing under this code in relation to immunisation and vaccination, and in particular in relation to vaccination, is that we are providing that an immunisation scheme or a vaccination scheme or any such form of protection can be carried out under the direction of the Minister in any particular part of the State at any particular time.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to hear the views of Deputies in relation to the powers we propose to take here.  Before they got exhausted in this long-distance trial, one section of the Fine Gael Party was very critical of the proposed repeal of the vaccination law.  But, in order to be sure that they would have all sides of medical opinion with them, another section of the Fine Gael Party attacked the Bill on the grounds that we were taking powers in any circumstances either to vaccinate or to immunise. No matter how persuasive I might have been before they left, I could not have satisfied those two schools of thought on the Front Bench of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vaccination has been compulsory in this country without any conscience clause, not only in the olden days which we are all so glad have come to <Col N="2005" /> an end, but during the whole period that the country was blessed with the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, vaccination was compulsory; there was no conscience clause, and there was no protest.  It has been compulsory, so far as the law is concerned, in the 14 years this Government has been in office, and there has been no protest from Fine Gael.  But, when we proceed to do something that appears to be sensible, when we proceed along this line of reasoning and we say that, by the blessing of Providence, it is a very long time since we had any case of smallpox in this country, when we say that the chances appear to be that people are not likely to be stricken with smallpox in future in so far as it is possible to envisage circumstances, when we say that, in these circumstances and in that setting, it does not appear to be any longer necessary to retain these powers of compulsory vaccination and to impose them upon a people who doubt not that vaccination has ceased to be a protective agent against smallpox, not that it has a protecting influence, but the need for exposing their children to the reaction and other complications that sometimes occur arising out of vaccination, we have this protest from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Cogan has hinted, it is scientifically sound to say that the protective effects of either immunisation or vaccination wear off in the course of time.  Consequently, it appeared to me illogical that we should compulsorily vaccinate a child if we do not compulsorily re-vaccinate at a period when medical scientists are agreed that the effect of the original vaccination had about passed off.  Consequently, I have advised the Minister, and he in turn has advised the Government, that we did not appear to be taking any serious risk so far as the health of the community was concerned if we abandoned compulsory vaccination in this country, so long as we retained the power to put at the disposal of the people that protecting agent in the event of the misfortune coming upon our people that smallpox would again appear.</P>
    <P>That is what we propose doing in <Col N="2006" /> this Bill.  We propose to retain the power to make vaccination or immunisation in any form compulsory in any particular area, if the circumstances of the time appear to demand such a step in the interests of the protection of the health of the community.  It seems to be sound and sensible, but of course it does not matter a thraneen how sound or how sensible any proposal is coming from these benches; one or other of the sections of the Opposition must find fault with it if they can get any volume of opinion at all, however irresponsible it may be, to sustain them in their viewpoint.</P>
    <P>When this matter was under discussion before, we were reminded that a number of medical gentlemen, with a number of letters before and after their names, had expressed the opinion that vaccination was, in fact, more of a danger than a protection to the people. I saw that communication in the Press and all I can say is that a search of the medical directory has failed to find the addresses of these gentlemen and, if they are as eminent in their profession here in the City of Dublin as the public are asked to believe, I can only say that they cannot be traced; and I have not met any eminent member of the medical profession, or indeed any other, who has been able to tell me that there are any distinguished men amongst the list of people who are alleged to have signed that document.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Bill is reported with amendments, there are some readjustments of the lay-out which I have to suggest.</P>
      <P>The contents of Part XI of the Bill &mdash;Miscellaneous&mdash;in the course of drafting and amendments have become rather too extensive, and I have in mind some rearrangements of sections before the Bill comes before the House on Report.</P>
      <P>Sections 85, 86, 87 and 88 of the Bill, as introduced, are intended to provide the legislative basis for the proposed extended maternity and child welfare and school medical services.  By official amendments Nos. 83, 84 and 101 (third group) the total number of sections dealing with this matter becomes six. Moreover, I intend to see if it would be possible by Report Stage to introduce amendments to repeal completely the Public Health (Medical Treatment of Children) (Ireland) Act, 1919, and re-enact those of its provisions which are still needed.  This would obviate the system of legislation by reference which has been adopted.</P>
      <P>In view of this, and as these provisions represent a very important aspect of the Bill, I think that they should be taken out of their present place and made into a separate part of the Bill, to be inserted before the present Part V, under the heading of &ldquo;Mother and Child Service&rdquo;.  This new part of the Bill would comprise a complete code of the law dealing with the mother and child health service.  I also suggest that Sections 92 to 95&mdash; Disposal of Bodies&mdash;be transposed to be inserted immediately before the present Part X.</P>
      <P>I propose therefore that the changes indicated be made in the lay-out of the Bill and be embodied in the next print of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2008" /> I therefore move:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the following changes be made in the position of sections and the division of the Bill into Parts:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) The group of sections (including new sections inserted in Committee) between Sections 84 and 89, but excluding those two sections, to be transposed to constitute a new Part before Part V, with the heading: Mother and Child Service;</P>
    <P>(b) Sections 92 to 95, inclusive, to be transposed to constitute a new Part before Part X, with the heading: Disposal of Bodies.</P>
    <P>This is merely a matter of reconstruction and lay-out.  Nothing new is being introduced.</P>

      <P>This is an unusual procedure which seems to involve a fairly far-reaching change in the general make-up of the Bill.  I should like to ask whether, on the Report Stage, the House will be permitted to deal with matters more fully than is usual on Report Stage; in other words, will the Bill be re-committed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  We have spent 15 days in Committee.  The Bill will be recommitted in respect of certain sections which have already been mentioned.  There is nothing in the proposal before the House now but the provision of a different lay-out. Nothing new is being introduced by this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not inclined to accept that view completely.  This is a very far-reaching change in the structure of the Bill and I think that the Bill ought to be recommitted in respect of the sections mentioned here as being transposed from one part of the Bill to another.</P>

      <P>The implications of the change being made require very careful examination, and, for that reason, the Parliamentary Secretary should agree to a recommittal, at least in so far as the particular sections involved are concerned.  If he is not prepared to agree to that, I feel that I could not accept this motion, and I protest against its being introduced without notice.  It is an unusual procedure, a procedure which has never been adopted with regard to any other piece of legislation.</P>
