      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin (for Mr. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state in respect of each of the years 1940 to 1945, inclusive, the percentage increase in the price of fertilisers related to an index figure of 100 at August, 1939.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>For a considerable number of years, up to and including 1941, official index numbers of retail prices of fertilisers, to base 1930 == 100, were published annually in the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin.</i>  Recalculated to base 1939 == 100, the index number is 133 for 1940 and 183 for 1941.  Since after 1941 <Col N="1190" /> many types of fertilisers were no longer available or, if available, not produced to pre-war specification, it was not possible to continue this series of index numbers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin (for Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he will increase the petrol allowance to owners of commercial vehicles whose supply of anthracite coal has been cut recently; or, alternatively, if he will state what action he proposes to take to enable such people to continue their business uninterruptedly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy's question refers to commercial goods vehicles fitted with gas producer plants. Petrol allowances are made available for these vehicles at the rates which apply to vehicles not fitted with producer plants.  It is not proposed to make extra petrol available in lieu of anthracite but I am prepared to consider on their merits individual applications for additional anthracite for gas-producer vehicles in cases where the reduction in anthracite supplies has created hardship.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the arrears of rent due by tenants of labourers' cottages in Kerry, amounted, in September, 1942, to approximately £16,732, and that the arrears due, at the present time, total approximately £7,883; and whether, in view of the improved position of the cottage rent collection, he will now consider a housing scheme for Kerry, particularly for the town of Caherciveen, where only four cottages have been built by the Kerry County Council during the past 30 years, and where there are practically no arrears of cottage rents.</P>

      <P>The initiation of proposals for the provision of water supplies and sewerage schemes rests with the local authority, who determine the order of priority of schemes in consultation with the county medical officer of health.  I am aware that, in addition to the schemes now in course of preparation in Kerry, the county medical officer of health has listed ten further schemes as urgent.  The improvement of the water supply and <Col N="1196" /> sewerage system at Milltown does not appear on the list.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that for the past six weeks there has been a serious shortage of water in the town of Caherciveen; and if he will take immediate steps to see that the Kerry County Council provides a water supply sufficient for the requirements of the town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been evident for a considerable time that the Caherciveen water supply is inadequate during dry periods.  Following the receipt of reports to that effect my Department in June, 1942, requested the submission of a plan of the existing waterworks provided 30 years previously, together with the engineer's proposals for improvements.  The data requested was furnished in the following year, but the Kerry County Council refused to sanction the expenditure of any money on the improvements.</P>
      <P>Preliminary proposals for the improvement of the Caherciveen water supply have now been submitted to the Department.  These proposals contemplate taking a supply from the River Pertha and the estimated cost is £14,300.  Before the proposal could be approved it would be necessary to have precise information regarding the reliability of the source during prolonged dry periods.  The local authority was accordingly informed on the 13th March last that gaugings are essential. Arrangements have been made to have such gaugings taken during the coming months.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby approves of the Sugar (Prohibition of Import) Order, 1946.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is aware that under the Sugar (Control of Import) Act, 1936, <Col N="1215" /> the Government makes an Order every year regulating the import of sugar during that year.  Consequently, it is normal to have a motion of this kind submitted to the Dáil and Seanad in this month.  The purport of the Order is to confine the import of sugar to the Irish Sugar Company.  As, however, the House is aware, there is no import of sugar taking place at present, and, consequently, the submission of the motion to the House is nothing more than a formality.  The Order exempts from the general prohibition upon the importation of sugar, except in accordance with the Order, sugar imported for the personal use of the importer or of the importer's household not exceeding 14 lbs. in weight and sugar sent as samples.  In practice, however, the total quantity of sugar imported in the past two years has been insignificant and it is not expected that this position will be any different this year.  Some quantities of sugar were offered for purchase here during the year but we considered that, having regard to the fact that we were exporting a substantial quantity of sugar by way of European relief, it would be illogical to import at the same time sugar which would otherwise be sold in the countries to which the relief supplies were going.  There was the further fact that the price at which the imported sugar was available was so very much dearer than the price of home produced sugar that to enable it to be sold at the prevailing retail price a very substantial subsidy would be required.  It is not possible to say when it will be possible or necessary to import sugar again but it is unlikely that the occasion for it will arise this year.  Under the terms of the Act of 1936, however, the motion must be submitted to the Dáil and the Seanad and passed here to keep the legal position right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 8, Section 13 (4), lines 22 <Col N="1216" /> to 24, to delete paragraph (c), and substitute the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(c) make an order for the transfer to the hirer of the owner's title to a part of the goods and for the specific delivery of the remainder of the goods to the owner, subject, if the court thinks fit, to the condition that the hirer or any guarantor pays to the owner within a specified time such further amount in respect of the hire-purchase price as the court, having regard to the amount already paid in respect thereof, the price of that part, the use which the hirer has had of the remainder of the goods and their depreciation in value, thinks just.</P>
    <P>This amendment might be discussed with amendments Nos. 2 and 3.  I think the purpose Deputy Martin O'Sullivan had in mind in amendment No. 3 is, in fact, met by amendment No. 1 in my name.  Amendment No. 1 and amendment No. 2 are, however, linked together.  It was Deputy O'Sullivan who raised various queries upon Section 13 of the Bill when discussing it in Committee.  It is, perhaps, the most important section of the Bill and it was right, therefore, that the Dáil should examine it with particular care.  Arising out of our Committee Stage discussion, I agreed to re-examine the section to ascertain whether any alteration in its provisions was necessary or desirable. One of the provisions of Section 13 is designed to ensure that, where the hirer of goods is unable to complete the contract and the contract comes before the court, the court may make an order transferring to the hirer of the goods the owner's title in part of them.  But sub-section (6) limited the court in this way: that it prohibited the court from making an order transferring to the hirer the owner's title in part of the goods unless it was satisfied that the amount which the hirer had paid in respect of the hire-purchase price exceeded the price of that part of the goods transferred to the hirer by at least one-third of the unpaid balance of the purchase price.</P>
    <P>It was argued in Committee that the provision was not completely fair to <Col N="1217" /> the hirer of the goods.  Personally I do not think that argument was well-founded. It will, I think, be agreed that, where a hire-purchase agreement comes to grief and the goods are being disposed of at the discretion of the court, the owner of the goods is entitled to get reasonable compensation for the deterioration in the value of the goods when returned to him and also compensation for the fact that the hirer had the usage of the goods during the period when the contract was in operation. I pointed out during the course of the earlier discussions on the Bill that it is generally agreed that such articles as motor cars lose a substantial portion of their value immediately they are used.  It is a common theory that a new motor car loses one-third of its value when it is driven home to the buyer's house.  The same is, to a large extent, true of other goods sold under hire-purchase agreements, such as wireless sets, bicycles, furniture, books and commodities of that kind. Their second-hand value is very much below their value as new goods and, consequently, the mere fact that the goods are returned to the owner by the hirer after only a small part of the hire-purchase price has been paid is not sufficient compensation to the owner.  He is also entitled to get compensation for the fact that he had been deprived of the opportunity of selling the goods to some other person while the hirer had them and reasonable compensation for the substantial deterioration in the value of the goods while in the possession of the hirer. The Dáil will, I am sure, appreciate that the rate of deterioration in value is much greater during the initial period of their use by the hirer than later on.  I went, however, very carefully into the whole provisions of the section and decided that a good case could be made for the changes which I am proposing by these two amendments.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan raised another point during the course of the Committee Stage discussion and that related to the case where the value of goods which the court could allocate to the hirer under the provisions of the section as it stood might be less <Col N="1218" /> than the value of any one article included in the transaction.  If, for example, the goods purchased under the agreement consisted of a suite of furniture and the hirer was unable to complete the transaction, he might desire to keep the table or the sideboard or some other item of the suite, but the court might find it impossible to arrange accordingly because the value of that one article would exceed the value of the goods which the court might transfer from the owner to the hirer.  The Deputy in his amendment proposes to deal with that question by empowering the court to require the owner to make a cash payment to the hirer.  I thought that was undesirable. There is no other provision in the Bill for the refund of cash by the owner arising out of the transaction and I think it would be unreasonable to provide for the possibility of the closing of the transaction by the repayment of cash to the hirer by the owner.</P>
    <P>I am proposing to deal with that point, but in a different way.  I am proposing to give the court discretion to make an order for the transfer of the owner's title in a part of the goods and for the delivery of the remainder of the goods by the hirer to the owner, but subject, if the court thinks fit, to the hirer of the goods or any guarantor of the hirer paying to the owner within a specified period such further amount in respect of the hire-purchase price as the court thinks just, but requiring the court, when determining the amount so to be paid, to take into account the use which the hirer had of the remainder of the goods and their depreciation in value.  In the circumstances which I have described, therefore, where the whole transaction relates to a suite of furniture, and where the hirer of the goods does not make the payment required and it goes to the court, if the hirer of the goods desires, say, to retain the table, but the value of the table exceeds the value of the goods which can be transferred to him, the court can, nevertheless, provide for the transfer of the owner's title in the table to the hirer of the goods, provided the hirer pays an additional sum, which in the court's opinion is just, representing the value <Col N="1219" /> of the table and which takes into account the fact that the hirer of the goods had the use of them for a period and that they have depreciated in value by reason of that use.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan's main objection was, however, I think, to the provisions of sub-section (6).  I am proposing to change that sub-section also. The effect of the change which I am proposing is to delete from the sub-section entirely the reference to one-third of the value.  If the amendment is accepted the court will have discretion to make an order under the amendment to which I have referred already, and where it makes such an order the following provisions will have effect in relation to the part of the order which refers to the transfer of the title in the goods to the hirer. First of all, the part of the order relating to the transfer of the goods to the hirer will not come into effect until the hirer has complied with the condition decided by the court.  If the condition is not complied with, the court shall revoke that part of the order and make such further order as it considers to be just.  If the order is complied with, then that part of the order comes into effect.  The effect of these two amendments is to remove some of the rigidity from the Bill and to leave a wider element of discretion to the court.  That, I think, meets what was the main objection to the provisions in Section 13, and meets the objection in a way that does not give rise to further objections such as, I think, would follow from the adoption of Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment No. 3.  I gave this matter very careful consideration.  I am satisfied that these two amendments will, in fact, improve the section, and that they go a long way, if not the whole way, to meet the criticism of the section which was expressed here in Committee.</P>

      <P>My reason for putting down this particular amendment is based on the difficulties I saw arising out of discussion upon the section in Committee.  I felt at the time that it would be a physical impossibility to give effect to sub-section (6) <Col N="1220" /> of the section, particularly in relation to a single article.  On the Committee Stage discussion, we had the illustration of the suite of furniture and the table.  We disposed of that, but I am glad to see that the discussion has had its effect in the amendments which the Minister is proposing to-day. A further examination of the Bill, as introduced, proves rather interesting because of its effect elsewhere, in this way, that once you began to apply the formula provided in sub-section (6) you found that it was absolutely impossible to apply it in relation to a single article.  Take the simple illustration of the bicycle, the piano or the sewing machine.  Having got your formula as provided in sub-section (6), you found that the hirer, having broken down in his payments&mdash;he could not continue to make them any longer&mdash;was credited by the court with a certain sum.  That sum was met by £13, whereas the original article cost £30.  He was credited with £13, but how was he to get £13 worth of goods from a single article costing £30?  That, of course, would be physically impossible.  As the Minister is meeting that point, it is rather interesting to note that the law in England at the present day&mdash;the Act there was passed in 1938&mdash;is line for line with sub-section (6) of Section 13 in this Bill, but it has not been in practical operation because, I understand, it has been suspended since 1939 under an Emergency Powers Act.  It would appear to me that the protection which that particular section afforded hire-purchasers&mdash;it is, by the way, the most important section in the Bill&mdash;has proved to be valueless, so far as the British people are concerned. In the light of what we are discussing here to-day, it would appear to me that an amending Act will be necessary to give to the people on the other side the protection originally intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point out to the Minister that there is still a slight difficulty where there are a number of items in a purchase as, for instance, in the case of a suite of furniture consisting of a couch and two chairs.  When you come to apply this formula you must, of necessity, have the foundation of the individual unit price.  The Bill makes <Col N="1221" /> no provision for an individual unit price.  Therefore, it would appear to me that when the purchaser is making his purchase it will be necessary for the trader to indicate the price of the couch and the chairs separately so as to enable the court to assess what portion of the goods shall be retained.  The Minister says that is met, to a great extent, in his first amendment.  In his second amendment, however, he provides that &ldquo;if the condition is not complied with&rdquo;.  The Minister is providing a way out in this matter, that suppose the amount of the goods to which the hire-purchaser is entitled is £13, that one item is a table costing £20&mdash; the illustration that we had the last day&mdash;that the whole suite of furniture cost £80, that the hire-purchaser has paid £35 and is anxious to retain the table for which he has paid £20, he is only entitled in a case such as that, to goods to the extent of £13. Obviously, in that case the trader is not going to give him the table which was invoiced at £20, or the suite of furniture which was invoiced at £80. The Minister is now providing a solution for that.  The solution is that the court may direct that the difference between £13 and £20 shall be paid by the hirer or by some guarantor on his behalf; but paragraph (a), in the second amendment which the Minister is proposing, provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that part shall not, in any event, come into operation before the condition is complied with.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, presumably, the condition where either the hirer or the guarantor pays the intervening balance.  Paragraph (b) of the Minister's second amendment provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;if the condition is not complied with, the court shall revoke that part and make such further order in relation to the goods as it thinks just.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Am I to understand that, in that case, the court need not necessarily order the return of all the goods to the owner, but that as in the case of the table due allowance will be made for all the circumstances, and that the court will have a rather wide jurisdiction in meeting the equities of the case?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The reference to one-third <Col N="1222" /> of the value is being deleted.  It is now left entirely to the discretion of the court to make such order as it considers just, but the court must have regard to something more than the value of a single item or a couple of items in relation to the total cost of all the articles purchased.  The court must also, in determining the amount to be paid before title to the goods is transferred, take into account the depreciation in the value of the goods that are being returned to the owner, as well as the fact that the hirer had the use of the goods for a period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the question of depreciation in the value of the goods that are being returned to the owner arise, apart from the depreciation that arises out of their use over a period of time?  I think that is a question that is going to cause many difficulties.  This matter is not quite as simple as it would appear. Take the illustration that Deputy O'Sullivan gave.  There are a couch and two armchairs.  There is the danger that the contract may break down and that the hirer may elect to retain&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a case of the danger of a contract breaking down. This is a case where the contract has, in fact, broken down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I have not made my point quite clear.  Take the example that was given by Deputy O'Sullivan of the Chesterfield suite, consisting of three pieces.  Deputy O'Sullivan's point was that the owner, at the time of the sale, should indicate not only the price of the suite but the price of each individual article in that suite.  If he does not, what guide is the court to have?  It would be a difficult matter to decide the value of the couch and of each armchair.  The taking away of the couch from the two armchairs would, definitely, depreciate the value of the two armchairs.  That is the point I want to make.  Let me give another illustration.  Take a bedroom suite, consisting of three pieces&mdash; wardrobe, dressing table and washstand. The court decides that the hirer should pay up whatever the balance is, that the wardrobe should be retained by him and that the dressing <Col N="1223" /> table and washstand should be returned to the owner.  The value of those two articles without the wardrobe will be depreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  The court will not take into account merely the difference between what the hirer has paid and the value of the article he wants to keep.  It will also have to take into account depreciation of the goods which are to go back and the fact that the hirer had the use of them.  The amount fixed will represent not only the difference between the amount paid and the value of the article but fair compensation to the owner of the goods in respect of the depreciated value of the articles returned to him and the fact that the hirer had the use of them for a certain period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That will put a disproportionate value on the article retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The court will take all the circumstances into account.  I tried to frame the Bill on the lines of British Bill which provided for a fixed formula&mdash;one-third of the difference between the hire-purchase price and the unpaid balance&mdash;and, in any of the illustrations I took to ascertain how that provision would work, it seemed to me that it would work reasonably well.  The objection which was voiced here was that the amount of the value which the court might allow in respect of the goods transferred might not represent any single item of the goods&mdash;that it was too rigid a method of determining the amount of the value of the goods to be transferred.  I met that by putting on the court the whole onus of deciding what would be a fair settlement but putting on the court also the obligation of taking into account not merely the amount the hirer has paid but also the amount which the owner has lost by reason of the depreciated value of the goods and the fact that he had not the use of them for a period.  The court can then arrange for the transfer of one or the other of the articles to the hirer either without any further payment, if it thinks that that is reasonable provision, <Col N="1224" /> or subject to such additional payment by the hirer as the court thinks would represent a just settlement. If that amount is paid, the whole transaction will be completed.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons why amendment No. 2&mdash;new sub-section (6)&mdash;is in the form it is, is the desirability of having the whole transaction completed.  One of the objections I had to the suggestions put forward here was that the thing might go on indefinitely, coming back again and again to the court, without the owner of the goods getting any satisfaction, if the hirer continued to default in carrying out the court's order.  The provisions of sub-section (6) seem to me to afford a reasonable method of ensuring that the business can be completed.  If the hirer of the goods defaults in the payment, one-third of the total price having been paid, and the matter goes to the court, the court can deal with the issue with a very considerable amount of discretion. It can order the return of the goods to the owner, or it can make an order for the delivery of the goods and postpone the operation of the order, subject to some adjustment of the price in relation to the means of the hirer.  That would give an opportunity of having the transaction completed on less onerous terms, subject to some conditions which the court might impose, which would, ordinarily, be conditions designed to protect the goods against damage.  The court can also divide up the goods, transferring the ownership of some of them to the hirer and ordering the return of the balance to the owner.  When dividing up the goods, the court can decide what additional payment should be made and, in doing that, must take into account not merely the relative value of the two portions of the goods but the right of the owner to compensation for depreciation of the goods and for the loss of the use of the goods for a period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the difficulty in getting anything in the nature of a completely satisfactory section but it seems to me that, even with the new amendments to be put in, the court will be coerced into doing an injustice either to the hirer or the owner.</P>

    <Col N="1225" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not follow that. After all, the only case in which the original formula might have worked harshly was where one-third of the purchase price had been paid and had been paid quickly, so that the length of time during which the owner was deprived of the use of his goods was not very long.  In such cases, there could be hardship.  Such cases are not unusual.  People who buy furniture or bicycles or other goods by hire-purchase sometimes make a substantial payment initially on the purchase price.  If they have a stroke of luck at the &ldquo;dogs&rdquo;, or elsewhere, they may pay off a substantial portion of the purchase price in order to get rid of it. If they found themselves unable to continue the payments, they might have been caught by the provisions of the Bill in a manner which would not be completely fair.  It is to meet that type of case that some alteration is necessary.  In such cases, it should not be beyond the power of the court to make an arrangement fair to each party.  There are not many alternatives to leaving the matter to the discretion of the court.  We cannot really put into the Bill provisions which would be so complete as adequately to meet the circumstances of every case. In the last analysis, we must give the court power to dispose of the matter in one or two ways and rely on it to be fair to all the parties.</P>

'Sé príomh-chuspóir an Bhille seo ná éifeacht do thabhairt in <Col N="1227" /> aghaidh na bliana airgeadais ar fad do na Rúin Airgeadais lenar ghlac an Dáil tar éis na Cáinfhaisnéise.  Mar is eol do na Teachtaí, ní bhíonn éifeacht reachtúil ach ar feadh thréimhse teoranta ag na Rúin a ritheann an Coiste um Airgeadas den Dáil.</P>
      <P>Cuireadh adhbhar furmhór na bhforálacha eile den Bhille fé bhráid na Dála cheana san Oráid Cáinfhaisnéise. 'Na dteannta san, tá forálacha ann a thugann cómhacht chun faoiseamh ó diúitéthe áirithe, a tugadh fén Acht Cómhacht Práinne, 1939, do coimead in éifeacht.  Bhéarfad tuairisc níos cruinne ar na forálacha san ar ball agus ar chúpla mion-rud eile atá san Bhille.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to give continuing effect to the taxes and duties embodied in the Financial Resolutions passed by Dáil Eireann following the Budget.  As Deputies are aware, these Resolutions have statutory effect for only a limited period under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927.  The majority of the provisions have been either the subject of Financial Resolutions or were referred to in my Budget speech of last month.</P>
      <P>Opportunity is, however, being taken in this Bill to incorporate in ordinary legislation certain revenue provisions at present in force under emergency powers legislation and also to amend the revenue laws in minor ways for convenience in administration.  It is not, I think, necessary for me to go into these provisions fully at this stage as Deputies will have ample opportunity later of examining each of the sections in detail.  For the present, therefore, I trust that the House will be satisfied with a brief reference to the various sections of the Bill as introduced.</P>
      <P>Part I&mdash;Income-tax&mdash;Section 1, which corresponds to Financial Resolution No. 1, passed on Budget day, is the customary &ldquo;charging&rdquo; section which provides for the imposition of income-tax, surtax and excess surtax for the year 1946-47.  It also makes provision for the continuance in force of the existing enactments relating to those taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1228" /> Section 2, which was covered by Financial Resolution No. 2, repeals Rule 8 of Schedule E of the Income Tax Act, 1918, and is designed to remove an old and obsolete provision from the income-tax code.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is a relieving section, introduced to bring up to date the existing exemption from income-tax in respect of wounds and disability pensions and gratuities granted under the Army Pensions Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is also a relieving section. It extends, by reference to the emergency years 1939-40 to 1945-46, the period within which losses incurred in a trade or profession can be carried forward for income-tax purposes and deducted from subsequent profits.  The section will benefit those concerns which, because they fared badly during the emergency, did not make sufficient profits to absorb the losses carried forward.</P>
    <P>Section 5, to which reference was also made in the Budget speech, provides for a special allowance in respect of revenue or capital expenditure on scientific research in the industrial field.  Revenue expenditure within the scope of the section will be allowed as an expense in computing the profits of the trade, while the allowance in respect of capital expenditure will be spread over a period of five years.</P>
    <P>Section 6, which was foreshadowed in the Budget speech, provides for a special allowance in respect of capital sums expended in the development of mines.  The allowance will extend to sums expended on searching for, discovering and testing mineral deposits, and on the construction of works whose value is likely to be little or nothing when the mine finally ceases to be operated.</P>
    <P>I come now to Part II dealing with customs and excise.  Section 7, which corresponds to Financial Resolution No. 3, provides for a basic increase of 12/6 the proof gallon in the rates of duty on foreign spirits and for an increase of 12/6 the proof gallon in the case of home-made spirits.</P>
    <P>Section 8, which corresponds to Financial Resolution No. 4, provides for an increase in the full rates of <Col N="1229" /> customs duty on wines to double the existing rates, which were imposed in 1930, and for corresponding preferential rates in respect of wine produced in and consigned from countries within the British Commonwealth of Nations.  The ratio of the preferential rates to the full rates varies from 50 per cent. to 70 per cent.</P>
    <P>Section 9, which corresponds to Financial Resolution No. 5, provides for the termination of the existing customs and excise duties on sugar and molasses and for the continuance of the duties and drawbacks on glucose and saccharin.</P>
    <P>Section 10, which corresponds to Financial Resolution No. 6, provides for a reduction as from 1st June, 1946, in the rates of customs and excise duty on mineral hydrocarbon light oils from 1/3 to 9d the gallon and from 1/1 to 7d the gallon, respectively. The oils to which the duty applies include petrol, benzol, white spirit, etc., but the bulk of the customs duty is received from petrol.  As there is no production of home refined oil at the present time the effect of the reduction on excise duty is nil.</P>
    <P>Section 11, which corresponds to Financial Resolution No. 7, provides for similar reductions in customs and excise duties on hydrocarbon oils. The scope of the duties include such oils as crude mineral oils, fuel oil, diesel oil, gas oil, paraffin oil and turpentine, but in view of provisions for rebate, the duties are, in effect, chargeable only on oils intended for use in propelling motor vehicles.  As there is no home production of this oil at the present time the effect of the reduction in excise duty is nil.</P>
    <P>Section 12 incorporates the provisions of Emergency Powers (No. 217) Order, 1942, which enables second copies of certain cinematograph films to be imported at half the existing rate of duty.  The main consideration which gave rise to this concession in 1942 was transport difficulties in this country, which still remain.  In addition, a world shortage in films, which is likely to continue for some time, has a bearing on the position.  The question of withdrawing the concession will be considered <Col N="1230" /> when there is an improvement both in transport facilities and in the supply of films.</P>
    <P>Section 13, which was foreshadowed in the Budget speech, abolishes as from 1st August next the entertainments duty on payments for admission to céilidhthe and dances.</P>
    <P>Section 14 follows on the Government's decision to establish a customs-free airport at Rineanna for which purpose a Bill is to be introduced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The section provides (1) that all goods imported direct from abroad into the customs-free airport shall not be liable to duty, and (2) that any goods removed from the airport to any other part of the State shall be chargeable with duty in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>Section 15 is designed to incorporate in ordinary legislation the provisions of Emergency Powers (No. 303) Order, 1943.  This Order exempts gifts of food from the provision whereby customs duty is charged at the fixed minimum sum of 2/6 (or 1/- in the case of goods from the United Kingdom or Canada), if the duty on any individual class of goods contained in one consignment or parcel would amount to less than 2/6.  The effect of the section is that imported parcels of food sent as gifts will be charged only with the actual duty without regard to the minimum duty.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the exemption from package duty of (a) goods imported as gifts, and (b) goods for the personal use of the importer brought in by the importer or his servant or a member of his family.  Under Emergency Powers (No. 348) Order, 1944, the package duty on gifts of food is at present suspended.  It is considered that extension of the exemption in the manner indicated and its incorporation in ordinary legislation would make for convenience in revenue administration and remove a possible source of irritation.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for permanent exemption from customs duty of goods imported by the Irish Red Cross Society as gifts or on loan from a Red Cross organisation abroad and imported solely for the purposes of the <Col N="1231" /> society.  Since September, 1942, exemption from customs duty has been allowed under an Emergency Powers Order in respect of any article supplied to the society by a Red Cross organisation in any other country.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for the exemption from customs or excise duty of articles required for use in connection with the establishment and maintenance of international air services using Irish airports.  The main purpose of the section is to implement the customs provisions of the draft Convention on International Civil Aviation drawn up at Chicago in November, 1944, and ratified by the Dáil on 19th April, 1945. Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1936, and Section 20 of the Finance Act, 1941, which are being repealed, provided for similar exemption but in respect of transatlantic air services only.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides for the exemption from payment of customs duty of articles required for rescue, salvage and repair of damaged aircraft registered in another State.  The section will apply only where the goods are imported temporarily.  If they are not exported in due course duty will become chargeable.  The purpose of the section is to implement agreements on this subject adopted by each member State at meetings of the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organisation in Montreal last January and February.</P>
    <P>Section 20 is identical with Emergency Powers (No. 273) Order, 1943, which reduced the minimum quantity of beer, wine and spirits which may be sold by wholesale dealers to licensed retailers.  The Order was made on receipt of representations that, since the legal minima were originally fixed, the increased cost and scarcity of liquors made it difficult for small retailers to purchase and for wholesalers to distribute available supplies.  These conditions will, so far as can be foreseen, obtain for a considerable time to come and it is therefore proposed to embody the terms of the Order in ordinary legislation.  The position will be reviewed when the supply position returns to normal.</P>
    <P>Sections 21 and 22 provide for <Col N="1232" /> amendment of the statutes under which excise duty on refreshment house licences and tobacco dealers' licences, respectively, is charged by reference to the &ldquo;poor law valuation&rdquo; of the premises. The sections provide for the charging of the duty by reference to the valuation of premises under the Valuation Acts.  The amendments, which are purely technical, are necessary consequent on the substitution of the municipal rate for the poor rate in the county boroughs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Nil.  It is purely technical and will have no effect on the amount of licence duty payable.</P>
      <P>Section 23 repeals Section 32 of the Excise Management Act, 1827, and is intended to be in substitution therefor. It rectifies defects in the 1827 statute which has been found to be insufficient and inappropriate to present conditions.</P>
      <P>Part III&mdash;Corporation Profits Tax&mdash; Section 24, which applies only to accounting periods ending on or after the 1st January, 1941, enables assessments to corporation profits tax and excess corporation profits tax to be made at any time.  It also provides that, in the absence of a return of the necessary information, the Revenue Commissioners may make an assessment according to the best of their judgment.  This section corresponds to Financial Resolution No. 8 passed on Budget day.</P>
      <P>Section 25 provides that profits arising on or after the 1st January, 1947, shall not be chargeable to excess corporation profits tax.  Deputies will recollect the announcement I made in this connection in my Budget speech. Section 26 is a &ldquo;construction&rdquo; clause for corporation profits tax (including excess corporation profits tax).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part IV&mdash;Miscellaneous and General &mdash;Section 27 applies to certain cases where proceedings in revenue matters are taken in the High Court or in the Circuit Court for the recovery of a tax or penalty which is due and payable for the benefit of the Central Fund. The section, which specifies the form <Col N="1233" /> of execution order to be granted in such cases, is designed to remove certain defects and archaisms in the existing form of the Order.</P>
    <P>Section 28 enables effect to be given to the proposals in the Budget statement regarding the interest rate on Post Office Savings Bank and Trustee Savings Bank deposits.  At present, the position is governed by Section 7 of the Post Office Savings Bank Act, 1861&mdash;which fixed the annual interest rate on Post Office Savings Bank Deposits at 2½ per cent.&mdash;and Section 5 of the National Debt (Supplemental) Act, 1888&mdash;which prescribes that interest on a deposit in a Trustee Savings Bank shall not exceed 2½ per cent. per annum.  In lieu of the fixed statutory rate of 2½ per cent. for the Post Office Savings Bank, it is proposed to take power to prescribe by Order such rate or rates as may be considered desirable from time to time.  Section 29 is consequential on Section 28.</P>
    <P>When the Bill becomes law, it is my intention to make an Order fixing 2 per cent. per annum as the interest rate payable on deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank not exceeding £300 and on the first £300 of larger deposits; in the case of deposits exceeding £300 the interest rate will be 1¼ per cent. on the amount of the excess.  The Trustee Savings Banks will continue to be free to fix their own interest rates subject to the limitation imposed by Section 29 that the rate shall not exceed the rate for the time being appropriate to a deposit of like amount in the Post Office Savings Bank.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recollect that in my Budget statement I informed the House that the third issue of Savings Certificates was being withdrawn on the 8th May and that a new issue of lower-yielding Certificates would be introduced.  The necessary printing arrangements are in hands and I expect the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will be able to make the new issue available to the public about the end of this month.</P>
    <P>Section 30 establishes the Transition <Col N="1234" /> Development Fund.  In my Budget statement last month, I indicated to the House in some detail the purposes for which the fund might be utilised. Sub-section (3) describes these purposes in short compass.  Before the summer adjournment, I hope to present an Estimate to the House to enable the money to be advanced to the fund as provided in the section.</P>
    <P>Section 31 provides for the repeal of the enactments which are cited in the Fourth Schedule.  As I have already mentioned, the repeal of Section 32 of the Excise Management Act, 1827, is consequential on Section 23 of the Bill and the repeal of Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1936, and Section 20 of the Finance Act, 1941, is consequential on Section 18.</P>
    <P>Section 32 is the customary care and management provision.  Section 33 is the usual section relating to the short title, construction and commencement of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given us in brief outline the meaning of each section in the Finance Bill.  I was rather hoping, with regard to some of the more important and newer sections, that he might have given us some fuller information.  I am sure the House would welcome fuller information with reference to Section 6, which deals with an allowance for mining development.  I should like to know why the Minister has decided to make this allowance.  I do not want to be taken as objecting to it.  I assume this has been made as a result of certain representations to the Minister or to the Department of Finance.  Are we to take it as an indication that there will be more activity in respect of mining?  Has the Minister any information that attempts are being, or will be, made to touch what I may call virgin soil as distinct from the wellknown areas which are supposed to have mining possibilities?  Fuller information on this matter will be welcomed by the House and by the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As long as we can remember, we have been hearing or reading about the mining and mineral possibilities of this country.  We know that a great many <Col N="1235" /> surveys have been made and that there have been borings and explorations. It is time, after a quarter of a century of native government, that there should be placed before the House some clear statement as to the decisions, if any, which have been reached regarding mining and mineral possibilities.  We know that there were some very optimistic views as to what this country contained.  We were told we had fairly large supplies, ranging from oil to gold. One matter on which we would welcome a statement is our coal development possibilities.  We should like to know if the Government are satisfied that all that can reasonably be done with reference to the production and distribution of coal has been done; whether they have any reason to believe that production figures can be improved, and whether we can hope that such an improvement will come within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>At one time there were rather optimistic hopes about certain parts of the country, particularly Arigna.  My recollection is that many people, including Deputies on the Government Benches, were optimistic.  Most people were hopeful that we would get in Arigna two of the things we are mainly in need of, coal and iron.  A great deal of work has been carried out in Arigna over a number of years and it would be useful and enlightening to the House if we could get some statement on that subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as I get it, I do not care from whom it comes. I am merely putting this matter to the Minister for Finance because, apparently, he feels that there are fields still to be explored.  Apparently the Minister and the Department are satisfied&mdash;and if one is to believe all one hears about the Department of Finance, it is not easy to satisfy them &mdash;that such further surveys as are to be made are worthy of their benediction. If what we hear about the Department is true, there is apparently <Col N="1236" /> some hope.  But they should not keep all the information to themselves.  The Minister should give us the information which he has at his disposal and which was sufficient to satisfy him and the Department.</P>
      <P>There are other points that one might touch upon, but I do not propose to do so now; I think it is better to leave them until the Committee Stage, when the House will consider the Bill section by section.</P>
      <P>There are, however, some rather important points on which I would like further information.  I am intrigued about this Transition Development Fund.  It sounds good, but I would like to know what it means and when will it be given effect to.  Is it merely a pious aspiration put into this Bill?  How much money will be spent on this development fund in the coming year and upon what will it be spent?  To what extent will it give additional employment?  To what extent will it give full employment to those who are now partially employed? The Minister has been very modest about the proposal.  He said that there is some legislation to be introduced &mdash;I am not quite sure whether it is in connection with this, or in connection with civil aviation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important matter and a large sum of money is involved.  I should like to know from the Minister whether we can take it that before the special Estimate is introduced the plans in connection with the Transition Development Fund for the coming year will be available and will be made known to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the interest on Post Office Savings.  I think this is definitely a step in the wrong direction.  It is something that should not be done.  It is a very bad thing that any step should be taken which will cut across whatever <Col N="1237" /> thrift there is in the country. God knows that thrift in these days is not anything like what it should be. We know that money seems to have lost any sense of value that it ever had.</P>
    <P>We know definitely that we have inflation in this country.  We know that there is every incitement, every inducement, and every temptation for certain sections of our community to flash money around as if notes were mere scraps of paper.  We know that other sections of the community are at their wits' end to make a £ note stretch as far as a 10/- note did six or seven years ago.  We have the two extremes.  We have a very substantial section and, strange as it may seem, that is the poorest and most crippled section, whose sheet anchor always was the Post Office Savings Bank.  I think it is foolish&mdash;I do not want to use any other word&mdash;and bad national policy that this gesture&mdash;I do not think the Minister means it other than as a gesture&mdash;should be made at the expense of people who use the Post Office for their savings.  Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to say what is the existing rate of interest in the Post Office on sums in excess of £300.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Two and a half per cent., up to £2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The position then is that, on sums up to £300, the rate of interest will be 2 per cent., and on amounts in excess of £300 the rate will be 1¼ per cent., so that the present rate of interest on sums in excess of £300 is being cut in two.  That seems to me to be very drastic on that section of the community that should be encouraged rather than discouraged to use the Post Office Savings Bank. It would be time enough for the Minister to get money from these people, and to give only 1¼ per cent. when the Government is able to get money at the same rate of interest from other sections and other institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>They are able to get it much less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says they will be able to get it much less than 1¼ per cent.  I take it that local <Col N="1238" /> authorities will be able to get it likewise. We will deal with that on another occasion.</P>
      <P>I want to express my disappointment that in this Bill there is no measure of relief of any description for the class we have been talking about, the very poorest.  I refer particularly to people dependent on old age pensions and blind pensions.  I think we are not doing our duty when we give substantial relief to people in respect of charges, which only operate after they have been allowed a sum which will, at least, give a decent livelihood, shelter and enough to eat.  I do not think there is any section of the community so much pegged down to the income which they had in 1939 as old age pensioners and blind pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking even the official figures, which we know do not completely represent the full increase in the cost of living, there has been an increase of 70 per cent. over and above the 1939 figures. To people who have to purchase, as those dependent on small pensions have, in the smallest quantities the cost is proportionately greater than it is on those who can purchase in a more advantageous way.  Perhaps that is not fully as true under war conditions, when most people are rationed, as in normal times, but even in the abnormal times that we have gone through in the last six years, there is a certain amount of truth in it.  It seems to me that we might easily, out of the £3,000,000 which the Minister had to dispose of, have found a portion sufficient to give some relief to sections which are at the bottom of the larder, and are barely on the existence level. The Minister will probably say that they are not entirely dependent on the 10/- a week, that they have vouchers for this, that and the other thing.  I do not agree with vouchers.  To be quite frank, I do not agree with the manner in which the additional 2/6 is administered.  In that respect, I should like to remind the Minister that the machinery, out of which the extra allowance is administered, does not allow it to be paid for the complete year, and that there are periods, as far as certain blind pensioners and old age pensioners are concerned, extending to <Col N="1239" /> three or four months, when they do not get the extra 2/6.</P>
    <P>All Parties in this House and in the country would have been satisfied with less reliefs than those which were given, if the difference was given for the relief of really necessitous people. I do not think that there is any case the Minister can make against the giving of such relief.  From the point of view of bare justice they are entitled to it.  We all know the purchasing value of a 10/- note to-day.  That is the maximum pension that a blind pensioner or an old age pensioner receives, while many of them are in receipt of less than that sum.  But for the charity of neighbours, and the well-known work of charitable institutions and societies, it would mean for them a level of starvation, that would compare unfavourably even with that which obtains in certain countries on the Continent to-day.</P>
    <P>That is the greatest blot on this Budget and this Finance Bill, and I appeal to the Minister to consider favourably, even at this stage, the granting of some addition to those who are in receipt of the smallest pensions in the State.  They are badly in need of it.  Their claim is a just claim and one the satisfaction of which would appeal to every section of the community. I do not believe there is any section in the House or outside it which would object to the Minister satisfying that claim, in so far as he possibly can.  I do not want to make any unreasonable demands on the Minister or the Department in this connection, but what would be less than justice would be acceptable and would be very helpful to them.  The Minister will admit that, on the basis of the increase in the cost of living, or on the basis of the reduced purchasing power of their pensions, they are entitled to some consideration.  The other minor matters which I want to raise can more appropriately be raised on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to a matter with which I dealt last year concerning excess corporation profits tax on the smaller companies.  Under <Col N="1240" /> Section 13 (1) (c) of the Finance Act, 1944, the Revenue Commissioners have a discretionary power of deduction in cases where the paid-up capital of a company is or exceeds £15,000, but in cases in which the capital is less than £15,000, the total deduction to be allowed shall not exceed a sum representing 3 per cent of the paid-up issued capital of the company.  A case has been brought to my notice of a company formed in September, 1943, to take over an existing business which had been carried on by a trader and his family and which had been in existence for a number of years.  For the trading year ended 31st August, 1939, the members of that family were paid salaries of approximately £190 per annum each.  By Section 13 of the 1944 Finance Act, the total directors' remuneration allowed in respect of excess corporation profits tax must not exceed £150, that is, 3 per cent. of the paid-up capital of £5,000.</P>
      <P>If the company had not been formed, the salary paid by the trader to the members of his family would probably have been as high as the 1939 figure of £190, and it is likely that, in many cases of this kind, increased salaries were paid as a result of increased profits during the war in the case of certain companies.  A company of the kind I refer to is rather harshly treated under this section.  It is desirable from many angles that traders should form companies of this kind, but, if the company had not been formed in this case, they would have succeeded in getting higher remuneration and would have escaped the penalties of Section 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be glad if the Minister would consider that case, because, when I raised it last year, the Minister said that if a case were brought to his notice of injustice and hardship being caused by the operation of the section, he would have it considered. I do not know whether I can get the permission of the trader concerned to give the actual name or to have the company dealt with by the Department, but, as the law stands, the Revenue Commissioners have no power to allow any deduction and I suggest that it is a matter that should be considered. <Col N="1241" /> I do not think it would operate unfairly against other members of the community if the discretionary power which the Revenue Commissioners have in respect of a paid-up capital of £15,000 or more were allowed to relate to smaller companies.  It is desirable that these smaller companies should be facilitated in every way and it is desirable that this discretionary power should be given.</P>
    <P>One of the other matters to which I want to refer&mdash;both have been referred to by Deputy Morrissey&mdash;is the section dealing with the allowance for mineral development, Section 6.  Recently the Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to the fact that Mianraí, Teoranta, would likely be wound up in the near future and that the phosphate rock development in County Clare&mdash;I think, at Doolin&mdash;was unlikely to continue much longer, for two reasons: first, that better quality phosphate could be imported at a lower price, and secondly, that it was desirable, in view of a possible future emergency, that whatever deposits remain should be allowed to remain in case they should be required at a later stage.  In view of the fact that Mianraí, Teoranta, is likely to be wound up in the near future, I should like to hear to whom this concession or assistance is likely to be granted and what type of mineral development is contemplated.</P>
    <P>The other matter on which I seek information is the Transition Development Fund.  Sub-section (3) of Section 30 sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may apply the fund for any purpose for or towards the cost of which public moneys are provided and which is conducive to the development or improvement of capital resources.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have had for a number of years, and apparently are likely to have for some years in the future, State or semi-State boards of one kind or another. One which comes to my mind is the contemplated Pigs and Bacon Board, and I wonder is it intended, in the event of such a commission or board being set up, to make an advance from that Fund to that board.  Another board to which an advance might be made&mdash;and I think it would be undesirable in either of these cases so <Col N="1242" /> to use the Fund&mdash;would be that in respect of air development.  As a result of contemplated legislation, the capital of the new company may be increased, and I do not know whether the legislation will incorporate a provision to that effect, but, at any rate, those are the types of boards which come to mind in this connection, and I think the House should have some information as to what exactly this Fund will be used for. It has a very high-sounding and progressive name, but, so far as pigs and bacon are concerned, if advances are to be made to such a board, the Fund should be known as the transition decline fund, in the light of previous experience.  I should be glad to hear from the Minister what particular development he has in mind in the coming year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it rather difficult to follow the case Deputy Cosgrave made about the smaller companies with a capital under £15,000 and the relation of such companies to excess corporation profit tax, but if he will give me particulars, either mentioning the name of the company or setting out in detail the factors which affect a non-named company, I shall be glad to look into them, and see if there is any case of hardship which could be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that, without having any further details at the moment, unless there is an amendment of the law, it will be difficult to give any allowance in the particular circumstances of this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be glad to examine any information or any facts which the Deputy may put before me, but he will realise that the excess corporation profits tax code is very complicated and I cannot give him now a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer regarding it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey referred to Section 6 and wanted to know whether this was an indication of the Government's hopes that more mining development would take place in the future.  The future of mining development is really a matter for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  All I can say is that this section was designed to facilitate any possible development in mining. Mining is a very hazardous business; but, if people are prepared to put their <Col N="1243" /> money into it, we are undertaking by this section to give them greater reliefs than are ordinarily given to companies or individuals who undertake work in the open air.  Once a person has to go underground for the purpose of following up a mineral he incurs a lot of expenditure and it very often happens that his preliminary expenditure is wasted because the minerals are either non-existent or are not there in sufficient quantity, or sufficiently easy of access, to pay a dividend.  It is for the purpose of encouraging people to take these hazards that Section 6 has been inserted in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In regard now to the Transition Development Fund, which was mentioned by both Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Morrissey, in my Budget statement I gave a few illustrations as to the manner in which I propose to utilise this Fund.  This Bill merely legalises the establishment of that Fund and legalises the putting into the Fund of a sum not exceeding £5,000,000.  Later on, when this Bill is passed into law, I propose to introduce a new Estimate for this Fund and on the introduction of that I propose to place before the Dáil, in as great detail as I can, the various purposes for which it is hoped to use that Fund during the coming year.  This sum of money is being provided in this way because it is not possible exactly to foresee when, or in what quantity, or for what purpose the money will be required.  It is brought forward in an effort to encourage every possible development during this transition period.  If there is a housing project, for instance, which cannot be completed owing to shortage of certain materials, I will be prepared, out of this Fund, to give every possible assistance to local authorities to assist them in the erection of the houses and to bear the capital charges on the Fund until the houses are completed.  Now, in regard to housing, one would need to be a prophet in order to compute how much will be required out of the Fund because so many uncertain factors are involved&mdash;the greatest of which, as Deputies in this House are well aware, is the uncertainty of supplies of essential materials from abroad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1244" /> Since the introduction of the Budget we have authorised the Department of Agriculture to accept certain applications which have come in for farm improvements. About £60,000 is involved in these.  If this transition fund did not go through this £60,000 would have to be met by a Supplementary Estimate; but I took a chance on its going through and I have authorised the Department of Agriculture to accept these applications on that understanding. I felt that it was essential, particularly during this period when there are so many men looking for employment and so much valuable work to be done in the line of farm improvements, that every possible encouragement should be given to the farmers to improve their lands.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked two specific questions as to whether this fund would be utilised for the Pigs and Bacon Board and as to whether it would be utilised for the Air Board.  I do not see how the Pigs and Bacon Board could draw upon this Fund, or for what purpose it might be suggested that could be done.  Before many months I anticipate there will be legislation before this House for the reorganisation of the Pigs and Bacon Board and for the purpose of giving it new powers. At the same time I am quite sure that the Minister for Agriculture will seek through the Dáil such funds as he considers necessary for that Board to enable it to carry out its functions. With regard to the Air Board, I cannot see in that connection either for what purpose the Air Board could call upon this Fund or for what purpose the various air companies could call upon it.  Very large sums of moneys have been made available for the building of airports, for the purchase of equipment, aeroplanes and so on.  I think that all such expenditure of that nature can more properly be met out of the Votes specially passed by the Dáil for their development.  Apart from Boards, such as Deputy Cosgrave referred to. there is a multiplicity of purposes for which I think the money could usefully be spent.  I think, however, that the Transition Fund will principally be drawn on by local authorities and I would like the local authorities now to <Col N="1245" /> go ahead and get in tenders for the building of cottages and houses in order to proceed as far as they possibly can with the available material and the available unemployed in their districts. I would like to see the job of housing our people in a reasonable fashion completed as soon as possible. Great strides were made in the housing campaign before the war.  We rehoused in five or six years about one-fifth of the entire population and, if we go all out on the job, I believe that within a few years we can have our people reasonably housed if the materials become available in any quantity.  That is not going to be the end of house-building because, if we had a certain standard of houses, I am certain, our standards would rise very quickly.  We have all seen in our own day how the general standard of life has improved and people are not content with it&mdash;they want a higher standard still.  I think trade unions and builders who are connected with the building industry will be cutting their own throats if they try to take advantage of the present situation to drive up housing costs.  I hope the builders will be prepared to do an efficient job at a reasonable price and that the building workers will be prepared to give a reasonable output at a reasonable price.  If we get these two things &mdash;if we have hearty and willing cooperation from both the master builders and the building workers&mdash;we can build houses to let at a reasonable price, even at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say on what terms money from this Fund will be made available to local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The general proposal is this: If there is a scheme of houses that can be completed&mdash;let us take that as an example&mdash;and if the local authority gets a firm and reasonable tender from a builder to complete the houses within a certain specified time the local authority will get the usual pre-1938 subsidy; it will get any loans required from the Local Loans Fund at 2½ per cent., instead of at 4¼ per cent. as in 1938, and over and above that, it will get out of the Transition <Col N="1246" /> Fund, where necessary, a grant&mdash;not a loan&mdash;an absolute grant, sufficient to bring the rent down to a reasonable figure in relation to the present wage income.  The money advanced out of this Transition Development Fund would be by way of outright grant, not by way of loan.</P>
      <P>The only other point that I should reply to is the one regarding the Post Post Office Savings Bank deposits will rissey also referred to old age pensions but we have had that matter out on many occasions here during the last three months.  Deputy Morrissey says that the cutting of the interest rate on the Post Office Savings Bank deposits will result in reduction in thrift.  I hope it will not, that proper thrift will continue.  I do not want to see people thrifty at the expense of their health or the health of their children but, if people can reasonably put away some money to be spent at a more appropriate time, I think they should do so. I believe it is a big encouragement to the poorer section of the community that they are being allowed, in this era of low interest, 2 per cent. for deposits which they can draw upon within a couple of hours' notice by telegram or on a few days' notice over the counter of the post office.  Over £300 it is proposed to pay 1¼ per cent. and, effectively, on, say, a deposit of £500, that means an interest rate of 1.7 per cent.  A person who has £300 and under gets 2 per cent.  A person who has £500 will get 1.7 per cent. interest per annum.  Even a person who has £1,000 in the Post Office Savings Bank, withdrawable on demand, will get a rate of interest of 1.475 per cent&mdash;as near as does not matter to 1½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out in my Budget speech, we have got the agreement of the commercial banks that if loans from the public and the Post Office Savings Bank and receipts from taxation do not meet the outgoings from the Exchequer during the financial year, we will be able to get three months bills from the banks at 1? per cent.; and, having regard to the fact that money going out from the banks in that way is liable to reappear with them on time deposit, to the extent of 80 per cent. of their original <Col N="1247" /> credit, and having regard to the other unavoidable expenses, that rate of 1? per cent. yields a very, very small net percentage of profit towards overheads to the commercial banks.  I do not know whether Deputy Morrissey, before he made his speech to-day, consulted with his colleagues on this matter or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to see that the ordinary people are provided with facilities to put their money on deposit in the Post Office Savings Bank and I want to get it at such a price as will enable me to re-lend at a rate of 2½ per cent. for 50 years in order to get housing going.  In relation to the local loans for these purposes, I want to reduce the actual charges appropriate to 4¼ per cent. for 35 years which were issued up to now and which cost about 2/1½d. per £100 per year, down to 1/4d. per £100 per year.  I think that the Deputy cannot expect me to pay more for money than we get for it out of the local loans.  Those people who do not want to deposit their money in the ordinary commercial banks, who do not want to keep it in the stocking or in the thatch, if they want to deposit up to £300, even for each member of the family, we will give them 2 per cent. on it in the Post Office Savings Bank.  We <Col N="1249" /> intend to issue in the very near future, in substitution for the old savings certificates, a new issue which will give them, on maturity, in 11 years £2/10/1 per cent.; in other words, 16/- rising to £1 in 10 years or to one guinea in 11 years.  I think that those who want to save and invest their money and get interest on it should be very glad to have the option either of placing on day-to-day deposit in the Post Office Saving Bank up to £300 at 2 per cent. or buying savings certificates which will yield them £2 10s. 1d. per cent. in 11 years.  At any rate, in present circumstances we cannot do any better.</P>
      <P>I hope that in present circumstances when goods are in short supply people will not spend their money foolishly, outbidding each other for the supplies that are available.  I wish to goodness that people would give prices a chance to fall in certain respects and that, instead of competing with each other for the short supplies available, they would put their money into the Post Office Savings Bank or into the commercial banks or into the new issue of savings certificates which I hope will be available about the end of the month.</P>

We suggest that the Estimates which are before the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture on the <Col N="1250" /> Order Paper should be taken to-day.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £652,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1947, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, and of certain Services administered by that office, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for this year is just slightly under what it was last year.  It is lower by £6,600.  Sub-head A is higher by £11,000 due mainly to increases in normal increments of salary and additional cost of emergency bonus.  I do not propose to comment on all the sub-heads, only on those which require comment from me.  On sub-head E (1) (b)&mdash;Seed Propagation Division&mdash;this division is concerned with the propagations and experiments in the cultivation of cereals and root seeds at the cereal station, Ballinacurra. At that station pedigree stocks of oats, barley and wheat are grown and distributed each season from it for further propagation in order to improve the standard of purity in cereal crops. There is an organisation known as Pedigree Seed Growers, Ltd., which is composed of two of the principal seed distributors in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They take the pedigree seed from Ballinacurra and, in some cases, from Albert College, Glasnevin, and they continue the growing of this seed for two years more on contract with farmers, and then distribute it usually in a commercial way.  It is anticipated that the company will have over 30,000 barrels of pedigree seed wheat and 25,000 barrels of pedigree seed oats for distribution next year.  Pedigree seed barley has always been dealt with by <Col N="1254" /> Messrs Guinness &amp; Company, Ltd. The pedigree stocks are distributed each year to maltsters and seedsmen for further propagation.  The resulting crops are inspected during the growing season so that very adequate stocks are always available for the growing of barley each year.</P>
    <P>On sub-head E (2)&mdash;Veterinary Research&mdash;the Estimate is up by £5,266. Last year a sum of £7,000 was provided in the Estimate for the acquisition of lands for a new Veterinary Research Institute as was recommended by the Committee of Inquiry on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy.  That money was not used because no suitable place could be got. The provision this year is £12,000, and we are confident that we may be able to get a suitable place this year, and that we may be able to commence making the necessary preparations for this Veterinary Research Institute.</P>
    <P>On sub-head E (3)&mdash;Subscriptions to Various International Research Organisations&mdash;I should like to say just a word about these.  The International Institute of Agriculture in Rome was established as far back as 1905, and was reorganised after the last war.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Deputies were not present; House counted, and 20 Deputies being present&mdash;</i>
    </P>
    <P>The position as regards the future of this institute in Rome is very unsettled at the moment.  There has been a proposal that it should be closed and that the supplying of reliable information on world conditions regarding agricultural production and trade, the progress of agricultural science and practice, including research work in regard to plant diseases and pests, and reports on agricultural co-operation, insurance and credit and other related matters&mdash;that these matters might be more appropriately dealt with by an institute attached to the farm organisation which has been built up in Washington.

      <P>The next organisation is the International Seed-Testing Association of Stockholm.  That is concerned with standard rules for the testing of seeds.  It arranges for triennial international congresses but, of necessity, they have not been held for some six years back.  The association will, however, commence to function now and it will be possible to get any information which is available from other countries on this question of seed-testing.  The International Dairy Federation operates at Brussels.  The annual contribution is only £5 but no contribution has been paid since 1940 because no benefits were being derived. It is not possible to state yet whether the federation will resume its activities but it is probable that it will during this year.  Accordingly, a token provision of £5 is put down.  The next association is the International Veterinary Bureau, Paris.  This is a clearing house for information on animal diseases and in normal times it held an annual conference. The annual contribution is 1,500 French francs which would amount to about £7 10s. 0d. in our case.  The World's Poultry Science Association has headquarters at New York and the annual contribution is £5.  This association provides a link between scientific and practical poultry workers in various countries.</P>
      <P>It arranges for an international poultry congress which, before the war, was held at intervals of three years. This association has resumed its activities, after interruption caused by the war.  The next bodies are the Imperial Mycological Institute, the Imperial Institute of Entomology, the Farnham House Laboratory and the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux.  These associations are under the control of the Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux on which this country is represented by the High Commissioner in London.  The main function of these associations is to collect and disseminate information of value to research workers in the special branch of agricultural science with which they are concerned.</P>

      <P>So far as I know&mdash;I am not certain&mdash;nations which are regarded as belonging to the British Commonwealth of Nations.  For the South American Potato Fund, £164 is provided. That is a contribution towards scientific investigations carried out at Cambridge under the South American Potato Research scheme and the object is the production of potatoes carrying resistance to frost, virus and local climatic diseases.  There is a contribution of £5 to the International Beef Conference which has its quarters in London and is composed of nations which export beef or cattle to the British market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The normal operations of this body were suspended in consequence of the war.  Only a token provision is necessary.  Sub-head E (4) covers miscellaneous investigations, inquiries and reports.  That is required for trials in the production of farm seeds, weed-control trials, etc.  Sub-head F (2) refers to grants to private agricultural schools.  The grant amounts to £20,385, a decrease of £9,497.  That is due to the fact that, in the last financial year, there was a contribution of £9,838 to Copsewood Agricultural College, in County Limerick, towards the erection of new buildings there.  That sum will not be required in the present year.  Provision is made in this Estimate for the recoupment of the salary of a teacher of poultry-keeping and butter-making at St. Michael's School of Domestic Training, Dundrum, County Tipperary. That is a new item.  This contribution was paid up to 1915, but not since.  It is now being revived.  Sub-head F (4) relates to scholarships in agriculture, etc.  A number of scholarships in agriculture, horticulture and dairy science are granted annually by the Department, tenable for one year and <Col N="1258" /> renewable annually, so that a scholar may cover the four-years' course leading to the degree of Bachelor of Agricultural Science or Bachelor of Dairy Science.  The scholarships in agriculture and horticulture are tenable at University College, Dublin, and the scholarship in dairy science at University College, Cork.  The scholarship winners receive free tuition and get a maintenance allowance of £68/6/8 per annum, a free ticket at the beginning of the session to the city and, at the end of the session, a free ticket home.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head G (1)&mdash;Improvement in Milk Production&mdash;there is an increased provision of £2,797.  The provision for the purchase of dairy bulls for leasing or resale at reduced prices, has been increased from £2,000 in 1945/46 to £3,000 in 1946/47.  A provision of £750 is made this year for the first time in respect of the non-pedigree dairy bull bonus scheme.  The recommendations in the report on cattle and dairy herds by the Post-Emergency Committee on Agricultural Policy have, in general, been adopted by me.</P>
    <P>Some of these recommendations were given effect to in 1945.  For example, the value of premiums for registered dairy bulls was increased to the scale recommended in the report; the minimum yields of milk and butter-fat required for the registration of cows in the Department's register of dairy cattle were increased; the remuneration of supervisors of cow-testing associations was increased; courses of lectures for supervisors were given and are to be continued.  In 1946-47 a further recommendation will be implemented by the adoption of a scheme of cash bonuses of £5 payable to owners of licensed non-pedigree and non-premium bulls whose dam and sire's dam have certified milk and butter fat yields of not less than 7,500 lbs. and 260 lbs. respectively.  It was intended to apply this scheme to licensed bulls, the progeny of registered dairy bulls and non-pedigree dairy cows on the existing register and &ldquo;designated&rdquo; cows.  This term &ldquo;designated cow&rdquo; is being applied to cows that would qualify as regards milk production but would not qualify as regards body formation. <Col N="1259" /> It is reckoned that, if this provision were applied in full, it would cost about £5,000.  We had to consider what would be the consequences.  We would be likely to have a number of applications from owners of cows which they might consider would become &ldquo;designated&rdquo;. That would mean an enlargement of cow-testing societies.  We have not got the equipment for them so we cannot proceed with the full scheme for this year.  Accordingly the provision for cash bonuses for 1946-47 does not include the progeny of &ldquo;designated&rdquo; cows.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is a &ldquo;designated&rdquo; cow different from a registered cow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a registered cow would have the body formation as well as the yield.  With regard to sub-head G (2)&mdash;Improvement of Live Stock, with a view to ensuring that adequate numbers of thoroughbred hunter-breeding stallions are available to mare owners at reasonable fees my Department purchases annually a number of good-class thoroughbred horses which are subsequently located with approved stud owners in hunter-breeding districts at reduced prices on condition that the fee for service of nominated mares is not more than £5.  The provision for loss on resale of these stallions has been increased from £2,000 to £3,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next sub-head is G. 3.&mdash;Fertilisers Subsidies.  Under this sub-head last year, we voted £120,000.  That was a very big reduction from the previous year when the Vote was about £500,000. The progressive decline is not due to a reduction in the supplies of fertiliser but is due to lower costs, principally shipping.  To give an instance, in 1943 the average cost of importing pyrites from Spain was £17 18s. 0d. per ton; in 1944 it was £7 7s. 0d. and in 1945 £7 3s. 6d.  In the case of phosphates, in 1943 the cost was £28 1s. 0d. per ton, in 1944 £10 8s. 0d. per ton and in 1945 £8 15s. 0d. per ton.  Owing to these reductions, which were very substantial last year, it was unnecessary to pay any subsidy to manufacturers except a small sum of £14,000 which was paid in respect of the subsidy on Avoca <Col N="1260" /> pyrites.  For the same purpose we include a sum of £10,000 this year.  The cost, of course, of superphosphates to the farmers is being reduced this year and it may be necessary to pay some subsidy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Are imported pyrites much cheaper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They were, slightly.  As regards the actual output of artificial fertilisers for the year up to 30th June, 1945, there was an output of 52,341 tons of 30 per cent. superphosphate. Of compounds of various kinds&mdash;compounds for sugar beet, compound for allotment holders, compound for seed potatoes, etc.&mdash;there was an output of 24,100 tons.  Nitrate of ammonia had an output of 4,756 tons plus 123 tons for seed production.  This year it is estimated that the output of superphosphates will be 62,000 tons.  The output of compounds will be about the same this year as last year&mdash;about 25,000 tons.  It is not possible to get any potash yet, and therefore we are not making any progress as regards compounds.  There is only one grade of compound fertiliser this year.  That is composed of 20 per cent. water soluble phosphate, 2 per cent. citric soluble phosphate, 2 per cent. insoluble phosphate and 4 per cent. nitrogen.  The quantity of nitrate of ammonia to be distributed this year will not be any greater than the quantity distributed last season. We had hoped to import some ground North African phosphate which would be particularly suitable for grass lands in the dairying districts.  Unfortunately it has been impossible to do so up to the present.  We have, as Deputies know, got a small amount of basic slag from Belgium.  It amounted only to 5,000 tons and it has not become generally available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>At what price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not control the distribution of it.  It was not worth while on account of the small amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us some idea of the price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot recollect the price at the moment but I shall be able to give it to the Deputy later on.  We <Col N="1261" /> decided this year not to control the distribution of fertilisers because such control had the effect of delaying distribution somewhat.  As well as that, we thought that supplies would be somewhat higher than they turned out to be.  We did request retailers throughout the country to treat their customers as fairly as they could.  I may say that, as far as I am concerned, I have got no complaints of the way in which retailers treated their customers.</P>
      <P>The next item is sub-head H&mdash;Grants to County Committees of Agriculture. The normal grant amounts to £127,000 and is distributed on the basis of the amount raised by the county councils. Every county is bound to raise a 2d. rate for the county committee purposes, but they may raise more and, in fact, nearly every county is raising more.  If the counties had all stuck to the 2d. rate, the Exchequer would be called on to pay only £73,000, but actually had to pay £127,000.  It will be apparent from that that the counties have gone very much beyond the minimum rate which they were bound to strike.  There is a special temporary grant of £1,500, to provide relief to a small number of counties, some of the poorer counties, which are not able to meet their commitments. There is a special grant to provide lime for agricultural purposes, amounting to £75,000, making a total in grants of £203,530.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lime subsidy scheme, which is administered through the county committees of agriculture, is designed to encourage the production and use of lime for agricultural purposes.  The provision is to enable the county committees to have this lime distributed at reduced prices.  This scheme has been in existence since 1934, but it has operated on a greatly extended scale since the beginning of the emergency. Over the last five years, £400,000 has been made available for this lime scheme.  That has been supplemented by about £100,000 from the funds of the county committees themselves.  Half of that amount is, in turn, paid by the Exchequer.  There is £75,000 included in the scheme for this year and that again will be supplemented by about <Col N="1262" /> £20,000 from the committees' funds. In the counties of Cork and Kerry, this scheme applies to sea sand as well as to lime.  In some counties the scheme is applied to ground lime as well as to burnt lime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be coming back to the lime question again and will deal with it then.  On sub-head K (1)&mdash;Agricultural Societies and Shows&mdash;the provision for the Department's educational exhibit at Royal Dublin Society's and provincial shows has been increased from £100 in 1945-46 to £2,000 in 1946-47.  These exhibits were not shown since 1940 and in that year the provision was £1,050.  Owing to the advance in costs and prices and to the necessity for replacing out-of-date designs, charts, signs, etc., a substantial increase is unavoidable and it is estimated that we will want at least this £2,000.</P>
      <P>Sub-head K (2) deals with the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society.  The grant is the same as last year.  This grant is calculated on the following basis.  There is a fixed grant of £5,959; there is a contribution of £1 for every £1 in excess of £3,000 received by the association by way of affiliation fees and special subscriptions, and that amounts to £2,050; there is a contribution of 10/- for every £1 received by way of individual subscriptions. The last-mentioned item does not operate, as the maximum of £8,000 is reached, in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding sub-head M (4)&mdash;Loans and Grants for Agricultural Purposes. &mdash;the rate of interest is 4½ per cent. on all these loans.  First, there are loans for the purchase of stallions.  I have already explained that these stallions are purchased for the improvement of hunter breeding and they are sold at lower than the purchase price in practically every case.  The buyer is entitled, if he so wishes, to pay one-third of the price down and get the other <Col N="1263" /> two-thirds by way of loan.  He pays his 4½ per cent. on the loan and repays the loan in five equal annual instalments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>What are these hunters costing, on the average?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to £400 and £500 They are thoroughbreds retired from racing.  The next item is loans for the purchase of premium bulls. These loans are issued to persons selected by county committees of agriculture to keep bulls for premium purposes.  The bulls must be passed beforehand by the Department's inspectors.  The borrower in this case pays one-third in cash and gets a loan which he repays in two equal annual instalments.  Then there are loans for hand sprayers, which are paid in the same way.  There are also loans for the purchase of agricultural implements. In the case of implements, the Department puts a limit of £100.  In the case of implements costing more than £100, the borrower is advised to go to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, which deals with such loans. There are also loans for the purchase and erection of poultry-houses and for the purchase of poultry equipment, but only a token provision was made in the Estimates last year for these items, as there was no demand for such loans. It was very hard to get poultry-houses and equipment, but we are expecting applications this year and we are putting in £200 for poultry houses and £500 for equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On sub-head M (9)&mdash;Farm Improvements Scheme&mdash;the provision is £67,000, which is higher than last year. The number of applicants under this scheme would indicate that it is being availed of very widely by farmers throughout the country.  The amount which is voted out of the Unemployment and Emergency Schemes Vote for the cost of works under the farm improvements scheme is £400,000.  The total expenditure was estimated last year at £388,000.  The area reclaimed under that scheme in land, apart from other schemes such as the scheme for the improvement of farmyards, is 16,500 acres and the number of applicants <Col N="1264" /> was 36,000.  The scheme is operated at present on rather simple lines. I do not think I need outline it, because every Deputy is aware of its provisions.  There is a grant given on half the estimated labour cost of the scheme and the works eligible for grants are land reclamation and field drainage; construction or improvement of watercourses; construction or improvement of fences or removal of unnecessary fences which involve waste of ground or impede cultivation; improvement of farmyards, laying of concrete floors in out-offices, erection of concrete stall divisions and concrete feeding troughs in byres and plastering of walls inside byres.  The construction and repair of buildings is excluded. Among the other eligible works are the construction of concrete water tanks, liquid manure tanks, silos and concrete stands for corn stacks; construction or improvement of farm roadways and the construction of cattle enclosures.</P>
    <P>The meaning of this is sometimes obscure to certain applicants.  It is to build walls as shelters for cattle in order to facilitate the making of farmyard manure.  Representations have been made frequently to me that we should bring out-offices under this scheme, but I am afraid we cannot bring them under it because the supervisors we have are not competent to deal with the building of houses or granaries.  There is, however, a committee of officers of the Department examining this question of farm buildings and I think it is possible that a special scheme may be introduced to deal with farm buildings&mdash;such things as the construction of grain lofts, dairies and so on, on the farm.</P>
    <P>We come now to the seed distribution scheme.  With the object of introducing a change of seed among the more needy small-holders in the congested districts, supplies of seed potatoes, oats, wheat, barley and rye are distributed each year in those areas at approximately half the cost.  The object is to renew the seed for the farmers in these areas and help them to get the best possible crop.  The scheme applies to every land holder in the congested districts provided he lives out of the land and his valuation <Col N="1265" /> does not exceed £25.  Where the demand for seeds exceeds the amount available for any particular district, preference is given to the smaller holders.  The maximum quantity supplied to any one applicant is 1 cwt. in the case of grain and 2 cwts. in the case of potatoes.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M (10) deals with the potato reserve scheme, which has been in operation for the last two or three years.  About three years ago there was a shortage of potatoes in Dublin before the new potatoes came in.  Since that we have purchased a quantity of potatoes during the early spring and held them in reserve to meet any shortage that might occur.  This year, however, though we did some purchasing of potatoes, it was fairly evident there was no danger of a shortage as time went on and the potatoes were resold to the Minister of Food in Great Britain.  There will be no loss on the transaction.</P>
    <P>O (3) covers the administration of orders controlling the spread of blackscab disease and the importation of plants with a view to preventing the introduction of diseases or pests.  This scheme applies in particular to areas where certified seed potatoes are being grown, in an effort to get the sale of vigorous, disease-free seeds.  During the emergency quantities of seed potatoes and early potatoes surplus to home needs were exported to Great Britain. From the 1945 crop we did resume to a small extent the export of seed potatoes to continental countries.  We hope now to be in a position to build up again the foreign trade that we had in potatoes.</P>
    <P>The Colorado Beetle comes under this.  This pest spread in many countries during the war and, naturally, we took every possible precaution to keep it from coming into this country. Orders were made placing a restriction on the imporation of plants, trees, bulbs, raw vegetables, etc., from all countries.</P>
    <P>O (4) provides for the remuneration of part-time veterinary examiners.  The amount is increased by £3,375.  This increase is required to meet the cost of veterinary examination facilities at Dublin Corporation abattoir in connection <Col N="1266" /> with the canning industry and the cost of increased activities at various factories.  I will have something to say later on about the canning industry.</P>
    <P>O (5) relates to the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Acts.  The provision is practically the same as in 1945-46. Under sub-head O (6) we deal with the Acquisition of Land (Allotments) (Amendment) Act.  There is a reduction here in the provision made for free seeds, manures, implements, etc.  The allotment scheme is proceeding quite satisfactorily.  It was slightly down last year compared with the previous year. However, there is a fair number of allotments being worked.  There were 28,238 cultivated in 1945 compared with 30,000 in 1944.  I do not know what the 1946 figure will be.</P>
    <P>O (7) refers to the Flax Act, 1936.  It is the same figure as last year.  The area under flax in 1945 increased to 32,800 acres.  The crop was purchased by the British Ministry of Supply at prices ranging from 25/- to 30/- per stone for retted, scutched flax.  The prices arranged with the Ministry for the 1946 crop are from 20/- to 25/- per stone, with an addition of 1/6d. per stone for turbine scutched flax.  It is down by 5/- a stone for ordinary retted flax, but there will be an addition of 1/6d. where the turbine is used.</P>
    <P>In O (10)&mdash;Emergency Powers (Tillage) Orders&mdash;there is a decrease of £4,305.  This is due to a reduction in the estimate of the number of entry cases, or the direct action cases that will be necessary during 1946.  The number of staff has increased owing to the fact that some of the inspectors we have had from the Land Commission on loan have been recalled by that Department to resume their normal activities in the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Under Appropriations-in-Aid, the receipts from sales of cattle and farm produce at the National Stud Farm were substantial in 1945-46, but corresponding receipts in 1946-47 will go to the company, that is, as soon as the Stud Farm is handed over to the company which, I expect, will be at the end of this month.  The fee for a threshing mill licence is 10/-.  The number of annual licences issued by the <Col N="1267" /> end of February, 1946, to owners of threshing mills operating for hire was 2,088.  The Emergency Powers (No. 366) Order, 1945, made by the Government on 9th October, 1945, requires every occupier of five or more statute acres of arable land to till in the year 1946, 37½ per cent. of such land, according to the county in which the farm is situated.  He is compelled to sow with wheat one-tenth, one-sixteenth or one-twenty-fifth, as the case may be.  He is entitled to have first year's grass counted as part of the tillage quota up to one-fourth of what is cultivated.</P>
    <P>The work of inspecting holdings continued, and during the year 1945 more than 24,000 holdings not previously inspected were reported on.  The total number of holdings inspected from the beginning of the tillage campaign up to the end of 1945 is approximately 125,000.  The Department of Industry and Commerce in its issue of statistics compiled for 1945 shows that 662,498 acres were under wheat, out of a total of 2,474,314 acres under tillage.  The amount of wheat grown in 1945 exceeded the amount in any previous year up to the end of May.  Wheat delivered for milling amounted to 2,814,000 barrels or about 394,000 barrels more than were delivered at the same period last year.  The quantity of pedigree seed wheat assembled by Messrs Pedigree Seed Growers, Ltd., was 7,000 barrels of winter varieties, and 31,000 barrels of spring varieties. The resale price of this wheat varied from 89/- per barrel, including carriage, for lots of over 1,000 barrels, to 96/- per barrel, including carriage, for lots of less than eight barrels.  The number of barrels of barley delivered out of the 1945 acreage was something about 600,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in any place in particular; all over the country.  The amount of barley delivered for malting was about 600,000 barrels.  It was all required.  There was no surplus barley this year either for incorporation in bread or for brewing purposes.  As regards oats, there was no fixed price. There was a minimum price of 21/- <Col N="1268" /> per barrel, but we discontinued that because it was in no way effective, and no indication of what the price of oats should be.  Licences were granted for the importation of small quantities of pedigree seed wheat and oats from the United Kingdom in cases where the necessary export licence was granted by the Board of Trade.  A small quantity of seed wheat was also imported from Sweden.  There was a partial failure last year in the production of native rye grass, and, to make up the deficiency, we had to get some supplies from the United States of America.  There were small quantities of oil cakes, linseed, cotton seed and sunflower seed received.  These came from the United States and were brought in by Messrs. Animal Feeding Stuffs, Eire, Ltd., and distributed by that company under the direction of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>To date we got about 33,000 tons of maize.  I informed the Dáil that we had purchased over 100,000 tons and that so far we had got 33,000.  This quantity has been held in store and it is hoped to begin to release it now. It should be reaching the maize millers next week.  We propose to release about 10,000 tons a month during the coming three or four months until native grain is available.  We got 20,000 tons of American oats for animal feeding to supplement home grown supplies. In addition, the Department of Industry and Commerce brought in 15,000 tons of Canadian oats for oatmeal millers.</P>
      <P>As regards the agricultural machinery position, supplies of tractors are not quite as ample as I thought they would be.  This is due, of course, to the position in Europe which is still making heavy demands on manufacturers in Great Britain, America and Canada.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been lucky to obtain a consignment of American tractors on rubber, which were very useful.  The more recent Ford tractors being imported are also on rubber, and some other makers' machines are also rubber shod.  The tendency is, to as great an extent as possible, to get back to the rubber tyred machine, but it is not possible to have all tractors coming in with rubber wheels.  Tractor ploughs are made to some extent by Pierce of <Col N="1269" /> Wexford and also by Cockshutt, International, Fisher Humphries and Oliver. There should be no difficulty getting tractor ploughs.  As regards reapers and binders, McCormick and Deering. Cockshutt and Albion machines will be available in better supply than last year.  We also expect Massey-Harris binders.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a good supply.  There is a bigger demand than was expected for disc harrows, but there are many more applicants than the supply can meet.  We hope that the scarcity of these particular machines will be met in the coming year.  Horse-drawn machinery is now in good supply.  I have not heard for a long time complaints about the difficulty of getting supplies of harrows, mowing machines, corn drills, rakes and other horse-drawn machinery.  There will be a bigger supply of threshing machines, though not enough. We may get 200 this year.  I think 100 are already in.  There will be a fair supply of knapsack sprayers and a better supply of scythes. The spare-part position is good, but it would help if farmers would look for spare parts in time, and not leave that to the last moment, as it may take some time to find out where spare parts can be got.  There should be enough spare parts if we get time to look round to see where they are.</P>
      <P>It was found possible during the year to revoke the Emergency Powers (Acquisition and Disposal of Agricultural Machinery) Order, 1943, with the result that there is no control by the Department of the distribution of any farm machinery.  Each applicant, therefore, should deal with the merchant with whom he is accustomed to deal if he wants any agricultural machines.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the position, now that the Order has been withdrawn, is that they are free to sell.  I am not sure if I am correct in that reply, but I think that is the position.  Kerosene <Col N="1270" /> for tractors is in better supply and the keeping of logs is now considered unnecessary. It was also found possible recently to make an allowance of kerosene for stationary pulping and chopping machines.  This is something for which farmers have been looking for a long time.  The one thing we still find difficult, and in fact impossible, to get is a better supply of coal for blacksmiths. The position has not improved so far as that is concerned, and the quantity of culm available has a direct bearing upon the output of lime which it is so desirable to increase, but we are considering other measures with regard to lime to which I will refer later on when dealing with the White Paper.  During the past year, the output of farmers' boots has been increased&mdash;it is scarcely a matter for my Department but it is very often raised on this Estimate&mdash;and the quality also has improved.  There has also been a supply of rubber boots, but not enough to go round.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to cartridges is somewhat better.  I have found that in some cases, where farmers could not get cartridges for agricultural purposes, if they had gone to another merchant, they might have been able to get them; in other words, some merchants seem to have better supplies than others.  Farmers should look around and should not come to the conclusion, if they are refused in one place, that they are not available elsewhere.  The binder twine position is quite good, except that we shall have to continue the restriction on its use for any purpose other than the tying of corn.  The horse shoe and horse-shoe nail position is also better, but again the supply must be used economically. We should, however, have enough for our needs.  The position with regard to sacks has not improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the years 1943-44, 1944-45 and 1945-46, and also for 1946-47, the fertiliser credit scheme was and will be in operation.  For every barrel of wheat delivered for milling or to a seed assembler, the grower is entitled to a docket crediting him with so much off the price of artificial manures as soon as artificial manures become freely available.  We hope that, in the coming spring, we may be able to commence <Col N="1271" /> to operate this scheme, to cash the vouchers, or at least to give a cash docket for the vouchers issued in 1943-44 which can be used by the purchasers of artificial manures during the coming spring.  If the acreage of wheat is somewhat the same as last year, for these years, including 1946-47, there will be about £1,500,000 to the credit of farmers which should help them in their purchases of artificial manures during the next three or four years, if we are in a position to give them credit now which they must get sometime for these vouchers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is to give them back one year each year.  We will give back the 1943-44 dockets in 1947.  There is a slight upward trend in the number of pigs sent to bacon factories last year.  It was about 17 per cent. higher than in 1944.</P>
      <P>I want to say something now about canned meat.  In November, 1941, the British Ministry of Food arranged for the purchase of all canned meat exported from this country, and, shortly afterwards, intimated that they would require a definite certificate on each can to the effect that it had been inspected and passed by this Department. They required similar certificates in respect of canned meat brought in from every other country. We had, therefore, to establish a system of inspection and certification, and this has necessitated, amongst other things, the setting up of a central laboratory where samples of each batch are sent for bacteriological examination.  We also had to keep veterinary surgeons to examine the animals and the meat after the animals had been killed and to see that the processing, packing and so on were properly carried out.  These veterinary surgeons had to be kept at each canning factory, but the expenditure involved does not come on the Department, because there is a slight levy on the canners to meet the expenses of this inspection.  The levy is very small &mdash;only one-twenty-fourth of a penny on each 1-lb. can of meat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> This has become a very big business. The total quantity of canned meat&mdash; stewed steak and ox tongue&mdash;exported during the year 1945 was 14,410 tons&mdash; a substantial increase on the 1944 figure of 8,300 tons.  The value of these exports in 1945 was £1,898,000.  In the previous year, it was just over £1,000,000.  Usually the canners have to close down at this time of the year because the class of cattle they take are not readily available during these scarce months, but they will commence again in July, and the Government intend to send 4,000 tons of canned steak to the Continent under a relief scheme.  We expect, in addition, to be able to give about 10,050 tons of canned meat to the British Ministry of Food.  The price paid is 14/5¾ per dozen 1 lb. cans landed in Great Britain.  This price has been fixed again for the coming year, but it is subject to the canners' costs, so far as the material in the cans and packages is concerned, remaining as they are.</P>
    <P>There are 10 firms in the business, seven of them being located in Dublin. The trade provides a good deal of employment, and, so far as the farmer is concerned, provides an outlet for a certain type of beast which it would not be so easy to market otherwise. The animals are good, healthy cows, but on the old side&mdash;cattle which are not first-class as regards finish and so on for beef.  They are second-class cattle of all kinds&mdash;healthy, of course&mdash; which would not get a very good price were it not for this canning business. The export programme for this year will absorb about 100,000 cattle, which is a very considerable item.  With regard to dressed beef, we exported, in 1945, 76,000 cwts. of beef and veal and 2,700 cwts. of mutton and lamb. In the case of beef, the figure was slightly higher than in 1944, but, in the case of mutton and lamb, it was lower.  No pork was exported, because there is a prohibition against its export.</P>

      <P>All this dressed meat goes to Great Britain.  The prices payable by the British Ministry of Food for dressed meat are related to those fixed <Col N="1273" /> by the Ministry for our live fat animals of the same classes and, as in the case of the latter, they vary seasonally. Before prices for fat cattle were fixed by the British authorities for the 12 months ending 30th June, 1946, representations were made for higher prices for our fat cattle and also for dressed meat.  As a result, we got an increase of ½d. per lb. for A quality cattle and A quality dressed meat.</P>

      <P>I am afraid there would not be for dressed meat.  The possibility of sending dressed meat to the nearer continental markets is being investigated, and it is possible that with modern technique we may be able in the future to send dressed meat to the markets on the nearer parts of the Continent.</P>
      <P>The export trade in cattle in 1945 showed a considerable improvement compared with the previous year and the big carry-over of cattle at the beginning of 1945 has now more or less completely disappeared.  At the beginning of this year we had exports to some of the continental countries. Some of these exports were on the relief scheme for the Continent, but the greater part of the exports was on an ordinary commercial basis.  We exported 6,700 cattle and 1,000 milch cows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment that trade has practically ceased because of the scarcity of beef in the home market.  However, it is anticipated that it will be resumed about the 1st of July.  The shipment of store cattle was 14 per cent. higher in 1945 than in 1944 and there was an increase of 2/6 per live cwt. on Irish bred cattle which were more than two <Col N="1274" /> months in Great Britain; that of course was reflected in the price here of store cattle.  The price of store cattle was good on the whole during the year 1945.  The ratio of heifers to bullocks sent out in 1945 was lower than usual.  That may be regarded as a favourable sign as to the future of the dairying industry here.  There was only a small increase in the number of fat cattle going to the Ministry of Food even though there was a ½d. per pound increase.  The price for our fat cattle, which are killed immediately on landing in Great Britain, varied from 10¼d. in October to 1s. 0½d. in June.  This is the highest price we have been able to induce the Ministry of Food to give us up to the moment at any rate.  The export of dairy cows and in-calf heifers was not as high as it could have been. There is a quota in regard to this particular item&mdash;that is, dairy cows and in-calf heifers&mdash;imposed by the British authorities.  We get licences to issue here, but those licences were not all taken up in the year 1945.  We could have got 62,500 licences but we actually only exported 41,800 cows and springers.  The number of sheep being exported recently is very small&mdash;82,000 sheep were exported during the year as compared with 47,000 the previous year. The majority of these sheep were exported to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The improvement in the marketing of eggs, which was shown in 1944, was maintained in 1945, notwithstanding the continuance of the emergency conditions. Production increased during the year.  There was a marked increase in home consumption coupled with an increase in the export of eggs.  This must be considered satisfactory, particularly in relation to the low production we had during the autumn months owing to the great scarcity of feeding stuffs.  Very good headway was made in exports for the remainder of the year.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out to producers that the more we export the more we will get per dozen or per great hundred of eggs and we realised a higher price on our exports in 1945 than in 1944.  The average price paid to producers was maintained on the 1944 level&mdash;that is, 2/1 per dozen.  The <Col N="1275" /> price never fell below 2/- per dozen, and at the scarce times it reached 2/9; the price averaged over the whole year 2/1 per dozen.  This price could not be maintained on the price which is received from the British Ministry of Food.  The price paid in 1945-46 by the Ministry of Food was 24/9 per great hundred, and this would not allow the people concerned to give the producers more than 1/11 per dozen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It comes from turkeys and poultry.  That is quite right.  There was a scarcity of eggs on the market here during the winter months of 1943-44.  That scarcity began in the late autumn and the early winter. Last year we took steps to store a certain quantity of eggs during the months of September and October and they were subsequently put on the market during the scarce period as &ldquo;harvest eggs&rdquo;.  They proved a great boon to consumers and the shortage of eggs was hardly felt at all as a result. The quantity of dead poultry exported in 1945 showed a slight decrease on the previous year.  Under the special cockerel scheme producers <Col N="1276" /> were paid 2/2 a lb. to 2/4 a lb. live weight according to the season; and other fowl realised an average of about 10d. per lb.  That 2/2 per lb. could not of course be paid economically on the price we received from Great Britain.  From Great Britain we received 1/7½ per lb. dead weight, and that would work out at about 1/2 per lb. live weight; but when the prices are averaged up&mdash;that is 2/2 per lb. for cockerels to as low as 10d. per lb. for other kinds of fowl&mdash;it works out all right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to agricultural education, advanced courses are available at the two university colleges to which I have already referred in dealing with the question of scholarships. In addition to that, there are three residential agricultural schools &mdash;one at Ballyhaise, County Cavan, one at Athenry, County Galway, and one at Clonakilty, County Cork. These schools are intended mainly for the instruction of farmers' sons who are interested in husbandry. It is anticipated that there will soon be accommodation for another 30 to 40 pupils at Johnstown Castle, County Wexford.  Great difficulty was experienced in fitting this out as a school owing to emergency conditions and because of the impossibility of having electric current brought a long distance to the school.  It was found impossible to do the necessary reconstruction work desirable there, but we hope that during the coming year we will be able to carry out that work.  We have already started a small school of horticulture there and it has been found possible to fit in a small number of students in the old building as it stands.  In addition to that there are four other schools; one is run by the Franciscan Brothers at Mount Bellew, two by the Salesian Fathers, one at Pallaskenry, County Limerick, and one at Warrenstown, <Col N="1277" /> County Meath, and there is St. Patrick's Agricultural College at Monaghan, run by the Diocesan Clergy.  These colleges provide similar courses to those provided by the Department's own schools. They receive financial assistance by way of recoupment of teachers' salaries and capitation grants in respect of the number of eligible pupils.  In recent years there has been a great demand for institutions of this kind and I think we have about double the number of pupils there now that were going to these colleges and schools, say, 15 years ago.  But even yet we have not got sufficient accommodation although I would not say it would take very much further accommodation to meet the demand now. We hope, when the emergency is over, to reconstruct the schools at Athenry and Clonakilty and it may be necessary, in addition, to provide even further schools.  We have the Munster Institute for girls in Cork where rural domestic economy instructors are trained in poultry keeping, dairying and so on.  There are nine or ten schools of rural domestic economy for girls who go for a year's course and return to their homes to look after poultry and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few <Col N="1278" /> words in regard to the White Papers. The first White Paper deals with a guaranteed market and price for dairy produce.  There is not very much that I need say as regards this White Paper because I think it is very explanatory with regard to the future prices and guaranteed prices for milk products. It deals only, of course, with the price of milk delivered to creameries but it is expected that that will automatically regulate the price of milk elsewhere. One point that is mentioned is that if there is a surplus for export it is not intended that it should be financed by the consumer in this country, as it was in the past.  In 1932, when the world price for butter fell very disastrously, I brought a Bill before the Dáil which was passed as the Dairy Produce (Stabilisation) Act.  Under that Act the home consumer was charged a regulated price for butter and the creamery was enabled, therefore, by getting a higher price at home, to subsidise the export of butter where butter was sold on the foreign market cheaper than it was sold at home.  We do not know&mdash;indeed we are not too sanguine &mdash;that there will be an export of butter in the next five years.  This scheme refers, of course, to the coming five years.  Certainly there will not be any export for a year or two.  We may, however, perhaps, increase our production considerably in the course of two or three years and we might be looking for an export market again but if, by any chance, the price on the export market is less than would give this guaranteed price to the creamery, then the difference will be made good by the Exchequer.  So that the Exchequer is, therefore, taking the risk of subsidising exports for at least five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I should like to mention is this: paragraph 17 says that the costs to the dairy farmer come under many headings.  We are not concerned here with anything like a fixed cost; for instance, the rent he pays for his land.  We are only taking the costs that are likely to very over the next five years.  There are certain costs, of course, that may very a bit, such as the steel for shoes for the horse.  That might vary but it has such little influence in the aggregate on the production <Col N="1279" /> of milk that we say it is not worth while bringing that in.  The big thing that is likely to affect the farmer is the cost of winter feeding and, therefore, we take the cost of winter feeding and say that we will take that as a variable; if that goes down or up we will have to change the price of milk accordingly.  We take three items&mdash; roots, hay and concentrates.  The roots do not matter very much, because they are invariably produced by the farmer himself, and we say they are worth £1. They are not likely to vary very much. We take hay.  We must have some way of finding out what the index price of hay would be from year to year.  We found on going into this matter that the only place where hay is quoted officially, constantly, is the Dublin market but, of course, hay is very dear in the Dublin market.  We thought if we took half the price in the Dublin market it would be a fair average.  As a matter of fact, I should like to point out that it is fairer to the farmer that we should take half the price in the Dublin market because if the price of hay goes down in the next three or four years his index will not go down so rapidly.  Therefore, we take half the price in Dublin as the index to be followed in the hay item of this cost. Then we take concentrates&mdash;1½ cwts. of crushed oats, at the moment, and ½ cwt. meatmeal, because they are the only things available.  We say in the White Paper that was issued that we will take all cereals as time goes on. For instance, if bran and pollard are on the market, freely available and cheaper, then they will be taken.  If maize is freely available on the market and cheaper, it will be taken but some cereal that could be properly substituted for oats, as far as the cow is concerned, will be taken and the index price calculated from year to year. The same applies to meatmeal.  The average price for the whole year will be taken.  For instance, take 1946.  We will take the average price of hay on the Dublin market for the whole year 1946 and when the year 1946 is complete we will compare that price with the price for 1945 and, if it was lower, that will be taken into account; if it <Col N="1280" /> was higher it will be taken into account.  The same applies to oats or any substitute for oats, and to meatmeal. That is how the farmers' price will be calculated from year to year.</P>
    <P>There was some criticism that a farmer could not feed a cow during the winter on 1½ cwt. of oats and half cwt. of meatmeal.  I wish to goodness every creamery farmer would give every cow in his possession that amount of oats and meatmeal during the winter and I guarantee that we would have much more butter in this country. Naturally, we are not dealing here with the 700- or 800-gallon cow and especially the winter producing cow.  We are dealing practically exclusively with summer producing cows and cows of not a very high standard.  As a matter of fact, we are taking a cow of 550 gallons as the standard.  Take a Limerick farmer supplying milk to a creamery.  If he has, say, 20 cows&mdash; these cows will probably be calving from March up to May&mdash;and if he gives them the amount of concentrates that we have here for even six weeks before they calve they will be a good lot better treated in the future than they have been in the past.  In any case the quantity we are taking here is only a factor.  Whether the cow is getting 6 cwt. or 2 cwt. of oats, it is the fact of whether the oats are going up or going down that matters to the farmer. It will make very little difference what quantity is put in so far as his price is concerned.</P>

      <P>No.  Certain farmers we discussed it with were inclined to say: &ldquo;Do not put them in.&rdquo;  I suppose they had some hope that if there was any movement it would be downwards not upwards.  I think they were wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we come to the reorganisation of the pig and bacon industries.  In the beginning of paragraph 20 I think the whole reason is summed up in one sentence why it is considered necessary to do anything at all.  It says: &ldquo;In view of the highly competitive conditions that are likely to prevail in the foreign market when the world supply of pigs becomes plentiful and of the unsatisfactory position obtaining in the <Col N="1281" /> pig, pork and bacon industries,&rdquo; the first task assigned to the departmental committee was this question of dealing with pigs and bacon.  That was the big object I had in mind anyway in asking some committee or commission to examine this question of pigs and bacon and to give advice as to how we are to be put in a position to compete to the best of our ability anyway, on the foreign market when pigs become plentiful.  After all, we could pull along as we are if we had no hope of having exports again.</P>
    <P>I am afraid, however, that when normal conditions are restored, if they are restored, and when we will be back to the position we were pre-war of countries offering bacon to unwilling buyers, and not, as at the moment, willing buyers looking for unwilling sellers, we will have to be very well equipped, first of all, to go on to the foreign market and, secondly, to hold it and everything we can do to make economies in all the various steps from the time the pig is produced on the farm until the side of bacon reaches the consumer in some foreign country will be necessary.  We will have to be very insistent also as to the quality of the product if we want to get that market and hold it.</P>
    <P>It is explained here that the Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy Committee in issuing their final report, which they called their comprehensive report, on tillage, etc., felt that a number of them could not give any more time to this work that they had been on for some years.  They had lost a lot of time, a couple of days a week on the average, and they felt they could not go on any longer.  Therefore they advised that some sort of committee should be set up to deal with a number of objects which they enumerated, one of them being this question of pigs and bacon.  Therefore I set up a committee of three in the Department and asked them to examine this pigs and bacon question first.</P>

      <P>There were two inspectors, Mr. O'Mahony and Mr. Duffy and an administrative officer, Mr. Nagle.  One <Col N="1282" /> of the things they laid down was that there should be an accurate estimation of market requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>No.  The Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy Committee dealt with the tillage one and they recommended what you will find at the back of the White Paper.  As a matter of fact, if the pigs and bacon one had come out after the other one, it would be less confusing.  It came out too soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>How did you arrive at your policy from the three reports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the officers of the Department who were dealing with that particular line of tillage for their comments.  Having got all their comments, I would get them to discuss the matter and I would say: &ldquo;I agree with that,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I do not agree with that,&rdquo; and then the thing is drafted. It is not a committee, however.  They say that there should be an accurate estimation of market requirements and the direction of pig production, bacon production and the pork trade accordingly, mainly by means of price control.  That is an extremely difficult thing to do.  It is a grand objective if you could do it, but I am afraid it is a thing we could never achieve.  The old way of affecting the number of pigs in the country was that by lowering the price you got fewer pigs eventually, and by raising the price you got more pigs eventually.  To do it by direction and legislation is extremely difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point is, I think, a matter that certainly should be part of any scheme: &ldquo;Acceptance at all times of all pigs offered by producers for slaughter.&rdquo;  That was a defect in the system that was working from 1933 until 1939; that is the quota system. <Col N="1283" /> If you have quotas and each factory is working under a quota, if the quota is full and pigs are offered, they must refuse them.  There was a scheme under which the producer's pigs would be taken by officers of the board and directed to another factory; but the farmer did not like that and therefore he sometimes brought the pigs home. As I say, that was a necessary part of the scheme brought in in 1933.  If we can get away from that as a necessary part of the new scheme, it will be a great matter, so that all pigs offered by producers for slaughter will be taken, whether offered at a fair, market or factory.</P>
    <P>The next point is: &ldquo;Payment of an assured price for pigs over as long a period as possible, such price to be announced well in advance.&rdquo;  I do not think that is so difficult: that the price of pigs will be announced and that the producer will get his price.  The next point is that, no matter what part of the country a producer is in, he will get this official price.  I agree with that.  When I come to the recommendations the Government have accepted in the White Paper I will be able to state what is necessary to achieve some of these objects.</P>
    <P>As to the next point:&mdash;&ldquo;Arrangement of a satisfactory flat transport rate for all live pigs,&rdquo;  I think that is not difficult to arrange.  Then the next is: &ldquo;Securing that all pigs for slaughter are bought on a weight basis and that grading is so designed as to encourage production of pigs of good body conformation and their marketing at appropriate weight and condition.&rdquo; That will be necessary if we are to keep up the quality and to get proper grading in connection with the bacon produced in this country, whether for home or for export.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>You can only do that on a dead-weight basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The next objective is: &ldquo;Reduction of processing costs to the minimum.&rdquo;  Of course that is the big object we have in view, to make all the economies we can.  The next point is to ensure that the small producers in poor parts of the country will get <Col N="1284" /> cheap feeding stuffs.  Paragraph (k) deals with the centralised sale of bacon, pork and live pigs on the export market.  That, I am afraid, is a very difficult problem.  Paragraph (1) refers to the provision of effective machinery for prompt expansion or reduction of output as circumstances may require.  I do not know how that is going to be done.  If it could be done, of course, it would be very nice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It ought not to be necessary to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I do not know.  It should not be, I suppose.  Keeping these objects in view the Government say that we should set up a board.  All it says about a board is that there should be an independent chairman, and that the board should have on it representatives of the curers and representatives of the producers.  I should, of course, say to Deputies that the idea of issuing a White Paper is to give the Government opinion of what should be done so that it might hear in advance what the criticisms of its proposals are. If there is criticism which the Government thinks is well justified it can change the system to suit the view put forward and then bring a Bill in.  If the Bill were brought in first it would not be so easy to change the whole foundation of it even though one heard fairly good criticism of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the points which the Government is laying down as the future policy in regard to pigs and bacon.  I have referred to the headings which deal with the small matters.  I now come to the others.  It is proposed to give the board power to acquire and operate or close any bacon-curing factory that may be offered for sale.  The board can erect new factories where, in its opinion, they are needed, and it can control the sale or transfer of bacon factories.  These, of course, are very big functions to give to the board. I think they are necessary if the board is to do very much good or effect an improvement in the whole industry. The board will also have to sanction the transfer or sale of a factory by one curer to another, or it can transfer or sanction the sale of a factory by a curer to some outside person who comes <Col N="1285" /> in.  The board may not sanction it; it may refuse to sanction it.  It may say that it will buy the factory itself. That is not set out in the White Paper. There is no great detail in the White Paper.  It only sets out the principles on which legislation will be based. That, of course, would be provided in the Bill.  If a curer wants to sell a factory and the board wants to buy it, both parties will try to agree upon a price.  If they do not agree upon the price there must be some system of arbitration.</P>
    <P>There are areas in the country where is has been claimed by the people concerned that new factories are necessary. I think myself that the areas in which that claim could be justified would number very few.  There may be one or two areas.  The board, in order to get the most economical working in the bacon industry, may say that it would be good business to build a factory in certain places.  If the board so wishes it can do so.  Again, if it buys a factory which it thinks is not necessary in a particular place it can close it down.  The board will have power to buy factories, to build factories or to run factories.  If it builds or buys a factory and decides to run it, it will have the power to do so.</P>
    <P>The next point deals with amalgamations. In certain cities and towns you have more than one factory.  It appears to be rather wasteful and uneconomic to have two, three or four factories in one town or city.  It would appear that one well-constructed modern factory would be very much more economical to run, and that, consequently, savings would be made in the industry.  If the board comes to that conclusion about any particular town or city it may serve notice on the proprietors of the factories concerned to the effect that they ought to amalgamate. It can advise them strongly to come together and try to negotiate an amalgamation of two, three or four factories.  If these proprietors agree to amalgamate then, of course, everything will be all right, but if they are unreasonable in their refusal to amalgamate&mdash;they will get plenty of time to think about it because it is not intended that these things should be <Col N="1286" /> rushed&mdash;the board will have power to approach the Minister for Agriculture, and say that, in its opinion, it is necessary and essential for the smooth and economical working of the industry that an amalgamation should take place between certain factories in a certain town or city.  If the Minister for Agriculture thinks that the board has a good case he can say: &ldquo;Well, I agree with you, but I must get both the Dáil and the Seanad to agree before any compulsion of that kind can be used.&rdquo;  A scheme will be put before the Dáil and the Seanad, setting out where the factories are and the lines on which amalgamation is proposed by the board: that is, in what proportion the shares in the new company, to be formed from the three or four existing factories, will be held by the existing factories, and stating where the new factory should be located and which of the existing ones should be closed down.  That scheme will be presented to the Dáil and the Seanad, and if it is approved, then the board will have power to go ahead and put it through. Naturally, if there is amalgamation of that kind and if, say, three factories are amalgamated, only one will then be working.  The other two can be closed down.</P>
    <P>Probably the most important provision in the scheme outlined in this White Paper is the purchase and allocation of all pigs offered for slaughter.  I have come to the conclusion, and I have come to it, I must say, on the evidence submitted to me by those who have been working this scheme&mdash;not only members of the board but some curers too&mdash;that a fixed price can never be enforced for pigs unless there is a system of buying, unless, in other words, the board does all the buying of pigs itself.  Now that may appear a very unwieldy and a very drastic system for a start-off, but I think it can be worked in a reasonable way.  There are at present 39 factories.  The pigs normally come in to them from the farms in their areas.  I do not know how many fairs and markets are held in the country, but there must be a great number.  If a farmer has been accustomed to bring his pigs to a <Col N="1287" /> certain fair or market he should be allowed to continue to do so, that is, if the fair or market is of any size.  It might be unreasonable to expect a buyer to attend specially if only four or five or a dozen pigs are usually offered at a market.  The board, in undertaking this system of buying all pigs, will have a representative at every factory and at every fair and market, and these representatives will buy the pigs.  That is the only way, in my opinion, in which a fixed price can be enforced.  There is no doubt whatever about it that in the past&mdash;I believe that this was not the only country that had this experience&mdash; when the price for pigs was considered a bit too high by the curers, they were able to get the pigs cheaper by various subterfuges.  A farmer goes in with a lorry load of pigs.  He is told by the curer that he cannot take them.  In the curer's estimation, the official price is too high.  This unfortunate farmer, after hiring his lorry, goes out and sees a man standing outside the gate.  He may or may not know that he is a pig buyer.  In reply to this man, he says that the bacon curer will not take the pigs.  He says he will buy them.  But there is an understanding between the curer and the buyer.</P>
    <P>There are curers who are capable of working a system of that kind.  On the other hand, when pigs are scarce and curers are competing for them, they will give more than the fixed price.  But that increase may not go to the farmer who suffered in the other case.  If we want to enforce a fixed price for pigs at all times, the only way to do it, in my opinion, is to have this board doing all the buying.  The next point is that the board should regulate the marketing of pigs, bacon, pork, and pig products.  In that, a number of things are involved The committee speak about paying a price according to grade and about the provision of reasonable uniformity of product. They also mention this question of export.  At present, we are not producing sufficient bacon for ourselves and the consumer will buy any bacon he can get without complaint. <Col N="1288" /> If the time ever comes when importing countries will have a choice of bacon from exporting countries, we shall have to be careful in having a certain uniform market.  That was what affected us very badly before the last war. When I asked a group of bacon wholesalers who came over here on a visit what the faults of our bacon were, they said that it was the best bacon they could get but that they could never get the side they wanted.  If they ordered a hundred sides of bacon of a certain type and a certain weight from our curers, they said that they could not get that type of bacon, that they might get four or five sides of that type and then sides of other types.  In the case of the bigger exporting countries, they could get any number of sides to any specification they might lay down.  When exporting again, we must have regard to the uniformity of the article and that can only be done by giving the board power to fix the price according to grade.  Secondly, it is necessary to have some control over the factories as regards the type of article they produce and, thirdly, it is desirable to have control over the export market so that one agency can do all the exporting.  In that way, there will be a better chance of a reasonable quantity of any particular type and of a reasonable variety when any order comes from an importing country.  Those are the points that arise in that White Paper.</P>
    <P>I now pass on to the White Paper issued this morning.  That Paper deals with tillage, crops, pastures, fertilisers and feeding stuffs.  The Committee on Post-emergency Agriculture issued a number of interim reports dealing with veterinary services, dairy produce and egg production.  Then, it came on to the question I have just mentioned.  It gave a great deal of time to these questions, and, in the end, found it impossible to get unanimity amongst the members on the questions concerned.  Accordingly, we had a majority report and two minority reports.  We examined those reports in the Department.  I took what I thought was best in them and made certain recommendations to the Government.  I should like to deal, first, with the tillage point, because <Col N="1289" /> it is the point likely to lead to most controversy.  In 1939, when the war broke out, we, in the Department, found that, in certain districts, the technique of tillage had been lost. There were no implements, no horses and no tractors.  There was not sufficient labour and the labour available was unskilled so far as tillage was concerned. I remember seeing, in 1940 or 1941, a letter sent by a farmer in the Midlands asking that an inspector call to tell him whether his wheat was ripe or not.  That was the case in certain areas.  In other areas, tillage was well established, and there was no trouble. That is the first thing we have to keep in mind.  We must be careful that we do not drift back at any time to a position of that kind.  As has been well said, the last war took some years to gather momentum.  We got plenty of time to prepare our resources.  We may not always get so long a time.  We may have to jump quickly into the breach and produce our own food in the event of another war.  In no consultation that I had with the consultative council or members of the county committees of agriculture did I meet anybody who did not hold that tillage was essential to good husbandry. Everybody, I think, agrees with that.  Some members of this Post-emergency Committee say that the object of tillage is to get good pasture and others say that the object of pasture is that it should be followed by good tillage.</P>
    <P>Whatever the object, we all agree that tillage is necessary if farming is to be carried out properly.  It was very well put in one of the reports&mdash;that the ideal thing was to take the plough around the farm, that is to take all the land in turn and keep it tilled in turn. I think we are all agreed that good farming, anyway, means a certain amount of tillage.</P>
    <P>I think I could go further and say that most people hold that we shall not drift back to the same position in which we were in 1939 and that a good many farmers who were anti-tillage in their outlook before 1939 now realise that tillage is a good thing for the farmer as well as for the country and that we may therefore have a good deal of tillage without any compulsion at all.  There <Col N="1290" /> will be admittedly a few recalcitrants. It is obvious that if a few farmers, who may have very good land, just go back to pasture and say that they do not approve of the tillage business, they will not be getting as good an output from the farms as if they were tilling. I think if the great majority are going to till anyway and if only a small minority are going to do the wrong thing&mdash;the wrong thing for the country and for themselves &mdash; compulsion is perfectly justified.</P>
    <P>Of course, when the object is, first of all, from the national point of view, or perhaps I should say from the protection point of view, merely to preserve our tillage technique, our tillage machinery and the skill that is necessary and if it is necessary for good husbandry to do a certain amount of tillage, it will not be necessary to maintain the present percentage.  We can lower the percentage&mdash;I do not know to what point.  That would be a matter that would require consideration. I do not think either that it will be necessary to make any order or any regulation in regard to the crop which should be grown.  That will be laid down in a general way in any scheme that will be brought in.</P>
    <P>The next matter with which I should like to deal is the question of wheat. A number of considerations have to be kept in mind, but we say in this White Paper that, as soon as normal conditions return, compulsory wheat growing can be dropped.  Normal conditions would, I think, mean, first of all, that imported wheat is freely available and, secondly, that there is no difficulty with regard to either shipping or exchange.  Of course, there would be no inducement to stop wheat-growing unless imported wheat were much cheaper than the wheat we were growing ourselves.</P>
    <P>If all these conditions were present, I think that we could then return to the pre-war policy of growing a certain amount of wheat, that is, that we fix a price for home grown wheat that will induce farmers to grow wheat up to, say, a quarter of a million acres.  It may be held by some that there is no necessity for any wheat policy, but I think we would be very foolish if we <Col N="1291" /> dropped the wheat policy entirely and went back to the 20,000 acres because, as I have already said, we may not get such a good warning the next time there is a war.  We may not get so long a time to prepare and we should, in all safety, try to have at least 250,000 acres.  If we had that we could, the following year, jump to double that and be fairly safe as far as bread foods are concerned.</P>
    <P>As regards beet, the same considerations apply, that is, in regard to sugar being freely available and exchange and shipping being fairly easy.  There again, however, we would have to maintain the machinery so that we could produce all our own sugar if necessary.  That would mean that we should grow sufficient beet to keep the four factories going.  What the definition of keeping them going is, I cannot say at the moment.  We had four factories going pre-war on 40,000 acres.  We have 80,000 acres now, but it might be possible with safety to go back to the 40,000 acres again.</P>
    <P>Barley is the next crop with which I desire to deal.  It is laid down here that there will be a fixed price for barley for malting and that other barley offered for sale, if of good quality, would be bought at some lower price and used for feeding.  I think it is stated in the White Paper that this barley would be purchased by the central cereals authority&mdash;whether we may call it that, I do not know.  There is a central cereals authority referred to which will import all the maize. They would also buy surplus barley. There are two separate transactions to be considered.  They would buy this barley from the various merchants who would collect the barley at whatever the fixed price would be.  They would re-sell the barley to the millers at what the millers would think it was worth in the ordinary way and the difference would have to be made good by the central cereals authority.</P>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was mentioned in this morning's paper.  Is that wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say to the Deputy that I think&mdash;I am not sure&mdash; that the alcohol factories have been growing beet for producing alcohol to see if it is more economical than potatoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister happen to see the newspaper report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it stated that it was proposed to use more beet in the alcohol factories.  Is that a mistake?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; so far as any decision was concerned, it was a mistake. In regard to fruit and vegetables, all the White Paper says is that marketing schemes will be introduced as recommended by the Fruit and Vegetables Tribunal.  In regard to foodstuffs, &ldquo;the protein foodstuffs,&rdquo; it says, &ldquo;will come in without restriction.&rdquo;  Then we come to maize.  The underlying idea is that maize should reach the consumer at the lowest possible cost and at a uniform cost, if possible, to all consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the tariff restrictions being taken off foodstuffs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There never was any tariff, as far as I know.  I am not dealing with maize meal, but with raw maize.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is intended that all tariff restrictions are to go off foodstuffs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have not said that. It is intended that maize should reach the consumer at the lowest possible cost.  That may be quite possible, even leaving a tariff on maize meal. The question of maize meal has not <Col N="1294" /> been considered at all in this White Paper.  Maize should reach the consumer at the lowest possible cost, at a level price, maintained over a long period.  These are the three conditions which we must keep in mind.  It would be very hard to deal with questions like the fixing of a price for pigs over a long period, unless the price of foodstuffs like maize and barley is known for a long period ahead.  If we keep in mind that maize must reach the consumer at the lowest possible cost, at a level cost to all consumers and that the price must be maintained if possible over a long period, then some of the other conditions laid down here become more or less inevitable.</P>
      <P>The first point that comes, then, is the authority I spoke of, the central cereals authority, the agency which would buy maize from abroad.  They should be able to buy maize at least as cheaply as any individual buyer.  If they are in a position to purchase all the maize for the country, their orders will be substantial and they will be able to get good value.  In addition, they will be able to deliver that maize at the various ports and will be able to arrange for it to reach the user, that is, the maize miller, or the ordinary farmer who mills his own maize or the co-operative society milling maize, at in or about the same price.  They will regulate the freight and so on so as to have that effect.  Then it will be possible to have a fairly uniform price ex-mill, a wholesale price and a retail price for maize.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that price be fixed by the Government, that is, the price of maize meal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The same would apply to barley, as they will buy the barley also.  In years to come, when things are more like they were pre-war, let us suppose the price of malting barley is fixed at 24/- and the price of barley for feeding is somewhat lower, so that there will be only a small gap.  There might be a slight gap as the central cereals authority will take all barley which is of merchantable quality&mdash;some of it might not be good malting barley, though all right for feeding.  They <Col N="1295" /> necessarily have to give a somewhat lower price, possibly 23/-.</P>
      <P>I take it that what they would do is that they would say to the barley buyers of this country: &ldquo;Buy up all the barley and we will take what you do not sell for malting.&rdquo;  They will buy from the collecting agencies or merchants and will re-sell it to millers, at whatever the millers think it is worth as compared with the price of oats, maize and so on at the time.  Then the barley will be put on the market, possibly at a fixed price, which could be arranged in the ordinary way.</P>
      <P>Presumably there will be a loss on that.  If there were no loss, we would not have to bother about it.  It will be small in magnitude, as it is not estimated that we would ever have in this country more than a couple of hundred thousand barrels of barley for sale in that way.  If there is a few shillings, even 4/- or 5/-, loss, the amount will be very small and the central agency will have to make up the loss on the import of maize.  If the proportion of barley for sale to the amount of maize coming in is the same in times to come as it was pre-war, it is estimated, I think, that a loss of 5/- a barrel on barley would make only a difference of a few pence per cwt. on maize.</P>

      <P>With respect to the Chair, if the Minister gives way to answer a reasonable question, put with a view to elucidating a very complex matter which he is explaining.  I do not think I have in any way offended. I do not want to interrupt, but I do not think I am interrupting when I am elucidating a point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1296" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Deputy's question, perhaps the Deputy could argue that that is the result, but these economics can be argued in very peculiar ways, depending upon a particular person.  The only other matters remaining on the White Paper are the questions of soil science and artificial manures.  Paragraph 27 says that, in regard to soil science, a commencement has been made by recruiting a certain staff for the purpose.  As soon as we have the facilities provided, the service will be set up at Johnstown Castle, County Wexford.  Even at the moment, we are able to deal with a certain number of samples sent to us and we are expecting, as time goes on, to deal with a very much larger number of samples and have a much better service.</P>
      <P>In regard to artificial manures and lime, it is recommended in the majority report&mdash;and I think also in the minority report&mdash;that there should be a subsidy on artificial manures.  I do not think that any Legislature should bind itself to pay a subsidy, no matter what the circumstances are. What we have stated in the White Paper is very much more reasonable. We approach the matter by saying that the Government will guarantee that the farmer will get artificial manures at a reasonable cost.  They have got them very cheaply, compared with other things.  A subsidy may not be necessary; it might be more useful to spend the money on some other scheme rather than on artificial manures.  This matter will have to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody has any great case over the tariff.  The tariff applies only to continental manures, where there is a very different position and where the output of the artificial manures is more or less a by-product of steel industries. The manufacturers here were competing with Great Britain and they <Col N="1297" /> could not charge a higher price than the British manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last thing I want to refer to is lime.  Deputy Hughes asked me how much lime is being used.  The amount used annually is between 75,000 and 100,000 tons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The last available figure was 65,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, that quantity is altogether too low.  If lime was being used as it should be, we could use 10 times as much.  But we will never get that lime in the ordinary way of kiln-burned lime and I think we will have to go in for the ground limestone.  I am having investigations made in that direction to see whether it is possible to get plant for the purpose.  We shall have to decide what is the most economical size of unit, if we did embark on such a scheme, and we would need to see how many plants we require in order to turn out 10 times as much lime as we use at the moment.  Then we must see if we could manufacture it convenient to the farmers and also if it could be manufactured cheaply.  If we could manage that we would have very much more lime used.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;fixing a standard for the by-product of the hydrated lime industry and allow that to be used as agricultural lime and make it available for the lime subsidy?  If he would, speaking for one area I know particularly well, we could quadruple the use of lime in that area, because limitless supplies of that appear to be available, whereas the burned lime does not seem to be in sufficient supply.  I know that by-product is liable to vary widely in quality and I <Col N="1298" /> quite agree that a rigorous standard will have to be set in order to avoid rubbish being sold as agricultural lime.  Will the Minister consider setting such a standard?</P>

      <P>On a point of order.  No Deputy on any side of the House will desire this occasion to be made an occasion on which any regrettable sentiments should be expressed by anybody. The circumstances, as I remember them, are these.  When the Minister came into the House a number of interested Deputies submitted to him that his White Paper had not reached them because of postal difficulties.  The Minister mentioned that it was his intention to make a very compendious <Col N="1299" /> statement, largely founded on that White Paper, and he recognised that the difficulties of intelligently commenting on his statement unless the White Paper had been perused were insuperable. In the light of that, he said that so far as he was concerned, without undertaking to regulate the business, he would be inclined to accede to the request for an adjournment so that Deputies would have an opportunity of studying the White Paper.  I submit without acrimony the Chief Whip might recognise the reasonableness of that arrangement and the unanimous desire of the House to have it implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I always thought that a debate on any Estimate would cover the activity of the Department in question for the previous 12 months and I would imagine that in the wide field of agriculture Deputies would have plenty to talk about in connection with that all-important branch without having to wait for a White Paper.</P>

I do not believe he wanted to mislead the House, but a message was conveyed to the Opposition on Saturday last that this Estimate would be taken <Col N="1302" /> this week.  At the same time, I think it is only fair to say that Estimates connected with the Department of Local Government were to be taken first this week, but circumstances, over which we had no control, compelled us to postpone discussion of the Vote for Local Government and Public Health.</P>

      <P>The discussion seems to be getting wider and wider.  I suggest that the House came to a decision in open session, that when the Minister had concluded his opening statement, the House would adjourn. On the opposite benches, it has been stated that that was not communicated to somebody on their side.  The procedure of this House ought to be regulated in the House and not by telephone messages between Whips.  There was another remark that I resent, that is, that, in return for allowing the House to adjourn this evening, a bargain should be struck and that the debate on this Estimate should be limited to a certain time.  That is trying to pile another arrangement on to one already come to, and I resent it.</P>

      <P>The White Paper was only issued this morning.  It is to be the foundation of agricultural policy for many years to come.  When we are trying to lay the foundation for future agricultural policy, I think it is a matter that should not be dealt with in a hurry.  I had not five minutes to look through the White Paper.  I think if we meet at 3 o'clock to-morrow, the time at our disposal will be short enough for the study of a document of such importance.  I suggest that the House should adjourn to give Deputies a chance of looking into the whole question.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 7.45 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, June 5th.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>If the information sought in this question is the actual weekly cost per head incurred by the managers of the reformatories in the maintenance of the young persons detained therein, I am not in a position to supply it as my Department has not the necessary parsupportin <Col N="1209" /> ticulars for the purpose.  I assume, however, that the information required is the average weekly expenditure from public funds in connection with each young person in the reformatories, and the following explanation is based on that assumption.</P>
      <P>There are three reformatories, viz., St. Connleth's Daingean, for boys; St. Joseph's, Limerick, and St. Ann's, Kilmacud, for girls; the last-named was established for a special class of girls in April, 1944.  Since 1st April, 1939, the State pays a capitation grant at the rate of 10/- per week in respect of each young person detained in a reformatory. In the case of St. Ann's, Kilmacud, owing to the small number of girls detained there, the State capitation was paid on a national number of 20 up to 31st March, 1945, and on 40 for the year ending 31st March, 1946.</P>
      <P>Since 1st October, 1942, the weekly rate of capitation grant paid by the local authorities to the reformatories for the young persons for whose maintenance they are responsible must be between 8/- and 9/-; the former figure is the rate generally paid.  Prior to the date mentioned the rates paid by local authorities varied from 3/6 to 8/- per week.</P>
      <P>The total average weekly cost per head from public funds may be put at 18/- for the reformatories at Daingean and Limerick for the two years ended on 31st March, 1945, and at 17/9 and 14/2 respectively for the preceding year.  The total average weekly cost per head for the reformatory at Kilmacud from the date of its establishment to 31st March, 1945, was 31/6.</P>

      <P>The average weekly cost of an unmarried private, Class III, during the year 1943-44 is estimated at £2 9s. 6½d., and during the years 1944-45 and 1945-46 at £2 10s. 8½d.</P>
      <P>The corresponding costs for a married private, Class III, are estimated at £3 15s. 9½d. during 1943-44, and £4 3s. 11½d. during 1944-45 and 1945-46.</P>
      <P>The difference in the cost of maintenance of soldiers in each of the commands was negligible, and the figures accordingly cover the Army generally.</P>
