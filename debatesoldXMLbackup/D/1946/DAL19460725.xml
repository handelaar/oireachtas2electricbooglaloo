      <P>Before we proceed with the business as outlined by the Tánaiste, I would like to draw the attention of the Chair to a matter which I believe is of very great importance. I made a speech in this House yesterday and, in the course of that speech, I was interrupted by Deputy Killilea.  I suitably replied to the Deputy and I asked him not to make any ignorant interruptions. Later in the day I would have been assaulted by Deputy Killilea if it were not for Captain Byrne.</P>

    <Title>Membership of the United Nations Organisation&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Dáil Eireann, being willing to assent to acceptance of the obligations contained in the Charter signed at San Francisco on the 26th June, 1945, recommends the Government to take steps with a view to Ireland's admission to membership of the United Nations Organisation as soon as they consider it opportune to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I had almost completed what I had to say on this particular motion.  I would like to add one or two further remarks.  I asked Deputies to accept it, and I notice by to-day's papers that the Taoiseach also asked them to accept it, that the admission of this country to the United Nations Organisation, while it may not do any harm in relation to the Partition problem, is not likely to do anything in the way of good.  I asked Deputies to accept this motion, encouraging the Government to take steps to join the United <Col N="1441" /> Nations Organisation, while at the same time putting far from their minds any even remote hope that anything raised before whatever United Nations Organisation will meet will have the slightest effect on the matter of Partition.  I asked people further to say that it would be an injudicious thing to ask any member of the Government to have that question raised abroad, and I pointed out that if our people were to appear there with the British, and were to have constant wrangles with regard to this matter, it would have two effects: one, it would definitely antagonise the members of the United Nations Organisation against us and, two, it would possibly harden English opinion on a matter which, it is quite obvious, is becoming day by day more flexible.</P>
      <P>When I did say that I did not mean &mdash;if it is allowable to introduce this matter as an aside&mdash;that the question of Partition should be left without notice.  When I finished last night I asked that we should, as one way of inducing the people of the North to join us, put our house here in better order and adopt better standards in many respects, certainly with regard to the economics they have there in comparison with ours.  I think the coming of this motion and our advent to the United Nations Organisation indicates a new atmosphere in which it is quite possible that this question may be raised with better effect with the British themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice in the papers that Deputy Flanagan yesterday suggested that this motion was brought in here because the Government had received instructions from, say, the British.  I know nothing of any such instruction.  I doubt if, in the ordinary course of diplomatic arrangments as between two friendly peoples such as ourselves and the British, anything in the nature of such instructions would be given. I think the money we spend in diplomatic representation would be badly spent if we had not some touch with the British and the Americans and with other peoples on this question of when would be a proper time to make application for membership of <Col N="1442" /> the organisation and what support we would find it possible to get for that application.</P>
    <P>I do know well that if the circumstances were changed, if the Taoiseach were here in opposition and another Government made this move, the phrase would come as trippingly from the Taoiseach's tongue as it has come from Deputy Flanagan's tongue, that instructions were given.  At least, it would have come as trippingly fifteen years ago.  One hopes that the experience the Taoiseach has derived makes him realise that these things were as foully said in the old days as he will repudiate them now as being foully said.  But I believe there has been an association, and I even hope there has been collaboration.  I would like to believe that we are so close, both to the United Kingdom representatives and the representatives of the United States of America, that we will be able to make soundings to find out from them what would be the most appropriate time for us to make this application and when it is likely to meet with success.  I shall be surprised if hereafter it is not discovered that such diplomatic approaches were made &mdash;I hope they were made&mdash;by us, and that the initiative came from our side.</P>
    <P>If that be the situation, and I hope it is, I think we are in a better position to urge the settlement of the Partition problem with more chance of success than there ever was.  We have been lucky in our history in one respect, that we swung out into independence here at a time when the old greed of British Imperialism had weakened.  We developed along friendly relations with them, while that old-time mood was fast slipping from them. We now see a further development along these lines.  We see the British getting ready to remove themselves from Egypt and offering to the peoples of India the freest possible settlement they can make for themselves, even if that means immediate secession from the British Commonwealth of Nations, or taking a place as an independent State inside it.  Nobody, so far as I can see, in the British House of Commons has raised any comment as to <Col N="1443" /> whether that secession from the British Commonwealth will take place eventually. The point is made as to whether it should take place sooner, or whether it should come later.</P>
    <P>One always thought that the great difficulty in connection with the Partition problem here was not, on the whole, a matter of sentiment but a matter of strategic values.  One felt that this island, placed as it was, was unfortunate in this respect, that the British did conceive of this island and its geographical position as something of importance to them as guarding the western approaches to their own country. One also thought of the Mediterranean, and particularly of the Suez canal, in the same context.  One now sees that whatever may be, to the amateur eye, the still continued value of these two places, the British are ready to leave Egypt and to hand over control of the Suez Canal and of the approaches, top and bottom, from and to the Mediterranean, to the Egyptians themselves.  If that be the situation, there has been some profound change with regard to strategy, something which no longer imposes on the British in their own defence the necessity of keeping these particular outposts.</P>
    <P>It is possible that the same considerations apply here.  In any event, there is a new mood and it is possible that that new mood, joined with the new weapons, may put the British into a better mind to see that right should be done here and the two portions of the country joined together.  In any event our joining the United Nations Organisation, our entering into these friendly relations with other people and entering into them particularly in close collaboration, as I hope, with the United Kingdom and with the United States of America, the United Kingdom being the party, in the main, responsible for the origin of Partition&mdash;whether they are responsible for its continuance or not is a matter about which they can argue&mdash;and the United States, a country where so many of our people are and in which we can hope we shall be able to arouse some feeling favourable to us in connection with this matter, may provide <Col N="1444" /> a better chance of success.  Joining this new organisation, in conjuction with these two countries, whom we know so well, whom fate has made us know so well, there is at least a better chance that, by a friendly approach to the British, and not by any snarling, in public at meetings of the United Nations Organisation, we shall be able to get this problem resolved.  But before we try to get that done, I suggest that minds should be made clear here and we should ask ourselves if we are going to adopt the not-an-inch attitude adopted in the North.  Are we going to say: &ldquo;We insist on the fullest possible meeting of our demands&rdquo;?  Are we going to insist that these people, some of whom we must recognise as not having the same ideals nationally, or any other way, as ourselves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish made a very interesting and very entertaining speech, from my angle, almost entirely about Partition.  However, I am almost finished with it.  I say that we ought to set our house in order and ought to see to what extent we intend to abate our full nationalist demand in the interest of bringing together the two portions of the country.  Until we make up our minds what we are prepared to accept as some diminution of these full demands, we are going to be met with the completely cold and unresponsive attitude which the Northerns have so far given to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to summarise what I have said by repeating to this degree, that I see value in this United Nations Organisation.  I think that, so far, the debate has paid too little attention to the value of a public opinion when it is mobilised and has, because of recent <Col N="1445" /> experience become too much focused on attention to the mobilisation of physical powers.  Any debate about this matter of the United Nations Organisation is apt to be lop-sided, if it considers merely the question of war and any future threat to peace.  I think we should look at the United Nations Organisation from the other angles which I have tried to stress, one of these being the matters of the Economic and Social Council.  It is a matter of the highest importance that so many governments, at the fullest height of international politics, have devoted themselves, so far as signing a charter can make them devote themselves, to the realisation of higher standards of living and conditions of full employment.  If we can meet the people inspired by these particular views and aiming at these objectives, we will benefit this country by being in that organisation and signifying with them that we have these objectives ahead of us.</P>
    <P>I think we will find the biggest conflict&mdash;because I do not think nations are going to turn their thoughts to war, at least for a while&mdash;not over war or the preparations for war, but over all these various economic matters, and, as I said last night, we will probably find a great divergence of opinion as between two schools of thought&mdash; the people thinking in terms of what has been aptly described as plantation politics, the type of full-time dependency, allied with what is called social security, which will give the security of the plantation and the dependence of the old plantation.</P>
    <P>At the time of the quarrel in the United States of America over the question of the abolition of slavery, in his Gettysburg oration, the then President of the United States talked about the nation which had been brought forth on that Continent, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men were created equal. The United Nations Organisation has been allowed to come into being by the efforts, first, of the British in resisting other movements and, secondly, by the tremendously formidable power of the United States of America in bringing these earlier efforts of the British to <Col N="1446" /> success.  If we can go to the United Nations Organisation, hoping to meet people dedicated to the same proposition, and if we go there ourselves dedicated to that proposition, that all men are created equal and ought to have equal chances, we may, as I said last night, benefit other people by our company, but we shall be very vastly educated ourselves.  It is in the hope that we will get that education which will accrue to the benefit of our people that I ask that assent be given to the resolution before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an atmosphere of intensity in this House yesterday greater than ever prevailed in it before, as if there was some threat hanging over our heads.  I wish to ask the Taoiseach what the position will be if the Communist element get the upper hand in this Security Council. If Communists desire to attack another small nation, that may not think in every way as we do, will our soliders be called upon to get into a fight to crush that small nation that the Communist element may wish to destroy? It is stated that every member State must pledge itself in advance to carry out destruction at the bidding of the Big Five.  What would our position be if we did not wish to fight against a small nation?  Have we power to refuse to do so, or to get out with honour?  Have we power to refuse to contribute in any way to any section of the forces that might be called upon to crush that small nation?  The happenings of other days appear to be forgotten.  I remember the days when citizens of this country, including members of the Front Bench, held up their hands in horror when they heard that the Red Flag was being hoisted, or was likely to be hoisted in any part of Ireland.  Is the Red Flag tendency gone out of this council that is going to give instructions to the small nations who accept membership of the United Nations Organisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having pledged ourselves to the Big Five, will we have any opportunity beforehand of approaching our own people to get their views as to whether this country or its Army should join in any <Col N="1447" /> way against the oppression of a small country, that might feel it had a grievance.  I ask the Taoiseach to deal with these points.  This country has, up to the present, been able to maintain its neutrality and has been able to keep out of war.  Its people have been able of their own free will to decide not to share in wars.  During the recent war, although our Government and the conscience of the people approved of neutrality for the whole country, that did not in any way debar our men and women from joining other forces and doing great work.  One point should be cleared up, about an approach to our own people to ask them to come to a decision, whether they thought it desirable to act, once we were pledged.  The charter before us states that we are pledged in advance to carry out and to obey the orders of the Security Council.  When replying, I ask the Taoiseach to give some information on these points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like most Deputies, I want to express my approval of this motion.  The debate opened by the Taoiseach circled around and dealt, I might say, almost entirely with the obligations of applying for membership, and very few Deputies have posed the question, as to what would be the risks of not applying and securing membership of the organisation.  Let us be clear on this matter.  We are certainly going to shoulder very definite obligations if we secure membership of the United Nations Organisation.  Does anybody know of any organisation, which either an individual or a nation applied for membership of, in which obligations have not to be undertaken? Is there any working man in this country who applies for and becomes a member of a trade union, who does not shoulder obligations, and who might find himself, because of his membership of an organisation, compelled to do certain things which, perhaps, if he was left to decide for himself he would not undertake?  I welcome this motion for another reason.  Perhaps, it is the chief reason why I welcome it.  In my opinion, it marks the end of the political <Col N="1448" /> humbug, and the political make-believe that has been going on in this country for the last quarter of a century.  It is realism.</P>
      <P>Once we apply for and secure membership of the United Nations Organisation, we will have to realise that neither the Taoiseach nor anybody else can henceforth indulge in political make-believe, political humbug and political confusion of the minds of the people.  It is worth taking some risk to get rid once and for all of that curse that has be-devilled politics for the past quarter of a century.  What are we asked to do under this motion?  We are asked to do what for centuries Irishmen fought and died for, to take our place with the other nations, as an equal. That is what we are asked to do, We are asking to be recognised by every nation on the face of the earth as a completely sovereign nation.  Our delegates will go there with as much authority behind them as the delegates of any other country, no matter what form of government that country may be operating under.  I welcome this for another reason.  It is going to bring us into close personal contact with people from whom we have been estranged&mdash; to our detriment, I believe&mdash;much longer than we should have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Far be it from me to suggest that I have a thousandth part of the knowledge of foreign affairs of either Deputy McGilligan or the Taoiseach, but I believe that this definitely will bring us nearer to the end of Partition.  I do not say that we are going to achieve that either through the charter or at any meetings of the United Nations Organisation or any of its subsidiary bodies but it is going to bring us into closer contact on a level with the only people who can put an end to it and it is going to place us in a position that have never occupied before.  I want to make it clear&mdash;a position that we have never occupied but which, in my opinion, we could have occupied.  I welcome it because of this fact, that it is going to bring us into closer contact with those people with whom everything that we stand for demands that we should be in close contact, not only because of the principles that are <Col N="1449" /> involved, but because of where our own flesh and blood are and where their interests are concerned.  Finally, it is going to wipe out that extraordinary ambiguity that has existed for some time and it is going to make clear where we stand, not only in relation to the United Nations Organisation, but in relation to the Commonwealth of Nations.  Some Deputies in the back benches of Fianna Fáil would still like to keep up the old humbug, but they are ending it, whether they realise it or not, once and for all, and it is about time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to remain silent on this very important motion.  It is one of the most important that has come before the House.  Speaking for the Party I represent, we want to give it our unqualified support, to give full power to the Government to apply for admission as a member of United Nations Organisation when they consider it desirable.  I regret some of the speeches that have been made in this House in connection with our responsibilities and obligations.  We recognise that United Nations Organisation is a committee for preserving peace, not for creating war and, while some Deputies desire to take advantage of United Nations Organisation to secure the good things that may come out of it, they are threatening us with the obligations and responsibilities that may come afterwards.  As far as I am concerned, and I am certain I am speaking for the majority of the Deputies present, once we become members and give our signature, we accept the principle that an Irishman is worth his bond and we are prepared to take the consequences and, should the occasion arise, to do our part to fulfil our obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My desire is that our reason for joining this organisation is to assist, as Irishmen will, in preserving peace and using peaceful ways at the conferences of this organisation and to make it a pact to prevent war.  This evening we will be discussing a Bill concerning industrial relations.  If it is necessary in the industrial sphere to advocate peaceful settlement of disputes, why not adopt a similar attitude in international affairs?  I believe we can play a very important part.  I am not afraid of the obligations because I am satisfied that Irishmen, no matter what Government may be in power, will do their best to uphold our signature as a member of this organisation and loyally to carry out the obligations.  I do not want to have it said&mdash;as may have been suggested in this House&mdash;that we are not prepared to carry out our obligations.  I fully <Col N="1451" /> realise the implications and, speaking for a very large body of organised workers, we recognise the obligations and are prepared, should occasion demand, to give the full force of our organisation in assisting the Government of the day to fulfil their part of the bargain if they are admitted as a member of the United Nations Organisation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I desire to give the motion my wholehearted approval and to assure our people that, should the occasion arise, Irishmen will carry out their part of the bargain so that it may not be said that they wanted to get any dishonourable way out of standing by their signature, no matter what sacrifice may be required on behalf of the people, and, when necessary, vindicate the right of people to look after their own affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>With others who have already spoken I believe that this is one of the most important decisions to be taken by this House since its inception.  I join with those who have unhesitatingly welcomed the step we are about to take.  We all know the dangers inherent in this matter and it is no use in glossing over or trying to minimise them.  The chief danger is that this country may find itself involved in war.  That means an abandonment of the policy of neutrality which we followed during the last seven years.  We must face that frankly.  I think that danger is one we ought to accept with our eyes open, knowing fully to what we are committing ourselves.  The United Nations Organisation is, as one Deputy has suggested, an instrument for promoting peace; it is not an instrument to make war.  We may find that, by virtue of that membership, we are asked to do certain things, but I take it we will not be asked to do things which lie beyond our power.  It is in that spirit I would face the obligations which our membership will impose upon us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advantages of membership are very great.  We here in Ireland, by virtue of our history and even more by virtue of our geographical position, <Col N="1452" /> have always been in danger of suffering from isolation.  By that I do not entirely mean political isolation, but isolation from the main streams of European thought and civilisation. That is one of the difficulties which all Irishmen have to face in this country.  We are at the edge of Europe and yet we are Europeans.  Our joining an international organisation will bring us into the very closest touch with the thoughts and energies which arise from time to time in the European Continent.  We may also have a contribution, be it small or large, to make to the United Nations Organisation: that will depend entirely on ourselves and on the way of life we lead under our own Government.</P>
    <P>People have referred to the British Commonweath of Nations and there are still some persons who are not prepared to look very sympathetically on that great organisation.  I would like to remind them that the chief instrument which governs the relations of that body, namely, the Statute of Westminster, was conceived in the brains of the Irish delegates and was moulded and changed by them into the instrument which it is today.</P>

      <P>I take it that the contribution which this country made to the British Commonwealth of Nations may be equalled or excelled by the contribution which we might make to the United Nations Organisation and it is in that spirit that this country is taking a big step forward in the main stream of world civilisation. We know that the United Nations Organisation's Charter is not as idealistic as we would wish it to be, but it is realistic and its very realism may save it from the faults which eventually brought down its predecessor, the League of Nations.  We all face the world which lies before us with a good deal of trepidation.  The world in 1919 faced the future with a great deal of idealism and the reaction to <Col N="1453" /> that idealism was complete cynicism when persons found that the idealism was fading and the hopes which it had engendered were not being realised. We are in a different way to-day: we see the difficulties which lie ahead, and once people see difficulties they are somewhat prepared to meet them.</P>
      <P>While I unhesitatingly welcome this motion, I would like to ask the Taoiseach why the Government has come to this decision.  Other speakers have asked him if he has changed his mind, apparently, since we had debates last month and earlier this month.  I would like him to tell this House&mdash;and, through this House, the country&mdash;as to why this motion is before us on this particular day in July and why we were not prepared for it by the various methods which any Government can employ.  As far as the members of this House are aware, a very short time ago the Government had no intention of joining the United Nations Organisation.  Now it is apparently anxious to join.  I personally have heard no reason why this change has come about.  The public are entitled to know and I would ask the Taoiseach to enlighten us on that in his reply. Our joining the United Nations Organisation marks the end of the old isolationism from which we have suffered for a number of years and I hope we will benefit and that we will be of some benefit to the organisation which we propose to join.</P>

      <P>Our decision to-day may be one of the turning points in our history.  At any rate, it will end the political and parochial outlook and make us more realists than we are.  I do not say that we have something to gain, but we have nothing to gain by staying out.  Our contribution to the organisation may be small from a material point of view, but from the spiritual side it can be very great.  As a mother-nation with a historic past, we can bring a different slant to things.  The organisation at present is one of greed and graft.  We want to change that, if it is in our power, and to get the big Powers to realise that there is more in this life than material <Col N="1454" /> things, that a spiritual outlook on the world is something worth attaining.</P>
      <P>Those things which are of greater value should come first.  Our nation is an old historic one with a glorious past which can give a message of hope to the world.  If a nation has courage, patience and perseverance it will win in the end.  We had 700 years of trials and tribulations and we stuck it out. To-day we have the sunshine of peace in our land.  Had it not been for the courage and the tenacity of our people this nation would have been ground under long ago.  With that past, we can make a contribution to the European Conference.  At the moment there are many nations, some in Eastern Europe, which are being ground down by a ruthless tyranny. Some feel that there is no hope for them because their spirit has been broken.  We in this old Irish nation send out a message of hope to them. We will bring that message to the European Peace Conference.  It will be that they should hold fast, and that if they do they will win through.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, it is right that we should join the European Peace Conference. We are one of the mother-nations of the world.  It is our duty to take our place beside all the other nations, no matter what the make-up of some of them may be.  I know it is rather hard that we should have to sit side by side with Communist Russia and take decisions with her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not like that, but at the same time we are a Christian people, and if we can do anything to restore real peace to the world it is our duty to shoulder that responsibility like men. Ever since the day that the blessings of Christianity came to our land we have sent out that message of hope to the world.  It is more needed to-day than at any time during the last 2,000 years.  There is a duty on us to bring that message to the European Peace Conference, and to voice it in the teeth of those who do not believe in the things that we believe in.  If we do that, it may have the effect of bringing about a change of heart <Col N="1455" /> among some of the mighty tyrants in the world to-day who are holding a ferocious grip not only on many of the small nations but one may say over the whole world.  I am glad to know that the decision to be represented at this peace conference will be an unanimous one.  In my opinion it is a wise decision, especially at this time when one may say that the whole fabric of Christianity in many parts of the world is almost on the point of breaking up and disappearing.  While that is the position I, at the same time, do not feel that there is the slightest need for despair.  I think that if the peoples of the world show a spirit of courage and perseverance there is a great future in front of the world.  There is no need for cowardice. We have nothing to be afraid or ashamed of in making our contribution to the peace of the world.  We are all aware that there are millions of defenceless Christians suffering under the most galling tyranny behind an iron curtain at the present moment.  We are a free people, and it is our duty to raise our voice on behalf of them.  The delegates that we will send to that peace conference will be men of strong will and of a Christian outlook.  They will bring to it the message that I speak of, and that message will give hope to the small nations that are being downtrodden at the moment.  It will give them hope to strive to shake off their shackles and to resume their rightful places in the world.</P>
    <P>It is right, too, that we should join the United Nations Organisation.  We are a free people and we can make our voice heard there too.  We are as free to say our own say as the biggest empires in the world.  We can do that regardless of what others may think. There is no need for us to tie ourselves either to the right or to the left.  We are one of the few countries in the world that can make their voices heard at the peace conference without any desire to gain anything from it.</P>
    <P>I believe that we can do an immense amount of good by being represented at it.  We are not out to gain anything from it, and do not want to gain anything. We are the friends of all free <Col N="1456" /> and civilised peoples, and we want to see the small nations of the world as free as we are ourselves.  We are their friends.  I believe that some of the big nations are anxious to have a small nation like ours represented at that peace conference.  We are not tied by any commitments and we can speak freely there.  I believe that if we do so civilisation, which is almost at the point of crumbling, will be put on a firm foundation again.  We will have there the Americans, the British, the French, the Poles and the Spaniards who, like us, believe in the Word of Christ.  All these nations will represent a mighty force against the eastern hordes who are holding so many of the small nations behind an iron curtain at the moment and grinding civilisation in the dust.  Those forces will be able to lift that curtain and unfold to the world what is being done behind it. For that reason a decision should be taken at once to have the country represented at the peace conference.  It would be fatal if we were to wait for four or five years before doing so.  If there was to be any delay, Communist Russia would then be free to do what she liked.</P>

I particularly welcome the decision of the Taoiseach to have a full debate on this question in the Dáil.  It is right that we should have such a debate in this Assembly.  It will be welcomed throughout the country.  It will show that we are going to the peace conference as a united nation.  I do not think there is any group of men in the country who do not wish well to that peace conference.  If there should be such a group then, in my opinion, they are not people of Irish character and are not entitled to the respect of the Irish people.

      <P>There was a statement made by a Deputy yesterday that there was a secret meeting here.  I <Col N="1457" /> belong to a small Party.  I understand that the Taoiseach took the Leaders of the Parties into his confidence and that they reported back to their colleagues.  We are now discussing a motion that this country should join the United Nations Organisation as soon as the Government consider it is convenient to do so.  I cannot see any great hope for peace in the future for this reason, that when three of the Big Powers decided to meet they met in Moscow on Christmas Day.  On that day all workers in that country were engaged in carrying out their ordinary day's work.  For that reason I think that any peace made will not be a lasting peace because the foundation stone for it was laid on the Lord's Day which we here respect.  We all know that the world to-day is threatened by one great dictator.  Germany was and Russia is. There is no doubt but that America and Britain as well as many of the smaller States are shivering before this great military power which is engaged in building navies and making more powerful armaments.  Many millions are being spent on the building of ships and now we see that they are being blown up.  This small nation could be blown up from any part of the coast or from the air.  It may be that one of the first demands that will be made on us by some of the big Powers when we join the United Nations Organisation will be that they want our ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the first big snag in connection with the last war.  If those people had had our ports, we should have been invaded. We realise that a future generation may be called upon to take part in the next war. Even to-day, the world is not at peace. According to Press reports, hundreds of people are being shot down in the streets of Jerusalem.  The Taoiseach has not given a good reason in connection with the future maintenance of neutrality.  I do not believe that we propose to join this organisation on the spur of the moment.  The matter will be examined by the Government and let us hope and pray that their decision <Col N="1458" /> will be for the betterment of this small island of ours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to learn from the Taoiseach why this motion has been brought in in such a hurry. When the Dáil met last week, we had no indication that this motion was to be introduced.  It was only at the end of the week that the motion was placed on the Order Paper and that information was received that it was to be discussed.  I ask for information as to the reasons which prompted the Taoiseach to bring in this motion, not out of mere curiosity, but because I consider it desirable that, in a matter of this kind, public opinion should be fully informed of the magnitude of the step about to be taken.  The fullest possible information should be made available to the public in connection with the proposal.  Speaking in this House on the Vote for the League of Nations on the 26th June, the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;Therefore, as I have said, we are losing nothing, at the present time anyhow, by the delay which has occurred.  This will become a ripe question for us when the peace treaties are signed and not until then.&rdquo; Later, he dwelt on the obligations involved and said: &ldquo;If we propose it, that will be considered by the Dáil in due course.  The arguments pro and con will, no doubt, be put forward here, but the time for doing that has not come just yet.&rdquo;  The fact that the country has been presented with this motion after the statement by the Taoiseach on the Vote for the League of Nations prompts one to think that something must have taken place between the 26th June and the end of last week which either forced or induced the Government to place this motion on the Order Paper.  It is significant that as recently as the 26th June the Taoiseach said the time had not come yet for entry.  He supported that remark by the statement that, until the peace treaties were signed, the time would not be opportune. Having regard to that statement less than a month ago, it may be reasonably supposed that the majority of the people were under the impression that the Government and the Department. <Col N="1459" /> of External Affairs, with sources of information not available to the rest of the community, considered that the time had not come for joining the United Nations Organisation.  If that is the case, I think that we are entitled to an explanation for the rushing of this motion on the very eve of the summer adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of this motion and the diverse speeches we have had upon it demonstrate that the general body of public opinion is uneducated as regards what is involved in our applying now or in the near future for membership of the United Nations Organisation. Many people, owing to their preoccupation with their own affairs, have been unable to study carefully and assimilate the proposals contained in the charter of the United Nations Organisation which was presented to this House last year.  The fact that people are uninformed as to the matters contained in that charter forces them to regard with certain misgivings and with considerable restraint a motion of this kind.  It is because of that, I think, that before a motion of this kind is introduced, there should be a preparatory course of public education either orally or by the dissemination of printed information which would enable the public to come to a proper conclusion.  However, we have not had such a course. We are presented with this motion and we have heard the Taoiseach's introductory remarks which consisted mainly of a reading of the various clauses in the United Nations Charter. That many people who have had the advantage of reading the charter are nervous regarding membership of the United Nations Organisation is, in my view, due to the fact that they have not had an opportunity of clearly understanding the significance of a step of this kind.  Serious obligations are, undoubtedly, imposed on members of the United Nations Organisation. The fact that we shall involve ourselves in future commitments of one kind or another should not prevent us from realising that many advantages will accrue to this country, both <Col N="1460" /> politically and materially, from membership of that organisation.  By &ldquo;materially&rdquo; I mean that we shall be in a position to collaborate with other nations and possibly get reciprocal arrangements with them which will accrue to our advantage.</P>
    <P>We have had for a number of years now a closing down on matters, so far as external affairs are concerned.  The fact that we were neutral during the war forced this country into a position of restraint so far as foreign affairs were concerned.  With occasional exceptions, we postponed discussion on external matters and the entire attention of the country was devoted to strengthening our defences and maintaining neutrality.</P>
    <P>The fact that now, at the close of that situation, we are forced to consider a matter of this kind puts many people in the difficulty that they imagine we are still neutral or that, so far as this country is concerned, there is still a conflict.  Whilst that is so, we must realise that at the present time many nations are gathered together and have been associated for some time in endeavouring to frame proposals for peace.  The fact that many nations have been so gathered is of interest to this country because of our historic position, because of the fact that the overwhelming majority of the people are of the Catholic faith and because of the fact that we realise that, as an independent State, we have certain obligations and that we are prepared to shoulder our responsibilities, so far as our contribution can assist or promote more harmonious relations either between ourselves and other nations or between other nations in the world. In doing so, we must consider for a moment one grave factor concerning the United Nations Organisation.  That is the fact that up to the present the Vatican has not been invited to participate in the framing of the charter or in any of the conferences dealing with the proposed peace negotiations.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for regret for this country, particularly in view of our Catholic heritage and in view of the <Col N="1461" /> fact that we have in this country so many people who look to the Vatican for spiritual guidance, that the Vatican has not been invited to participate in these matters.  While that is so, we at any rate can look with consolation, with pride and with confidence to the various messages which our present Holy Father has throughout the war, and in fact since the cessation of hostilities, given to his flock scattered all over the world.  We have looked with considerable satisfaction and with a firm faith in their soundness to the many statements which the Vatican has made on the whole world position.  In view of that, I think that our biggest contribution and our largest interest in future world affairs must depend on our ability to contribute to the spiritual, rather than to the material side of these affairs. We have had much evidence in recent years of the rise of the forces of materialism, of power and wealth, but we have had little evidence, and there is little evidence at the present time, that, among any of the participating nations, there is a return to an appreciation of those things which, so far as we are concerned, make life worth living.</P>
    <P>If there is any return to a more peaceful approach to and a more harmonious deliberation on all the matters concerned in world affairs, if we cannot look with the satisfaction which we might on the various meetings, the various negotiations and the various conferences that have have taken place, we at any rate can hope that if, in future, this country takes its place within the United Nations Organisation, we shall contribute, so far as in our power lies, to the preservation of the sanctity of human life, that we shall contribute our Christian approach, that we can say to the United Nations that we are a small country which for centuries suffered under a grievous subjugation, that we were suppressed by a foreign Power and that if many countries on the Continent are now battened down by external superior forces, we in this country were in a similar position for many centuries.  We can say that <Col N="1462" /> despite that aggression which held us in bondage we, throughout all these centuries, had a firm faith that in the end our Christian tradition, our Christian fortitude, our hope in everything that we value as part of the Christian faith and the Catholic religion would triumph over all the forces of materialism.  That being so, we can hold out a message of faith to those other unfortunate nations and to those other peoples who are not in as fortunate position as we are at the moment.</P>
    <P>My mind at this moment recalls a cartoon published in <i>Punch</i> many years ago when Bismarck was attempting to impose the German authority on other countries.  There was a representation of the Vatican and Bismarck was shown holding on to a chain.  In another corner of the cartoon there was a drawing of the devil and he was represented as saying: &ldquo;Prince, you can give that up. For two thousand years I have been trying and I have not shaken it yet.&rdquo; The fact is that however strong material forces may be at the present time, the voice of the Vatican and the voice of the Christian world must be, and will be, heard.  We want this nation to take its part in making that voice. However small or insignificant we may seem to other nations, we have at any rate that noble heritage and it is our responsibility and duty to make the fruits of that heritage available to other nations.</P>
    <P>I should like for a moment to dwell on the fact that so far as this country is concerned the one major political problem is Partition.  What the future of Partition may be in our acceptance of membership of the United Nations I cannot attempt to forecast; but I think that it should never be absent from the minds or from the consideration of the representatives of this country, either in the United Nations or elsewhere, that so long as Partition continues harmonious, cordial and friendly relations between this country and Great Britain can never be established on the basis on which they might rest if Partition ceased to exist. So far as our contribution to world <Col N="1463" /> affairs is concerned, our effective voice, our strength, our force, and our unity in contributing to these matters would be all the greater if the problem of Partition were solved.  A consideration of that factor must weigh with both Britain and America, and particularly with America in view of the fact that so many of our kinsmen have for so long sought a livelihood in America when they were unable to secure one at home.</P>
    <P>We hope that those people in their present frame of mind and in the light of the fact that they realise that every country has a right to its independence will appreciate to the full that this country could contribute in many ways and could contribute effectively to a better understanding of world affairs so far as Western Europe and America are concerned if this country could speak with a united voice.  I trust that as soon as the opportunity presents itself this country will raise the matter of Partition.  Whether it is considered by the United Nations as a whole, or by some committee of it, our contribution to world affairs and to a full participation in our obligations in such an organisation would be far greater, far more effective and far more encouraging to the people of this country in making them participate in a fuller measure if the problem of Partition were solved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a degree of acceptance of this motion far beyond anything that I had reasonable grounds to anticipate.  I attempted to set the debate along certain lines, namely the lines of the obligations to which we would be committed were we to enter this organisation.  I did that with a deliberate purpose because it is the duties, rather than the advantages, which in the end will really matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be a very serious thing for our people, if we entered into an organisation of this kind and if we were at any time called upon to fulfil our obligations, it was found that our people were unaware of the nature of the commitments into which they had entered.  It has been suggested that we should have had this matter discussed <Col N="1464" /> up and down the country before it was discussed here in this House.  I do not think that would really have been possible. It would have been possible for organisations, if there were such, to have gone out and debated this particular question had they so desired. But it would have been very, very difficult, in advance of a motion here in the Dáil, for members of the Government, or members of our Party, or members of any political Party to go out beforehand and try to inform public opinion prior to a decision.  I am sure there would have been a great deal of objection raised here had I, for instance, gone down the country and spoken on this question of our possible entry into the United Nations Organisation, discussing and weighing the advantages and disadvantages in advance. I think the inherent difficulty in that ought to be a sufficient answer to Deputy Cosgrave who has more or less put forward the suggestion that there should have been a wider discussion. That does not mean at all, of course, that these remarks are also directed against the observations of the Leader of the principal Opposition Party who suggested that it is our duty to go out now and acquaint our people of the obligations that we propose to take upon ourselves.  That is quite a different matter.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, I merely want to say that I am fully in agreement with the principle that it is now our duty, having taken our decision, to inform the public of what the obligations are.  I think it is very, very necessary that our people should thoroughly understand what obligations they will assume if, when we make application, we are accepted as members of this organisation.  The more realistic we are about that the better.  Some of the other speakers on this motion stressed the advantages. To my mind the decision as to whether we should or should not enter into this organisation ultimately resolves itself into the one question: In what way, either by joining or not joining, are we most likely to preserve the independence of this country?  That is really the net question.  Is the independence and freedom which we have <Col N="1465" /> achieved and the independence and freedom to which we aspire for the whole country likely to be better guaranteed by our being a member of this organisation or by our not being a member of it?  If we believe that it is, whatever doubts we may have with regard to the obligations, we shall resolve these doubts in only one way. There is no doubt that we, like every other nation in the world, wish to keep out of war.  I think that if the peoples of the world were consulted there are very few of the ordinary people and very few of the small nations who would deliberately go into war.  They prefer to avoid war.</P>
    <P>I know that for great causes one may feel there is a moral obligation upon one to go to war, but these causes are not so numerous and, when it comes to the point and they are examined home, it will be found that there are very often other motives for entering into war which are anything but worthy of admiration.  There are very mixed motives at times.  Consequently, it is not at all easy for a nation to satisfy itself that it is going to war solely on a moral issue.  It is for that reason generally that people endeavour to avoid war, and also because of its disastrous consequences in many other ways.  Our people sincerely desire to remain out of war.  I am perfectly convinced of that.  The question they have to ask themselves now and the question we here have to ask ourselves is are we more likely to keep out of war by joining an organisation of this sort or are we more likely to keep out of war by remaining outside such an organisation?  Probably no Governhas had such an experience as we have had in recent times.  Some people think that all that is necessary in order to keep out of war is to declare that one is neutral.  That is not sufficient. I would like our people and the members of this House to bear in mind that for six years of war the question as to whether our neutrality would be respected or not depended ultimately upon the will of, perhaps, two men.  It was on that slender thread that our preservation here during the emergency period really depended.  That was a <Col N="1466" /> very serious and a very anxious situation in which to have this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Ultimately, in my opinion, the question whether our neutrality was going to be accepted depended upon the concurrence of wills of two individuals.  That was a desperate position for our nation to be in. Those who have passed through that anxious period have no illusions about the value of a declaration of neutrality in preserving a nation from attack. When, therefore, we come to consider matters of this sort we should bear in mind that it is not sufficient for a nation to wish to remain out of a war, that, even though they may wish it sincerely and though they may declare their neutrality and do everything in their power to maintain that neutrality, yet that does not prevent them from being attacked.</P>
      <P>I said in my opening speech, and I have said it on many occasions in the past, that it is the small nations particularly that should welcome an organisation which is intended to give collective security.  No nations ought to be more loyal to such an organisation than the small nations.  But the small nations, just like the big ones, will, if they become members of such an organisation, have to be really loyal members of it.  They will have to make up their minds that the obligations which are necessary, if the organisation is to be successful, will be fulfilled and carried out.  It would be fatal for the small nations, including ourselves, who have any hope of collective security, to think that they can in the end dodge their obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they attempt to do so, they are going to bring the whole edifice down and they might as well never have had anything to do with an organisation of this sort.  Therefore our people should <Col N="1467" /> realise that when we enter into an organisation of this sort we are committing ourselves to take collective action with other people.  The difference between a war such as may arise under the obligations of the charter and other wars is this: that that type of war would be a war of enforcement, enforcement of obligations, and also enforcement of rights. If there is ever to be a rule of law, nations must make up their minds that they will take part in such enforcement, because, if there is not enforcement, then, of course, the duties and the rights that are guaranteed will be all thrown aside.</P>
    <P>I think I pointed out on another occasion that the difficulty in the old League of Nations, and the difficulties generally in building up an organisation of this sort, lie in the fact that there seems to be a kind of dilemma involved.  You have to face the waging of war in order to prevent war.  It seems a strange thing; but there is no way of enforcement against large nations, particularly enforcement of the rule of law, except by military action, which means war.  Therefore, when you enter into an organisation of this sort, if you enter into it with any hope that it will be successful, you must enter into it with the firm conviction that, if enforcement is to be effective, it has to be achieved by the loyal co-operation of all the members and by you also doing your part.</P>
    <P>I think Deputies who imagine that the country does not realise this are wrong.  They seem to think that we are very far ahead of public opinion in this country.  I doubt it.  I think our people are as wise, politically, whether on national or international questions, as most people are.  I would say on the whole that they are wiser.  I do believe that our people realise that there is a better chance of maintaining the independence and the liberty we have got in this country by joining an organisation of this kind than by staying outside it, particularly when you remember that, when you are outside, this organisation will treat <Col N="1468" /> you exactly as if you were a member so far as obligations are concerned. They will simply say to you: &ldquo;We represent a world organisation; you are simply a small nation.  World peace demands that this thing be done,&rdquo; and there will be an end to it.  The representations which you might have been able to make successfully within will not be at all possible without. Therefore, if you have a world organisation of this magnitude, you have hardly a choice in the matter.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion of a change of mind so far as I am concerned. I do not really mind people saying that I changed my mind.  I try to deal with situations as I find them.  I am not conscious of any change of mind with regard to this matter of whether we should or should not join a world organisation designed to maintain peace.  I have always stood for that.  I have stated and I still hold that this organisation is not as valuable an organisation as it could be made.</P>
    <P>I have to admit that possibly it is as good as can be got at the moment. If one of the great Powers says: &ldquo;We will not enter this organisation unless on condition that we have a right of veto,&rdquo; what can you do?  You start with the best you can get.  You may be fully conscious, as I am, of its defects and wish that it could be changed and say that, if you had anything to do with it, you would try to bring about this change.  Nobody, I think, can say with truth that I have changed my attitude with regard to this organisation, or with regard to the desirability of our entering it or not.  I do not think any statement I have made since this matter was raised over a year ago can be interpreted as saying that we would ask the nation to keep out of it.  The only thing which, I admit, requires explanation so far as change of attitude is concerned&mdash;I tried to give the explanation, but it was so simple, apparently, that people will not believe it&mdash;is the fact that some time ago when dealing with the League of Nations Estimate I said that we were losing nothing by delay.  That was the position at the time.  I did not think we should be in a great hurry <Col N="1469" /> about joining the organisation.  I thought there were very great reasons why we should not.</P>
    <P>This organisation was built up by a number of victor States, fresh from war, with all the passions that are aroused in belligerent nations.  Their main purpose was to try to make sure that the sacrifices they had made in the war would not be lost and that they would redound to the benefit of their own particular peoples.  Anybody who read the papers could see that there were contests going on between the victors to make sure, so far as they could, that their own particular nation would derive the best possible results from the victory which had been achieved.  I do not think that we were losing anything by being out of that particular type of conflict.</P>
    <P>As time went on, however, the situation was getting a little bit clearer. Already it had become somewhat clearer owing to the fact that draft peace treaties had been more or less agreed upon.  But even so, on the 15th July, which was given as the last date, I felt there was no particular urge to get in at that time.  If I were choosing a time for bringing this matter before the Dáil and the country for consideration, it would be a time when a peace situation had really been achieved, when the peace treaties had been signed, and when you were looking on a new world where everybody's interest would be to try to maintain peace for the future.</P>
    <P>Why was there a change then&mdash; roughly, about the 15th July?  What brought about the change was this. The view that I took of the situation, and the view taken by the Government, was one which was shared by most of the small neutral nations in Europe.  None of them appeared to be about to apply until, roughly, the approach of that date.  That was the final date for application. There was a special provision by which, under certain circumstances, applications could be considered after that date, but you would have had to look for special treatment if you were to depend upon that.  It appeared to me that some nations were beginning to change their attitude and <Col N="1470" /> it was quite possible that at the eleventh hour, say on the 14th July or whatever was the last moment at which they could make application, they would have changed their minds. It was possible that the small nations in Europe which most corresponded to ours in the general situation might have applied&mdash;I knew a number of other nations were applying because that appeared in the public Press about the 9th or 10th July.</P>
    <P>The situation might very well have come about in which we would be the only neutral nation not applying.  Perhaps I should not say the only one; there would probably be two others. I do not know what is the position of Switzerland and I do not know either what is the position of Spain.  It was indicated at the Potsdam Conference that three of the five Powers whose assent must be got would not be willing to assent to the membership of Spain.  We might very well have found ourselves by ourselves.  As regards the other nations which, up to that time, had been in the same position as ourselves, there was this difference.  They could have taken action on the 14th July; they could have taken action at the eleventh hour, because they had already got the necessary power from their Parliaments and from the other groups who were with them, but our Government could not.  We made a promise here and it would have been unseemly that a step of this magnitude would be taken without consulting the people's representatives in Parliament.</P>
    <P>I discovered at that time that there were certain powers which we should have if we were to keep step with other nations and I felt it was desirable we should keep step with them. The last day for application passed and, if there was no question of postponement, these nations would be more or less in the same position.  But it appeared that the last day for application was likely to be changed; it was going to be postponed to a later date and this later date might occur in a week's time or in two weeks' time. We could not take action if, at the eleventh hour before the new date, there were to be a change of attitude on the part of the other nations, so I <Col N="1471" /> felt that we could delay no longer.  I said we could not delay the matter any longer without injury to the nation's interests.  That is the simple explanation and I think I already indicated that, without, perhaps, going as fully into the matter as I am now doing.</P>
    <P>The position is that the period when one could say that delay no longer carried evil consequences as far as this country is concerned has passed, and, therefore, as I said yesterday, the interests of this country demand that this question be settled now.  As regards giving liberty to the Government, I could not come in here and ask the Dáil to give us liberty to adopt any attitude we pleased.  I am sure members of the Dáil have very definite views as to whether we should or should not apply and as to the direct advantages or disadvantages of applying.  If I had asked that the Government should be permitted to do as it pleased, I am sure there would have been a great deal of opposition. The members of the different Parties hold the views that they have already expressed here, and we have our own views on the matter.  I hope I have made the matter clear and that I have satisfied Deputy Cosgrave's curiosity. He said it was not altogether his curiosity, but he felt that there was some explanation due to the country and to Parliament as to the reason for the change.  It is quite simple.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestions made by Deputy Flanagan and some others, I can only say that there is nothing whatever to them.  I can say that the attitude of Britain towards us during the whole period has been a strictly correct one&mdash;strictly correct.  There has been no attempt on the part of Britain either to urge us, much less to force us, or to encourage us to enter or not to enter.  Britain, with the United States and with Russia, made a declaration at Potsdam on, I think, 2nd August, 1945, that they would support the application for admission of the neutral nations, mentioning one exception. The only communication we have had from Britain was a friendly <Col N="1472" /> intimation that that declaration applied to us and that in line with that declaration they would naturally support our application.</P>

      <P>I have, on behalf of this country, to conduct the affairs of the country.  There are communications between ourselves and different States.  Britain is not the only State with which we are dealing; we have communications with different States and without their permission, or without asking it&mdash;and I do not propose in this case to ask it&mdash;I am not going to read that correspondence.  If that rule were to be adopted, no nation would communicate with you.  There have necessarily to be private communications from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan hoped that we have not representatives in various countries doing nothing.  The fact is that the things he thought might have been done could have been done with propriety.  It did not happen to be necessary to do them, but if <Col N="1473" /> it were necessary to find out if there had not been statements and declarations such as the Potsdam Declaration, it would have been our business to try to find out, but, of course, I could not say, and I do not know yet, what would be the fate of our application.  I have seen some reports in the newspapers to-day which Deputies and the public have also seen, but I do not know what would be the result of our application. I do, however, know one thing, that is, that the British will support it, because it has been intimated to me directly in a friendly note indicating that their attitude was in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.  But, again, I say that the Potsdam Declaration was made a year ago.  The moment it was made, I had no doubt that the nations which made it would stand by it.  I did not assume for a moment that they would not, but it did not change our attitude as to whether we should apply then or not.</P>
    <P>What has changed that attitude is this, that if other neutral States apply for membership we do not want to apply at a later period alone.  We have been neutrals as they have been and our position has been very much alike in a number of ways, and we think it right that, if they should apply, we should apply, too.  That does not mean that if they did not apply, we might not apply.  We can take our own independent action, but we want to be in a position to take whatever action we might consider best.  On the whole, the chances are that we will apply, and if our doing that should influence the action of other small States, we are content that it should be so.  We hope to keep in reasonable touch with them, and, with the power and authority which we shall get here as a result of the vote, I hope we will be in a position to take action before whatever date is fixed as the latest date for application.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, something may happen, even before then, which may change our attitude and which may cause us to say: &ldquo;This is not the appropriate time for applying.&rdquo; and we may not actually apply at that particular time.  As I have said, the ideal time, from our point of view, for applying, <Col N="1474" /> for entering into this organisation&mdash;if we could fix the time; if it could be fixed by our will&mdash;is when the peace treaties have been concluded, when the contests which are obviously taking place, or which have been taking place up to the present, with regard to the ending of the war and the terms on which it should end have been brought to a finish, and when the minds of the people in various States have turned to building up and constructing the foundation for the future peace.</P>
    <P>The next meeting of the Assembly may coincide with such a time, because it would appear now&mdash;the indications are&mdash;that the peace conference may be shorter than people were inclined to believe some time ago.  The draft treaties having been largely agreed upon by the principal belligerents, the actual fixing of the treaties may not take a very long time, and the peace treaties may be concluded and the peace situation arrived at before the meeting of this Assembly.  It is also possible that, under the special arrangement which is available to them, the Security Council may, in that event, invite some of the other States in Europe who were belligerent States on the other side&mdash;belligerent against their will, as they would probably be regarded&mdash;to become members, too.</P>
    <P>My own hope is that this organisation will ultimately embrace all the nations, both those who were on one side and those who were on the other, and that we will really have a world organisation of the large States and the small States, with no discrimination against peoples, because, if there is such discrimination, it is a violation of the fundamental principles that must lie at the base of any organisation which is to last and to be effective.  I hope that will be done, and, if it be done, I certainly think that, once we were prepared to accept these obligations, it would be our duty to be there.</P>
    <P>I have not spoken at all of the advantages of joining this organisation, other than the fundamental advantage with regard to the way in which we would best secure our freedom.  I am not talking of the advantages that <Col N="1475" /> could be found in membership, or the part that our country might play, through its representatives, in such an assembly.  I have deliberately kept off that, because I think it very much better that this matter should be decided by us and by our people on the net question as to the method by which we are best able to preserve the freedom we have and to achieve the freedom we aspire to.  I call that the net test.  It may be regarded as a lower test than that which other people might apply, but I think it is a realistic test which, if applied now, accepted and a decision taken in accordance with it, is one which will not fail us later, if we have to fulfil our obligations.</P>
    <P>There is one fear which I would have, one danger which I would see, in regard to this.  I had an experience of it here and I think I indicated it already.  At the time of the attack on Abyssinia, against the clear obligations of the States in the old League, there was a question of whether military action would be taken or not.  It might have happened that the League at that time would have decided on military action, and if military action had been decided on&mdash;I admit it would have been difficult within the organisation&mdash;it would have been our duty to play our part in that action.  That was going to be a very serious matter here, because of the fact that, in the one case, the nation against which action had to be taken was a nation which was culturally associated with ours over a long period, and the nation on whose behalf we would have had to take action was a nation which was unknown to us.</P>
    <P>That matter was going to be extremely difficult here, but, if we were to play our part as a nation, it would have been our duty to participate in that action.  I do not know whether I would have been able to get a majority in the House in favour of it, and what I am trying to do now is to ensure that, whoever may be in this seat, if ever an occasion arises involving the question of the fulfilment of our obligation under that charter, it ever such a day comes, that, in advance, our people will be fortified <Col N="1476" /> by the knowledge that it is their duty to fulfil them and that they will not be taken by surprise in having to deal with a situation of that sort.</P>
    <P>With regard to one or two matters which were raised, there seemed to be a little confusion on the part of some of the speakers, and, curiously enough, they were speakers who probably had studied the charter more closely than others, or who were in a position to study it with previous training.  There seemed to be some suggestion that two of the great Powers could decide in the Security Council&mdash;as if it were a majority of two out of three or something of the sort&mdash;what action would have to be taken under the charter. That is not so at all.  The point is that, under the charter, action by the Security Council must be taken with the full concurrence of the whole five. That is the organisation as it is at the moment.  If there is a falling out between these five, if they go different roads and do not concur, there can be no question of members having any obligations, because there will have been no decision.</P>
    <P>If there were to be war against one of them then, legally at any rate, it seems to me the whole organisation falls to pieces.  It is defective to that extent.  It is not designed to do the very things that such an organisation should do.  It is not designed to restrain any of the five great Powers, except in so far as they might be restrained by consultation.  All the great wars have come about because of differences between the great Powers.  This organisation, as it is under the present form of charter, does not guarantee the world against another great war, because it simply falls to pieces at once if action should have to be taken against any one of these five powers.  In such a case action could not be taken legally under the charter, and the whole thing would go to bits. It is all right for taking action against others when the whole five agree.  But I expect they will not agree if action falls to be taken against any one of themselves.  What would happen is, that the whole thing would go tottering down, just like the League of Nations. It is not an effective method from that <Col N="1477" /> point of view for guaranteeing the peace of the world.  There is no means in it of compelling the big Powers to obey the law.  It does not allow the big Powers to be coerced into obeying the law.  Until the big Powers like the others, submit themselves, and bow their heads to the fact, that they, too, will be ruled by law, then no method like this will preserve peace. I am very far from wishing to deny the big States their proper weight and proper influence.  They deserve that in view of their size, their power and their influence.  They are entitled to a proper weight of representation of some kind.  At the moment they have not admitted that they will be subject to the law.  But, like the old League of Nations, this organisation might be a step on the road and a good deal might be done by it towards bringing about a state of affairs in which large as well as small nations would accept the rule of law.  We may be heading towards that, but we are very far from the end of the road in the charter.  I do not think our people or Deputies have any illusions about it.  It is quite wrong to argue that a majority of, say, three of the great Powers could decide that one was an aggressor and take action against that one in accordance with the terms of the charter.  They cannot because, as I say, the league would be dissolved the moment one of these great Powers is an aggressor. That is the legal position it seems to me.  What the moral position would be is another matter.</P>
    <P>What would be the end?  In the old League of Nations, there was a disposition on the part of some States to get together in different camps.  I think that is a misfortune.  It is a terrible thing that an organisation, when the real test comes, is not able to meet it and either dissolves or splits up into new <i>ad hoc</i> combinations for the time.</P>
    <P>All people who genuinely wish to have a world organisation that will be effective must, in the first instance, try to get the big nations&mdash;if it can be done by any method&mdash;to submit to the rule of law, like the others.  That does not mean that they should not get their full influence in such an organisation. I think they deserve that. It is their right.  If a world authority <Col N="1478" /> could only be got in defence of the position that the law is there and that if any State has been found to have broken the law&mdash;that State being bound to obey like everybody else&mdash; the law is enforced and the power to enforce it is sufficient to compel obedience, if necessary&mdash;that is the objective in view.</P>
    <P>However imperfect this charter, I think it is our duty to play our part in this organisation.  I have not the slightest doubt about the way mankind should try to work in the direction of a world organisation.  At the League of Nations on one occasion I expressed a view which would be extremely difficult to get accepted, but which I think is true in the end, that the only way in which we can get in that direction really, is by something like a world conferderation, in which there will be justice, such as we have by our municipal constitutions and courts and so on and which will be able to exercise a sovereign authority which is generally accepted.  You would have States confederated in such a way that there is authority, a law-making authority, an executive for seeing that the law is carried out, and a court to determine what is the law at a particular time and to apply it to a particular instance. I think we are very far from that.  I see what difficulties there would be in trying to bring about such a condition. Sometimes it is the small nations which are more difficult.  My recollection is that it was one small State in the American Union that stood out longest against entering the United States.</P>

      <P>No, that is so.  I am simply talking of human nature and how it reacts.  There is no doubt that the small nations are probably more attached to what they regard as their sovereign rights than the large ones. On the question of sovereignty we have to realise that whenever you enter into any combination and accept the rules then to that extent you deny the right to decide for yourself.  To that extent you surrender your sovereignty.  That is inevitable in all organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey spoke of trade unions.  When a man enters a trade <Col N="1479" /> union he gives up the right in certain circumstances to do what he pleases. He guarantees in advance that he will do a certain thing in accordance with whatever rules are laid down for the organisation as a whole.  If he is a loyal member and wants to work with them he will keep to the rules and will fetter his own will, once he has joined the organisation.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the members of the Dáil have viewed this matter in the way they have viewed it.  I am very glad that they have seen fully the implications and I have no doubt that, notwithstanding the seriousness of the obligations, our people are prepared to assume them.  I do agree that it would be desirable that it should be fully explained to them and that opportunity should be taken to do it. It has been suggested that on one occasion we issued cheap copies of the Constitution so that it might be available for our people.  I will consult to see whether we could not have cheap copies available for our people so that they may study this charter and understand it.  If we are accepted, of course, we will have to come back to the Dáil.  In the first instance, being an international agreement, it has to be laid before Parliament and there will be an opportunity given to anybody who wishes to discuss it then.  There will also be a question later.  There are charges.  We will have to accept our proportionate share, I suppose, of the expenses.  It will be our duty as a member to try to keep these expenses down but we will have to bear our share of them. That being a charge on public funds, an agreement involving such a charge will have to come here.  Again, assuming that we are a member, there will be a question of these agreements about the facilities which we should afford to the Security Council, and so on.  These matters will be matters of negotiation in the first instance but they are matters which will naturally have to come here for acceptance and for ratification.  So that, from time to time, the Dáil will be in a position to consider, and to hear about, the obligations that are being accepted <Col N="1480" /> under this charter, and I have no doubt that our people, now that this matter has come to a head, will take a very much closer interest in this organisation than they have done before.</P>
    <P>I do again express the view that our people are not so far behind in this matter as might be suggested by some of the speakers.  I think our people generally have been following international affairs.  I do not believe that during the war it was right to say we were cut off and did not know what was happening.  I think we had probably a more accurate general view than most of the nations in Europe had.  That is my own view.  In this case, also, I believe our people are likely to take a well-balanced view of the whole situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter of substance which the Taoiseach has not touched upon that was raised in the course of the debate.  In the Constitution of the League of Nations there was an express provision that, if the constitution should be changed in any material detail, there was machinery for a nation withdrawing.  In the charter of this body there appears to be no positive or negative provision in regard to withdrawal.  Are we, therefore, to assume that our acceptance of membership is irrevocable on our part or do we reserve the right to withdraw? Is there any legal method envisaged by the charter for withdrawing in the event of the charter being radically altered, bearing in mind, of course, that in the last analysis we can walk out and take the consequences, but is there a legal procedure provided?</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any in the charter.  This charter has been drawn up, in a certain sense, in a hurry, and not every contingency was foreseen and it probably may have been completely forgotten.  That is one of the advantages of coming in fairly early in these things, that you are in at the formative stage and matters of this sort can be brought up.  But at the moment there does not seem to be any provision for that.</P>

At least, Section 31 provides for a complaint being made to the labour court by a trade union of workers affected by an agreement that an employer affected by the agreement is not observing it and the court has the power to order the employer to take such action as will rectify his default, including the payment of arrears of pay to a worker concerned.  It is intended that the enforcement of a registered agreement should be through the labour court and not by the <Col N="1482" /> Minister in the same way as rates of wages or conditions of employment prescribed by a joint labour committee would be enforced by the Minister.  I think it is undesirable that the Minister should come into the picture at all in the enforcement of registered agreements.  I think the proposal in the Bill that the labour court will function in that regard is preferable.</P>

      <P>In page 12, Section 31, to delete sub-section (2), lines 1 to 22, and substitute the following sub-section:</P>
      <P>(2)  If an employer or a trade union representative of employers affected by a registered employment agreement complains to the court that a trade union representative of workers affected by the agreement is promoting or assisting out of its funds in the maintenance of a strike which to the knowledge of the general committee of management of the trade union of workers is in contravention of the agreement and which has for its object the enforcement of a demand on an employer to grant to a worker remuneration or conditions other than those fixed by the agreement, the following provisions shall have effect:</P>
      <P>(a)  the court shall consider the complaint and shall hear all persons appearing to the court to be interested and desiring to be heard;</P>
      <P>(b)  if, after such consideration, the court is satisfied that the complaint is well-founded&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the court may, by order, direct the said trade union of workers to refrain from assisting out of its funds in the maintenance of the said strike;</P>
      <P>(ii)  the court may cancel the registration of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will remember that I accepted an amendment by Deputy Norton in Committee subject to revision of its wording by the Parliamentary draftsman. Some revision was found to be <Col N="1485" /> necessary and this is the amendment, as accepted, revised.  The changes effected by the revision are as follows: First of all, the sub-section is made to apply to an employer &ldquo;affected by an agreement&rdquo; instead of an employer &ldquo;party to an agreement,&rdquo; and also to a trade union &ldquo;affected by an agreement&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;party to an agreement.&rdquo; That change is necessary because it is clear that an employer may be affected by although not party to an agreement, and consequently he should have the limited protection which the section gives.  Similarly, a trade union, in circumstances mentioned by Deputy Norton a moment ago, might be affected although not party to an agreement and consequently should come under the section also.</P>
    <P>The second change is in the tense. The sub-section, as introduced in Committee, refers to a trade union which &ldquo;has promoted&rdquo; a strike and that should obviously be a trade union that &ldquo;is promoting&rdquo; a strike.  The word &ldquo;deliberately&rdquo; is left out before &ldquo;promoted&rdquo; because it adds nothing to the strength and might cause some ambiguity in interpretation.  &ldquo;The governing body of a trade union&rdquo; is changed to &ldquo;the general committee of management of a trade union,&rdquo; which is considered more appropriate; and the wording at the end is revised, not for the purpose of altering the sense but to make the meaning clear.  The other changes are drafting changes and do not affect the sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And that inelegant word &ldquo;connivance&rdquo; has been cut out. I still would prefer if the section were phrased in its opening words in the way it was in the Bill when we discussed it on the Committee Stage.  I do not think the section has been improved by making it possible for an employer affected by a registered agreement to complain to the court that a trade union representing the workers &ldquo;(party to the agreement) has, deliberately promoted or assisted out of its funds in the maintenance of a strike which to the knowledge and with the connivance of the governing body of the trade union of said workers took place in contravention of the agreement....&rdquo;<Col N="1486" /> The whole purpose of the section has been that those who are parties to an agreement make the agreement and if they break it they are amenable to the court for a decision.  Now we are getting away from that and permitting an employer not a party to the agreement to come into court, although he was in no sense a principal to the transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He might, nevertheless, be subject to the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Although he is subject to the agreement, he is subject in the sense that he has got to give the same rate of wages as the good-class employer who makes the agreement. If he wants to get a remedy against a union and have the right to complain, he ought to be compelled to go in and negotiate the agreement in the first instance.  If he does not, he has no right to complain.  The law simply says that the agreement was negotiated by the good-class employers and the trade unions and if he wants to come in he will have to go into the agreement.  If, for reasons of his own, he does not want to be in the employers organisation and does not want to take part in the negotiations, then he has no standing.  It seems to be a novelty to say that any person who never took part in the agreement and knows nothing about its terms, except what he has heard after it is made, can come into court with the same standing as an employer who took part in and voluntarily undertook to carry out the terms of the agreement.  I still hold that an employer who will not come in and negotiate an agreement ought to be told that the penalty is that he cannot make a complaint in court.</P>

      <P>We have agreed that an agreement, when registered, applies to all workers of the defined class, even though the employer of those workers was not a party to the agreement.  If there are ten employers and nine of them are party, the tenth has to conform, even though he may have been unwilling to participate in the agreement. If an employer is affected, clearly he must be entitled to the limited protection which this sub-section gives.  It would seem to me to be unreasonable to have the section work one way only, that he could be brought before the court by a trade union if he fails to observe the agreement. It is quite fair that he should have the right to complain to the court if the contrary action were being taken against him.  Therefore, it seems to be unduly restrictive to confine this section to employers &ldquo;party&rdquo; to an agreement.  Clearly it should apply to all employers and all trade unions.</P>

At some stage it acquires members in that class of work and subject to that agreement.  Should not that union, catering for those workers, have the right of complaint under the Bill and he held liable to observe the agreement under this sub-section?  We must widen the scope of the sub-section to include unions which are &ldquo;affected&rdquo; as distinct from those <Col N="1488" /> which are &ldquo;party&rdquo; to the agreement. If that is true of unions, it must be true also of employers.</P>

      <P>I would like to mention an aspect of this amendment which has not been mentioned.  If it were passed, a most unsatisfactory state of affairs might be created in which, before a person could make a complaint, there would be an examinaction of his credentials to see if he was a party to the registered agreement and all sorts of shades of that would occur.

      <P>I move amendment No. 44, as an amendment to amendment No. 42:</P>
      <P>In page 12, Section 31 (2) (b), line 19, to delete the words &ldquo;out of its funds.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What I want to bring out is that &ldquo;out of its funds&rdquo; is altogether too narrow a way of describing the assistance that a trade union could give to a body of workers out on strike.  I suggest that would be very difficult to prove, and that if those words were struck out it would leave it &ldquo;representatives of workers affected by the agreement as promoting or assisting in the maintenance of the strike&rdquo; and so on.  That would be a more definite way of looking into the whole matter.  As I said before, there are many ways of assisting a body of workers.  I consider that the Minister ought to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister ought not to do any such thing.  Instead of making the section clearer, Deputy Dockrell's amendment would make it as complicated as it is possible to make it, because it would then read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The court may by order direct <Col N="1489" /> the said union of workers to refrain from assisting in the maintenance of the said strike.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Ultimately, the matter would have to be tested as to what was the meaning of &ldquo;assisting in the maintenance of a strike.&rdquo;  So long as a union does not overtly assist people on strike for the purpose of continuing it I think that the whole spirit of the section would be complied with, but &ldquo;assisting in the maintenance of a strike&rdquo; may well consist in advising people.  If the executive of a union were in consultation with a recalcitrant branch and was trying to persuade them not to persist in an undesirable course of action, certain people might consider that was assisting them, unless the proceedings between the executive and the committee were open for inspection by everybody.  It is possible to ascertain whether a union is assisting a strike out of its funds because that fact can be ascertained.  The court would be empowered to bring the union before it, and ascertain whether, in fact, any cheques were issued to any members on strike or to the branch committee controlling the strike or to the secretary of the branch committee.  When, however, you try to get a definition of what &ldquo;assisting in the maintenance of a strike&rdquo; really means, you may find that the most trivial act by an executive, or by the principal officers of the executive, may be held to be assisting in the promotion of a strike.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that is the intention of the Deputy or not, but if he wants to create a situation in which almost anything can be construed as &ldquo;assisting in the maintenance of a strike,&rdquo; short of having a row in public with a difficult branch committee, I do not know of any more effective way in which he could go about it than by seeking to delete the words in his amendment.  It ought to satisfy the Deputy and employers generally if the prohibition is related to assisting in the maintenance of a strike out of union funds.  If, however, you delete the words &ldquo;out of the union funds,&rdquo; then the section can be interpreted in a variety of ways, and it will be interpreted mainly against the unions because of the fact that there is no definition <Col N="1490" /> of what assisting is.  In the section, the meaning of assisting is perfectly clear.  It means paying out money in furtherance of a strike. Under the Deputy's amendment assisting might mean giving advice.  In that situation, is it the Deputy's intention that unions should be liable to a fine of £500?  I think if the Deputy reflects on it he will see that, by his amendment, he is making the section very ambiguous.  I am not sure that acceptance of it might not make it possible to use funds in a way not contemplated by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not altogether agree that the deletion of the words would make the paragraph ambiguous or ineffective.  I think that the power given to the court is adequate when one bears in mind that, in addition to the limitation upon the use of union funds which follows from a court order, the union is also convicted by the court of having broken the agreement.  That, in itself, must react on the conduct of the union, because, presumably, its ability to negotiate agreements with employers and generally to cater for its members, will be impaired if there is a declaration by the court that it has broken the agreement.  I think that perhaps the moral effect of that decision by the court might be even more effective in many ways than the actual order prohibiting the use of funds.  I think, therefore, that the section is effective enough with these words in it.  I would not agree that it would be ineffective if the words were out.  But, in so far as it is desired to make clear what precisely the effect of the court order will be on the union, it is probably better to leave in the words relating to the funds.</P>

      <P>May I direct the Minister's attention to what appears to be an omission?  The complaint to the court is that a union has promoted or assisted a strike out of its funds.  The court has power to order a union to refrain from assisting a strike out of its funds, but the section is silent on the matter of promoting a strike.  The complaint to the court is &ldquo;promoting or assisting&rdquo;.  Is that omission deliberate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>What is intended there is this: that the court having considered the complaint, which it thinks justified, will give an order to the union saying: &ldquo;You must not assist this strike out of your funds; the strike is in contravention of an agreement, and, consequently, you must not give that form of assistance.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton cited a case which, I think, no fair-minded person could suggest.  He said that, if a union entered into negotiations with a recalcitrant body, it would be regarded as &ldquo;promoting or assisting&rdquo;.  I certainly did not suggest that.  I suggest a case for the consideration of the Deputy in which the assisting would be out of its funds. Suppose a union said: &ldquo;Well, look here, of course we cannot assist you out of our funds, but we suggest that the members should agree to put a levy on themselves.&rdquo;  I suggest that the retention of the words &ldquo;out of its funds&rdquo; makes the thing too narrow altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that we are overlooking the whole basis on which we are trying to frame the section.  The Minister referred to the fact that, in effect, the real penalty imposed on a union is, first of all, cancellation of the registered agreement, and secondly, pillorying of a union as one whose bond cannot be accepted in good faith.  I think that Deputy Dockrell is aware that the whole basis of collective negotiation is acceptance on the part of each party to an agreement that the word of the other party will, as a general rule, be kept.  If we depart from that, we are departing from what is the test of collective bargaining.  Any union which acquires the reputation that its word cannot be accepted will soon find that it will not be in a position to negotiate agreements.  On the other hand, if the amendment proposed by Deputy Dockrell is accepted, it will open the door to possible abuse, as indicated by Deputy Norton.  Deputy Dockrell does not seem to have taken notice of the other side of the picture. If I were a trade union official and desired to enter into an agreement, which I had no intention of keeping, I <Col N="1492" /> should be in favour of Deputy Dockrell's amendment.  It could be taken advantage of by such a union, whereas a union which proposed to act in good faith might be penalised.  On consideration, I think that Deputy Dockrell will find that the paragraph would be better as it is even from his point of view.</P>

      <P>When you come to construe &ldquo;union&rdquo; legally under amendment No. 42, it may very well be established that a trade union means not merely a union collectively but an official of the union, on the ground that the union is responsible for his actions.</P>

      <P>It might be held under Section 31, as amended by amendment No. 42, that the term &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; would include an official of the union. An official of the union might be sympathetic to a strike which a union proper was not assisting by making funds available to members.  The official might be a local man engaged in directing the unofficial strike.  It might be held that the union proper was, in those circumstances, guilty of an offence and, in that case, the union could be held liable to the fine set out in the section.  Other cases will occur to the Deputy.  Suppose a large trade union organisation has premises in different parts of the country.  An unofficial strike is being conducted by a local branch committee from its premises, where office equipment, owned by the union proper, is installed and where a staff, paid by the union proper, is operating.  It might be held that, by making the hall available to the branch for the unofficial strike and by making clerical assistance available, the union was in some way assisting in the promotion and maintenance of the strike.  I think that that is not contemplated at all.  Deputy Dockrell will have to find his consolation and the unions will have to find their consolation in the fact that, if people make agreements, they are morally bound to keep them.  If the Bill were to be conceived <Col N="1493" /> in a policeman spirit&mdash;keeping an eye on the other fellow&mdash;not many agreements would be registered and this Bill would not work in the smooth way we hope it will.  In these circumstances, I suggest that Deputy Dockrell should not press his amendment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows as well as I do that the practice of not passing a strike picket is adopted by all organised workers.  If there were a strike of boilermen in a factory, it would not be reasonable for the employer to expect other workers in the factory to insist on continuing their work.  Normally, a strike of one class of workers involves a cessation of work or a refusal by other workers to do work in the same premises.  What is provided for here is: if there are two grades of workers, members of the same union, in the same premises, one grade of which is on strike, the fact that the other grade decline to work on the premises while the strike continues will not be a reason why dispute pay should not be given to them by the trade union.  Whatever the Deputy might desire to see, having regard to the realities of the situation, it is reasonable to make this provision.</P>

      <P>I put down amendment No. 48, which cannot be regarded as a very satisfactory one, simply to provide a means of raising this point. Has the Minister considered what has been discussed in this connection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Say that proceedings arise in a court at the level of the Circuit Court&mdash;for instance a workman's compensation case.  We get then the question of a man's agreement and the employment risks he has to undergo.  The court has to consider a matter referred to in many decided cases, what is called the added risks or the added peril.  The question whether it is added or not arises on consideration of the agreement itself&mdash;has the man put himself in a new peril in connection with work not really related to the conditions of employment?  The principles with regard to added peril or added risk are then adjudicated upon.  The basis of <Col N="1496" /> the whole thing is, what are the conditions of employment and has the man incurred any extra risk?</P>
    <P>Suppose you have a claim for workmen's compensation as a result of an injury suffered by a workman.  That is going to be considered by the court on (a) the terms of his employment and (b) something extra to which the man has subjected himself.  Does the Minister realise that, under this amendment, workmen's compensation cases will have to be referred to the industrial court to get an interpretation on his agreement or the terms of employment? That matter will have to be sent back to be adjudicated upon by this lay court.  Appeals in workmen's compensation cases are taken now direct to the Supreme Court.  It is possible that a point may be raised in the Supreme Court which has not been raised in the first hearing.  Does the Minister seriously contemplate that the judges in the highest court in this country, considering the arguments in a workman's compensation case, may be suddenly held up in their hearing by the consideration: &ldquo;Well, there is an agreement here of which we should like to have an interpretation.  We realise, however, that the interpretation of the agreement under Section 32 is a matter not for us but for an entirely different court.&rdquo;  They then close their proceedings until this matter is referred to the lay court and the lay court sends back their interpretation of the agreement.  That is one case.  I am taking an ordinary case but these cases could be multiplied <i>ad infinitum.</i></P>
    <P>Take a case where a man is dismissed, and makes a claim for wrongful dismissal.  The question arises then whether he has been dismissed in accordance with the conditions of his agreement.  Say that he is in the High Court claiming £500 for wrongful dismissal. Does the Minister seriously contemplate that if such a question is raised in the High Court, the case has to be interrupted until such time as the lay court&mdash;I am calling it that without offence&mdash;has pronounced upon the meaning of the agreement?  I suggest that was not in the Minister's contemplation when this Bill was being drafted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1497" /> I unwillingly accept the view that the labour representatives&mdash;I do not know why&mdash;would rather have a lay court than the ordinary courts to decide this question.  I have not heard any satisfactory reasons for that except it is founded on conditions which may be easily confined.  I could understand the labour representatives saying: &ldquo;We would rather have a situation in which the lay court decides on the interpretation, where on the results of the interpretation, a question depends as to whether there is an industrial dispute or not&rdquo;.  I could imagine everything relating to industrial disputes being confined.  I regret that that should be the situation but I am taking that as the view that after deliberation has been accepted by the labour representatives. Let us limit it to that point of view and let the Minister accept that. The labour representatives say that in anything leading to a trade dispute they would prefer to have the interpretation of such an agreement brought before the lay court.  Surely, however, the question of a man's rights, say in regard to alleged wrongful dismissal or compensation for incapacity to work, should be left to the ordinary courts for their determination.</P>
    <P>I wonder could the Minister not make some division and say that any question leading to a labour dispute or involved in a labour dispute might be left for the interpretation of the agreement to the lay court but that once you have an agreement registered, when it comes to the question of a man's right to compensation for injury or for wrongful dismissal, that should be left to the independent judiciary established by the State.  After all the energy that has been expended during the centuries on the establishment of an independent judiciary as the best system of getting the rule of law established in the country, I think it is a rather haphazard decision to take away from the ordinary courts every question as to the interpretation of an agreement or of a man's obligations under the agreement.  That is going to be left entirely and completely to the lay court.  I should like to hear some further explanation from the Minister in support of that proposal.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt the desirability of this procedure.  I think there are a number of advantages in having the interpretation of a registered agreement solely the function of the labour court.  Not only is the atmosphere of that court likely to lead to a more intelligent interpretation of the agreement than the atmosphere of the ordinary court, but the confining of that function to the labour court ensures a uniformity of interpretation which may be of considerable importance.  There are other advantages also.  It is, I think, worth mentioning that this procedure means that any person can get an interpretation of a registered agreement without having to institute formal proceedings. He can go to the labour court for an interpretation of an agreement at any time he wishes.  If there was a necessity to have these agreements interpreted by the ordinary courts, there would have to be some action taken before the question of interpretation would arise there.  May I point out also that this practice of interpreting collective agreements by non-legal courts is to be found in the legislation of many countries.  In fact, it exists at present in Great Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is this difference in the circumstances, that the chairman of the New Zealand court is a judge, a person holding legal qualifications and having the same tenure as an ordinary judge, but on the principle of final interpretation of an agreement no appeal from the decisions of that court is provided in that legislation.  I do not think that this practice will constitute the difficulty that the Deputy contemplates.  Certainly I do not think the difficulty would be such as to outweigh the very obvious advantages. <Col N="1499" /> There may be objections to this court because it is composed mainly of a non-legal personnel.  The objection would not be as strong if the chairman were qualified in legal matters, a judge of the High Court or of the Supreme Court, but the arguments against the appointment of a legal person as chairman of the court are purely practical arguments.  It does not necessarily follow that the decisions of the court will not be uniform and in strict accord with the interpretation of agreements in the spirit in which they were framed and which the court understood them to mean when they accepted them for registration.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that to provide for an appeal from the labour court, on the question of the interpretation of an agreement, to the ordinary courts or to provide for circumstances under which the ordinary courts of law could interpret independently of the labour court would introduce a risk of such complications that it would not be worth while doing it merely for the sake of theory, or for the sake of avoiding the necessity for resorting to a procedure which is unusual in a court of law.  I do not think that there should be any difficulty in making rules which would ensure that, when a question of this kind would arise in a court of law, it could be referred to the labour court, without delay, and a decision on the interpretation of the agreement received from the labour court and available to the court of law to enable the case to be resumed and a decision to be given at the usual time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that my amendment was rather haphazardly chosen but, bad and all as it is&mdash;and I do not claim any great merit for its wording&mdash;it meets one difficulty; that is, to put in &ldquo;excluding&rdquo; in opposition to the word &ldquo;including&rdquo;.  If the amendment were accepted, then any question arising as to proceedings, excluding proceedings in a court of law, would be referred to the labour court. That would meet the difficulty of which the Minister talked.  The Minister has said that he does not want the situation in which all questions would have to be referred to a court.  I do not <Col N="1500" /> want that either.  But if a case has gone to the point that a man has been advised that he has certain rights under the law and that he feels he has such rights, once he takes the step then of going to the court the matter should be left to the court to determine. The amendment, in so far as I seek to change it, would merely mean that where the individual has, on advice, originated an action at law then the law courts should be allowed to decide it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supposing, for instance, that an employer group and an employee group made an agreement and something occurred which might lead to a labour dispute&mdash;and the whole purpose of this Bill is to avoid such disputes&mdash;and an individual is not encouraged to go to a court, then I can see the field to be covered by the people coming back and saying: &ldquo;We want this interpreted; we want you people in the labour court to get back to the circumstances under which this agreement was drawn up; it is agreed that the people operating before this court came to an agreement along certain lines; if we have badly written that down, or misinterpreted it, we will now correct the agreement and we will get an agreement, by interpretation, which will enable it to be carried out.&rdquo;  But where the individual feels that the agreement has not been properly worded and where he wants to find out if he has certain rights based upon that agreement, it should be left then to the independent ordinary judiciary of the country to establish his rights for him.  I can well understand circumstances in which a body of employees might say to a body of employers: &ldquo;We wrote down a certain agreement; certain circumstances have now arisen which we do not think are covered by the agreement; we, therefore, want the agreement to be re-interpreted from a new angle&rdquo;.  In that case I certainly think they ought to be entitled to go back and secure, by way of such interpretation, an enlargement or an amendment of the original agreement.  But supposing you have an agreement and an individual asserts that he has been wrongfully dismissed under that agreement, surely, it should be open to the independent judiciary of <Col N="1501" /> the country to say whether or not he has been wrongfully dismissed and award him damages.</P>
    <P>Similarly, if a man says: &ldquo;I was engaged under certain circumstances and I have been advised and I hold that risks were imposed upon me and that I underwent such risks and suffered an accident and am now disabled&rdquo;&mdash;why should that be referred back to the labour court to say,<i>post facto,</i> what the risks were that the man took in his employment?  If an individual is under the sway of his union and his union decides that the matter should be dealt with in another way and that they will go to the labour court and get the court liberally to interpret the conditions of his employment, so that it will be quite clear that the risk was one which was properly incurred in the carrying out of his work, then that individual will naturally go before the ordinary court to get his risk valued in money's worth. But, to my mind, the two things are completely distinct.  I do not say that I have found the formula to make the distinction here in this phrase, but I think the two sets of circumstances are clear and distinct.  You have a somewhat analogous situation in relation to international agreements.  People are often asked to submit these to a court; they invariably say: &ldquo;No, we will not; we will go back to the people who made the agreement with us and we will try to find out what that agreement means; we will explore the contents; there are new circumstances now which give light and life to a phrase and we want to have that particular phrase analysed&rdquo;.  They will be told: &ldquo;That is not what we meant and you know that is not what we meant&rdquo;, and they will get an enlargement or an amendment of that agreement.  But, take again the case of the individual who says: &ldquo;I believe I have rights under this and I want to go to the courts to get my rights&rdquo;, I say he should be allowed to do that.  If we set any value on the independent judicial institutions of this country we should give them liberty to analyse that type of agreement.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about uniformity. What is the likelihood of a lack of uniformity? <Col N="1502" /> I can only see that arising through minds which think the courts adopt a too narrow or too rigid viewpoint on agreements that come before them.  They sometimes read in to Statutes of this Assembly even meanings which, if the Debates were read, it would be clear were not in the minds of the people who framed the Statutes. That may be an objection.  But is this court going to build up its own precedents and set its own standards?  Is it going to be ruled by its own cases as decided by it?  If so, they will build up a body of precedents and they will be bound by their decisions. I hope they will be bound by their decisions; otherwise there would be no stability.  Does the Minister think that the two groups&mdash; the trained mind in the courts and the lay mind which will eventually become trained through operating in the labour court&mdash;are going to be so completely at variance on the interpretation of an agreement as to lead to any confusion? I do not believe there is any ground for that at all.  I could see it, perhaps, in isolated cases here and there.  The Minister says he wants uniformity.  I think he will get uniformity in the end, or something approaching uniformity. But if the independent judiciary is to have any value I think we should sacrifice something in order to uphold that principle.  That is why in this amendment I bring it down to the point that if a man is dissatisfied and if he decides to go to a court he ought to be allowed to go to the court and subject himself to the court's decision.  That will only occur when a man goes to a court of law.</P>

      <P>The ordinary type of agreement made between unions and employers certainly does not cover all the circumstances under which an employee has to work.  They may be covered by recognised practice or by <Col N="1503" /> the requirements of the Factory Acts. They may be entirely at the discretion of the employer.  In fact, in the majority of the occupations the condition under which the workers perform their work is at the sole discretion of the employer and no attempt is made by the unions to interfere in any way. It seems to me that, if this provision remains as it stands, the practice will develop that where a person taking an action in the courts is advised that the outcome may turn upon the interpretation of a particular registered agreement he will go first to the labour court and get his interpretation.</P>

      <P>It will affect cases of wrongful dismissal where questions may arise as to whether the rule for dismissing redundant workers is followed or not.  It may arise in a claim for arrears of wages and on the question of rates payable; that, in turn, may depend upon the nature of the work the person is doing or the class in which he should be placed as a worker.</P>
      <P>Quite recently a dispute arose in County Dublin where workers were employed as general labourers.  At a stage during their employment they claimed that the work they were doing at that particular point was work which ordinarily should be done by builders' labourers, to which a different rate applied.  There was a question of fact there which could, I think, be determined by this labour court much more satisfactorily than by a court of law.  But, if we had the possibility that, by going to the court of law on some claim, a different interpretation was put on the agreement, or a different decision was taken as to the fact, then we might have a situation where many hundreds of workers covered by the registered agreement would feel that they were entitled to claim some alteration in their conditions of employment because they were outside the scope of the registered agreement, or because a decision of a court of law appeared to bring them within the scope of it.  It is because a difficulty of that kind might result from having a situation in which the scope of a registered agreement, or its application to any class of worker, will be decided by a court of law that this is considered to be the more desirable arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that Deputy McGilligan's objection to it is very largely theoretical.  It is based upon a feeling that it is in some way a reflection on the capacity of courts of law to have them in this particular matter bound by the decision of the labour court on a question of the interpretation of a registered agreement.  I do not think that is very valid.  I pointed out that it is not unusual in the law of other countries and that, in any event, it is not altogether different from business <Col N="1505" /> contracts which are to be settled by the arbitration of a named person or the arbitration of some named body. In that case, in any action arising in a court of law the court would have to take into account the terms of the contract and assume that the parties had agreed to be bound by the arbitration of some named person or body.  It certainly would not be regarded as casting any reflection on the capacity of the court to interpret the contract equitably themselves.  Having regard to the very practical advantages in keeping this question within the sphere of this court, it seems to me that the theoretical objection which Deputy McGilligan advances does not outweigh it. While there may be some question as to the constitutionality of the procedure, I have no doubt whatever as to its desirability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the arbitration question is not relevant to this, because there the parties freely enter into an agreement and, if any dispute arises, they will in the first instance refer the matter to arbitration.  There are, of course, court proceedings which often follow in the background of that matter.  That is excluded by this.  The matter is not just on the same footing. I want to achieve that, if an employer or an employee wants to go to the labour court to get an agreement interpreted, he can go.  All I ask is that, if one or other of the parties, and either of the parties can be forestalled by the other going to the labour court, decides to take the bold course of going into a court of law, the court of law ought to be left to adjudicate.  That is the sole purpose of the amendment. It is excluding proceedings in a court of law.  Proceedings in a court of law must be instituted by somebody.  The court does not institute them on its own.  The court cannot say to the <Col N="1506" /> people: &ldquo;You are unwilling to come to court and you are going to be brought into court by us.&rdquo;  The institution of proceedings lies with somebody who will be called a plaintiff in an action.  All I ask is that, if somebody decides to become a plaintiff in a court of law, the court of law should have full cognisance and that there should be no interruption of the proceedings for a reference to the labour court.</P>
      <P>It may be said in answer to me that some crank of an individual may say: &ldquo;I am going to the court; I do not care anything about the labour court, and I am going to go ahead.&rdquo;  It will be a very odd case in which one individual can take that course, bringing about an interpretation which may bind hundreds of thousands of people. The unions or the employer's side will know what is on and they can go to the labour court for an interpretation, and the interpretation, if made before the proceedings are instituted in a court of law, will be binding, because, if there is an agreement which is the foundation of a basic dispute, the agreement, with its interpretation, will be before the court.  What I object to is, and I ask the Minister to take it seriously, if somebody becomes a plaintiff in a court of law in a case in which he is seeking some right founded upon an agreement, that that judicial inquiry should be interrupted in its course in order to get a lay court to say what the agreement means.  I think that if a man seeks a court of law he should be left to it, knowing that he has resort to the labour court to get an interpretation beforehand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter in which I have to be advised and, while the advice given to me is that the section is clear of constitutional objection at the moment, the lawyers concerned, as lawyers always do, have expressed a desire to think again on the matter. It is not to be assumed that their second thoughts will be different from their first.</P>

The Government, by regulation, have kept wages at a very low level, and we should have some provision in our Acts of Parliament for a family wage.  Deputy Larkin spoke about a wage sufficient to keep a man in working efficiency, but wages at present, as tied down by Government regulations, would not keep a man in working efficiency and these wages are responsible for emigration and so on. We suggest that some words other than &ldquo;standard wage&rdquo; should be used in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained in Committee, what we are trying to do in the section is something very limited and very practical.  It is to try to provide, by order of the court, which will have no binding effect, an improvement of wages for general workers in smaller towns by the moral effect of the court's determination.  That will not work, unless the court relates its finding to the actual conditions prevailing in the town.  If you try to elaborate it by putting on the court the obligation to have regard to extraneous matters, either the court will not use its powers, or the determination will be ineffective, because, unless it has a clear relation to the conditions prevailing, the rates paid to other workers in the vicinity or in the neighbouring towns, it just will <Col N="1514" /> not be observed.  I explained that what we are trying to do here is based on our experience of the Standstill Order The making of a standard rate order for these workers, even though it was not obligatory on the employers to pay that rate, did, in fact, mean that the rate was paid, and workers who were unorganised and not in a position to press their claims themselves got the benefit of the increase, by reason of the fact that what was regarded as a Government Order had been made.  We are trying to carry that advantage over into permanent legislation.  It may not work, but I am quite certain it will not work if we try to do more than the very limited thing we have in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the amendment in my name, I have raised the point already and do not propose to elaborate it in any great detail. The Minister's amendment says that the court, in certain circumstances, is to fix a wage referred to as the standard wage and that wage is to be a wage which, in the opinion of the court, should be paid.  &ldquo;Should be paid&rdquo;&mdash;on what basis?  The only basis given is the next sub-section, dealing with the rates prevailing for other workers in the area, so that, if wages are at a low level, that low level is to be taken as the standard by which the standard rate is to be fixed.  That may be a very low level, as we have it at the moment, owing to the increased cost of living and the fact that the power of our money has decreased.  Is that to be stereotyped for all time? How is the wage level to be raised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest other standards in my amendment.  I suggest that certain things should be brought into consideration, amongst these being the matters referred to in the Constitution, the principles of social justice&mdash;a not very well defined matter at the moment, but capable of definition, and certainly capable of such definition as to be applicable to workers of a particular type in a particular area under certain conditions.  I also ask to have considered the matter of purchasing power.  Here I am simply trying to get thought given to the new point of view that one should no longer think of <Col N="1515" /> wages as something which, if they have to be paid to a worker, are something taken from what would otherwise be regarded as the legitimate amount the employing side could claim, which, I think, is an old-time idea and one of which we are getting rid, although not so fast in this country as might be desired.</P>
    <P>Purchasing power may work in two ways.  It may hold up an increase in wages because it might be that a well-informed court, thinking of purchasing power, might say: &ldquo;If we release too much purchasing power in relation to a limited supply of goods, we will cause inflation and the new wage will be lower in buying power than the old.&rdquo; They might also say: &ldquo;The purchasing power we release will call for new goods which can easily be produced in a particular country&rdquo;&mdash;say, for instance, agricultural goods here&mdash;&rdquo; and if we create a demand for them, we are likely to cause the new goods to be produced and cause repercussions of a benevolent type elsewhere.&rdquo;  Therefore, they would say: &ldquo;Although there is a time lag and there may be an upward movement, it will be met when new goods come on the market and these new goods will be easily called into production.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not denying that the thought of purchasing power may, at times, stop a demand for increases in wages, but, in the main, particularly when we think of the way in which wages are spent here, on agricultural goods, on sustenance, on consumer goods of the subsistence type, which can readily be made in this country, I do not think that there will be any great likelihood that this standard will be used to depress wages, but will be used generally to bring about an upward movement, but it will give leave to people to consider the bad effect of increased purchasing power, to consider what are the circumstances in which increased purchasing power would be bad.</P>
    <P>The second matter I want considered is something more than merely the prevailing rate.  The prevailing rate may be very low.  Suppose the Minister thinks of this measure as sliding into conditions in which the rate, on account of the decrease in the buying power of money, is very low indeed. <Col N="1516" /> We more or less stereotype that if we are going to have the term of reference the prevailing level of wages for workers in the area.  You are, so to speak, battening down on that low level.  Why not give some upward tendency?  In this country, which boasts not merely of its Christianity but of its Catholicity, is it too much to ask that we should consider principles of social justice?</P>
    <P>I would not like to be asked to say in relation to any matter what the principles of social justice would demand, and I know that eminent ecclesiastics with whom I have from time to time been in touch say that it is a difficult matter to attempt, but they do not say that it is impossible, and do not say that it is an undesirable standard.  In fact, the whole tendency of the world is to try to get what have been regarded theoretically as these principles of social justice put more effectively into practice.  Why should we not ask that it be done here?  It is not that we tell the court: &ldquo;Find out and determine objectively social justice and the principles of it and their application to certain workers, and rule accordingly&rdquo;, but that is one of the matters to be taken into consideration.  If I were a worker, I think I should welcome this with enthusiasm, because I think workers, and certainly workers who have read pronouncements by ecclesiastical authorities on this matter, must feel that, since history began, they have not been paid in accordance with these principles, and that the principle is very much ahead of practice, but nobody wants at this moment to cause the revolution that would be caused by setting that up as an objective standard.  It is merely asked that that shall be one of the considerations which will operate in the mind of a court deciding on wages.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan is arguing on a basis of theory and I am arguing on the basis of a certain recent experience.  I think there is no point in asking the court to consider in this matter the effect on the community of an increase in purchasing power, resulting from the payment of the standard wage.  The court will have neither the information on which to decide, nor the function of deciding, these matters.  I have said already that I regretted putting in this section, not because I do not think it is going to be useful, but because it has created so much misunderstanding and has caused more trouble than any provision in the Bill.</P>
      <P>What happened during the emergency? That is the important question, because it is on our experience of that period this section is based.  In a small country town the majority of the unskilled general workers were not in any trade union.  The majority of the employers were not in any association. A trade union, having some members in the town, was able to enter into an agreement with the best employers there for a joint application for a standard wage order.  That standard wage order when made could be expressed to apply only to the employees and employers who were associated with the application, and could not be made of general application. We amended the Emergency Powers Order to try to ensure that a rate made in that way for unskilled general workers in a small town could be regarded as applying to all such workers in the town, even though they were not members of the applicant union, or not employed by employers associated with the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we were altogether successful in attempting to amend the Order, because there were obviously drafting difficulties and, if not drafting difficulties, there were practical difficulties on the part of people who wished to operate it in getting applications to the tribunal.  There was <Col N="1518" /> nobody who could be described, no matter how loosely it was interpreted, as representative of workers or employers.  It was found where a standard rate order was made for general workers in a small town that all workers in that town eventually succeeded in getting their rate up to that level.  Some may have got beyond it but, at least, they got that where they were below it.  They were able to point to the Order, and perhaps bring local influence to bear on their employers to get that rate.  Many general workers in small towns, such as those employed in hotel yards and others, were paid wages which were very low, judged by any standard, low even judged by the standard of the minimum agricultural wage.  It was because I saw that good results had come from the making of a non-effective Order in that particular way I tried to continue the practice in this Bill after the Emergency Powers Order had lapsed.  The Order under emergency powers did not bind anyone to pay the wage, but the effect of making it was that wages generally were levelled up to that rate or tended to move towards that rate.  It is hoped that the wage fixed under the section will have the same moral effect. Nobody will commit an offence if he does not pay it.  The fact that the court makes it will, however, mean that few employers in the area will offer to pay less.</P>
    <P>In addition to the possible effect on unorganised workers and unskilled workers in towns of such an order by the court, there is the further advantage that that standard rate fixed by it, although not binding on anyone, will serve as a yardstick by which other rates will be determined, rates for juveniles, rates for women and rates for workers whose employment involves some degree of skill.  Generally it will tend to facilitate the unorganised individual workers in a town by improving their condition.  If it is thought the section will not have that effect I am prepared to take it out.  I think it will.  We found that the Emergency Powers Orders had that effect.  I discussed this with representatives of the unions who had experience of the making of standard rate <Col N="1519" /> orders of that kind and they agreed that it was desirable to try to continue the same process in normal legislation, after the Emergency Powers Orders had lapsed.  That is all we are trying to do.  We are not trying to institute a device by which the purchasing power of the community as a whole could be increased.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that if standard rate Orders made under the emergency powers had not been regarded as suitable by everyone in the locality they would have been ignored.  If the court under this section makes an order, which has no regard to the wages prevailing in the locality, unless the opinion in the locality regards the decision of the court as reasonable it will be ignored.  If it is regarded as reasonable the tendency will be to relate the rates for unskilled workers and other classes to the rates fixed by the court.  I think the general results will be beneficial.  I am certain that otherwise it will be innocuous, because the court will not try to utilise it.  It would be deterred by having such obligations as Deputy McGilligan proposed.</P>

      <P>The Minister's arguments can be summed up in relation to my amendment, asking the effect of the new purchasing power on the community in this way: he has two arguments and one is that the court would not be able to decide that.  His wages tribunals&mdash;and no one can say that they were efficient bodies&mdash;were asked to decide from time to time whether the new wage would have any appreciable effect on the cost of living.  How did they decide that?</P>

      <P>How did they decide any point like that in making a recommendation? The same considerations apply.  I have tried to look at it from a new angle.  An increase in wages, therefore&mdash;as some people would take the jump&mdash;an immediate increase in the cost of living.  It does not necessarily follow at all.  I want to give the countervailing view.  Does the new purchasing power call for other goods; does it increase the general level of living?  The <Col N="1520" /> Minister says that we have no way of deciding that.  If not, it is time that we got it.  There is the Statistical Bureau. The Minister's general argument is that Papal Encyclicals are not practical politics.  That is what it comes to.  As to the principles of social justice that we have put in the Constitution as the standard in connection with private property and its use, the Minister says that wage rates fixed would be un-reasonable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>We had considerable discussions on Section 65, and I have reconsidered the whole section arising out of these discussions. It will be recollected that, first of all, there was the question whether the court might decline to interfere in a labour dispute in certain circumstances, whether it should be obliged to interfere in all circumstances, and whether the person who could motivate the court to intervene in a dispute should or should not be representative of persons concerned in <Col N="1523" /> the dispute, and how far he should be representative.  Considering the whole matter, I came to the conclusion that the wiser way to leave it was merely to provide that, subject to the provisions of this section, where a trade dispute exists, the court may investigate the dispute.  That sidesteps all the difficulties that were raised as to the possibility of persons moving the court to act who were not fully representative, acting contrary to the wishes of the majority of the persons concerned, or other difficulties of that kind.  It will be now a matter for the court to decide whether the persons approaching it are so representative as to justify its intervention, whether its intervention is likely to be beneficial or otherwise, and it will be at liberty to decline, if it thinks it can do no good, or if the people asking it to intervene are not representative, and if the persons mainly concerned do not want the court's intervention.  The court will have discretion to intervene or not as it thinks fit.  I think it is the simplest procedure and avoids the necessity for drafting far more elaborate amendments to meet some of the difficulties that were raised on Committee.</P>

Before that happens, we think the court should be given an opportunity of considering it&rdquo;.  In other words, if there is to be an appeal from the tribunal to this court, it is the tribunal itself would sanction it, and I think that is the wiser procedure, because that court has functioned well and it is largely because there is a feeling that its decisions are fair and that they are final.</P>

      <P>The object of the amendment is to ensure that, when a dispute occurs, the court will set forth the various claims, demands and contentions and will then find the facts concerning them.  I think it is a desirable amendment, as on many occasions it may be useful.  There is one that comes to my mind, although under the framework of the Bill it would not actually apply. In the teachers' strike there were various demands and contentions and considerable confusion concerning the claims.  In a dispute of that kind, if the demands and claims were put down and at the same time the court found the facts concerning them, that would be informative and would enable other parties, if not the parties to the dispute, to consider the merits of the claims.  For that reason, I think it would be an improvement of the section.</P>

It certainly was my purpose, in framing the section, to make it quite clear that in dealing with disputes the court was concerned only <Col N="1529" /> with the practical issues and would endeavour to get a commonsense arrangement.

I think we should not presume to do other than to put on the court these two obligations&mdash;the fairness of its award to the parties and the prospect of its award settling the dispute.

      <P>I move amendment No. 72:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 23, Section 70, to delete lines 22 to 27 and substitute the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b) an employer party to the dispute who, during the said period, employs or offers to employ a worker under conditions less favourable to the worker than those of the award shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £100.</P>
      <P>Section 70 provides that, wherever the court makes an award under Section 69, certain provisions shall have effect. One of them is that:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(b) an employer who, during the said period, employs or agrees <Col N="1531" /> to employ a worker under conditions inconsistent with those of the award shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £500.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My amendment is designed to ensure that an employer party to a dispute, who employs or offers to employ a worker under conditions less favourable than those of the award, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100.  It seems to me that, with the prospect that he is liable to a fine of £500 if he employs a person under conditions which are inconsistent with the award, no employer will take the risk of doing so.  Suppose, for instance, that a dispute has been investigated under Section 69, and that the court awards a wage of £3 10s. 0d. a week to the employees concerned.  If the employer employs a person on terms which are inconsistent with that award&mdash;if he employs a person at £3 8s. 0d. or £3 12s. 0d. which, of course, would also be inconsistent with the award&mdash;then he runs the risk of being fined £500.  Would there be any difficulty in permitting an employer to employ a person on terms not less favourable than the terms of the award?  Suppose an employer cannot get people to work for him at the £3 10s. 0d., which the court has awarded, and that he is prepared to fill vacancies on his staff at a wage of £3 15s. 0d. or £4, why should he be prevented from doing so?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that this section, and this section alone, is designed to give coercive power to the court.  It deals with unorganised strikes, with strikes on the part of employees who are not organised in a trade union or who are acting in defiance of the authority of their union&mdash;in other words, with unofficial strikes.  I considered whether it was desirable to give the court any function at all in relation to these unorganised or unofficial strikes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I decided that, while there might be theoretical grounds for not having the court interfere in such strikes, there <Col N="1532" /> were practical grounds on which it should be able to do something.  What is the problem in relation to these unorganised or unofficial strikes?  It is that nobody can, in fact, enter into negotiations or make agreements which will be binding upon all the people concerned.  If there were such persons it would not be an unorganised strike, and, consequently, there is a necessity for dealing with it in some way.  What we are proposing here is that, if such a strike occurs, the court can make an award which will be binding both ways for a period of six months.  The period is limited, and during that time it may happen that the difficulties will be adjusted, or that the workers will become organised, or that some other arrangement will be made which will bring them under other provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are two alternatives that could be considered to the putting in of the section.  The first is a provision prohibiting an employer paying the workers less; and, secondly, making illegal a strike to enforce more.  To make a strike of this kind illegal would be a difficult matter in so far as action against it could not be taken against a union.  You would have to take action against individuals, bring them to court and charge them with the offence of carrying on an illegal strike.  I was anxious to avoid putting any such provision in the Bill.  I, therefore, decided that we should try to get the same result by making it illegal for the employer to pay more or less, or to observe different conditions for that limited period of six months than those which the court had decided.  The effect, therefore, is that if it is an illegal strike it will be a useless strike, because the employer cannot pay more. The employer cannot be required to pay more than what the court has awarded&mdash;what it regards as a reasonable rate&mdash;or observe conditions different from those which the court regards as reasonable.</P>
    <P>That power to enable the court to make an order which has a binding effect is limited to this section of the Bill, and to the classes of strikes dealt with here&mdash;strikes not promoted by or assisted by a trade union.  It might <Col N="1533" /> happen that workers in a quarry who are unorganised, not members of any union, will go on strike, or it might happen that a group of workers, against the wishes of their union, will go on strike.  The practice of the Department of Industry and Commerce, in the case of unofficial strikes, is not to interfere.  We have always endeavoured to get workers back under the authority of their union before participating in negotiations in the case of these unorganised strikes.  The difficulty always has been to get an agreement arrived at, because one or two of the individuals whom you could bring to a conference will not be able to commit the others.  They may have been elected as their spokesmen, but they really cannot say that what they will agree to will be accepted, nor can they enter into an agreement that will be binding.  It is because of that practical difficulty in dealing with strikes of that type that I decided that if the court was to have any function at all in relation to them it must be this coercive function which will operate for a limited period of six months.  The original proposal was a year, but I decided later to make it six months.  I would have no objection to making the period three months, but there must be some period in order to emphasise that what the court is doing is merely to resolve an immediate difficulty until somebody else can get in and negotiate or arrange for a long term settlement.</P>

He is prepared to take them at £4 or £3 15s. 0d. a week, but he cannot employ them at that wage because the court award is £3 10s. 0d.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Remember what will happen is this: A strike occurs, and a conciliation officer comes in.  That will, obviously, be the first step.  There will be an attempt made to get a settlement by conciliation, and it is only where conciliation has failed that the matter goes to the court.  At that stage, the court knows that, on the basis of trying to get the employer to pay more, there is going to be no action.  The court will consider whether the mere expression of an opinion will result in the strike being settled.  If they come to the conclusion that it will not, they can make a binding award.  The Deputy contemplates circumstances in which an employer, having refused an increase, permitted a strike to take place and, rather than grant the increase, insisted on his refusal during conciliation and told the court he would not pay the increase unless compelled to do so&mdash;the Deputy contemplates such an employer at some subsequent stage desiring to pay more.  That is an unlikely circumstance but, if it arises at all, the amendment of the section I should propose would be that the employer should pay only the rate prescribed by the court during that six months' period unless there was a registered agreement providing for a higher rate, or something of that kind.</P>

      <P>In page 25, Section 75, to insert before sub-section (2) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a strike continues after the court has made an order under sub-section (1) of this section in respect of the strike, and</P>

      <P>then, the payment to those members of strike benefit in accordance with the rules of the trade union shall not be regarded, for the purpose of this section, as assisting in the maintenance of the strike.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 26, Section 76, to delete paragraphs (e) and (f), lines 9 to 17, <Col N="1539" /> and substitute the following paragraphs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(e)  if the court makes such order, it shall specify in the order the trade unions of workers or bodies representative of workers (in this section referred to as interested parties) who shall be entitled to require the revocation of the order or the cancellation of the recording of the wages (standard rate) Order and the bonus Order in accordance with this section;</P>
    <P>(f)  if any interested party, within 16 days after the making of the order, notifies the court either&mdash;</P>

    <P>(ii)  that it requires the order to be revoked and the recording to be cancelled,</P>
    <P>the court shall comply with the requirement.</P>
    <P>This amendment corrects an omission in the original clause, making it clear that the only bodies who have a right to accept or reject an order of the court shall be a body representative of workers.  Bodies representative of employers will not have that right. Originally, if a trade union or body representative of workers rejected a court order varying the rate of wages, the recording was cancelled automatically. This amendment provides that, even if a court order varying the rates is rejected, the recording of the order will not be cancelled unless the union specified in the order asks to have it cancelled.</P>

    <P>(2)  When a wages (standard rate) Order and bonus Order are varied by Order under Section 76 of this Act <Col N="1540" /> the court shall publish in such manner as it thinks fit notice of the variation together with such particulars of the variation as the court considers necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that in the sub-section we define what a trade union is and then you find that there has been an amendment under the 1941 Act.

      <P>I am entirely in favour of continuing the position for the present because obviously there has been no change in conditions which would justify an alteration.  I should say, however, that I am not at all clear as to my legal powers.  I did not fully appreciate that the power under the <Col N="1541" /> Act was limited to the time that the Emergency Powers Act was in existence. As the House knows, we decided to repeal the Emergency Powers Act and substitute the Supplies and Services Act.  That introduces a legal complication. Whether I have power to continue the reduction in deposits is in doubt but I am having the point examined. Personally I would be prepared to introduce legislation to rectify the situation if I have not power, but, again, there is a problem in so far as the Emergency Powers Act will expire in September and the Dáil will not meet until October.  I hope, however, that our legal advisers will be able to get us out of the difficulty.</P>

      <P>I am in favour of continuing reduced rates for the time being but I have in mind the fact we may have, at some stage, to have discussions concerning the whole of that Act and the possibility of altering its provisions in a more general sense than that.  I would have preferred not to have to introduce an amending Bill on a detail of that kind until I had an opportunity of considering a more general measure.  As it is an urgent point, however, I am having it examined.  It is possible that amending legislation will be necessary in which case I intend to prepare it, but that amending legislation will be temporary pending the general re-consideration to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>I think the purpose of the amendment is self-evident on the face of it.  It is to provide that where a deputy may be appointed, he may not be authorised to perform the duties for more than six months even though the special circumstances which justified the appointment of a Deputy originally may continue to exist.  The Minister may, however, make a further Order or Orders which will expire at the end of six months.</P>

      <P>(1)  If the Minister is of opinion that on account of the nature or extent of the duties of an office it is inexpedient that the holder of such office should engage in any other gainful occupation without the permission of the local authority by which appointments to such office are made and the consent of the Minister, the Minister may give a direction to that effect and such direction shall have effect according to the terms thereof.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister may revoke any direction given under sub-section (1) of this section.</P>
      <P>Although the House accepted the section as it originally stood, there was a fear that it might be interpreted in such a way as to interfere with the position of existing office holders and a fear also that it might perhaps be unreasonably interpreted by the Minister.  The House will remember that it gave power to the Minister to make regulations requiring holders to devote the whole of their time to the duties of their offices. This amendment was inserted in the Seanad to meet certain objections which had been raised here, rather tentatively, and there, more strongly, in relation to this matter.  It now provides that&mdash;</P>

      <P>(1)  In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;the principal section&rdquo; means Section 80 of the Act of 1941;</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;the official resi&mdash; dence&rdquo; means, in relation to a member of a local authority, his official residence for the purposes of the principal section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  A local authority to which the principal section applies may by resolution decide that, in lieu of defraying the expenses of locomotion actually incurred by each of their members in travelling to and from the meetings of such local authority, such local authority shall pay to each such member, in respect of every meeting of such local authority which he attends at a place not less than five miles by any route from his official <Col N="1546" /> residence, a fixed sum for every mile between such place and such official residence measured along the route by which such member would normally travel.</P>
    <P>(3)  A resolution passed by a local authority under sub-section (2) of this section may be revoked at any time by another resolution of such local authority.</P>
    <P>(4)  A resolution under sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) of this section shall not take effect until sanctioned by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(5)  The passing by a local authority of a resolution under sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) of this section shall be a reserved function.</P>
    <P>(6)  While a resolution passed by a local authority to which the principal section applies under sub-section (2) of this section is in force such local authority shall not defray under sub-section (3) of the principal section the expenses of locomotion actually incurred by each of their members in travelling to and from meetings of such local authority but, in lieu thereof, shall make payments to members attending such meetings in accordance with the terms of such resolution.</P>
    <P>(7)  Where a member of a local authority attends a meeting of such local authority at a place not less than five miles by any route from his official residence and is obliged by reason of such attendance to remain away from his home for a continuous period of not less than three hours, the local authority shall, in addition to defraying under the principal section the expenses of locomotion incurred by such member in travelling to and from such meeting or making to such member the payment required by a resolution under sub-section (2)  of this section (as the case may be), pay to such member an allowance in respect of such period calculated in accordance with the prescribed rules.</P>
    <P>(8)  The rules made by the Minister for the purposes of sub-section (7) of this section shall make provision for preventing allowances <Col N="1547" /> being paid to a member of more than one local authority, by more than one local authority in respect of the same period.</P>
    <P>This section is intended to amend Section 80 of the Act of 1941 which allows travelling expenses to be paid to county councillors and members of certain other local authorities.  Section 80 of the Principal Act authorises a refund of the expenses of locomotion incurred in travelling to a meeting held at a place not less than five miles from a member's residence.  This new section will allow a fixed mileage allowance to be paid instead of actual expenses and it also provides, as can be seen, for the payment of subsistence allowance for members who have to travel not less than five miles from their homes to their meetings and are away from their homes or place of business for not less than three hours. The first of these provisions is to meet the desire which some county councils have expressed to revert to the former method of contribution to travelling expenses in the form of mileage rates.  Such rates may be more economical in certain circumstances, say, where members, instead of having to arrange each for his own conveyance, may join together in hiring a single conveyance.  I have agreed to make that amendment.  As I have already explained under sub-sections (7) and (8) of the section it will be permissible to pay subsistence allowance in accordance with the rules which the Minister is empowered to make.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's statement, I would like to point out that this system has caused great confusion in the county councils. The previous arrangement was cheaper on the ratepayers.  These members live out in isolated parts of the country; some of them are not near a bus or train and they have to hire a car to come to a meeting.  The old arrangement of 6d. a mile was cheaper on the ratepayers.  I understand that this system will cost nearly £1,000 extra if it is operated.  Very few people have their own cars.  A person who has to travel less than five miles on a bicycle <Col N="1548" /> gets 1½d. a mile.  I do not think any member of the county council is going to lose time cycling less than five miles. Deputy Allen, the chairman of the Wexford County Council, is here now and he knows what the position is on the Wexford County Council.</P>

      <P>On sub-section (7), the amendment is to be welcomed and will be welcomed by many local authorities, but I am a little bit worried about the subsistence allowance where members are out for three hours.  That is desirable in itself, but the Minister must now take his mind off the city and imagine himself in the country with five miles of a country road and a man coming in on a bicycle; that man could do with a cup of tea just as well as the man who travels 20 miles.  If he comes 4¾ miles he will not be allowed anything by way of subsistence.  The Minister must get his mind off the 2d. tram in the city, and the men who can get home to their lunch by means of the 2d. tram.  I would ask the Minister to amend that now if he has power to do so.  I think it would be a pity to spoil a good day's work.</P>

      <P>It is a difficult matter and there is something to be said for the minimum distance which we prescribe; this distance of five miles applies also to the travelling allowance and if I were to decrease the minimum distance in the case of the subsistence allowance I should probably be called upon to decrease also the distance in respect of the travelling allowance.</P>

      <P>I move: That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 66: At the end of the section a new sub-section as follows added:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(8)  If, on an application to the High Court under Section 12 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1871, by a person aggrieved by a surcharge made under the said Section 12 or a charge made under Section 20 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1902, the High Court <Col N="1551" /> confirms the surcharge or charge, such person may apply to the Minister within the prescribed time to remit the surcharge or charge, and if on such application the Minister is of opinion that the circumstances of the case make it fair and equitable that the surcharge or charge should be remitted, he may direct that the same shall be remitted upon payment of the costs incurred by the auditor or other competent authority in resisting such application and otherwise enforcing the surcharge or charge.</P>
    <P>This is a new sub-section inserted to meet a point raised and argued with some force in the Seanad.  As the position stands at present, if a person aggrieved by a surcharge or charge goes to the courts on a question of law, and the legality of the surcharge or charge is confirmed, he cannot subsequently appeal to the Minister to be relieved on the ground that, notwithstanding the surcharge was properly imposed by law, the circumstances would justify relief being given.  In consequence of this, a rather undersirable habit has grown up of coming first to the Minister because he may remit the surcharge without deciding the point of law if he feels that the surrounding circumstances justify it. In a number of cases, I think it would be preferable that the courts should first be approached in order that the law may be definitely settled and for that reason it is proposed in this amendment to allow a person who has gone to the courts on appeal from a surcharge on a point of law to go to the Minister subsequently and ask him to consider whether there are such palliating circumstances as would justify relief being given irrespective of whether the surcharge was lawfully made or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw attention to the fact that it is generally public representatives who are mulcted in these surcharges and, from my experience, I can say that very often it is the action of officials that leads to the surcharge and when the public representatives are surcharged the officials go scot-free.  The Minister should give some consideration to that aspect of the question. Very often at a meeting of a local authority a document is sent round for members to sign and they do so and are mulcted in a surcharge.  The responsible official is not mentioned at all, although the surcharge arises from his action.</P>

      <P>We are concerned as Deputy Walsh said, where it is a member of a local authority.  The sub-section says that the Minister must be satisfied that it is fair and equitable to remit the charge or the surcharge. It seems to me that, if members of a local authority were concerned and were prepared to take the matter to court, not only their own costs in trying to prove their point in a court of law, but the costs incurred by the auditor or others in resisting the application will be very heavy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, I think it can be taken that appeals will be made to the Minister in the first instance and it is only where a question of law of major importance will arise that the case will go to the court.  It is almost inevitable, it may not be invariably the case, that it would be the manager, acting for the local authority, who would be concerned in that matter and the local authority would have to pay the costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this sub-section, even if the Minister wishes to meet the situation so far as costs are concerned, he will not have power to do so.  As I say, it is conceivable that the amount of the surcharge may be far less than the amount of the costs. It may be a point of principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that, where the manager is acting for a county council or an urban council, it is the local authority will pay, but this legislation will be taken as a headline for committees of agriculture and vocational education committees and there should be an amendment on the same lines where individual members will be affected.  I want to point that out.</P>

      <P>The argument is this. The individual members need not necessarily go to the High Court; they can go to the Minister.  It is only where it is in the public interest that a point of law should be decided that they should go to the High Court.  In that event the local authority will bear the costs.</P>

      <P>The Minister should be aware that old corporate towns stand in a different position from county councils.  Old corporate towns make decisions of their own, apart from the manager's authority, and sometimes they are advised and directed by officials, and wrongly so. It is with such cases as those that I am concerned.  This matter is worthy of consideration.  Throw the responsibility on the officials as well as on the public representatives.</P>

    <P>The House is familiar with the provisions relating to the changing of names; they are set out in Sections 74, 75 and 76.  Section 77 is a section on almost identical lines, dealing with what might be described as something which is neither a street, a town nor a townland, but might be described as a locality or a district.  The purpose of the section is to provide a procedure on lines similar to what has been adopted already in relation to streets and towns for the changing of the name of a whole district.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment&mdash;Harvesting of Crops and Prices of Farm Produce.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice on behalf of this Party of our intention to raise on the Adjournment for the Recess two matters: (1) the supreme importance of successfully saving the coming harvest, in respect of which we suggest that the Government should take all possible measures to ensure that sufficient labour will be available to farmers for this purpose, and (2) having regard to the increase in wages of farm workers, the necessity for increasing the prices of all farm products, pending a full and an impartial investigation of costings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the coming harvest, which is in every respect the most important harvest that will be reaped in this country or in the world, it is essential that nothing should happen to impair the efficiency of agriculture during the harvest season.  The Minister is aware that a deputation called to this House last week and brought to the notice of the various Parties and to the Minister the danger of a stoppage of work with regard to agriculture in certain counties.  I do not wish to say very much on this question. We have often in the past had threats of strikes in agriculture from both farm workers and farmers and we have occasionally had strikes of both, but it is to be sincerely hoped that there will be no stoppage of work in agriculture during the coming harvest, and sincerely to be hoped that, whatever questions arise in regard to which there may be a dispute, will be settled by reasonable negotiation, and if it is not possible to settle such outstanding questions, we hope the Minister will take steps to influence all parties concerned to postpone action until the <Col N="1561" /> legislation going through the Oireachtas, setting up a labour court, becomes operative.  This Industrial Relations Bill is one of the most important measures which has passed through this House, and I think it ought to be given a fair trial.  If there is any dispute outstanding in regard to agriculture, or any dispute pending, it ought to be referred to the authorities which will be set up under that Bill, and I therefore think the Minister should exert all his influence to ensure that there will be no stoppage of agricultural work in any county.</P>
    <P>There is also the important matter, to which the Minister should direct his attention, of the stoppage which has taken place as a result of the dockers' strike.  If there is any section of the community suffering more than another by reason of that stoppage, it is the farming community.  They are in a serious predicament in regard to imports of harvest machinery and wearing parts.  This is an important matter, because it affects the saving of the harvest.  There is also the difficulty with regard to the export of cattle.  Our cattle markets are being seriously affected by this stoppage, and the Minister ought to take whatever steps he can to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>In the event of an unfortunate dispute arising in the agricultural industry and of farm workers coming out on strike, I hope the Minister will make provision in time to deal with such a situation and to see that no part of this year's valuable harvest is lost. From whatever source assistance may be available, it should be brought in to help in the saving of the harvest, and all possible precaution should be taken to ensure that the work is carried through successfully.  The year has been rather unsatisfactory from the weather point of view, and it may continue to be unsatisfactory for the harvest, and it is therefore essential that all possible labour and machinery should be available to the farming community to ensure that whatever handicap may arise by reason of weather conditions will be overcome.</P>
    <P>With regard to the desirability, and, in fact, the urgent necessity for an increase <Col N="1562" /> in the prices of essential farm products, the Minister is aware that there has been a very substantial increase all round in wages during the past few months.  Farm workers' wages have been increased by the Agricultural Wages Board by amounts from 4/- per week upwards, and it is essential that these increases in the farmers' costs should be taken into consideration in regard to the prices of the products of the land, and particularly tillage products.</P>
    <P>Prices of barley, wheat and beet were fixed long before increases in wages were put into operation.  These prices were based on a standard of wages which existed six or 12 months ago.  As far as these products are concerned, prices have not been increased over the past two or three years.  Nobody will deny that the cost of production has substantially increased, particularly the cost of labour.  The Minister knows that a considerable number of products have been reduced in price this year compared with last year, notwithstanding the increased cost of production.  The price of potatoes is very substantially lower this year.  There has been a reduction of 3.9 per cent. in the price of potatoes.  Hay and straw have also fallen in price.  All classes of pigs have reduced in price compared with 1945.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Where did the Deputy get that information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Instead of the price of pigs being reduced it should be increased. Bacon pigs are almost entirely the product of tillage farmers.  The price of such pigs should be increased. That is a matter to which the Minister might give attention.  He may also be able to give some information on a matter that I raised recently, and that is the prospect of an increased price for cattle during the coming year.  As negotiations have been going on with the British Government it is possible that the result may now be known to the Minister.  If so, I hope he will be able to make a statement.  During the past few weeks very few cattle were exported to Britain, partly because of prices and partly because of the stoppage in connection with the shipping dispute.  It is desirable that <Col N="1563" /> the export market from this country to Great Britain should be extended. We are, at present, exporting large numbers of cattle to the Continent. That market may be useful now, but it may not be as permanent or as desirable as the British market.  The negotiations with Britain should be brought to a successful conclusion in order to ensure the best possible terms for farmers' live stock.  It is desirable that the Minister should make a statement.</P>
      <P>He is aware that practically every farmers' organisation&mdash;not political organisations&mdash;is agitating on the question.  These are strictly nonpolitical organisations, on the governing bodies of which the Minister's Party are represented.  They have made a strong demand for increased prices, having regard to the increased cost of production.  The Minister is aware that beet growers, led to a great extent by members of his Party, have more or less declared their intention to withhold beet from the factories unless the price is substantially increased.  It is all very well for the Minister to say that he has no control over the price of beet.  As Minister for Agriculture every agricultural product comes under his supervision.  He should see that agriculture gets a fair deal, not only for live stock and live-stock products, but also for tillage products.  I hope the Minister will be able to say something definite in regard to the position of labour for the harvest and as to the intention of the Government to make some definite concession to farmers in view of increased costs of production.  The Minister has given hints to the House that he contemplates setting up some authority to go carefully into agricultural costings. Pending the establishment of such authority, he might take steps now to improve agricultural prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephHallide" hpid="Mr. Halliden Mr. Halliden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support Deputy Cogan's proposal, particularly that portion which stresses the desirability of giving farmers increased prices for their produce.  An agitation has been going on I might say for years, urging that farmers should get economic prices for their produce. Economic prices mean not only the <Col N="1564" /> cost of production, but also a small margin of profit, so that farmers, their sons, daughters, and agricultural workers would get a decent livelihood from their work on the land.  During the war years farmers did grand national work for this country and did not grumble about having to do it. Now that the war has ended, it is only right that they should be given economic prices for farm produce&mdash;for beet, wheat and particularly for milk. Various public bodies, including county committees of agriculture, cooperative dairy societies, and representatives in this House, have urged the Government to realise that dairying, our oldest industry, is fast sinking into a position from which it will be difficult to restore it.  In my opinion the present position of that industry is a very serious one.  The figures supplied by various creamery societies show that there has been a great decline for a number of years, ranging from 15 per cent. in some cases to 45 per cent. in other cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From independent sources costings were supplied to the Department, showing the cost of producing a gallon of milk in different parts of the country, but for some reason the figures have not been accepted by the Department. What has been the result? Herds have in many cases been dispersed and, in other cases, reduced in numbers.  Our people are inclined to fly from the land because they have not the amenities or the privileges that urban populations enjoy.  The worst feature of all is that a great many workers, even farmers' sons and daughters, are not inclined to milk cows.  They regard the hours that have to be given to such work as being too long.  Cows have to be milked every day, on Sundays and on holydays, and these people feel that they are not properly paid for the valuable work they are doing.  It is very unfortunate that the Department and the Government generally have turned a deaf ear to the representations of various public bodies, as well as those from independent sources, pointing out that the price of milk is not attractive enough to keep people on the land, or to get people to milk cows.  It is not attractive enough to get the people to milk <Col N="1565" /> the cows.  Recently I came across a case of a farmer who had 30 cows to be milked and on Sunday evening the men did not turn up to milk them and he and his wife and two children under 12 years of age had to milk the cows. On the following Monday morning the same thing occurred.  That is not by any means an isolated instance.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the Government and the Minister have made up their minds that the price of milk is not to be increased.  I want to tell the Minister that a great many farmers have also made up their minds that henceforward they will keep the minimum number of dairy cows.  In many cases they have at their service very valuable and very willing milkers, that will do the job very well and pay the farmers far better than the present system.  I refer to the calves.  That system is being adopted and I think it would be disastrous for the dairying industry if it should become general. The farmers have no option in the matter.  It is deplorable that, after many years of dairy herd development and intensive propaganda with regard to cow testing and the breeding of the best dairy bulls, in an effort to get the best dairy cows, many of these are finding their way to the butcher or the foreign market.  It is a very serious position if our farmers are obliged to put the young calves under the cows. I believe, and the farmers believe, that that would be an easier way and ultimately a more satisfactory way in view of the attractive price for store cattle and the possibility of that price becoming even more attractive.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity of once again appealing to the Minister and to the Government to meet the farmers' demand with regard to the price of milk. We are told that if the price of milk supplied to creameries is advanced by one penny a gallon and the price of home made butter correspondingly increased, the cost will be £1,000,000. That is a very small sum to maintain the oldest and best industry of any nation.  The money would be well spent.  There is a growing protest and a growing uneasiness amongst our farmers generally in regard to the instability of the dairying industry.  The <Col N="1566" /> Minister, in reply to Deputy O'Donnell a few days ago, said that this is not an appropriate part of the year to appeal for higher prices for farm produce.  I would remind him that the Minister for Agriculture in England has during the past month very substantially increased the price of nearly all farm produce.  Where there is a will there is a way.  I again, in all sincerity, appeal to the Minister to have the question of the price of milk reconsidered, with a view to making it more attractive for the dairy farmers.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this question. The period during which 1/- a gallon is given for milk should be extended to the month of April.  That would encourage farmers to bring in their cattle earlier and would perhaps encourage them to rear calves.  That is a very serious matter.  I appeal to the Government to reconsider the whole position of the dairying industry. In Limerick, in June, we had a very large and representative meeting of dairy farmers from all over Munster at which there was unanimous demand for an increase in the price of milk. That meeting was called by the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society and was representative of every dairying interest in the country.  The representatives at that meeting were hardheaded men who had the interests of the country at heart and they were unanimous in their demand for an increase in the price of milk.  I ask the Minister not to turn down that appeal but to grant it in the interests of the dairying industry, which is the most valuable, the oldest, and the best industry we have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>To-night the House will adjourn for a period of possibly three months.  We will have three months' holiday with full pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan referred to the port workers' strike in Dublin and said the cattle trade and the export trade of farmers may suffer considerably.  It was stated to-day at a public board meeting that cattle were being diverted, that butter was being held up and that generally speaking the export market in which the farmers are interested is being seriously hampered <Col N="1567" /> and will be more so if something is not done by the Government quickly to bring to an end the present unfortunate dispute at the North Wall between the dock workers and the ship-owners. There is goodwill on both sides, the owners of the ships are anxious for an early settlement and so are the workers.  I earnestly hope that, during these three months, the Government will not sleep over these things and allow strikes to spread.  Every effort should be made to end them without invitation from anybody.</P>
    <P>It was stated by one Minister only yesterday to myself that he was prepared, on invitation, to hold a conference at any time with a view to bringing this deadlock to an end.  One party will not seek a conference, as asking for it may be a sign of weakness and the workers will not show any sign of weakness by pressing continuously for conferences.  It is the duty of the Government&mdash;and the elected representatives for the constituency should keep reminding the Government of that duty&mdash;to see that decent wages are paid and good holidays given and that work is resumed.  I will say this, on behalf of all the decent employers in the city: every decent employer in this city who speaks to you privately says that his workers and every worker is entitled to at least two weeks' holiday with pay.  Why it is being held up, I do not know.</P>
    <P>We were hopeful up to yesterday that we would get some encouraging statement from the Minister for Education regarding his proposals to bring to an end the teachers' dispute, before the schools open in September.</P>

      <P>Very well, I will get back to the point raised by Deputy Cogan, who, apparently, is alarmed at the hold up of the farmers' supplies, due to the failure of the full and adequate shipping services, due to the strike at the North Wall.  On farming, I should like to be assured by the Minister that our supplies, the incoming supplies, are adequate and that there will be no such thing as bread queues in our city.  The Minister ought to be able to give us a guarantee that there will be no need for bread rationing, that the incoming supplies, coupled with our own produce, will be available for the people.</P>
      <P>I had intended to touch on a few other matters, such as the possibility of the scarcity of turf.  For some reason the Phoenix Park is not anything like what it was in the storage of turf and I earnestly hope the Minister, who will have some responsibility in connection with the supply of turf, will keep that in mind.  I do express the hope, on behalf of the cattle trade generally and the farmers as a whole, that their export trade will not be injured in any way by the prolongation of the port workers' strike.</P>

      <P>I have always found him a gentleman who was very approachable.  In his reply, the Minister said we had a much higher price for wheat than farmers anywhere else. I was in a confectionery shop to-day and it was good to look at the supply of stuff.  I said: &ldquo;Thank Heaven,&rdquo; but we have not enough, as we are cashing in on the fertility of the soil.  Wheat is an overdraft on the bank of nature and when the bill is presented for payment there are no reserves to meet it. That has been the history of wheat all down the years.  The Minister and I differed and he said wheat has been more or less grown almost all the time. I respectfully differ with him.  I have read a good deal of the history of agriculture and have heard it from two generations at the Tipperary fireside. We are a tillage county outside the Golden Vale and would run Wexford very close for the model county.</P>

You get one in fifty turning out 17.5.  I have a bit and 12, 13 and 14 are usual and 14 to 15 would be the average.  With the carriage off, the farmer gets about three-sixths.  A sixth on&mdash;I would go further and say two sixths&mdash;would be one-third on, making £4 8s.  He would want roughly that.</P>
      <P>Take the case of the ordinary <i>pater familias</i> with a family of our or five, who is earning a fair wage.  He may smoke three or four packets of cigarettes, or the equivalent in tobacco, during the week and drink an odd bottle or pint, perhaps three or four in the week.  Let him deny himself one packet of cigarettes, 8d., and a pint, 10d., that is 1/6, and put two-sixths on the price instead of taking it off and give it to the farmer.  It will bring sugar to 8d. a lb.  He can buy 2½ lb. sugar by smoking a packet less and drinking a pint less.</P>

      <P>In regard to meat, I notice the Argentine have declared off frozen meat going to England.  I am informed that there is a terrible meat scarcity in the United States. This, therefore, is a glorious time for us and we should be given a chance. We should be given something more for the milk we produce.  A cow will only have one calf in the year, but a sow will have a litter of eight or ten bonhams, so that if the farmer has <Col N="1571" /> got out of pigs he can get back into their production in a year or eighteen months.  You cannot increase the cattle population in that way.  It is time that we conserved our herds and not be destroying them.</P>

That can only be done if the cow population is increased.  Milk production is definitely going down.  The position now is that the farmer and members of his family are the real cow milkers.  The road worker, the forestry worker and the mill worker finish on a Saturday at 12 o'clock but the farmer and his family between 12 o'clock on a Saturday and the starting hour on Monday morning do what would be regarded as half a week's work by other classes of workers.

      <P>We have it on the highest authority that man is to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow.  I say, give the farmer a chance.  I am sure Deputies are familiar with the story of &ldquo;Martin Chuzzlewit&rdquo; written by Charles Dickens.  It is the story of the young republican of 21 years of age whose engagement was announced to the planter's daughter on an adjoining estate.  The planter had about 1,000 slaves working for him.  The guests were drinking the usual toasts to &ldquo;liberty, equality and fraternity&rdquo; when word arrived that the slaves had escaped.  The party quickly dispersed in an effort to re-capture the slaves.  The fact is that if it were not for the work done by the farmer and his sons and daughters the people of this country would be starving.  We are willing to work and we are not looking for holidays, but we want to get payment for the wheat, the beet, the milk and everything else that we produce.  I was not sent to this House by the farmers of Tipperary as a beggar or a mendicant, but I am asking that we <Col N="1572" /> should get fair play so that we may keep the nation alive.  We do not want to cash-in on any class.  We are working 66 and 70 hours a week.  During the coming autumn we will be working at the threshings until 10, 11 or 12 o'clock at night.  We are not asking for an eight-hour day.  We have saved the nation, and we are not begging or asking for charity.  All that we want is a price for the stuff that we produce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first matter that was raised&mdash;the supply of labour to farmers&mdash;there is, as I am sure Deputies are aware, a scheme under which labour can be recruited from areas where there is labour to spare&mdash;in the north-west and south-west of Ireland. Under the scheme operated by the Department of Industry and Commerce, the transfer of those labourers is facilitated.  There are various conditions laid down.  A farmer can, by going to the labour exchange, to a tillage inspector, or to the tillage supervisor in his area, or to the Post Office, get all the necessary information.  The Department of Industry and Commerce helps those men by paying their travelling expenses from their own homes to the home of the farmer where they are to take up employment.  The Department also gives them 5/- to spend on the journey, with 4/- a night towards their lodging allowance.  The farmer must pay them 1/2 an hour for a 54-hour week, and 1/6 an hour above that. All that is laid down in the conditions.  The scheme has worked very satisfactorily during the last two years.  The only point is that the farmers have not availed of it as much as was expected at the beginning.  I think that, in the ordinary course of peaceful agriculture, there should be no trouble about getting extra labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point raised by Deputy Cogan was the possibility of a strike. I think that the less said beforehand about strikes the better, because an unguarded word might only cause trouble.  All that I can do is to hope that no strike will take place at this time of the year.  Deputy Cogan was anxious that something should be done under the Bill that left the Dáil this evening.  Even before that Bill comes <Col N="1573" /> into operation, there is negotiating machinery in the Department of Industry and Commerce which will be at the service of anybody who asks for it.  Deputy Byrne raised the question of the dock strike.  I do not think it can be held by anybody that the Department of Industry and Commerce have not done their best to end the dock strike.  I think that they have intervened at least two or three times to try to effect a settlement.  The same machinery is there for any other strike that may take place.</P>
    <P>The next point that was raised was with regard to prices.  Deputy Cogan mentioned the question of the rise in agricultural wages.  There are two points that I would like to refer to on that.  In the first place, relief was given to landholders in their rates under the Budget.  As a matter of fact, although that relief in rates operates from the 1st April the increase in wages did not take place until nearly the end of June.  In view of that, I think it will be admitted that the relief given in rates in that way will meet to a very substantial extent the increase in wages.  Apart from that, we must, I think, come to the conclusion that the Agricultural Wages Board, when they are fixing a minimum wage, take existing circumstances into account: what the farmer is actually getting for his stuff, and what farm prices are.  As far as I know, they have never fixed a minimum wage in the hope that farmers will, as against that, get an increase in prices. I think that is the only way in which the Agricultural Wages Board could act: that is, to take the circumstances as they are and try to fix what would be a just wage in existing circumstances. I want to repeat that I do not think it is possible at this stage to review any prices already fixed.  I said here a few nights ago that, when farmers sign a certain contract for beet, the contract must stand. Farmers sowed wheat knowing what the price was before they did so.  The same applies to many other farm prices.  I think it may be possible, as Deputy Cogan mentioned, to find some more satisfactory machinery for fixing farm prices in future, but that will <Col N="1574" /> take some little time.  The Dáil will, I hope, have an opportunity of discussing that matter more in detail when we meet next session.</P>
    <P>Deputy Halliden is right in saying that a penny per gallon increase in the price of milk all over would amount to £1,000,000. Producers would get £1,000,000 more and the taxpayer or consumer would have to find the money.  Whether it would cost £1,000,000 or £2,000,000, if it is necessary to do it and if it could be justly done, the matter should be considered. I do not think that Deputy O'Donnell is right in saying that the average sugar-content of beet is 14 per cent. or 15 per cent.  The average sugar content paid for by the Sugar Company&mdash;and they do not pay unless the sugar is there&mdash;was 16.6 per cent. for last year.  We must accept that as a fair figure.  I do not think that it is right for Deputy O'Donnell to say that any Party in this House wants to keep the farmer in the mud.  Accusations against every other Party in the House seem to be the stock-in-trade of Deputy O'Donnell and some members of his Party.  I do not know with what object these accusations are made. Perhaps it is to give the impression that they are the only Party who want to keep the farmer out of the mud.  I do not see that these accusations do good to anybody.  I know many Tipperary farmers and I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that they did not send him here as a mendicant or a beggar.  They are the most independent men I know in this country or any other country and I do not think that they would stand for such statements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan referred to the recent negotiations with Great Britain.  I should like to take the opportunity to say something about those negotiations. Many items were mentioned in the course of those negotiations but the two items of importance discussed were cattle and eggs.  In the case of eggs, we have not got down to finality yet, though I have some hope that we may be able to offer better prices next year.  When we may commence, has yet to be decided.  I hope that we shall be able to offer a better average <Col N="1575" /> price to producers in the coming year, but I cannot give any details at the moment because the details are not yet fixed.</P>
    <P>In the case of cattle, we are up against a much more difficult situation. Although I am sure Deputies know as much about the cattle trade as I do, I should like them to have the patience to allow me to refresh, as it were, their memories on some items in connection with that trade before I come to the final point regarding these negotiations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the seven-year period before a certain law was passed in England&mdash;1925-31&mdash;there was an average export of cattle from this country of 730,000.  It is interesting to analyse the composition of that export of 730,000 and compare it with the position at the present time.  At that time, we were exporting on the average 290,000 fat cattle, 390,000 store cattle and 55,000 dairy cattle.  In the next seven years&mdash;I hope to point out later the significance of these three seven-year periods&mdash;1932-38, the average export went down to 650,000, composed of 170,000 fats, 430,000 stores and 52,000 dairy cattle.  The stores and dairy cattle maintained the same level as before.  The next period of seven years&mdash;1939-45&mdash;gave an average export of 535,000.  Again, there was about the same number of dairy cattle, 55,000; practically the same number of stores, 400,000, but fats were down to 80,000. In respect of the last seven years, I want to add a certain figure.  Up to the last seven years, our export of dressed beef or canned beef was insignificant but, during the last seven years, it became a very big item.  It is estimated&mdash;I think fairly accurately &mdash;that the average number of cattle going into cans and dressed meat for export was 97,000 per year.  For those seven years, that would bring the average total up to 632,000.  If we take <Col N="1576" /> the more recent three years, 1943-45, included in the last seven-year period, we have an average as low as 466,000. Again, the stores remained at 407,000, dairy cattle 43,500 and fats 15,000. We have the history there of gradual and continuous decline in the export of fat cattle.  That is the whole story of the export of cattle from this country for the past 21 years.</P>
      <P>During 20 years, the number of cows here remained the same&mdash;1,200,000.  It has varied very little up or down during that period.  We may, therefore, conclude that we had the same number of calves born in the country and we must further conclude that the big decrease in the exports was due, to a great extent, to the fact that we did not rear the calves in these recent five or six years because young stores were a poor price.  That discouraged farmers from rearing calves.  Stores were a poor price because farmers were over-stocked with older cattle they could not dispose of in a remunerative way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must, of course, take some account of the increase in the consumption of beef at home because there had been some increase during all that time.  As I have said, the big and most significant fact in the whole picture is the decline in the export of fat cattle.  Undoubtedly, that had its origin in the provisions of the Cattle Industry Act, passed by the British Parliament in 1934, under which payment of subsidy was made in respect of home-bred beef in Great Britain and in respect of animals which were imported for further feeding in Great Britain.  The British farmer got a good subsidy on cattle reared in Great Britain and a fairly good subsidy on cattle brought in for further feeding but there was no subsidy in respect of the cattle which went over for slaughter from this side.  Up to 1939&mdash; to the end of the second period I mentioned&mdash;the subsidy was 5/- per live cwt. on cattle brought in for further feeding, equal to 9/4 dead weight. From that period, there was a distinct reduction in the number of fat cattle going in and there was a distinct inducement to exporters here to send out good store cattle for further feeding. By 1939, the number of fat cattle <Col N="1577" /> exported had declined by 100,000 per annum as from 1931.  There was some improvement in the year 1941, but that was due entirely to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease when we were sending nothing but fat cattle for immediate slaughter to Great Britain. We ought to ignore that year in a way in making comparisons of the number of fat cattle exported.</P>
    <P>Again, when the Minister for Food assumed control in Great Britain in 1940, the production of cattle in Britain was further encouraged.  The Minister for Food gave those who reared cattle in Britain and those who brought in cattle for further feeding in Great Britain a higher subsidy than they had been getting in 1939.  The differential of 5s. per live cwt. to which I have already referred, had increased by 1941 to 12s. 6d. per cwt. and now, after some recent increases on the other side, the differential is 15s.  If we take the average beast of 10 cwt., or, in fact, a smaller animal than the average beast, because a 10 cwt. animal is a small beast, by an easy calculation any Deputy will see that the bullock that is exported is worth £7 10s. 0d. more after two months in Great Britain and the bullock that is reared in Britain is worth £10 more than the animal imported for immediate slaughter.  That is to say that the export of fat cattle from this country was very much discouraged.</P>
    <P>I have stated here that in some ways we can produce things cheaper here than in Great Britain, but in the case of cattle there is very little difference in the cost of production because when you take everything into account&mdash;rents, rates and the items that count most in the rearing of cattle &mdash;there is not very much difference between the cost of rearing cattle in Britain and here.  If it is necessary to give the prices that have been given to the British farmer to get him to rear cattle, then it must be obvious that the price that we are receiving for our cattle when exported fat are not remunerative and therefore they are not going.  I have mentioned the fact that the average number of fat cattle exported in the last three years <Col N="1578" /> from this country to Britain averaged 15,000 per annum&mdash;a very big reduction from the 300,000 per annum that used to go in the '20's.  I might mention further that that 15,000 is confined almost entirely to a type of beast that would not be regarded as the ideal animal for export.  They are mostly small cattle of the Kerry breed or of the Galloway type.  They are slow-maturing cattle which would not be suitable for the very high-class store cattle trade which we have built up in Britain in recent years.</P>
    <P>This store trade is of a very selective nature and the number that can be taken by the British farmer is limited, because the British farmer, through force of circumstances, has had to put a great deal of his land under tillage and, as well, the British farmer, like our own farmers, is greatly in need of feeding stuffs.  Therefore, he selects the best possible type of stores that will give him a quick return and that can be sent for slaughter at the end of the two months' period for which he must wait to get his subsidy.</P>
    <P>There is no longer, therefore, a market for what might be regarded in this country as slow-maturing cattle. We have quite a number of that type. They have become very plentiful.  It is hard to get rid of them in this country and they remain on the farmers' hands.  They would be regarded as the rougher type of cattle. There are also the non-beef breeds, like the Kerry cattle or the Galloways.  The Galloway might be regarded as a semibeef breed, but they are not cattle which are regarded as a quick-maturing type.  These are the types which are being left on the farmers' hands.  They are not wanted for the high-class store trade in Great Britain.  What is becoming of these cattle?  They remain here until they are absorbed by the home victualling trade.  Some go for canning and a small portion eventually go, after a long period of feeding, as stores to Britain.  While they are there, they have the effect of making it very difficult for the farmer to get rid of his yearlings and the price given for yearlings to the farmer is not inducing him to rear his calves.  Hence you have the <Col N="1579" /> tendency to slaughter more calves than had been slaughtered heretofore.</P>
    <P>I should like to say, of course, that the type of cattle to which I have already referred, the Kerry type and the bigger and grosser types, make first-class beef when they eventually mature and are fit for the butcher.  If there was a more attractive outlet for fat cattle for slaughter on the other side, I believe the feeders here would get rid of these smaller and slower-maturing cattle, more rapidly.</P>
    <P>In fact, feeders would be tempted to breed more of them if they could be got rid of rapidly for immediate slaughter on landing on the other side. In that way, we would be sending out a bigger proportion of that type and our general export figures would increase. It would not interfere in any way with the export of the high-class stores that are going out now because there will always be a demand for such high-class stores by feeders on the other side and they will be prepared to pay a price for these stores.  If these slow-maturing cattle, non-beef varieties, were got rid of more rapidly, it would create a movement upwards for younger stores.  They would realise in turn a better price and the farmer would be induced to rear his calves.</P>
    <P>There have been, as Deputies are aware, various estimates given of the number of calves slaughtered in this country in recent years.  It is not an alarming number but it is a great pity that such slaughter should take place at a time like the present when meat is so badly needed.  There was always, even at the best of times, a slaughter of about 10,000 calves, calves that were hardly worth rearing.  There was a small trade in them as veal and we may regard that number as the normal number which would be slaughtered no matter how good the cattle trade might be.  Owing to the low prices recently obtaining, as I said already, for yearling cattle, calves were killed up to the number of 100,000 per annum.  That is a very big increase.  What became of them?  About 30,000 in recent years were exported as veal to Britain and about 70,000 were used at home.  We are not veal eaters, so it may be <Col N="1580" /> assumed that a good lot of that veal was used wastefully&mdash;not always for human consumption, so that to a great extent these calves were waste as human food.  In any case, if all these calves were consumed by human beings as veal, the sum total of meat would be small compared with what we could get from them as matured cattle if they were all reared.</P>
    <P>It is evident, therefore, that until there is some more movement at the top for the slow maturing cattle there will be no prospect of stopping this present movement in the slaughter of calves.  In fact, I think there is a certain danger that it will increase until we reach a kind of numerical equilibrium&mdash;that is to say, until yearlings begin to get a bit scarce and dear.  Then, of course, through the very scarcity of yearlings there will be an inducement to the farmers to stop this movement towards killing more calves. It is rather significant that the British policy in regard to prices has resulted not only in a serious decline in fat cattle going in but has created a situation which may very well lead to a general decline in the number of fat cattle going across.  Taking the total number of all classes, as I have said already, exported as tinned beef, or dressed beef, in more recent times, as well as the cattle going across, into account the sum total of the decline in exports has been from 730,000 to 536,000.  That is a very substantial decline in exports.</P>
    <P>I thought it well to refresh the minds of Deputies here in this House with these figures in order to show to them the difficulty we have on our side and the difficulty that the British appear to have on their side in working their subsidy system and encouraging their own farmers.  The British Government have stated that they are desirous of getting more meat from this country, but I am afraid that in actual practice their present policy has the effect of ensuring that less meat will go.  I might say to the Deputies now that these were the facts that the recent delegation from this side tried to make as clear as they possibly could to the British Government during the course of these negotiations.  The whole position has been put to the British <Col N="1581" /> Government and fully explained and the British Government are now examining, from their point of view, what they are prepared to do.  They have not, however, given us any indication as to what their decision may be. As far as cattle go, therefore, I am even less in a position to give the Dáil any indication as to what the result of the negotiations may be than I was in the case of eggs.  In the case of eggs I was at least able to say that there will probably be an increase in the price to the producer for the coming year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan mentioned one other point as regards the export of cattle to the Continent.  There are, of course, cattle going to the Continent under two headings.  Firstly, there are cattle going out as a gift to those countries that suffered through the ravages of war.  The number under that heading amounts to something in the region of 12,000 to 14,000 head.  Apart from that some Continental countries are buying cattle here in the ordinary commercial way and we have made various treaties with them from time to time&mdash;I should, perhaps, hardly dignify the negotiations with the title of treaties, but we have made agreements with them any way&mdash;to give them a certain number.  I do not know what that number may be for the rest of the year, but there is one thing to be said about it&mdash;that is, that the trade to the Continent means that they are taking off our hands those cattle which are slow to mature, the non-beef beast, the Kerry breed and so on; they are first class beef and, therefore, they are taking beef off our hands and in that way they have relieved the position here to a considerable extent.  We would, however, want further relief before we could feel as happy as we would like to feel about the whole cattle trade.  I do not think that I have anything further to add unless any Deputy would like to ask for more definite information.</P>

      <P>Before adjourning, I wish to acquaint the House that I have made inquiries into an incident which took place within the precincts of Leinster House last evening, concerning which Deputy Flanagan made complaint against Deputy Killilea at the commencement of business today.  That complaint was that Deputy Flanagan had been molested by Deputy Killilea because of a remark made by the former in the course of his speech in the Dáil yesterday.</P>
      <P>I felt bound to take very serious note of the complaint because, if substantiated, it would constitute a grave breach of the privileges of this House and of its members.

      <P>Having interviewed the two Deputies and witnesses of the incident, I have come to the conclusion that the matter does not require further investigation and that the House need not take any action.  Deputy Killilea has assured me that he did not intend at any stage to use violence and I accept that assurance.  Nevertheless the House must deprecate such unseemly incidents.</P>
