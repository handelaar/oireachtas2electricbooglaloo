      <P>Speaking last night, before the Adjournment, I referred to the fact that whereas the Minister did not indicate in this Bill, by way of figures or otherwise, the amount of reafforestation that he intends should take place in a particular year or during a number of years, at the same time, he placed no limit, so far as this Bill is concerned, to the amount of such work that he intends to carry out or that may be carried out.  All Deputies are aware of the adverse conditions under which the Forestry Department have been working for the past five or six years of the emergency. If we take into consideration the measures indicated by the Minister in this Bill, we must assume that his intentions so far as the progress of reafforestation is concerned are of the highest order.  In this Bill he is taking the necessary provisions to eradicate any difficulties that have obtained under Forestry Acts heretofore initiated, by simplifying the law in relation to the acquisition of land, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my short time in this House I have heard statements made by Deputies of all Opposition Parties and for a number of years I have been reading Press reports of such statements in which it seemed to be a common practice <Col N="2228" /> to tax the Government with bureaucracy or dictatorship in all matters pertaining to the welfare of the community that it is within the province of the Government to deal with in this House.  It is maintained that everything is being centralised.  On this question of reafforestation, the general community have an opportunity of doing for themselves something that would tend, if you like, towards decentralisation. The Forestry Department has been to a certain extent, up to the present, responsible for reafforestation but so far&mdash;at least as stated by Deputy Cogan&mdash;the farmers&mdash;and those are the people to whom I principally refer&mdash;have not taken advantage of the incentive offered to them by the Government to plant small belts of timber on their lands.  Deputy Cogan said that in his opinion the farmer was not inclined to carry out all the essential work for that purpose.  That work would be beneficial to every farmer in this country.  It may not produce immediate results, it may not be a cash crop, but, nevertheless, by taking advantage of the incentive offered by the Government he would be doing a good day's work, not alone for the country, but for himself and his descendants. Deputy Cogan maintained that the farmers were not inclined to carry out their share, let it be ever so small, of the reafforestation of the country.  I do not believe that every farmer has that outlook, even in County Wicklow which Deputy Cogan represents in this House, just as I do.</P>
    <P>I know numbers of farmers who are supporters of Deputy Cogan who take every opportunity to plant trees on their holdings.  I am sure that, spread over the other counties, there are numbers of farmers who look at the matter, not from the point of view of the immediate material gain but from the national point of view that reafforestation is good from the climatic point of view, the scenic point of view and other points of view, but, particularly, from the financial point of view when the time arrives that the timber can be disposed of.</P>
    <P>Statements were made here that owners of timber, particularly owners of small lots of timber, have not realised the full value of the timber <Col N="2229" /> which they sold during the emergency. I question that.  I think that any person who had the necessary licence to dispose of timber, even though he had to dispose of it at the fixed price&mdash;except, of course, he wanted to use the black market and take advantage of the emergency and the fact that we could not import timber in order to grow rich quickly&mdash;was able to dispose of it at a remunerative price to himself. Reference was made to a certain section of this Bill dealing with the right-of-way.  I think every Deputy will admit that the powers asked for by the Minister under that section are very fair.  The Minister and his Department are responsible for the expenditure of a large amount of money on afforestation.  Every Deputy knows that for the first two or three years it is absolutely essential that the life of the young plants should be protected. Surely no Deputy can argue that, if the State goes to the expense which this Department has to go to, the Minister should not have the right to dispose of that timber when it matures and that any individual farmer or landowner should be in a position to prevent, not alone the disposal of the timber but the use of a right-of-way to the plantation in order to look after the welfare of the young plants.  I might couple with that the question of vermin, because I think the same principles are involved.  I do not see that there can be any objection to the Minister having the necessary powers to ensure that the State, having gone to enormous expenditure, should be able to see to it that that expenditure is not wasted and that no individual or set of individuals should be allowed to stand in the way to prevent the plantation from maturing.</P>
    <P>While paying tribute to the Minister, I have one fault to find with this Bill. County Wicklow is a very favoured county from the point of view of afforestation work.  At the college at Avondale technicians are being trained. If we are to judge by the operations carried out in the County Wicklow over a number of years, it is fair to assume that County Wicklow is visualised by the Minister as being the headquarters of a great timber industry at some future date.  While I say that, I also <Col N="2230" /> wish to draw the Minister's attention to the conditions of the workers and technicians engaged in that work in County Wicklow.  Whilst I do not wish to make a point of it or to draw a parallel as between agricultural labourers, forestry workers or road workers, and whilst I understand that the wages of the forestry workers are based on those of farm workers, nevertheless I think that the work in which they are engaged is certainly of a semi-skilled nature; not alone that, it is a type of work that calls for extra expense on the part of workers engaged in forestry, that expense mainly being incurred through footwear and clothing. I would ask the Minister to take that into consideration and make some allowance by way of rubber boots and some type of clothing for the men engaged in that work.</P>
    <P>I say that on behalf of the ordinary or semi-skilled worker, but I would also like to draw the Minister's attention to the inadequate wage, in my opinion, that is being paid to forest overseers and technicians who have been trained in forestry work in the forestry college at Avondale.  I am sure that all of these men had to have a certain standard of education before they passed into the college.  Having spent a certain amount of time in the college, they are allocated to certain areas, and not alone are they responsible for the practical work of planting, but they are also responsible for the administrative work in their respective spheres of forestry activities in their own particular county.</P>
    <P>Those men are responsible for keeping time sheets; they are responsible for paying wages, keeping the accounts, etc., and I think that if the Minister got down to it and investigated the conditions under which those men are working: taking into consideration the fact that they are an educated body of men, in the first instance, that they have been trained as technical experts in forestry, in the second instance, he would see the force and reasoning of my argument and, perhaps, he would in his own good time see that those individuals receive a proper wage, commensurate with the work that they give to the State, thereby ensuring that in <Col N="2231" /> that county, at any rate, which is the home of forestry at the moment so far as this country is concerned, the forestry worker, let him be an ordinary semi-skilled worker or a technical expert, will receive a wage that will make him happy and contented.  In that way we would ensure that at some future date, we would arrive at that happy position where reafforestation will have reached a point where it will be, not alone a benefit from the climatic point of view, but also where it will be of material benefit to the country from both the commercial and industrial point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that of all the schemes in this country for which it was most essential to have post-war planning, it is forestry.  As long as I am alive I have always heard that forestry could give a vast amount of employment, that it could absorb thousands of men who are idle in this country.  I do not believe that the Minister himself is quite satisfied with this, and, as far as I can see, it is Finance that is at fault and that prevents us from having an intensive forestry scheme, now that the war is over.  Such a scheme could have absorbed 10,000 or 20,000 men on a permanent basis.  I know that if Deputy Dowdall, God rest his soul, were alive to-day and were here in this House, there would be skin and hair flying here, because he was intensely interested in this matter of forestry.  He seemed to be a great expert on forestry; he had studied the matter a great deal, and I believe that he was quite right in his views.  I did think, however, that by now some of his efforts would have taken effect and that some Minister would have taken in hands the putting of forestry on a proper national basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present moment, the county from which I come is stripped bare.  It was one of the most beautiful landscape counties in this country but now it is an absolute wilderness.  I come from a county where Cromwell, centuries ago, did his best to clear the people off the land, and nobody was allowed back in after years except to plant trees for the gentry who had taken their lands <Col N="2232" /> from them.  As I have said, it is a county where landscape was on a scale of grandeur, particularly on some of the big estates.  Now that these estates are being divided into small holdings, and what with the war and all the rest of it, that county is stripped bare and it is one of the most desolate places you ever saw.  You have the Land Commission taking over the vast estates, selling the timber and leaving the stumps there, and tearing down old, picturesque castles.  It is a county in which a vast amount of improvement could be made by afforestation.  I do not believe that the Land Commission is playing the game so far as forestry in my county is concerned.  In Wicklow and other counties, they may be active but, in my county, they have taken up large quantities of woodland and sold the timber.  They say that they plant three or four trees for every tree taken up but that has not been done in my county.  Even from a scenic point of view, they should give us some forestry belts.  But they take away the timber and give the old timberland to a small farmer who gets a bit of land from them.  That is unfair because that man is unable to clear away the old brushwood and scrub and the land is left as a run for hares, foxes and rabbits.  The Forestry Department should clean up such land and replant it.</P>
    <P>In my own neighbourhood there are two large estates, the Langford estate and the Winter estate.  Between those two estates, there are 300 acres of good woodland which should be taken over for reafforestation.  Beside one of those estates there is one of the finest little nurseries in Ireland.  It is not a growth of yesterday.  It has been carried on for hundreds of years and carried on on very progressive lines.  It had, and has, an export market.  Small people there with an acre of a garden can make up to £700 or £800 a year. Men who grow onions can take £200 or £300 out of a little patch.  These men ought to be encouraged and their industry fostered.  There could be a good forestry and nursery business in that area.  I do not speak in this way because the place is near me but because I think this is a thing which should be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2233" /> One of the speakers has dealt with the question of compulsion.  In the forestry business, I believe you require plenty of compulsion.  Some of those big estates to which I have referred are in the hands of absentee landowners. In the big wind of 1903, trees were blown down and they have been left to rot, as well as other trees which have since fallen.  Nobody is allowed to take a sprig off them.  They would be locked up if they entered the lands for that purpose.  The Forestry Department should enter upon those lands.  That would involve compulsion but it would be just.  Why should old royal oaks be allowed, when they fall, to rot instead of turning them to some useful or commercial purpose?  There is opportunity for the Minister to act there.  These absentee landlords get their wealth in a handy way but they should not be allowed to permit the wealth of the nation to rot and decay. They are making not the slightest effort to obtain a return for the nation from their forestry land.  It is time that the Minister stepped in and prevented this vast woodland from going to decay.  Nearly all those old forestry belts in my county have been there for hundreds of years.  The timber is dying away and rotting and nothing is being done about it.  I thought that we would be able to get some cheap timber for the poor during the emergency but we had to pay through the nose for the bits of scrub which we got. I think that the people would be justified in marching into these estates and showing those people that it is not just to treat their timber in this way while some of our people are famished.  Compulsion in that direction would be good for the country. I do not believe in too much compulsion for people on small holdings but, when I see these big gentry living in luxury and realise how they acquired their estates and how they worked them and the regard they had for the poor who lived on the sloblands, I think it is only fair to say those things.  The Forestry Department should inspect the woodlands of those absentees, set about cleaning them up and putting down young trees and, in that way, give work to people whose ancestors were fired out of those lands <Col N="2234" /> hundreds of years ago.  I understand that, at the headquarters of our Forestry Department, things are not well.  Somebody told me that they were holding up work.  Somebody told me that a Scotsman there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall turn from it. I think that the Minister himself is not happy.  I know that he is, and always was, a man of great drive.  I am sure that he would like to see money spent on forestry.  But this Bill is merely a sort of camouflage.  What is wanted is a really big scheme in which there would be co-ordination between the Board of Works, the Land Commission and the Minister for Agriculture. Forestry will never be successful until you drain the sloblands and cut-away bogs.  The Minister for Agriculture should work hand in hand with the Minister for Lands, and there should be co-operation in a big scheme. All over the Midlands there is cut-away bogland which is no use for timber or grazing, but which would be ideal for timber of different types.  Those lands should not be left idle.  Hundreds of acres from the town of Kilcock and the Hill of Down into Mullingar are lying idle.  There is a sort of wilderness there at present, where there could be thousands of acres of fine forestry belts.  The land of which I am talking is giving no return to anybody.  It may feed a few old goats and cows, but I am sure they never give milk.  You may see the gentry going out for snipe-shooting on it at certain periods, but there is no return to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that, in connection with forestry, there is too much concentration upon Wicklow and a few other counties at the expense of the counties of the Midlands.  Forestry should be scattered throughout the country.  If we had sufficient forestry, I believe that the climatic conditions would <Col N="2235" /> change appreciably.  There is an almost continuous rainfall in some areas and in others there is very little rainfall. These matters should be studied with a view to ascertaining how forestry belts affect weather conditions.  I think that they have a very great effect upon them.  I suppose the excuse for not having proper forestry development is that we have not the cash.  Freedom should have brought a better outlook to our people.  We see the drift from the land and across to Britain.  I do not see why those people should not be absorbed in a national scheme of forestry.</P>
    <P>It would be one of the greatest assets we could have.  Money should not be an obstacle.  We were able to find millions of money during the emergency. Why not get the £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 we need now to clear away the sloblands and get afforestation under way? The land is idle, and it could be used to provide work for our people.  There is no reason why we should not do that. If we cannot do it under present conditions, then we shall have to get control of our own credit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be a national drive by the Minister, the clergy and local people to get our farmers, small and big, to plant shelter belts.  Most of the farms which have been divided in the past 25 years are very bleak.  A few little quicks have been planted to provide a fence, but there are no shelter belts on those holdings.  The man concerned will tell you that his holding of land is small enough without putting timber on it, but I think that a small holding of 20 or 30 acres should have half an acre of a shelter belt.  It may be as useful to the farmer to shelter his cattle as a stable.  The biggest snag, of course, is that the farmer does not like to lose the half-acre of land.  It is also a costly business to plant and protect the shelter belt.  If you do not properly protect it, all the hares for miles around will come and clip the bark off every tree in it.  I put down some young trees, and, if I had not been a fairly handy man with the gun, I would <Col N="2236" /> not have one of them left on account of the hares.  The goats of neighbours also find the young trees a very savoury dish, with the result that, unless you properly fence the belt, there will be no trees left.  Your last state will then be worse than your first.  You will have to cut them again or else they will die.</P>
      <P>I think that the farm improvements scheme could be extended to include these shelter belts.  It would be work which would give a good return, and the farmers, I imagine, would take it up fairly keenly.  At present the farmer is given very little incentive to engage in work of this kind, and very few farmers will venture on it because it is costly work, and the farmer, as I said, is in danger of losing that acre of land if it is not properly fenced in.  I suggest that the Department of Agriculture should assist farmers in establishing these shelter belts by offering to provide the wire and stakes for fencing if the farmer undertakes the planting.  Planting of that kind would beautify the whole country, and it would also have the result of improving the condition of our cattle generally, because under present conditions cattle are starved during the winter.  They have scarcely regained their condition after the summer, when the winter months come on again.  If proper shelter belts were provided, they would be a great asset in assisting farmers to keep their cattle in good condition.  I should like the Minister to take up this question with the Minister for Agriculture, and ascertain if the farm improvements scheme could be extended to facilitate planting even on a small scale by private individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the present Bill is a bad one, I do not believe that it is the Minister's fault.  I think that Finance must be to blame, because I know the Minister is a man of &ldquo;drive&rdquo; and that nothing will hold him back if he can get a thing done.  I know myself he is not a man who likes to see our people emigrating to get a living which should be provided for them at home.  I would ask the Minister, therefore, to persevere in his efforts with the Minister for Finance so as to shake him up, because the Minister for Finance will always keep the strings of the purse tightly <Col N="2237" /> pulled.  If, however, he is shaken up by the Minister for Lands so that money can be provided for this purpose, I think we can go a long way towards solving the unemployment problem in this country.  I therefore ask the Minister to apply as much pressure as he can to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister would be only too happy to go a long way towards meeting the wishes of Deputies in regard to the reafforestation of the country, but the fact is that if we undertake a big forestry scheme, a scheme commensurate with the needs of the country at the moment, it will involve the taxpayers of the country generally in a huge liability, possibly to the extent of some millions of money.  I would suggest that, prior to undertaking a general scheme of that sort, we should have a survey of the country, county by county.  In practically all counties a certain amount of forestry work has been carried on, in conjunction with the horticultural section, by people who are interested in the shelter belts scheme.  If such a survey were undertaken, county by county, we would be able to arrive at an estimate of the country's needs.  Having got that, the Minister could submit to the Government and the House an estimate of what this gigantic scheme is going to cost the country.  First and foremost, I think we must face the fact that the public generally have lost all respect for Government property.  For some years past&mdash;I am sure the Minister could give the details over a long period&mdash;we find that a lot of destruction has been done to State forests throughout the country.  I should like the Minister to give even a rough estimate of the damage to forests, Government property, during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also suggest to the Minister that more encouragement should be given to county committees of agriculture to assist forestry schemes.  I heard Deputy Giles refer to the farm improvements scheme, but I do not know if every county committee of agriculture operates the shelter belts scheme.  If they do, I would suggest to the Minister that the grants be increased, <Col N="2238" /> at least doubled, in order to encourage more planting by private individuals.  Certainly, shelter belt schemes would tend to beautify the country to a great extent.  On many small holdings in mountain areas, where it was thought timber could not be brought to maturity, it is a great consolation to see that the occupiers, some to a smaller extent, some to a greater extent, have planted shelter belts.  Growing timber on small holdings such as these has much the same effect as furniture in a house.  It beautifies the surroundings.  Every step which the Minister or his Department takes to encourage private enterprise in the planting of timber and the provision of shelter belts will be a step in the right direction.  You may have a certain number of people who have on their farms ten or 12 acres of land that is fit only for rough grazing, and if substantial grants were provided they might be induced to plant such land to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>If schemes of that kind were adopted on a larger scale, the possibility is that people generally would have more respect for private property and in the long run more respect for public property or State property.  If the Government could be persuaded to undertake a big scheme of that kind they would be doing a good day's work and in 40 or 50 years to come the trees which are now planted would form a very valuable national asset.</P>
    <P>Again, in the post-war period there may be a good deal of unemployment in certain areas.  Owing to the demobilisation of the armies in England and at home many men will be returning to their native places and if a forestry scheme were prepared on the lines I have suggested it would go a long way towards alleviating unemployment. Certainly it would be much better to provide employment for these men on reproductive schemes than to be doing out money to them for nothing.  I think that is a bad policy, giving assistance and getting nothing in return for it.  Every tree that is planted will be an asset in years to come to the individual and to the State.  Another point that has to be considered is that during the emergency <Col N="2239" /> quite a lot of woods were felled and in many cases the timber was utilised for firewood.  I drew attention to that matter some time ago by way of a question and I pointed out that much of the timber that was being used for firewood could be planked and put aside for housing purposes. Deputy Morrissey referred recently in the House here to the case of a contractor who could not get timber to complete four or five houses.  If a contractor could not get a sufficient quantity for that purpose, how are the local authorities to deal with the housing problem in the future?  Every local authority in the country is confronted with the difficulty of providing adequate housing.  I am satisfied that a lot of the timber cut during the emergency has been wasted inasmuch as it has been used for firewood instead of being put away carefully to be utilised later in the erection of houses.</P>
    <P>In connection with those forests and woods that have been cut down during the emergency period, I hope the people who purchased lands for the purpose of acquiring the timber on them will not be allowed now to transfer the land to the Department of Forestry with a view to having it planted and so shifting the baby from themselves.  I am inclined to think that many of those people who purchased land to acquire the timber may wish to say to the Minister: &ldquo;You take the land and plant it&rdquo;.  I suggest to the Minister that he should put his foot down on anything like that. Such people should be made carry out their obligations to the State and if they got a profit from the timber so felled they should be made re-plant them and look after them.  I hope the Minister will see that the taxpayer is not mulcted by those people.  I hope also he will see his way at least to double the grants to local committees and encourage a shelter-belt scheme, which would be an improvement generally to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. L.J. Walsh Mr. L.J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my approval of the Bill.  We have heard much criticism from Opposition Parties on particular parts of the Bill, <Col N="2240" /> but that is only natural and to be expected.  I have not very much to say on afforestation, as I come from a district where there is not very much timber.  However, I want particularly to draw the Minister's attention to one district I represent, the district of Collon, County Louth.  There are some 200 acres of land there which have been offered to the Department over the past 20 years.  For one reason or another, the Nelson eye has been turned on it.  During World War No. 1, some 300 acres of forest lands were cut down in that district and very little reafforestation has taken place.  The 200 acres offered to the Department of Lands are still lying derelict and unsuitable for tillage.  There is 20 years' growth on that 200 acres being wasted. If afforestation had taken place 20 years ago, as it should have been when first suggested, we would have 20 years' growth of timber to-day.  I would ask the Minister to give special attention to that particular district, because in the past it was even a nursery district for plants.  Even 40 years ago, the nurseries of Collon were well known and there you could get any quality of plant required for afforestation on your own lands.  A good deal of that has been done, but I think it is rather amiss of the Minister's Department that the district should have been overlooked for so long.  The present Minister is a pretty energetic man and I hope when he comes to consider the question of afforestation he will give particular attention to this district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard some references to the scarcity of timber for housing purposes, which is very true, but I know most parts of this country pretty well and there is still a tremendous lot of timber standing and becoming old, which could have been felled and made available for building purposes.  There is not a county in the Twenty-Six but has an abundance of such timber. Deputy Giles referred to it in his speech, mentioning western Meath and Westmeath.  In the very eastern ends of County Meath, adjacent to us, he will find tremendous numbers of trees which are outliving their usefulness and which in a few years more will be deteriorating rather than improving. It is regrettable that we should be at <Col N="2241" /> such a loss for building timber while that timber is still standing over the last six years, when it could and should have been felled and would be seasoned now and available.  The Minister should waste no more time in allowing people to retain those trees, but should let them be cut down and made available for building purposes and the ground replanted with new trees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke (County Dublin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in welcoming this Bill, as it marks a further advance on the road to afforestation.  I have listened to many speeches made here regarding reafforestation and would like to support the encouragement of shelter-belts on small farms.  In my constituency, there are many small farms which have not enough land to allow them to have a proper shelter-belt. However, when a man has 35 or 40 acres, or even only 30 acres, if he were encouraged to have a small shelter-belt and if a grant could be given to him for that purpose, the belt would prove its usefulness in timber in years to come, as well as being useful for sheltering cattle in the winter. If reafforestation could be attacked in that way, we would definitely go ahead more rapidly.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Department have been doing their best with the money at their disposal and no one could have done more.  This is a really big issue and we must consider this country in comparison to other countries.  We all know that our timber resources are lower than almost any other country in the world.  In other countries where they have attacked the reafforestation problem in a proper manner&mdash;take France, for instance&mdash; they have encouraged the farmers themselves to replant the land.  We cannot progress as fast as we would wish, unless the Minister and the Department get the assistance of the people who have land at their disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County Dublin was very much denuded during the emergency and, if I might say so myself, being secretary of a parish council, I was as big a culprit as anyone else in that way.  We have a lot of waste land still in County Dublin, slobland which is of no use for <Col N="2242" /> tillage or grazing and, if properly drained, it could be used for State forests.  We have mountains in South County Dublin, some of which would be suitable, especially around the Castlekelly end, where at present there are ferns responsible for killing the cattle.  I had to go out to a few cases there.</P>
    <P>I would like to see reafforestation more decentralised than it is at present, while our whole approach to reafforestation is only in its infancy now. If there were a central nursery in each county, worked in conjunction with the county committee of agriculture and the Forestry Department, it would mean that, at certain times during the year, the county committee inspectors and the forestry inspectors could get the small farmers to come to see how the trees were progressing in the nursery beds and could ask them to take a deep interest in them.  That would encourage them to take an interest in the growing of trees and to see the benefit it would be to the country later on.</P>
    <P>As far as County Dublin is concerned, there are some small farmers who have not the land to plant timber, but there are others who have and I am sure that, if they were properly encouraged by the county committee of agriculture and the Department's inspectors, we would find, in ten, 12 or 20 years' time&mdash;if we are alive to see it&mdash;that reafforestation has improved and that there has been a big increase in the number of trees.  I hope that the people of the country will be only too anxious, from a national point of view, to help the Minister and his Department in trying to make our country what it should be from a wooded and scenic point of view.  With such co-operation I believe we could have our country growing timber which will be useful to us in the coming years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>One gets rather perplexed by a debate of this kind. Listening yesterday evening and to-day to Deputies, one wonders what the people of the country think about what is said in this House.  There has been a lot of talk about shelter belts.  There is provision made already for shelter belts.  The committee of agriculture in <Col N="2243" /> each county gives plants practically free in order to establish shelter belts, and the Forestry Department give a grant of £60 an acre for planting larger areas.</P>
      <P>The main issue is, do we want trees in this country or do we want men? I was struck by what Deputy Morrissey stated here last night about areas that he knows of in his part of the country that should be planted and that would grow timber: that have already grown timber.  In the past the Department's policy was that there are certain districts that will not grow timber, that bogland will not grow timber.  That is a mere statement.  What I regret is that the Department did not take some steps to demonstrate to those people who put up this contention, that timber cannot be grown on it.  I would like to see substantial research work carried out to demonstrate to the people that timber will not grow on bogland.</P>
      <P>It is quite easy to demonstrate to anybody that trees will not grow along the western side of the mountains of this country, along the west coast.  You can easily demonstrate that and you want no research work in that connection. Trees planted there are destroyed by the storms sweeping in from the Atlantic.  But, on the eastern side of the hills and mountains, which everybody says should be planted, no steps have been taken to prove or disprove that trees would grow there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main question is the planting of trees on tillage land.  Deputy Giles is very enthusiastic about planting trees in County Meath.  From my county, and other western counties, people leave in order to take holdings on the royal lands of Meath.  I expect there would be a regular storm if it was suggested that trees would be placed on the lands of Meath instead of people.  We cannot have it both ways. Are we or are we not to grow trees in places not suitable for human beings? There is a lot of land that human beings should not be living on.  In sheer desperation they had to settle down on that land&mdash;their ancestors were driven there many years ago. Should we grow timber there and put the people on the good land?  If we are <Col N="2244" /> to put the people on the good land we cannot grow timber on it.</P>
    <P>To what extent can we successfully grow timber in the western parts of this country and in the poorer parts of it?  I am disappointed that some research work has not taken place so as to indicate to everybody what can be done with regard to the growing of timber on what is known as land that is not suitable for any other purpose. I cannot see why very poor land that will not grow grass or crops but that might grow commercial timber, should not be planted.  Unless it does grow commercial timber, I do not see what is the use of planting it, but if you put some scrub timber on it, it would add to the beauty of the country.</P>
    <P>We are aiming at producing timber for commercial purposes and as a national asset.  The Department may be quite right in saying that timber will not grow on what appear to be semi-barren tracts of country, but that timber will not grow there has never been physically disproved and no steps have been taken to disprove it.  Perhaps in a laboratory or an office you can prove that on paper, but you have never proved it to the people.  I would like active steps to be taken to prove or disprove it.  I would be prepared even to lose a considerable sum of money in demonstrating that this cannot be done.  You should settle the thing one way or the other.</P>
    <P>What I do know from my own experience is that at some stage or other in the evolution of the earth timber did grow in places where bogs now exist. What is troubling me, before making any charges that timber would or would not grow there, is, did that timber grow away from there at an earlier age, say several centuries ago, and then some cyclone which swept over this country tossed that timber and buried it and then there was an accumulation of bog on top of it?  I cannot prove that the timber grew there, or how the bog accumulated; it would take someone with scientific knowledge to do that.  The fact is that at some stage good timber grew on what is now bogland. Of course, the timber is now buried in the bog.  The point is, how did it get down there?  There is no <Col N="2245" /> doubt about the timber growing, but the question is, when it did grow was it bogland or not?  I suggest that is an issue that could be quite easily demonstrated by the Department.  If it could be solved, it would settle a very vexed question in this country.  So long as something is not done about it, the problem will still remain and those who come after us will talk here year after year on Forestry Estimates and will put up the same proposal.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is satisfied that he has sufficient land on which to plant timber to meet the requirements of this country, then the problem is practically solved, but one is quite sceptical about that.  Statements are made in the House on issues of this kind and events falsify them absolutely.  I am sure most people will remain quite sceptical as to the ultimate vindication of the Minister's hope with regard to meeting the full timber requirements of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry opened out here last night about compelling farmers to plant at least three acres of land.  That may be all right, but he should qualify his statement.  Surely, it is a ridiculous thing to ask allottees who have been given holdings of 22 acres or so by the Land Commission to plant three acres. In the layout of those holdings very foolish things have been done.  Acres of these small holdings have been wasted erecting enormous fences with a wide gripe on either side, when a wire fence which would take up only six inches should have been erected.  This valuable land has been put to loss by these enormous fences which one would think were regular fortifications, with huge gripes, made at each side as a result of getting material to build them, on plots of land 20 acres in extent, which are 30 acres too small to be economic holdings.  Then it is suggested that another three acres should be taken for the planting of shelter belts.  The thing is positively ridiculous.</P>
    <P>The Department have been completely wrong in their approach to this matter in providing these miserable holdings of 22 acres and creating new problems of congestion.  One would think that it was merely a matter of <Col N="2246" /> building up the country for hunting.  It represents a terrible waste of land, and more good land is wasted in this country through the building of these fences, with gripes at each side, than in any country in the world.  It would be impossible to put a value on the amount of land wasted in that way and the Land Commission is perpetuating that waste by continuing to build these enormous fences.  Probably a couple of acres of good land are wasted in erecting these fences on these small holdings. Deputy Corry then suggests that three more acres should be taken from them.  If they had got 50 acres originally, as they should have got, we could accept the idea of devoting an acre or two to the planting of shelter belts.</P>
    <P>The general impression throughout the country is that this Department has not got off its mark in the matter of forestry.  While a good deal has been done in some way, it does not show itself.  What we see is scarcely commensurate with the effort put into it, and it will probably be another 20 years before the work becomes really apparent.  Everybody is united in this matter&mdash;there is no contest about it&mdash; and everybody is desperately keen. The only problem is the matter of a proper approach, and I suggest to the Department that all that can be done should be done in the matter of research work into the growing of timber on land on which we have been told up to now it is not possible to grow timber but on which that has not been demonstrated.</P>
    <P>With regard to shelter belts and farmers growing small quantities of timber, there should be a section in the Bill whereby farmers who grow timber and put up decent timber belts will not, when an emergency arises, be treated as outlaws.  There should be provision to enable such farmers to get sufficient timber for any purpose for which they require it, because if they get it into their heads&mdash;the farmers in this country are in ways very peculiar&mdash;that they are growing this timber for other people and that, if they want a tree, they are no better off than the man who never grew a tree, they will say to themselves: &ldquo;What is the use in our bothering ourselves when we are <Col N="2247" /> merely doing it for somebody else?&rdquo; We should insert a provision in the Bill, which is a codification of the forestry law, whereby farmers who grow a belt of timber will be entitled, as of right, to get whatever timber they require for the needs of their farmhouses and dwellinghouses.  The country will be happy to know that this is the basis of a scheme which will solve this vexed question of forestry. I would like to be convinced of that, but I remain somewhat sceptical.  I hope, however, that the Minister's anticipations in the matter will be realised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the fundamental problem in this connection is that we have not got enough land to relieve congestion in this country.  If we wanted to give every farmer in Ireland an economic holding, we would have to reclaim a considerable area of the ocean bed.  There is no getting away from that.  I am informed by those who are qualified to speak that any land on which trees can be reared to maturity is capable of reclamation. We want all the land that is capable of reclamation for the extension of uneconomic holdings, and therefore we have to ask ourselves: Are we going to put on the land men or trees?  I am in favour of putting men on.</P>
      <P>There are people who will argue that, if you create forests, more men will get employment looking after those forests than would be employed if you divided the land among tenant farmers.  I do not want to make the rural population of this country the paid servants of the State or anybody else.  I want to make them independent proprietors and I would sooner make small farmers independent proprietors of the soil than to make trees the owners of the soil and potential farmers the servants of these trees, and the foresters who planted them, in perpetuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin speaks of the manifest impossibility of planting timber on the western sides of the Connemara and Donegal mountains to be destroyed by the Atlantic gales.  I distinctly remember a publication by our own Department of Forestry pointing <Col N="2248" /> out that havoc was wrought on the western slopes of these mountains, but that, contrary to normal inexperienced expectation, when the Atlantic gale struck the western side of one of these mountains, it was not diverted into the firmament, but followed the contour of the mountain, and that if you planted trees on the eastern side, the gale came over the top and cut the tops off all the trees. I remember seeing photographs of all the trees being bent down and cut off by a gale which came over the top of the mountain.</P>
    <P>All were agreed that you could make the trees grow to a certain point and that then they were destroyed.  If that contention be true, I do not see the point of wasting oceans of money for the purpose of demonstrating to those who refuse to be convinced that which has been repeatedly demonstrated already, that, where there is a prevailing westerly gale beating on a mountain range, you cannot grow trees to maturity on the western slope at all and you cannot grow trees, again to maturity, on the eastern slope above the half-way line.  If that is true, it seems to me to dispose of the matter mentioned by Deputy McMenamin.</P>
    <P>I have only one other point to make. I would like to see tree planting developed in this country.  But it is all eye-wash, all this grandiose talk about forestry, when the population is overflowing off the land into the sea.  I think it is a cod to be talking about vast schemes of forestry.  Nobody proposes that we should depopulate wide areas and plant trees in place of people.  Make up your mind if you want large areas of forestry.  The first thing you will have to do is to get a Clanrickarde and institute wholesale evictions to clear the land.  In the old days certain landlords wanted to make sheep-runs, and the only way to do that was to clear the people off the land, and throw down the fences and the houses.  Is not the process of preparing land for afforestation closely analogous to the process of preparing it as a sheep-run?  Who wants to put the people out in order to make room for trees?  I do not.  If that is the kind of forestry aspiration some Deputies have I have not got it, <Col N="2249" /> and I will resist it to the best of my ability.  There are, undoubtedly, certain inland slopes that could be afforested and which I think should be afforested.  My only radical complaint against the Department is that in the smaller &ldquo;takes&rdquo;, which under recent forestry regulations they have been prepared to accept, they are planting soft wood trees.  I think that is a great mistake.  We can get all the soft wood we want from Russia, Canada and the Scandinavian countries.  It is the merest codology for us to be growing soft wood against the imports that will be available from the natural sources of supply in 25 years' time. The timber we plant now will be mature in from 25 to 30 years.  Does anybody imagine that we are going to continue in a state of siege for the next 30 years?  Does anybody imagine that what we plant now will affect competition with countries like Tasmania?</P>
    <P>What is disappearing in this country altogether as a result of our policy of land division is hard wood trees.  There are no oak, and no elm, while beech is rapidly disappearing, as well as ash, and such as remains to us are very largely deformed by disease, by malnutrition or unsuitable positions. Nothing is more beautiful in a rural countryside than a well-kept and reasonably extensive beech-grove or a smaller wood of oak trees.  It is quite outside the capacity of any individual in this country now to plant such timber, because that class of timber was in the past planted by great territorial owners, who looked forward to a succession of heirs to follow them.</P>
    <P>They planted hardwood timber with their eyes on a period 150 years hence. They were, figuratively speaking, seeking to create a park or something of that kind, and were content, in the certainty of the survival of their house and family, to provide amenities, the full enjoyment of which they never contemplated seeing.  No small farmer in this country can afford to keep an oak tree on his land.  An oak tree or a beech tree in full leaf will cover a surprising area of land, not only with its roots and foliage, but with its shade, and under that shade the quality of the herbage must inevitably deteriorate, from the feeding point of view, with <Col N="2250" /> the result that the small farmer thinks it as dear to keep a tree around the place as to keep a goat.  Accordingly he uproots the tree.</P>
    <P>Anybody who lives in a congested area realises that as soon as the land was divided amongst the people, the first thing that was done was to remove the trees.  The people did not do that because they were unaesthetic or because they hated beauty.  They did it because they were hungry, because they wanted to live, and required every square inch of the land on the miserable 20 acres they had, to be used to the limit of its capacity in order to get a livelihood.  Our people could no longer afford to keep trees, and those who, in the past, planted trees are gone, and their functions have been transferred to the Department of Forestry.  It is manifestly uneconomic to grow trees on smallholdings of 25 or 30 acres.  Beech, oak or elm make a very material contribution to the scenic amenities of the country and, at the same time, accumulate a very valuable deposit of hardwood which for certain specialised purposes is very useful.  They can in certain circumstances be very valuable.  There is no use wasting verbiage in labouring that point.  I think I made it perfectly clear. So far as there is a contest between men and trees I am in favour of men. So far as planting mountains and bogs goes, it is all cod.  The trees will not grow and, if they grow, it will be to a certain point, and then they die.  So far as planting large forests and wide tracts of arable land is concerned, far from commending that to the House, I think it would be criminal activity to undertake it.</P>
    <P>So far as planting hardwood trees as widely as we can as an endowment of generations yet unborn, I am all for it, and I think the money spent on it would be well spent and would ultimately, in one way or another, make a generous return to the community on whose behalf it was spent. Subject to those observations, I wish the Department of Forestry well and trust that they have under this Bill all the powers they require for the successful prosecution of a forestry policy adapted to the conditions of a country where there are far more people looking <Col N="2251" /> for land than we have land to give them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon's remarks in the last part of his speech influenced me to get up, that is, his observations in connection with the hardwood trees.  I have always thought the policy of the Forestry Branch of the Land Commission was somewhat wrong in that when they divided large estates they did not make some attempt to preserve the timber on them.  I have spoken on this subject before in the House, and I do not think there is any harm in raising it again.  Nobody expects that the owner of land is going to make his living out of a wooded area or partly wooded area&mdash;he cannot do it &mdash;but provision might have been made by the Land Commission to preserve those portions of estates on which there was valuable hardwood timber.  I know estates on which there was an extensive quantity, say, of walnut timber. I venture to say there is hardly a walnut tree in the country at the moment. If there is one, I do not know where it is.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Old Age Pensions&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Dáil Eireann requests the Government to introduce proposals for the purpose of providing for persons over 65 years of age, who have ceased being gainfully employed, old age pensions at the rate of 22/6 per week; and providing further that, in computing the means of applicants under the old age pensions code, any net income not exceeding £52 per annum will not be taken into account.&mdash; (Deputies M. O'Sullivan and Keyes).</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of old age pensions has been before this House on many occasions.  It has been subjected to criticism from all parts of the House.  I propose to deal with the matter to-day as briefly as I possibly <Col N="2252" /> can.  I want to avoid as far as possible any repetition of the case as so far presented.  If there is any true Christian charity left in the Fianna Fáil Ministry or if they believe in the elements of fair play to the most deserving class of the community, I cannot see how they can possibly reject the motion that is now before the House. Although the motion suggests a retirement age of 65, I should like to point out to the Minister that while that is a very admirable objective to aim at, it does not always follow that persons engaged in industry or in gainful occupation retire at the age of 65.  So that, in any computation made by the Minister and his officials of the total cost of putting the terms of this motion into operation, that factor should not be excluded.  Many people who would be entitled to a pension of 15/- or 16/- a week would not retire at that age because they would consider themselves still fairly well fitted to remain in industry.  I should like to remind the House and particularly the Minister and his Government that during the régime of a previous Government the old age pension was reduced by the sum of 1/-.  It was reduced from 10/- to 9/- per week.  I think it would be agreed by all sides of this House, as it is agreed by the electors, or most of them, that that was the main factor that brought about the defeat of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  At that period there was a tremendous hullaballoo raised all over the country by the Minister and his associates.  I suppose there is hardly a member on the Government benches to-day who did not make himself vocal in condemning any Government that would cut old age pensioners by 1/-.  Let us see what is the position to-day.  The old age pensioner, when his pension was cut from 10/- to 9/- a week, was twice as well off as he is now with 10/- a week.  He could buy more consumer goods with his 9/- then than he can buy with £1 to-day.  Everybody knows that.  The merest tyro in the first standard of the national schools to-day would be able to tell you that.  As I have said, there was a tremendous hullaballoo raised at that time.  The Government were told they <Col N="2253" /> were robbing the poor.  Again I say that was the main factor which brought about the defeat of the then Cumann na nGaedheal Government.</P>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I have to call attention to some extraordinary anomalies that exist in the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act.  I shall quote two cases which I think will satisfy the House that a grave injustice is being done and has been done to some of the most deserving persons in our community.  The first case is that of the provident and prudent man who, for a long period of years, in most cases a period of 40 years, contributes to an organisation, whether it be a trade union or a benevolent association of some kind. He contributes to a superannuation fund, frequently denying himself the necessaries of life and most of the luxuries in order to secure to himself at the end of a period of 40 years a sum of 15/- a week by way of superannuation allowance.  That prudent and provident citizen who, I submit, is the backbone of this country, the man who stands up to all his obligations, whether it be to the local authority, to the State, to his neighbours, shopkeepers and others, who is a model citizen, puts in an application for the old age pension of 10/- per week.  He is told by the State: &ldquo;No, you will get the large sum from us of 1/- per week.&rdquo;  One shilling per week is offered to that decent man, or woman, as the case may be.  I will produce figures and facts to prove every word I say.  It is so well known that it is hardly necessary to give that guarantee.  That deserving applicant is told: &ldquo;No.  We will give you 1/- a week, because your means are 15/- and the State recognises this fact, at any rate, that any person who has 16/- a week is outside the ambit and the scope of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now let us take the second case, just to prove some of the anomalies that exist under this cruel, unchristian, uncharitable system.  The second applicant has been a liability on the State almost since birth, not alone a liability on the State but a liability on the local authority.  He has possibly <Col N="2254" /> been reared at the public expense; he has been in and out of the jails of this country over a period of years. He has been charged for assaulting the police, assault and battery of his neighbours, and so on, just by hook or by crook avoiding penal servitude.  That person having attained his seventieth birthday applies for an old age pension. He gets the full pension of 10/- a week.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister who, I believe, has a fairly decent outlook on these matters, does he consider that that is a just, right, or proper thing to do in this so-called Christian community? From the Press and from pulpits in this country we have been abjured to establish savings societies. We were told the virtues of saving. School children were advised to put their pennies, tuppences and sixpences per week into savings in order to purchase Savings Certificates, and so on. What a contradiction of that policy is represented by the two cases I have quoted.  Children were told to save. The virtues of saving were placarded on the walls of the country.  Savings committees were established.  Saving for what?  In order to save the Exchequer a miserable 15/- a week when some of these children would reach old age.  At a meeting in the Albert Hall the late Mr. Lloyd George said that if his mother were alive he would compel her to apply for the old age pension.  It is a well-established fact, according to the statisticians, that a person of 70 years of age has contributed during his life through the customs and excise and other establishments of the State, far more than he could ever get out of the State.  Based on these cold statistics alone, the person who is in receipt of 10/- or 12/- a week from a former employer should be entitled to an old age pension of 10/-.  This motion asks for an increase in the old age pension. Does it ask too much?  If it is said that it is asking too much, then why have you got a tribunal in this country for the purpose of making emergency Orders giving a bonus to the ordinary workers&mdash;a belated bonus by the way? Does there not seem to be a contradiction in that policy when a deserving citizen who has worked up to the age <Col N="2255" /> of 70, and who retires and gets from his employer a pension of 10/- or 12/-, only gets another 2/- or 4/- from the State?  In other words, you are putting a penalty on thrift and providence.</P>
    <P>I could quote many cases which would demonstrate strange anomalies which arise out of the Act.  Let us take the case of an investigation officer who, in accordance with Government policy, examines an old woman who is applying for an old age pension and who lives with her daughter and son-in-law. Perhaps I should say the inquisition officer, because the Spanish Inquisition is trotting very slowly after the terrible inquisition undergone by these unfortunate people, as if they were criminals or had robbed something from the State, instead of being able to say what they put into the State.  At the inquisition this old lady will be asked: &ldquo;Have you got the use of this room?&rdquo; It may be a little parlour in a back street.  She answers: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Then she is asked: &ldquo;Have you a bedroom to yourself?&rdquo; The old lady, being proud of her daughter and son-in-law, says: &ldquo;Yes, my daughter and son-in-law look after me very well.&rdquo;  Then she is asked: &ldquo;You have also the use of this room?&rdquo; and she answers: &ldquo;Certainly, my daughter and son-in-law deny me nothing in this house.&rdquo;  The old lady, being proud of her daughter and son-in-law, may answer the officer truthfully, possibly sometimes exaggerating the decency of the daughter and son-in-law. What happens?  The investigation officer reports that the old lady's maintenance is valued at 16/- or 18/- and she never receives a pension.  Is not that the negation of what is meant by encouraging filial affection and duty? The young woman and the young man who help the parent are penalised.  It seems to me that we are mouthing a whole lot of Christian charity in this country.  We demonstrate on the saints' days.  We parade on Church holidays and make protestations of our piety, etc., while here we have an instance of pure daylight robbery of old people.  Yet, you are a Christian Government and we are a Christian people, moryah!</P>
    <P>I believe that there are decent men <Col N="2256" /> in the Fianna Fáil Party, that 99.9 per cent. of them are decent men&mdash;I will not explain what the other decimal point stands for.  I believe that if the Whips were taken off and those Deputies were allowed to vote according to their honest convictions and consciences they would vote for the motion.  I cannot see how they could do otherwise.  These decent men will tell you in private conversation that they are compelled by the Party Whip and discipline to vote in a certain way. I know what Party government means. I know this has to be done, and I do not blame the individuals.  I feel that 99.9 per cent. of the Fianna Fáil Party have some conscience, some sense of justice and Christian charity left.  Of course, I know it is almost hopeless to ask the Minister to take off the Whips and allow these Deputies to vote according to their conscience.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Keyes, who sponsored this motion, made a contribution to this House which I think is worthy of them and of the House.  They gave a reasoned and logical statement of the case. Some of the cases which have come within my own experience are really heartrending.  I suppose every other Deputy has a similar experience and has to listen to the complaints of some of these old people who are turned down.  There are many cases on the files of the Local Government Department which I sent in either by letter or by 'phone.  I am certain that if it were left to any Minister who had any sense of responsibility to the community, and particularly to those helpless ones of the community, a motion of this kind would be passed.  A sum of 22/6 per week does not go very far nowadays.  I think that figure should be somewhat higher.  In my view, this motion should commend itself to the House, and to the Government, which boasts of its Constitution and of the rights of citizens, and of this being a Christian country.  I ask the Minister to say whether he agrees with the case I have made in relation to the person who has a small superannuation allowance of 8/-, 10/- or 15/- a week.  Does he believe that it is right to penalise a man who might otherwise get a decent <Col N="2257" /> allowance from his previous employers, because that is what is happening? Some employers to-day are giving their retired employees a pension of £1 per week, and in some cases 25/- a week, at the age of 65/-, but when these men attain the age of 70, the employers say&mdash;and you cannot blame them:&mdash;&ldquo;Well, it is the duty of the State now to give these men 10/- a week, and I will reduce my contribution to 6/-.&rdquo;  You are inflicting a hardship upon a man who might otherwise be getting £1 from his employer and 10/- from the State.</P>
    <P>Now, I hope the Minister understands that position.  Assuming, for instance, that a railway company, or large transport company, or any other big firm, provide a pension of £1 per week for a retired employee, at 65, that man automatically comes under this if he has over 16/- a week, and what happens is that the employer on his ex-employee reaching the age of 70 reduces the £1 to 6/- a week.  You cannot blame him for that, he is perfectly justified, as he says that the State makes up the rest.  That simply means this: &ldquo;Thou art prohibited from having more than 16/- a week.&rdquo;  I think that that should be inserted in some of the commandments of the Fianna Fáil Government or of any other Government that inflicts such great hardship on the aged and the poor.  I hope and trust that at some future date the anomalies I have mentioned will be wiped out, and then we shall have some claim to call ourselves a Christian Government and a Christian country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this motion in its entirety.  I think that the mover and seconder definitely are to be congratulated on the very able way they presented it to the House.  Now, on this question of old age pensions, the first thing that hits one forcibly is the difference that is drawn between those who should be entitled to an old age pension and many other classes in the State who are entitled to a pension automatically at 65.  What I like about the proposal here is the suggestion that some recognition should be given to the old on reaching 65.  I hold <Col N="2258" /> that, no matter what the amount of the pension is&mdash;if it were 5/- a week or even only 2/- a week; I do not care what it is&mdash;these people are definitely entitled to some recognition at the age of 65.  Most of the people concerned are persons who have spent a life of toil; they have earned their living through bodily toil, and we all know that when we come to 65 we are no longer able to meet the daily round of work in the way that we could formerly meet it.  Accordingly, I think that the granting of the old age pension at 65, no matter what the amount is, would be only just and fair, and I think that it is a fair case to put up to the Government.</P>
      <P>Now, of course, one of the principal faults in the administration of old age pensions is the means test.  A headline was set up in this House some time ago in the case of the Children's Allowances Bill, where a means test was not mentioned at all, and quite rightly so. I think that that Bill did not suffer from the fact that there was no means test, not has the State been unduly burdened because of that.  The means test has proved to be a nasty and outworn means of getting away from paying what people should be entitled to, and very often the result is that some people get an old age pension who are not entitled to it.  The last speaker spoke bitterly about the humiliation that is often inflicted on those old people when the investigating officers come around to inquire into their means.  Well, I must say that some investigating officers are not like others, and they do not poke and pry into small, petty details and, perhaps, details of a very private and delicate nature, but some of these officers do, and I think that any civil servant who is charged with that duty should use common sense and have a little humanity.  I could quote cases, although I do not intend to do so now, where investigating officers have proved very nasty and have allowed outside considerations to intrude into their investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for instance, an applicant who has a certain sum of money in the bank.  The first thing that happens is <Col N="2259" /> that that sum of money, whether it be great or small, is assessed at the rate of 5 per cent. interest for the purpose of the old age pension.  Now I am not sure, but I think that there is no bank in the country at the present day that is paying more than 1½ per cent., or even 1 per cent., interest. Why the Government, knowing that the money in the bank is only paying 1 per cent. or 1½ per cent. interest, should have a standard whereby it is assessed at 5 per cent., for old age pension purposes, is beyond me.  That was called to the attention of the present Minister's predecessor in office &mdash;I was not here at the time&mdash;and I do not think that there was any satisfactory explanation given at the time, nor do I think that there is any satisfactory explanation for it now.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a man with, say, £100 or £200 in the bank; very often, that is due to the combined efforts of himself and his family.  That money would not be there at all if that man had paid his sons and daughters even a small wage for their labour.  Take a man with a small farm of land and three or four of a family, between sons and daughters: all of these contribute to the running of the house or farm in various ways.  Then they might have outside earnings, and the whole lot is put in the bank.  Yet, if that were to be presented in the proper way, it would be found that it actually represented a very small wage for the sons and daughters, who had not received any wage, and the money should not be there at all in the father's name by right, if he had distributed the profits of the place amongst his family, who were the real wage earners in that particular case.  Then take the case of an old person, living alone, who might have a small sum of money in the bank to meet his burial expenses.  That is a case which is very often to be met with. Surely to goodness, in ordinary humanity, as the last speaker said, if we have any Christian charity, we ought not to take that into account. It would amount to a very small sum, and it certainly would not overburden the Exchequer.  I think we should drop all that kind of thing.</P>
    <P>Another case that very often comes <Col N="2260" /> to my notice is where the money in many cases is the result of accumulated remittances from the children working abroad, and who send the money home, which is the custom in practically every home, at least, in County Mayo.  The boys and girls who go across to England try to make the best of their youth and their strength, and they save up, maybe, £500 or £600 and they send it home.  It cannot be banked in their own names, and therefore it is banked in the father's or the mother's name, as the case may be.  Now, I do not say that in all cases, if representations were made, or if it was proved that the money although in the father's name was actually the property of some members of the family living outside this country, that would be taken into account.  I do not know whether that would be taken into account or not, but in some cases that I know of, at least, it was not taken into account and was assessed as belonging to the father.</P>
    <P>A great deal could be said to show how objectionable is this means test, but I shall not go further into that question, because a number of speakers have already dealt with that aspect of the matter.  Whatever portion of this motion the Minister agrees to consider, I hope he will agree to consider the abolition of the means test.  Deputy O'Sullivan gave some interesting figures as to what the investigation of means costs.  The figure was £30,000. That would go a long way&mdash;or at least some way&mdash;towards meeting the extra cost of pensions, and it would wipe out an odious system.</P>
    <P>We must look at the other side of the picture.  Where is the money to be found?  This motion contemplates the giving of the old age pension at 65, increasing the amount to 22/6, and abolishing the means test.  That is a motion which should commend itself to the Government and to every Deputy.  The last speaker said that, if the Whips were taken off, not a single member of the House would vote against the motion.  I believe that that is so.  The care of the old and infirm should have our first attention.  In many cases, they have to toil until they reach 70 years of age, and then go <Col N="2261" /> through the harassing experience of an investigation to ascertain whether they are qualified to receive the pension or not.  We have been lavish in our Votes of money for other purposes. The Minister for Defence asked for a supplementary amount of £700,000, and there was not a word about it.  On a previous occasion, when I spoke on this subject, the reply of the then Minister was that my proposal would involve putting a halfpenny an ounce on tobacco, and another tax on a pint of stout, and so on.  During the emergency, when we had to face up to the task of defending the country&mdash;I was not a member of the House at the time&mdash;there was no difficulty in finding the necessary money.  If our neutrality had been violated, we should have had to find much larger sums, and there would not be a single objector.  Not a single voice was raised to the finding of the millions of increased expenditure on the defence of the country.  If a larger sum had had to be found and expended, owing to the violation of our neutrality by any of the belligerents, it would have been regarded as well spent.</P>
    <P>What I dislike, when an attempt is made to help the old or infirm or the poor, is the question that comes from the Government Benches: &ldquo;Where is the money to be found?&rdquo; Then they tell us that Clann na Talmhan and Labour and Fine Gael and Independents want to increase the cost of living.  When money is needed for other purposes, there is not a word about it. We should cast that outlook aside. Those who have definitely spent their lives, who have contributed to the upkeep of the country by the payment of taxation from year to year, which every citizen has to do, should get the recompense proposed in this motion and thus raise them out of any pecuniary difficulties which may come to them in the closing stages of their lives.  That should be our first care. The Minister will, probably, give us a string of figures and ask where this vast sum of money is to be found.  The money will be in circulation within the country.  Not a penny of it will leave the country.  The result will be the same as in the case of an internal work which would be put in hand in the <Col N="2262" /> country.  Every right-minded Deputy will support the motion and the Minister should take a reasonable view of it. It has been presented very ably and decently by the mover and seconder, and I and every member of my Party will support it.  I hope the Minister will take a favourable view of it.</P>

      <P>The deep thought and attention which Deputy Blowick gave this motion was displayed when he said that the saving of £30,000 on inspection costs would go a long way towards meeting the cost which would be involved by its acceptance. In his view, £30,000 may be a long way towards £12,000,000 but I do not think it is.  Deputy Blowick blows hot and cold on this question of Government expenditure.  To-day, he supports this motion for the expenditure of £12,000,000 or more on old age pensions.  When the Budget comes along he will growl very heartily indeed about national expenditure.  It is only a very short time since he introduced a motion here complaining of the &ldquo;enormous and ever-increasing burden of national expenditure.&rdquo;  If this sum of £12,000,000 were to be provided by the Government in the coming Budget, I have no doubt that Deputy Blowick would complain even more energetically than before about the &ldquo;enormous and ever-increasing burden of national taxation.&rdquo;  This Government has never been backward in doing what it could, and what it thought the nation could afford in any particular set of circumstances, for desirable social services, including old age pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that, if the Dáil considered that, no matter what else happened, we should provide this additional sum of £12,000,000 or more to meet the cost of this motion, it could be done.  When the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme and the children's allowances scheme were introduced some years ago, I think it was generally agreed that extra sums for social services should be devoted to these purposes rather than to increasing to any great extent the weekly amount of the old age pension.  I do not think that anybody would suggest that we should meet this sum of £12,000,000, added to <Col N="2263" /> the £4,000,000 which we are already spending on old age pensions and supplementary allowances, by abolishing the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme or the children's allowances. The one suggestion that was made for cutting down expenditure in order to meet this demand, so far as I could see, was contained in Deputy O'Higgin's complaint about the cost of the Army.  He, in his usual way, exaggerated by saying that the Army was going to cost four or five times the amount it cost pre-war.  Deputies will have the book of Estimates in a very short time and they will see that the cost of the Army will be, roughly, twice, not four or five times, what it was pre-war, but that is a rather slight exaggeration for Deputy O'Higgins. If we were to abolish the Army at his request, in order to meet one-third of this new bill, he would be the very first to complain of such a proceeding.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;on the community in times of peace&rdquo;.  It was very lucky that we had the Army in times of peace in order to expand it in the last war.  If we had not the Army, it would not be we who would be talking about the amount we should give to our own people as old age pensions.  Deputy Martin O'Sullivan and Deputy Keyes indicated that nothing had been done, practically speaking, for the old age pensioner since the Fianna Fáil Party came into office.  I grant you that the increase in the cost of living has borne harshly upon all sorts of people with fixed incomes&mdash;old age pensioners and others&mdash;but the Government has on many occasions indicated that it was prepared to do what it thought the <Col N="2264" /> community could afford towards giving the old age pensioner a reasonable standard of life.  One of the first things it did, even during the economic war when times were hard, was to remove a number of the disabilities that had been imposed upon old age pensioners by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government and to extend the facilities for obtaining old age pensions. The extra cost involved drove the old age pensions bill from £2,800,000 to about £3,800,000, so that an extra million was made available.  There is no use in going into the details of the 1932 Act.  The fact is there to be seen by anybody that this community is, or was up to 1939, paying an extra million pounds in old age pensions over and above the amount paid prior to the coming into office of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
      <P>Since the war commenced, Deputies are aware that it was State policy not to allow wages or prices to go into a race one after the other, but, however, at the lowest levels of income some concessions were given in order to compensate, in some measure, people with small incomes for the rise in prices. The old age pensioners benefited by the amount of money&mdash;£380,000 or so&mdash; which was made available in order to give them a supplementary allowance in the country and in order to guarantee them a certain allowance of food and fuel in the city.  Deputy Martin O'Sullivan said that it was wrong to call the various sums of money, which the Government distributed to relieve hardship, social services.</P>
      <P>He does not regard, I take it, free milk, free boots, free or cheap fuel, or free bread and butter as social services, but, from the point of view of the State Exchequer, they have the same effect. From the point of view of the recipients, they are receipts in kind rather than receipts in cash.  The people who are on the food and fuel allowance are at least guaranteed that their ration remains the same no matter what the price is.  In that way it is a very valuable social service, in my opinion, for the recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole question of social services will require care and thought in the coming years.  Even a list of the various things that have been done, and <Col N="2265" /> various schemes that are in operation to relieve hardship, is an indication of the complexity of the social services that are in existence in this country at the moment.  Deputies are aware that the Taoiseach has indicated that he proposes to set up a separate Ministry to go into this question of social services to see how they can be combined to the advantage of the community and to the advantage of the Exchequer, which is also the advantage of the community.  I know that the first duty of the Minister appointed to take charge of social services will be to examine them and see how best they can be co-ordinated and administered.</P>

      <P>We have not promised, and do not propose to promise, to the people that you can immediately make this a land fit for heroes to live in without doing any work.  It is better that we should indicate to the people our general lines of policy, but we should point out also that it is related to the national income.  Deputies here were talking about the getting of the money. It would be quite easy for us to distribute £1 a head per week to every person within the country.  There would be no physical difficulty in that&mdash;a short Act of Parliament would enable it to be done and it would only cost about £150,000,000 a year to do it. But would that alter the physical facts of the situation?  After all, we can distribute to the old age pensioners, to the widows and orphans, to the <Col N="2267" /> workers and to the farmers and employers and to the people as a whole only what the nation produces or what we can import.  While a correct monetary and financial policy may help to add to that national income, no monetary policy could substitute the necessity for production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Give me a chance.  I did not interrupt the Deputy.  We want, therefore, to continue the policy that has been adopted by Fianna Fáil, that is, to increase our social and other government services designed to give a better standard of life to all our people, according as we can see our way to afford and to maintain them.  We do not want to be taking a hop, step and leap forward and then a gallop back.  Every advance we have made in the line of social services we have been able to maintain.  We have not gone back, at any rate.  Deputy McGilligan may point out, as it is reasonable to do, that we have not increased the payments to compensate for the increased cost of living.  That has to be admitted.  However, the State policy in that regard is no secret to the community.  It was thought better, during the emergency, not to allow prices and wages to go up too high, as well as various payments, and flop then when the war was over.  Deputies can see that, in certain countries where the opposite policy was allowed to operate, they are at the moment in a spot of bother.  I am sure there are other Deputies here who wish to speak, and I will not take up very much more time.  I do not think that it would be a good thing for the community to inflict this bill of £12,000,000 on them at the moment.  If we were to raise that money in taxation in the coming year, we might do a lot more harm than good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that apply to any and every portion of the £12,000,000 this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking the motion as it stands, which is what we have to vote on, for or against.  It would do <Col N="2268" /> more harm than good even to the beneficiaries themselves that we should, by way of taxation, raise that amount of money for the coming year for that purpose.  If the money were asked for, for a purpose which would increase the total national income, the output of goods and services, which would give us more to distribute, I would welcome it; but if it were to be raised by taking from the present producers £12,000,000 extra, in order to give it to the old age pensioners, I doubt whether there would be sufficient incentive to work left in them.  We have seen in some countries recently that, when people have not enough incentive to work, they simply do not go to work; and the pure increase in wages does not cure the situation, as they want something for the money they get, whether that amount of money is big or small.</P>
      <P>We can distribute here amongst our people only what our people are willing to produce.  We would be well advised, in the coming years, to try to add to our present production and <i>pro rata</i> to the increase to make sure that the distribution end is taken care of.  There is no use in having production if you do not have distribution at the same time.  That was a dilemma and crux of the years previous to the war.  At the moment, the difficulty is to get the goods to distribute.  It would be much better for the members of the Labour Party to encourage the men with whom they are associated throughout the country, to add to the national production rather than ask for this sum of money to be distributed in this way.  I certainly think it would be much better for Deputy Blowick to do likewise.  I hope that, when the Government, in the coming Budget, asks for a reasonable amount of money to carry on State services and develop the country, Deputy Blowick will take up the same attitude as he takes up to-day and will say: &ldquo;All right, go ahead and get the money&rdquo;, and not be going back to the terms of the motion which he solemnly introduced and debated here a couple of months ago, when he complained about &ldquo;the enormous and ever-increasing burden of national taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2269" /> I believe this country can afford a reasonable level of taxation, but the smaller the burden in the way of taxation that we put on, the better it will be to give the people an incentive to work and to produce.  I do not think that we can ask the people at this moment to face an additional £12,000,000 in order that the terms of this motion might be carried out.</P>

      <P>Since I became a member of the House, I have listened to a number of feeble speeches from Ministers, but the feeblest and most hopeless speech I have ever heard from any Minister has just been delivered by the Minister for Finance on the all-important motion placed before the House by the Labour Party.  The motion concerns a section of the community for which we were all thought to have the highest of respect, that is, the older people.  It cannot be said that the present Government is treating the older section of the community fairly well.  As a matter of fact, any Irishman ought to be ashamed of the low esteem in which the present Government holds the older section of the people to-day.  I do not see how any Government can expect a citizen to exist on the miserable sum of 10/- per week.  I defy the Minister, or any member of the House, to give us an idea or a table showing how a citizen can get the necessities of life out of 10/- per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Northern Ireland the old age pension is 10/-, but there are allowances which bring it up to 22/6 per week.  It is the policy of this Government to bring about the unity of the country.  I submit that there is one way of doing that and that is to have a better standard of living in the Twenty-Six Counties than there is in the Six Counties.  I suggest that would be an encouragement to the people living up there to join with us.  I ask the Minister, who is an Ulsterman, does he imagine that the people in Northern Ireland are insane to throw in their lot for a system whereby they will have 10/- per week as an old age pension with, in some cases, an allowance of 2/6, and surrender the right to a weekly pension of 10/- with allowances <Col N="2270" /> bringing the amount to 22/6 per week?  The only way we can bring about unity is to have a standard of living comparing more than favourably with what they have across the Border and that will be an encouragement to those people to come in with us.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government is treating the old age pensioners with the highest disrespect.  I am sure the Minister realises the situation in the country as well as I do.  I am sure he knows that there are numerous old age pensioners dying of hunger every week.  How could it be otherwise?  If the Minister goes down to any of our provincial towns and inquires into the circumstances of the unfortunate people who have gone beyond their years of labour and asks how they are existing, he will find out that they are existing just on their bare rations.  Does the Minister realise that every person in New Zealand, man or woman, who is unable to work, is provided, when the age of 60 is reached, with £1 12s. 6d. per week and, in the case of a married couple, the amount is doubled&mdash;£3 5s. a week. In addition, they can have £1 a week each as personal income, up to £500 each in the Post Office Savings Bank, and they can own their own houses without that affecting their pension.</P>
    <P>The state of affairs that exists here cannot be compared with the state of affairs existing in any other country in the world, because here the conditions are most deplorable; they are horrible and really unchristian when a comparison is made with the conditions in any other civilised country.  Take the case of a constituent of mine who lives at Mountheaton, near Roscrea.  He applied for an old age pension and it was refused because he had 3/6 a week pension from the British Government&mdash;he served in the Boer War&mdash;and he also had 10/- a week from the British Government by way of subsistence allowance in respect of his son who is in England.  There was no income coming out of funds in this country and yet, because of the few shillings he received from the British Government, he was deprived of the old age pension. It is most unfair that such a system should be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>As to the means test, I believe that <Col N="2271" /> the continuance of the means test is the writing on the wall for the Fianna Fáil Party, just as the cutting down of the old age pension from 10/- to 9/- was the writing on the wall for the Cumann na nGaedhael Party in the days of its administration.  In order that the local old age pension committees may be able to discharge their duties in a more favourable manner from the point of view of the applicants for pensions, I think it is the duty of the Government to introduce some type of order or legislation &mdash;it gave them no trouble at all to introduce emergency powers when it suited them&mdash;which will ensure that the local investigation officer will attend all the meetings of the local committees. I have been a member of a pensions committee for several years and I know cases in which the investigation officer reported that certain persons had incomes which, in his opinion, were derived out of a few acres of bogland.  He estimates a certain sum&mdash;whatever he believes would be the value of a crop on four or five acres of bogland.  Any sane human being would know that such an estimate was quite incorrect.</P>
    <P>The only way to rectify a position like that is to have the investigation officer at all the meetings of the local committees.  He could then give an account to the members of the circumstances in each case.  Probably some of the members would also know the circumstances of the applicant and the conditions under which he or she lives. Under the existing practice, when various cases arise before committees, we have to adopt the report of the investigation officer and do as he desires.  His word is taken as final.  It cannot be questioned by members of the committee.  In such circumstances the local committees are powerless. They have no function whatever.</P>
    <P>I was expecting the Minister to make a statement as to what he proposed to do, but he evaded the suggestion to give the old age pension at 65.  From my recollection of his statement, he could hold out no hope for any increase in the rate of pension. The vast majority of our aged citizens <Col N="2272" /> have to continue with the present rate of pension until they go to their graves, having died from starvation and misery and having lived the remaining years of their lives in the height of poverty on a miserable 10/- a week.  No difficulty has been found in securing thousands of pounds for other purposes.  Look at what we are sending abroad for the relief of distress in other countries, while here nothing can be done about giving a small increase to our old age pensioners. For the upkeep of one individual in this State we have no hesitation in passing a Vote for £22,000, yet we make no provision for the needs of the old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick inquired where the money would come from.  There was no question about where it would come from when it came to passing £22,000 for the upkeep of one man's house, but there are questions raised as to where the money will come from when it is proposed to improve the lot of the old age pensioners who have given 70 years' good service and hard work to the State, and who, at the end of their days, are permitted by a so-called Christian Government to die in the same condition as any pauper.  The Minister ought to be ashamed to read out the list of social services&mdash;free this, that and the other, free beef, free boots, free milk.</P>
    <P>The people are being made paupers. The people do not want anything free so far as social services are concerned. They want decent wages and decent treatment for the old.  The less they get free the better.  If I had my way they would get nothing free.  The people merely want to be independent and to have a good standard of living; they want to be able to die in Christian decency, not to die in starvation and poverty as, unfortunately, the vast majority of our old age pensioners are dying.</P>
    <P>It is a disgraceful state of affairs that charity, funds given by charitable organisations, is taken into account in operating the means test.  I think Deputy Dillon raised the case here not long ago of a charitable organisation &mdash;I think it was the British Legion&mdash; which was giving a small allowance <Col N="2273" /> towards the maintenance of an old age pensioner.  Because of the few shillings per week being given by that organisation, the man's old age pension was considerably reduced.  Does the Minister consider that a Christian state of affairs?  The old age pensioners of this country are treated as slaves.  They are treated with disrespect, as if the Government's attitude was: &ldquo;They have lived their days and they are useless.  Let them starve and go to their graves&rdquo;.  I challenge Deputy Gorry, who is always extending sympathy to the old age pensioners in his constituency, and other members of the Fianna Fáil Party who are full of lip-sympathy for the old age pensioners, to prove their sincerity by voting for this motion.  If the Fianna Fáil Deputies for my constituency vote against this motion, I shall leave nothing undone to see that the old people in my constituency are made fully aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the fact that the Labour Party tried to improve conditions for them and that the Fianna Fáil Deputies were opposed to it.  I had expected good results from this motion but I am greatly disappointed by the Minister's reply.  He said that so far as he was aware the Government had fulfilled all their election promises.  It was definitely a plank in the Government's programme to increase old age pensions&mdash;the Minister cannot deny that&mdash;but no increase whatever has been given to them, except the provision whereby local authorities can give 2/6 per week as a supplementary allowance.  That supplementary allowance, however, is given only in cases in which, in the opinion of the home assistance officer, it is necessary and the applicants have to go to the relieving officer for it, so that it is another step in the direction of making paupers of the people.  I support this motion and any member of the House who believes in Christian charity, who believes that the conditions under which old age pensioners are compelled to exist by a so-called Christian native Government are horrible, <Col N="2274" /> will vote for it and do what he possibly can to see that it is carried. I have, however, little hope of the motion being passed while it is not in accordance with the ideas of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>Deputy M. O'Sullivan covered the subject of this motion in such a comprehensive speech that I do not desire to dwell on it at any great length, but there are a few points which ought to be underlined, particularly in the light of the Minister's speech.  The Minister gave some interesting advice to the Labour Party when he said they might usefully advocate amongst those in contact with them the necessity for increasing the national production.  Advice of that kind from the Minister was rather ironical, if not amusing, because the Minister must know that, during the past six years, 250,000 of our people who were willing to work in Ireland to increase the national production were railroaded out of the country to Britain because it was not possible for the Government to provide them with an opportunity of adding to the national wealth.  Advice of that kind from the Minister falls on rather barren ground, in view of the fact that his Government neglected the opportunities of utilising the man-power available to produce the additional wealth, without which, according to the Minister, it is not possible to add to our social services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic fact in connection with this motion is that it really asks for old age pensioners something less than what they are entitled to on the merits of the case.  Back in 1908, an alien Government gave old age pensioners in this country a pension of 5/- per week; in 1916, that pension was increased to 10/- per week; and in 1946, 30 years later, that pension is still 10/- per week.  But it takes, in 1946, approximately 25/- to buy what 10/- bought in 1916, and what this motion says to the old age pensioner who got 10/- per week in 1916 is that, having regard to the increased cost of living, he ought not to get less than 22/6 per week now.  If we had been honest and just to old age pensioners every year since 1916, we would have increased <Col N="2275" /> their pensions step by step with the increased cost of living.  We did not, however, do that.  At times we reduced their pensions and then we restored them, but, in the main, we give them to-day the same pittance as we gave in 1916, with the difference, as I have said, that it now takes approximately 25/- to buy what 10/- bought in 1916. The motion, therefore, asks the House to give back to the old age pensioners approximately the same purchasing power as their pensions had in 1916, and I submit to the Minister and his Party that that is not an unreasonable demand.  It has not been met in argument by what the Minister said, and no member of the Government Party has attempted to say that it is in any way an unreasonable demand to make on behalf of a very deserving section of the community.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not deny that we ought to do better for old age pensioners and, in fact, he did not deny that morally we owe it to the old age pensioners to improve the purchasing power of the pensions they have had since 1916.  His attitude might be summed up by saying that it is inconvenient to pay the debt to-day. That may be an argument of expediency, and I doubt if it can be justified or defended on grounds of expediency, but it certainly cannot be defended on the ground of doing justice to old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>One has only to reflect for a few moments on what life must mean to old people on a pittance of 10/- per week in 1946&mdash;with prices having increased by more than 70 per cent. since 1939 alone and with prices up by over 195 per cent. since 1914.  It is in that situation that we ask our old people to subsist on a pittance of 10/- to-day.  The very fact that they get 10/- a week is clear evidence that they have practically no resources whatever, because the iniquitous means test&mdash; and it seems to me to be a test which is becoming more rigorous year by year&mdash;is such that if they have any income whatever, the normal pension of 10/- which they would receive if they were completely destitute is depressed.</P>
    <P>In rural areas the position of the old <Col N="2276" /> age pensioner is one which begets the sympathy of every right-minded and sympathetic person who sees these unfortunate people trying to exist in their old age on a small pension of 10/- per week, but, bad as is the position in rural areas, it is worse in the towns and cities because there the old age pensioner very often has to try to pay rent and to eke out an existence without the possibility of getting the agricultural aid which it is possible to get in rural areas.  I have come across cases, and Deputies on the Government Benches have come across cases, of old age pensioners making a valiant struggle to make ends meet on the miserable pensions they receive, and only able to struggle along merely because we condemn them to a diet of tea, bread and butter as their main source of sustenance in their old age.</P>
    <P>To imagine that they could have any other type of food or nourishment on the miserable sum of 10/- a week is to make a mockery of their sufferings. The strange part of the whole business is this, that if a person breaks a window in O'Connell Street he will be arrested, put into jail and it will cost the State £2 a week to keep him there for a week.  Nobody questions that. Everybody says: &ldquo;That is quite right; put him into jail, and keep him there.&rdquo; If an old age pensioner decides to break a window in O'Connell Street, and if he is sent to jail, he will cost the State £2 a week to keep him in Mountjoy.  But if he is a good citizen and stays at home he will get 10/- a week.  That is all the State will spend on him.  If a person who, because of his circumstances, is drawing the old age pension, finds that he cannot continue to exist on it, he can go to the county home, as it is now called, where the local authorities are compelled to pay from 30/- to 40/- weekly for his upkeep.  The cost in these institutions has to be related to the fact that local authorities can buy goods at wholesale prices.  That gives a clear idea of the cost of a resident in institutions, in relation to the cost of an old age pensioner residing in his own home.  While we cheerfully pay the cost of incareerating prisoners in jails, and while local authorities are compelled to pay from <Col N="2277" /> 30/- to 40/- weekly for the upkeep of people in county homes and institutions of that kind the State resolutely sets its face against giving old age pensioners anything more than 10/- a week because, presumably, it regards 10/- a week as sufficient to keep a person in his home, while in poor law institutions the cost is three or four times that amount.  I should like to know how the Minister can justify the application of economics of that type to the problem of dealing fairly and adequately with old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the State had made supplementary allowances available, which were payable by local authorities.  I want to tell him that the application of the supplementary allowances is a positive disgrace. It consists of a means test in its worst and most vicious form.  Unless the object is to degrade old age pensioners, why must the supplementary allowances be administered under the poor law authorities, through the home assistance officers?  The old age pensioner can get the 10/- at the post offices, but he must go through an inquisition by the poor law officials before he can get the supplementary allowances.  I am familiar with what happens.  While those responsible under the local authorities have virtually no power, the attitude seems to be this: &ldquo;Is this another old age pensioner?&rdquo; One gets the impression that some folk would like to see old people dying at 69 rather than living to an age when they could get the pension and the supplementary allowances.  The Minister asked where was the money to come from to meet this claim and to do justice to the old people.</P>
    <P>Not so many years ago we had an annual Budget of £21,000,000.  The annual Budget now amounts to £52,000,000.  In the interregnum nobody asked where the difference came from. During the past six years we raised, because we felt that it was necessary, between £8,000,000 and £9,000,000 to maintain the Army.  Nobody objected to the raising of that sum or to putting at the disposal of the Army authorities all the money they wanted.  Nobody asked where it came from.  It is only when we ask for money for social services, <Col N="2278" /> with which to rescue people from poverty and destitution, that we are asked where is the money to come from.  It is always the poor have to explain where the money to keep them alive is to come from.  When other people want money this question, of where the money is to come from, is an issue that never gives trouble.  If we could raise the amount of the Budget from £21,000,000 to £52,000,000, I think we ought to be able, by a similar process, to do justice to the old age pensioners and to restore the sunken value of the pension to the value it had when they got it in 1916.</P>
    <P>Deputy Anthony referred at length to the penalty that is imposed on thrifty people.  A person can be in and out of jail in this country for 40 or 50 years, but when he reaches 70, if he has been thriftless throughout his life, he can get the old age pension. If he was a good citizen, and spent his life in rendering service to the people, when he reaches 70, if he gets a small pension from his employer or from his trade union, the means test will be applied, the effect of which is to deprive him of the State pension of 10/- weekly, or a substantial portion of it.  A person who has been the cause of worry to the police, but who lives up to 70, will get the full pension, while the thrifty citizen is penalised for being thrifty because of the imposition of the means test.  Nobody who is reasonable or just could defend a position of that kind.  Similarly, when members of trade unions receive pensions in their old age, that amount is taken into account.  They are deprived of portion of the State pension that they would get if they had not been sufficiently thrifty to provide for old age.  How could the Minister or any Department defend that state of affairs?  That is putting a premium on thriftlessness, on recklessness and abandon.  A good thrifty citizen is penalised, simply because he may have a little income and was truthful enough to disclose it.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister that he made no case against this motion.  No effort was made by any of the Minister's Party to make a case against the motion.  It can do no harm to test the <Col N="2279" /> feelings of the House on it.  If the Whips are taken off members of the Government Party could exercise their independence for one day in five years. That would not commit them to an excessive form of liberty.  I suggest to the Minister that if members of his Party are given leave to vote according to their conscience, they will vote for the motion.  In doing so they will probably do more to help the fortunes of their Party than silence will.  I hope the House will vote for the motion. The money can be easily found.  It will be a debt of honour to old age pensioners to give them a sum of money which would give their pensions purchasing power no less than that which they had when the pension was given them by an alien Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with one remark of the last speaker, that no argument has been produced by the Minister in favour of this motion. There has been one, of course, which was taken out of the rather wandering statement he made, and was linked up with other arguments we heard in this House in the last fortnight.  The Minister said he was afraid that if the old age pension was increased to the point demanded you might not be able to get people to work.  To work at what?&mdash;at the wage which the Ministry propose to give them in the near future.  This certainly has to be related to the wages policy which has been prominently a feature of the Ministerial policy for years back.  We have been told in recent debates that the Ministerial view is that nobody ought to find in this country a life half as attractive as that of agriculture and that half the attraction of life in agriculture is to be measured by the £2 a week wage to the agricultural labourer.  The whole thing has to be taken in that setting and that framework and in that setting only is the policy understandable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two main points I want to question on this motion.  The first is this matter of the means test.  Since I began to think about this matter, I have never understood why there is a means test attached to this at all.  It must be on one basis and that is that <Col N="2280" /> the old age pension is not intended to be the only provision given to an aged person or aged couple to buy the necessities of life.  If it is only intended to be a supplement, then there should be no means test because the mere fact that you speak of it as a supplement means a supplement to something, something which that person or those persons have saved and put past and are enabled to draw in their old years.  So, if it is a supplement, there ought to be no means test.  We have a means test.  Therefore, we must take it that it is not a supplement and when we look at the combination of means test and the pension allowed, we get the Ministerial view of what is required in this country and what is sufficient in this country to enable a man to live after he reaches the age of 70&mdash;16/&mdash; and that 16/- is worth what 8/- was worth in 1939.</P>
    <P>When the present Minister for Local Government on one occasion was speaking about the bonus to civil servants, he pointed out that they had their salaries related by a cost-of-living bonus and one of the features he most strongly criticised in the make-up of the index figure to which that was related was that rent for a civil servant was accepted at the sum of 7/6 a week.  That was long before 1938; it was before 1932 when the purchasing power was better than it has been at any time since, when the cost of living was not so severe.  His great comment in those days was that dog kennels could not be purchased or leased in the city at 7/6 a week and yet civil servants were supposed to have their bonus measured by a figure the rent point of which was based on 7/6. Very good.  Supposing we think of dog kennels being purchasable or leasable nowadays at 7/6 a week and take that back to the 1938 figure, and the present purchasing power of the 16/-, it means that you think of a man with his dog kennel residence and 6d. over to buy food.  That is the Ministerial view of how a human creature is to subsist and to keep himself with the dignity that is supposed to attach to his human personality.</P>
    <P>The Minister's second comment on this motion has been that old age pensions <Col N="2281" /> ought to keep step by step with production.  Very good.  Let us take that test.  The Minister, thereafter, in the course of his remarks, attempts to frighten the people of this country by saying that the proposal here in its fullest form would mean an additional £12,000,000 in a year and wants to know where that can be got.  That money is already here.  If it was not here, if there was not the increase, not merely of £12,000,000, but of 12 times £12,000,000 purchasing power would not have lapsed.  It is because the Ministerial policy has let into this country a vast flood of money not accompanied by extra production in this country that we have got to the inflationary position we now stand in.</P>
    <P>The last Budget statement I listened to from the Minister's predecessor talked about national income and said that it had gone up from the figure in pre-war days to a figure he gave as representing last year's figure.  He said it was completely and entirely a monetary phenomenon.  What was the monetary phenomenon?  National income had risen from something in the nature of about £130,000,000 to something in the nature of £250,000,000.  It had gone up by £120,000,000.  More money had come into the country and, according to the definition given on the other side, which is accepted as the apt one, when you have a big amount of money chasing a small amount of goods, you will get inflation.  That is what the old age pensioner is suffering from, and all this motion demands is that of the £120,000,000 that is now floating around this country, which is merely a monetary phenomenon, the old age pensioner should be given his share.</P>
    <P>Suppose the motion is carried and implemented, as far as the sum of money is concerned, the old age pensioner has not improved his standards; he is living in the same way as he was enabled to live on a 10/- pension in the pre-war days.  It would, in fact, be a lower standard.  But, even accepted at that, the Minister says it is £12,000,000.  We have £12,000,000 and 12 times £12,000,000 in the country over and above what we had.  The trouble is, it is not evenly distributed, <Col N="2282" /> and it is because it is not evenly distributed, and because the old age pensioner has not got, and cannot get, his share of the extra money that this motion is called for.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about going step by step with production.  Remember, the present situation is not brought about mainly by any decrease in the volume of production in this country, although there has been that, but it is because there has been a vast increase in the amount of money that is at large in the hands of certain people to buy the smaller quantity of goods that is being produced.  When the old age pensioner with his 10/- goes to join in the hunt with the people who have a better enjoyment of the monetary phenomenon that the Ministry have brought about, then he finds that he cannot buy what he used to buy and asks now to be put back in the old position.  It is the sheerest and simplest justice that that should be done, but the Ministerial view is just as it is about wages: &ldquo;No, let us keep the wages closed and battened down; let us have the situation hereafter in which we will have a low wage policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We will be able possibly to get people here then to produce and possibly have an export trade that we never had before.  In the old days British elections were fought on what was called Chinese coolie wages.  We are aiming at having something of the same situation here and the Minister's satisfaction to-day at having kept wages battened down and having kept old age pensions battened down is all indicative of that frame of mind, that we are going to swing out into the post-war world with the amount that we have to give to the salaried and the employed classes lower relatively than it ever was before, and then, of course, if we can get goods produced cheaply at home we may get some chance to export and the producers will not get so much but the people who own the producers of the goods&mdash; the masters&mdash;will.</P>
    <P>The Minister then, afterwards, asks us are we going to assist in production? I have asked many times in this House for a policy that would lead to increased production.  I have heard <Col N="2283" /> that approached from many angles&mdash; harnessing up our credit resources, harnessing that to our unused human material and even to our unused other material, to try to get the conjunction between these three things in a country which, to everybody's knowledge, is undeveloped.  We have got very little response from the Ministry when we come to a policy about production. We have sometimes a response from the Minister when it comes to a policy about giving more free milk and a little bit more in the way of dole and something more in the way of free meals, because, if all those things can be passed through the Government machine and emerge as relief given by the Government, it is the old policy of Lenin&mdash;control the ration books of the proletariat and you control their votes&mdash;let it appear as Ministerial benefits and the Ministry must benefit in votes.</P>
    <P>Any policy leading to better production at higher rates of wages so that men may have more purchasing power in their hands and call for more goods has met as yet with no response from the Government.  What have we ahead of us?  As far as I can understand from Government spokesmen this country will be asked to contemplate the expenditure of £21,000,000 extra on a road policy.</P>

There is money for Rineanna, more public hospitals&mdash; £24,000,000 worth&mdash;something more in the way of public health institutions; public assistance institutions, £10,000,000; rural electrification at £23,000,000.

I have seen papers that are very unfriendly, not merely to New Zealand, but to the New Zealand type of government, saying that no country in the world enjoys higher standards than the New Zealanders do and, mind you, that is not in doles and old age pensions and that sort of reliefs, which are generally regarded as indicative of a low standard of living in the community, but it is in wages, in a good policy of production marked by a good wage policy.</P>
    <P>I think of that country held up as being bankrupt and owing money all over the world, while we are owed money.  New Zealand lives on selling goods of the type we produce in the market we are trying to clamber back into after the Minister tried to dislodge us from it.  New Zealand has to send these goods across a vast extent of ocean.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Chair will allow me another yard or two. One of the schemes they have is an old age pension scheme, as Deputy Flanagan pointed out, far better than this motion asks for.  They can afford to do that when they are in debt.  They are providing big wage schemes for their employees in productive industry and the fruits of that productive industry have to compete with us in a market which is nearer to us than to them and in which we have considerable advantages.  How do they do it? Certainly no Minister stands up and bleats about finding an extra £12,000,000.  They have Ministers there who have protected their community from the inflationary policy which has been allowed to develop here, with the result that they do not need, as we do, an increase in the old-time rates of pay or provisions for security of the old age type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2285" /> This motion is put down on grounds of the sheerest justice.  If, meagre and all as it was, we thought at one time that the standard of life for people who reach 70 years of age was to be measured by 10/-, the present-day equivalent of that would be what the motion asks for.  It would be really more, but we will be content with what the motion asks for.  In a world which is full of Christian ideals, there are comments everywhere about the dignity of the human person, the fact that he is made in a certain likeness and image and ought to have certain associations of a dignified character attaching to his human personality. When we think of the type of human creatures who are left to drift along under the conditions of the dog-kennel kind of house and the 1/6 or 2/6 to be spent on food thereafter, we ask the Minister to recognise that, owing to the Government's policy in connection with money, the purchasing power of the money we give these old people has lapsed considerably in value and he should restore it.  It is a matter of simple justice to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. Old age pensioners will be disappointed to find that the Minister has held out no hope to them except that under the new Ministry of Social Services something may be done for them at some time or another.  The necessity for an increase in the old age pensions has been proved by the Deputies who have spoken.  Members of public boards are well aware of the huge increase, amounting to 150 per cent. and 200 per cent. in some cases, in the cost of maintaining patients in hospitals and other institutions under their control. We have protested against the means test.  I can never understand why a wealthy person, a highly-paid official, or a prosperous businessman is allowed a deduction from his income-tax for the premium he pays to an insurance company to provide him with a large sum of money in order to give him comfort in his old age, while a poor man, who is in receipt of a couple of shillings a week from his children or from some insurance society or organisation, is deprived of the benefits that the State had intended at one time he <Col N="2286" /> should receive.  That shows the class distinction and the class treatment we have in this State at present.  We are not unmindful of the fact that family allowances and widows' and orphans' pensions are provided.</P>
      <P>The Minister expressed his sympathy to-day.  He admitted that, while the policy of the Government is to keep down wages, they have been unable to keep down the soaring prices of the necessaries of life.  To my mind, no person has a bigger grievance than the old age pensioner living in a rural area.</P>
      <P>Those of us who are connected with public boards have found that during the last two years the means test has been applied with a severity such as was not experienced in the previous 20 years.  A forestry worker who works until he is 70 years of age is refused an old age pension.  The wife of a road worker is refused an old age pension at 70 years of age on the ground that her husband is in constant employment and has over £52 a year.  Such cases as that, I am certain, came to the Minister's notice, and should have the sympathy of all sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not condemning investigation officers who are merely carrying out the law.  They are as human as any of us and have sympathy with these people, but they must administer the law as they find it.  Within the last two years some secret instructions must have been given to them, because, as I said, the means test is being applied with a severity such as had not been experienced in the previous 20 years. If we are to keep up with another country, we will have to take a good many steps to get into the position which they have reached.  I will not go into the question of the necessity for increased production.  The policy of the Government at present is preventing increased production.  They have a policy of low wages for agricultural labourers and road workers.  I am afraid that in the near future the Government and the people of this country will be awakened from their slumbers by a realisation of what may take place.  I hope the Government <Col N="2287" /> will change their outlook and prevent these things from happening.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with the Minister's statement.  We were expecting something more than that the old age pensioners should wait until the new Ministry of Social Services comes into operation.  We hope that they will not have to wait as long as that and that in the forthcoming Budget the Government may see their way to do something for them and realise that they have a just claim.  I am sure that even the Minister, although he is responsible for Finance, has as much sympathy as we have for the old age pensioners.  He is, however, more concerned now with the responsibilities of his office.  Deputy McGilligan has contrasted the position in this country and that in a neighbouring country and pointed out the benefits which are being provided there for all sections of the community, notwithstanding the fact that they are in debt to practically every other country in the world.  We are a creditor nation and other countries are looking up to us.  If we are a creditor nation, surely our first duty is to this most deserving section of the community.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision and, if he is not able to give an increased grant, to arrange, even before his Budget, to remove the means test.  I trust that Deputy O'Sullivan will be able to reply to the various points made.  I merely want to point out that the old age pensioners have our sympathy. But they want more than sympathy.  Our sympathy would be put to practical proof by the grant to the pensioners of the increase to which they have been entitled for a number of years.</P>

      <P>There is not much to which I have to reply, but I should like to acknowledge, on behalf of my colleagues, the generous measure of support given to this motion.  My only surprise was in <Col N="2288" /> the reply given by the Minister. I had hoped that, since he was acting for the first time in regard to this matter in his capacity as Minister for Finance, he would take the opportunity to break with convention and precedent and indicate that he was prepared to face up to a situation which is really serious in connection with one of our most important social services &mdash;old age pensions.</P>
      <P>Not the slightest trace of hope is to be found in any part of the Minister's reply.  In fact, it goes lower in the matter of assurance than statements we have had on previous occasions.  I quoted remarks from the Minister's predecessor and the Minister for Industry and Commerce which indicated, on previous occasions, at least, the relaxation of certain features of the means test so far as it related to voluntary pensions from industrial and commercial firms.  On that aspect of the question, the present Minister held out no hope this morning.</P>
      <P>I should like to correct the figure of £12,000,000 which the Minister gave.  I gave the figure of £12,500,000 as the cost of the motion which was before the House in 1944.  Additional to that would be the extra 2/6&mdash;from 20/- to 22/6, which would be not more than about £13,500,000, less the cost of existing pensions&mdash;about £4,000,000&mdash; so that the cost to be borne would be about £9,500,000.</P>

      <P>The only ray of hope, if it may be so described, in the Minister's statement was his reference to the Ministry of Social Services. Deputy Anthony endeavoured to get an amplification of that reference, but the Minister was quite shy about giving it.  Lest there should be any idea <Col N="2289" /> that something of a definite character will accrue from the Ministry of Social Services at an early date, may I point out that, when the Taoiseach indicated recently that a separate Ministry would be set up, he took the opportunity of warning the House that the probability was that no intrinsic increases, so far as the services were concerned, would take place, and that what was really contemplated was an amalgamation of the services to admit of better administrative machinery?  I place the Minister's statement against that of the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time is now ebbing.  We have done our best in this House to present the case of thousands of people who are in dire want and who have been in <Col N="2290" /> very sore need during the past four or five years.  I am afraid that the decision which the House will take will be interpreted by those people as one of indifference, so far as their present circumstances are concerned.  It will aggravate their position.  Their outlook on society in future will be soured and embittered and of a cynical character.  The means to aid them are available, but they will feel that this House, having the means, declined to do anything.  The decision which will, apparently, be taken will be a confession of absolute failure.  I am exceedingly sorry that that should be the effect of a motion of this character.</P>
