    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="806" /> SECTION 17.</P>
    <P>In page 7, at the end of the section, after line 20, the following sub-section added:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(2) In case the board in the performance of the duties referred to in paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) of this section, interferes, without complying with the provisions of Section 31 of this Act, with any land or any easement, wayleave, water-right or other right existing over or in respect of any land or water, the person having estates or interests therein, or the owner thereof, may maintain an action for damages against the board as if the board were not acting pursuant to a statute.</P>
    <P>The Turf Bill, as the House will remember, gives the board powers of compulsory acquisition of lands and power to interfere with rights subject to following a certain procedure and paying compensation to be determined by arbitration.  It was pointed out in the Seanad that the board might possibly interfere with some rights otherwise than in accordance with that procedure, inadvertently, as it were, or might take action which would interfere with some of these rights, the interference not becoming apparent for some years after the action was taken. An ordinary person so affected would have a right of action in the courts but a body acting under statute would not be liable for damages in such cases unless it could be shown that there was negligence or carelessness.  The effect of this amendment is to put the board in the same position as an ordinary person, to give a party whose rights are interfered with by the board the same right of action against the board as if the board were a private person not acting under the statute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little more I can say with reference to the chief matter that was debated on the Vote, that is, the question of the teachers' strike.  I do not know whether Deputies read what I said when I spoke here previously or whether they paid any attention to the comparisons I gave between the proposals in the Government offer and the scales that they were prepared to give and the 1920 scales and, furthermore, with the relative scales in the North of Ireland, for example.  The Minister for Finance has reduced the income tax here.  That affects the teachers as a body and the comparison, therefore, is still more appropriate because it brings home to those who had <Col N="808" /> not given sufficient attention to that aspect of the matter that the gross figures give quite a wrong impression of the situation.  Judging by the way the advertisements that were published by the Department of Education were criticised here, I can only feel that many of the teachers who voted for this strike realised the true position only when they saw the full picture placed before them.  I think the figures that I have given, showing the relative position at present here and elsewhere, if carefully examined, should help the teachers to realise that they have made a mistake and that, in the new circumstances, they ought to reconsider their whole position.  I think that if they do examine these figures it will have some effect in getting them to alter their attitude.  I have stated also, with regard to certain other matters, that the Government clearly explained its position. The Department of Education is at all times available for consultation with the teachers.  We do meet members of the teachers' organisation. The inspectors meet their representatives and I meet them, or the secretary meets them, where necessary, to discuss problems affecting them.  I mentioned already last night that I do not believe there is an artificial barrier or any artificial restriction upon the number of teachers, for example, who can secure the rating of highly efficient if their work deserves it.</P>
      <P>If there was such a restriction, I certainly would do everything I could to remove it, but I do not believe there was.  There has never been any instruction, or any advice of any kind, given so far as I have been able to establish to inspectors to limit themselves in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins mentioned the question of teacher-graduates.  It is preposterous to suggest that in a matter of this kind, where the Government's proposals would have increased the expenditure on the Primary Education Vote alone by £1,250,000, the few hundred pounds that would have meant a difference one way or the other between men and women graduates could have precipitated the strike.  If that is the position, I think that any trade unionist will agree that <Col N="809" /> the negotiations must have been very badly handled.  If the position was that I was dealing with the teachers' organisation officially on the basis of the proposal of £1,000,000 or £1,250,000, and that later on when the Government had made its final decision we were told that this was a very important question&mdash;the fact is that it has been mentioned here, and I have been told myself also that it has been responsible for a certain agitation being created among women and women graduates in particular&mdash;then, whatever feelings one may have about the effect of university education in that particular connection, one does not feel that the matter was handled reasonably or with commonsense. There was certainly no suggestion that there was any question of serious difference or that it was a matter for serious contention between the teachers and myself, and the same applies to the other questions.  The object of the teachers' organisation, obviously, was to spread whatever moneys they could get over the great bulk of their members. It takes very large sums of money to effect even appreciable improvements in that way.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last night, with regard to the Dublin teachers, what the position was.  If argument is made or if points are made about grading and so on, there is the one clear case, the outstanding point probably, the kernel of the situation so far as the teachers' strike is concerned, on which the Government deferred entirely to the official policy of the teachers' organisation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is no excuse for suggesting that the Government wanted to divide the teachers.  It is quite clear that if the Government had pursued its own wishes in the matter, the results might have been different. We were dealing with bodies which we thought represented the organisation as a whole and not with particular sections.  When the point arrives that particular sections of the organisation are going to make claims for themselves and are, apparently, not going to be guided by their own executive or to be controlled by it, then obviously we reach a position when there is no use in continuing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="810" /> Deputy McGilligan also seemed to suggest that this question of the strike had been&mdash;he did not say planned&mdash; decided upon, and had been made clear to the Government.  How could that be the position in view of the correspondence that I read last night, and in view of the fact that subsequent to that correspondence there was a congress of the National Teachers' Organisation where the question of a strike was defeated?  According to an official communication of the 11th February which I received from the General Secretary of the Teachers' Organisation, the following resolution was adopted at a special congress held on February 9th:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Congress rejects the Government's offer and directs the Executive to make further representations immediately to the Government with a view to improving the present offer as regards scales and date of operation, and that the official offer be submitted to a referendum of all the members of the Organisation in the Twenty-Six Counties, this referendum to be by secret ballot on the lines of the C.E.C. election.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think I am correct in stating that that resolution was carried as against an amendment for strike action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what was discussed.  Unfortunately, one position may have been represented to me and an entirely different position may have been represented outside.  When any person in my position is dealing with the representatives of an organisation he has to take it that they are dealing with him in a <i>bona fide</i> manner, that they have a responsibility to their organisation, and that what they say and what they believe will go.  We know that they cannot entirely control their organisation.  There was no question of a strike since the time the letter was written to me unreservedly withdrawing the threat of strike.  It may be said that it was only the words in the letter that were withdrawn.  If that is the position on which I was asked to <Col N="811" /> negotiate, that certain words were being withdrawn but that the threat of strike was not being withdrawn, then the position is certainly very peculiar.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Minister officially informed of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It appeared in the public Press.  We were led to believe that the question of a strike was dead. I do not know what happened afterwards. I think that Deputies who will take the trouble to read what I have said will see that there was no suggestion that we were not approaching the point when agreement was being reached.  I think that everyone concerned felt that.</P>
      <P>Now, with regard to other matters, Deputy Mulcahy referred to the question of the primary schools.  He says that the real weakness is in the primary schools.  We had the usual statements that the standard of education has deteriorated, that it is not as high as it used to be, and so on.  I have dealt with these matters in previous years.  These may be personal opinions, or they may be personal experiences, but if we are going to judge the question of the standard of education throughout the country as a whole we must take some broader or more general principle.  We have first the position that the primary schools of the country are under the control of the managers.  The control of the school and the control of the teacher is vested in the manager.</P>
      <P>I think that is a valuable safeguard, and I think that that position, described by one of our Irish Bishops as ideal or almost ideal, means that there is effective supervision both from the religious point of view as well as from the point of view of the community. Nobody has suggested that that ought to be altered.  In my opinion, it is of great value for the community, provided the system is worked properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> Then we have our teachers.  Our teachers now have the advantage of having a full secondary education before they proceed to training.  While educational experts will always have different opinions as to methods of training and similar questions, I think nobody will question that the standard of general education amongst the teachers who have come out of our colleges during the past 15 or 20 years is higher than it was before.  We have a staff of inspectors who are thoroughly acquainted with the work of the primary schools.  Most of them, as I mentioned last night, were themselves national teachers and it seems extraordinary that they should be criticised. I should imagine that nobody would understand the difficulties of teachers better than they.  If there is any suspicion that they are being driven by the Office or by the chief inspector to make unreasonable demands on the teacher, then I say that that is not so. The relations between the teachers and the inspectors are laid down in the regulations.  As I said last night, in case the teacher feels that he is being unjustly treated, he has a right of appeal to a body which consists of one inspector and one national teacher, with an independent chairman.  I think that that is a safeguard.</P>
    <P>If the statements made that there is a weakness in primary education be correct, it is surely inconsistent and at variance with the facts to suggest that no blame whatever can be attached to the teachers.  Whatever the programme may be, it is recognised by the inspectors and the rules that the teacher can only do his or her best in the circumstances of the ordinary, rural school. The standard, generally, in the area has to be taken into account by the inspector. Furthermore, all the difficulties operating against the teacher must be taken into consideration.  These matters are laid down in black and white.  We all know that teachers working in country schools, where there may be only a staff of two, cannot have the same advantages as teachers in large schools, where one teacher can be allocated whole time to each class, and it would be difficult to expect them to get the same results.</P>
    <P>With the inspection system, and <Col N="813" /> the system of appeal on the teachers' side, the public have also the advantage of the primary certificate examination. It is not an elaborate examination. It is a one-day examination on the three basic subjects&mdash;Irish, English and arithmetic.  I was most anxious that the teachers themselves should take over complete responsibility for that examination.  That was not found possible and I had to go ahead.  With the co-operation of the managers, some members of the teaching body, and the religious Orders, the results have been very satisfactory. Parents have the satisfaction of knowing that the primary certificate shows that their children's primary education has been successfully terminated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey referred to the question of extending secondary education. While we are anxious to extend education in every way possible, attention must be paid to the outlet for students.  Most students who take the secondary education course expect to proceed to the university.  At the same time that Deputy Mulcahy seems to claim that we should extend secondary education facilities much more than we are doing, the universities are reducing the numbers of their students. Deputies who complain of the export of trained men must reconcile themselves to the fact that the number of openings here for men is limited, except in well-defined categories such as teaching, medicine and engineering. Even in these three cases, we have an enormous surplus.  Through the work of the Christian Brothers and other Orders, students in modest circumstances have been able to get a good secondary education and to proceed, with the aid of the system of county council scholarships, to the university. Deputy Morrissey's own county is, I think, the county in which we have the largest number of secondary schools relative to population.  There are 23 secondary schools in Tipperary and 2,367 pupils from that county are receiving secondary education either in the county or outside it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not bring the rest of the country up, at least, to that standard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> The schools, which are under private management, are being extended. Many of them are chock full at present. As soon as materials are available, the authorities of the schools intend to go ahead with extensions.  At the same time, a number of new schools are being opened.  Most of the urban areas have both a male and female secondary school.  In that connection, the figures regarding post-primary education quoted by the Deputy will bear some correction.  Like other Deputies, he referred to the figure of 90 per cent. as representing those who receive no education other than that obtained in a national school.  According to the figures I have been able to obtain, of those between 14 years and 16 years, some 25 per cent. receive post-primary education either at secondary or vocational schools.  That would reduce the figure to 75 per cent., but it must be remembered that a number of pupils remain at the national school after the age of 14 years.  Unfortunately, when the School Attendance Act came into operation and it became legally incumbent upon parents to send their children to school between the ages of six years and 14 years, many of them &mdash;whether they were those who failed to send their children to school before the Act was passed or not, I do not know&mdash;conceived the idea that, immediately the age was reached at which legal compulsion did not apply, they should remove their children from school.  In spite of that, we know that post-primary classes are carried on in a number of the larger primary schools. We know that children are prepared for the intermediate examinations in certain cases, so that 20 per cent. more, according to the figures I have been able to collect, of those between 14 years and 16 years, are attending school after 14 years.  How long they are attending, we do not know.  We know, however, that they are over 14 years of age.  So that, between the two classes, at least 45 per cent. continue to receive some schooling after the age of 14 years.  There is, of course, a system of secondary scholarships.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey mentioned the question of books.  I know it is a very serious question.  The domain of secondary education is rather different <Col N="815" /> from that of primary education. Primary education is regarded as a public system, with the Government having a substantial measure of control. In the case of secondary schools the management, as I have said, is private. If the schools receive grants they are liable to inspection.  They send in pupils for examinations and we arrange for these examinations.  Outside that, the secondary schools are in a different position.  I take it the Deputy does not suggest that school books should be provided for all secondary school pupils?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but would the Minister agree with me when I say that quite a number of children of poor parents, parents who would desire that their children should continue at secondary schools, such as convent schools or Christian Brothers' schools in urban areas, are unable to go there because they are unable to afford to buy books?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the things schools do.  We have to bear in mind that the managers of secondary schools provide their schools without any assistance from the State and they contribute in various other ways. Generally, if a pupil is talented, and there are hopes that he or she may get a scholarship and go on for higher education, the school manages to give some aid.  I think most of us would prefer, if aid were being given, that it should be given by way of scholarship than by way of extension of the free school books scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not let us concentrate altogether on the geniuses. I have much more faith in the average pupil if he gets a fair chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The point, in any case, is that there is a strong feeling against the system of giving school books free except where there is evidence of great necessity.  As the Deputy knows, when the system is operated in the primary schools there is something in the nature of a test.  I do not know what the reaction of the secondary schools would be to the introduction of such a system in their case.  I fancy their natural <Col N="816" /> answer would probably be: &ldquo;Well, why not make further scholarships available?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Why not give us more money?  Increase our grants and we shall try to give better facilities where possible.&rdquo;  As I have said, the schools are increasing and are trying to increase the accommodation they are providing. It is a matter I should like to consider but I am not at all of the opinion that we lack suitable secondary school facilities as we stand.  Had it not been for the hold-up in transport and building during the war, of course the number of students would have increased very much more than it has done.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to fundamental questions of education and there was some reference to a Council of Education.  This matter was raised on a motion last year and I would refer Deputies to the debate on that motion. The Government is not opposed&mdash;quite the contrary, as the setting up of the commission showed&mdash;to the establishment of vocational organisation.  We should like to see vocational organisation but I would suggest to those farmer Deputies who apparently think that the recommendations of the commission referred only to education or primarily to education, that education really is a field where it is comparatively simple.  If one agrees that vocational organisation should be set up, the principle determining it is simple enough.  There are difficulties in working out representation and so on, but what was intended surely in setting up the commission, as I think the Taoiseach made clear, was that vocational organisation should be established for agriculture and for the larger occupations. The question was to fit in vocational organisation for education with the general scheme.  The Government has not had time to consider it and it is doubtful, until we get over the present transition period, if the problems that have to be dealt with now will allow us to go into the question. If we are going to fit vocational organisation for education into a general scheme of vocational organisation, we shall have to wait.  That is the Government's attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is contended that we should go ahead with it now and that there is <Col N="817" /> some opposition or some reluctance on the part of the Department, that at the back of our minds we dislike and object to inquiry, that we are not prepared to give information, to consult and take advice, that is not so.  I do not know if some of the Deputies who have taken upon themselves to criticise me in this matter have ever discussed the question with representative educationists outside, with those who have most authority, and asked them what their view was.  The question is, even if we did establish such a council, whether it would be generally welcomed or whether there would be any real demand for it.  An effort was made to set up such a council some years ago on a voluntary basis.  It failed, and it was not any action of the Government that prevented its establishment.  Deputies, therefore, ought to look at the history of the matter and consider what the attitude of the different interests concerned may be to it.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of the school-leaving age, that is not a matter that need be left to a council. It is a matter upon which we here ought to come to a decision.  I only regret that we have not been able to come to a decision on it before now, but I must plead in extenuation that we have a commission dealing with the question of unemployment, and that commission is dealing incidentally with, and I believe it will make a recommendation in regard to, the question of the school-leaving age.  We prefer to have the recommendations of the commission before us, to know what it has to say and on what lines it thinks the problem should be approached before making our arrangements.  We are doing what we can in the way of preparing teachers for vocational schools, and in the City of Dublin, the Dublin Vocational Education Committee, for example, is making preparations to go ahead as soon as possible with the extension of its schools.  It will try to provide further accommodation.  It has not accommodation at present for the ordinary students without reference to the burden that would be thrown upon it if the school-leaving age were raised from 14 to 16 or 14 to 15.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> Even Deputies who talk about this matter admit that its application in the rural areas is not at all easy.  We have a system of compulsory part-time education for pupils between 14 and 16 going on in Cork for some years.  Now it has been established in Limerick and we hope to see it established in Waterford.  I only regret that it has not been established also in Dublin because the trend of things elsewhere seems to be that, with the system of apprenticeship and with the advance in technical efficiency in industry, a close collaboration is required between the technical schools and the factory. Many experts in both industry and education who are interested in this problem feel that the ideal system would be that the apprentice should spend one whole day at least, or two half days per week at the technical school and the rest of the time at the factory following his apprenticeship.  I have referred to the scheme in operation here under the motor traders' auspices and under Córas Iompair Eireann and the Electricity Supply Board.  If we can extend these and if the trade unions&mdash;I am glad to say they have always shown a great interest in this matter of apprenticeship training&mdash;and the employers can be got to come together and to use the facilities available in the schools, as the organisations I have mentioned are using them, we ought to be able to get the best of our vocational students into industry and, at the same time, we ought to be able to provide industry with apprentices and with learners who will have received a good grounding in education that will be suitable to their future occupation and increase their efficiency.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the condition of rural schools.  The emergency, of course, has held up building very much. We have been pressing the managers, and I should still like to press them, to do everything possible to complete the preliminaries.  The manager is responsible for the erection of the school.  The Government regards as fundamental in this question of school building that the parish should make an appropriate local contribution.  It is true that in very necessitous circumstances we are prepared to give an <Col N="819" /> extra grant; but, here again, the total amount of money available is limited. We are not prepared to give a necessitous grant in every case. We think that in the ordinary urban areas and in the better-off parishes and the better-off parts of the country where agriculture is fairly prosperous the parish ought to be able to put up a decent local contribution.  The contribution that should be put up is one-third of the cost.  One-third is not put up of course; very often it is one-sixth. That means that a certain number of cases have to be postponed or have to go without.  The State is not prepared to accept the position in all these cases that we must take something less than the official rate of contribution.  I quite understand that costs have gone up and I would like to meet managers.  Where managers are energetic and want to do work, like the managers in Co.  Meath to whom Deputy O'Reilly referred, and all praise to them, it is my duty to cooperate with them.  It is their duty and responsibility to provide proper, sanitary schools.  It is their duty to take all the preliminary steps.  Our county medical officers of health have high standards.  Some of them would like to see the most modern methods of sanitation and water supply.  That is not always possible.  But we ought to work towards the position that a water supply would be provided in every new school.</P>

      <P>When a new school is being built, or the manager of an old school makes a requisition where a water supply is available, if the county manager is prepared to bring the water to the school, and I think in the interest of public health and the amenities of the district the county manager ought to be prepared to do that, I can promise the Deputy that we will do our share.  I do not think it would be fair to expect the Department <Col N="820" /> in isolated areas where there is no proper water supply to place the whole cost upon the State.  As I have explained, we are asking the manager to do his share, which sometimes is heavy enough.  I think we ought to expect the local public health authorities, if the water is available, to do their share, and that has been done in cases that I know of.  If the Deputy has particular schools in mind, I would be glad if he would let me know of them.</P>

      <P>That is not meeting the point.  If the Deputy has particular cases in mind, I would be glad if he would mention them to me.  But, in the case of the building of a new school, we ought to make every effort to deal with that matter.  I come across cases like the case Deputy Moran mentioned.  The Deputy&mdash;he is not here to-day&mdash;is in a great hurry about this school in County Mayo.  The case commenced in 1928.  A grant for the new school was applied for in 1935. The grant has been sanctioned. Evidence of title has only just been furnished.  I think that not all the delay, at any rate, is attributable to me or to my officials.  There has to be correspondence in regard to these matters.  The Department entrusted with the arrangements for the buildings is the Board of Works.  The first thing that happens is that the manager is asked to provide a site.  The Board of Works inspector has to see that site and has to be satisfied with it. The manager may know more about building than I do.  Nevertheless, the advice of the trained engineers and architects of the Board of Works must be taken.  When we are building schools we are building them for a generation or two, and we ought to build them on the best sites, with the best aspect, and the best facilities we can provide.  The manager's contribution is the first money to be spent. He has to provide the surrounding wall and then the building goes ahead. As I have said, if managers are progressive, if they want to replace these 400 or 500 old schools which ought to be <Col N="821" /> replaced without delay, they will get every assistance in the way of advice and consultation both from the officers of the Board of Works and the inspectors and other officers of the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear again that the responsibility devolves on the managers to provide the schools and it is their duty also to see that while the schools are in occupation they are properly maintained and that repairs are carried out to them.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, like most Nationalists who come from Ulster territory, is keenly interested in the revival of our national language and I am grateful to him for making sufficient monies available to bring the existing grant for Irish-speaking children in the Gaeltacht areas up to £5.  The grant will be made available this year to pupils who have been receiving the £2 grant in the ordinary way; but it will take some little time before it can be made available to pupils attending vocational or other schools than national schools.  The rules will have to be amended and, while we will send out word to the inspectors as soon as possible, I do not know whether we will be able to pay the £5 in the present session to pupils other than those who would receive the £2 under the existing regulations. We may take the opportunity to amend the scheme in other particulars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is interested in seeing that the language is preserved in its native home.  Everything in the modern world is operating against the language and, while it may sound extraordinary that we should pay people to speak their own national language, we have to put ourselves in their position.  They see that English is the language of wealth, of advancement and prosperity in the country.  If they have to leave the country, they see that they have to know English. Even in the public examinations, although everything possible has been done by the Government to emphasise the importance of Irish, it would be extremely difficult for a native Irish speaker, who had not a good knowledge of English, to secure a position. All these things and the effect of transport <Col N="822" /> and travel, of pictures and of the daily newspaper&mdash;which now goes into every home&mdash;are operating against Irish.  Therefore, it is the Government's duty to encourage those who speak Irish as their natural and native tongue to continue to do so.</P>
    <P>I would ask the co-operation of Deputies of all Parties in achieving that aim and in extending the use of Irish into the Breac-Ghaeltacht areas, those areas where the language has died out in our time.  Those persons of middle age are, unfortunately, in the position that they have the least knowledge of the language.  The older people may have some and the younger people growing up should have a good knowledge of it.  If we can get the middle-aged parents in the Breac-Ghaeltacht interested in this matter and if we can make them see, as Deputy Cafferky put it, that it is an honour and a privilege to speak the language of one's country and that, if we lose it, nothing else can replace it, that they are in the fortunate position of being able to do more than most to maintain Irish, then we shall be helping to extend Irish.  The grant which the Minister for Finance has made available will do its part also.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear Deputy Corish and I congratulate him.  I had known that he was interested in Irish and I hope that the younger Deputies who come into this House and who ultimately will replace us all, will take an interest in this matter.  We do not ask them to subscribe to any narrow views or to any particular view, but we ask them to do their share, as leaders of future opinion, as men who will have important responsibilities, to see that the struggle to keep our native language alive and the struggle to extend it outwards from the schools into the public life and social life of the country will not fail.  The present generation can claim that they had not the advantages.  As I have said, those of middle are at the present time were possibly in the worst position of all those who have gone before us, but there is not the same excuse for the younger generation.  I was very glad to hear Deputy Corish. It has given me encouragement to <Col N="823" /> know that the younger men like him understand the position.  If we can approach this problem through the different organisations and if we can give them any aid, we will be very glad to do so.</P>
    <P>I think aid has already been given towards the Coisde na bPáiste scheme for sending children to the Gaeltacht areas.  As the Deputy pointed out, there is no reason why we cannot establish, in the English-speaking areas, camps and schools&mdash;and summer schools, particularly&mdash;for our younger people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to the defects in the Davis film.  I am sure that the film has defects&mdash;few films have not.  If the particular defect to which he refers is the sound, the position is that it was determined to make this film after the Thomas Davis celebrations last year and as soon as possible. There was no sound apparatus available in this country and to bring it across here would have increased the cost of the picture by 50 per cent. Owing to the cost and the urgency of the matter, the sound had to be added in London.  Therefore, I think there is a good excuse if it is not of as high a standard as the rest of the picture. According to the Press critics, it is a good picture.  I have not seen it in one of the picture-houses, but I saw it before it was publicly shown and before the sound was added, and it seemed to me to be good.  In any case, it is not a picture made by the Department of Education.  It was made under the auspices of the Irish Film Institute and it cost less than £4,000.  It is not a full-length picture.</P>
    <P>If we are to go in for picture making, including educational films, we will have to bear in mind that they will have to bear short pictures, such as documentary films.  If they are going to be shown publicly and go in with the ordinary commercial programme, they will have to be short.  We forget that the number of pictures coming from Hollywood which particularly appeal to us or have some religious note or some motif that seems to agree with our own is very small indeed, and they probably would not be regarded <Col N="824" /> as box office draws by any means.  The Government is looking into the whole question of the film industry, but obviously to go into it on the scale that some people contemplate, as a serious competitor in the film world with the magnates of Hollywood, would take millions.  At the same time, we can do a certain amount, we can make a beginning with pictures like &ldquo;A Nation Once Again&rdquo; and also we can go in for the 18 mm films.  We can provide apparatus for having films of an instructive character shown throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I was greatly impressed at the Spring Show by the pictures shown in the Department of Agriculture Hall, dealing with Clean Milk and Bovine Tuberculosis.  There is no doubt whatever but that pictures like these, shown to farmers, will make an impression on them.  It is not sufficient to tell people how things should be done.  It certainly is very valuable that they should get the visual aid.  I do not agree entirely that we can employ educational films generally, but there are particular matters in technical education and in agricultural education where they may be of value and the Film Institute is building up a library for schools in that way.  In the same way, I hope libraries of instructional films in agricultural and industrial matters will also be procured.</P>

      <P>May I ask the indulgence of the House with regard to a point of personal correction?  Last night I used the figure of 59,000 as representing the number of children absent from school.  In his reply the Minister referred to other figures, which showed a big discrepancy.  I learned subsequently that the figure I used was incorrectly computed and this morning I was given correct figures. From these it appears that there are 16,909 children absent from 102 schools actually open, and 32,000 children absent from 124 schools closed.  The total should be 49,000 and not 59,000.</P>

The number of pupils over 14 years attending primary schools in Dublin on 30 June, 1944, was 2,814&mdash;1,152 boys and 1,662 girls.  With regard to the matter raised by Deputy McCarthy, I shall look into that.  I think we have been in touch with the conductors of the school at Garryvoe.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £3,257,700 be granted to complete the <Col N="830" /> sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st day of March, 1947, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office and payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>As the House will remember, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Supplies were amalgamated last year.  The amalgamation of the two Departments occasioned considerable reorganisation of staffs and it is not possible, therefore, to make a clear comparison between the staff of the Department of Industry and Commerce this year with previous years.  Some economy of staff was achieved by the amalgamation, but the expansion of activities in other sections, and the acquisition of new functions by the Department, made it difficult to show these economies on the face of the Estimate. The total estimated cost of staff in the current year is £430,221 as compared with £396,536 for the combined staffs of the two Departments in the previous year.  There are, I think, no other changes under sub-head A of the Estimate worthy of special mention, except perhaps an increase in the cost of the statistic service in the current year, due to the taking of the census.</P>
    <P>The only substantial change arising under other sub-heads of the Estimate on which it is necessary to comment at this stage is in connection with food subsidies.  The Estimate for food subsidies this year shows a decrease of £715,000.  That substantial drop in the Estimate for food subsidies is due entirely to the reduced cost of the flour subsidy.  The reduced cost of the flour subsidy is attributable to the reduction of freight charges on the North Atlantic route, and the cessation of the purchase of Plate wheat.</P>
    <P>During the past year the war ended and the prospect developed of a return to more normal conditions of trade and industry, and consequently the work of the Department took a wider range. During the war it was forced to deal <Col N="831" /> mainly, if not solely, with the immediate problems that arose from day to day, and my statements on the annual Estimates in recent years were largely confined to a review of the position in regard to supplies, actual and prospective, of various essential commodities, our main concern then being to get the nation through the crisis without undue hardship.  Now that the difficulties of the crisis are diminishing, we can afford time for the problem of future economic development, and I am sure that it is with that aspect of the Department's work during this year that the Dáil will expect me to deal to-day.  I am personally convinced that this year and next year will be a critical period in our economic history.  I have said so at other times and in other places.  I believe that in the near future we will have an exceptionally favourable opportunity of industrial expansion, and it has been always my conviction, that it is through the development of manufacturing industry in the main that this country will be able to end unemployment, to find the resources required to raise the general standard of living, and to achieve what is called social security.</P>
    <P>It may be that international developments in political, financial or economic spheres will raise fresh impediments to our progress, but assuming a slow but uninterrupted return to stable international conditions, we have, I believe, a better opportunity now than ever before of permanently raising the volume and the efficiency of industrial production, and thereby increasing the number and scope of employment opportunities open to our population.  I do not believe, however, that the extent to which we, as a nation, will use or misuse our opportunity will depend solely on what the Government may or may not do.  It will depend also upon the enterprise and the realism with which the occasion is faced by the leaders of industry and, in equal degree, by the leaders of labour.  The legislation enacted by the Dáil and the administrative work of the Department of Industry and Commerce can merely <Col N="832" /> help to create favourable conditions in which the initiative and the enterprise of individuals can bear fruit. Unless the desire to make progress is backed by the will to achieve it, as expressed through the various organisations which are concerned with economic affairs, we will not get very far.</P>
    <P>In giving here a review of our present position and our future prospects of the administrative work upon which the Department of Industry and Commerce is engaged, and of the legislation which is in contemplation, I would like to ask the Dáil to consider it in the light of the circumstances which I have mentioned, and, particularly, to bear in mind that these are not the circumstances of the war years or of the pre-war years.  They are new circumstances which we must approach with fresh and unprejudiced minds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be common ground amongst us I think that the test of the efficacy of any economic policy is the contribution it makes to the ending of unemployment and the abolition of undeserved poverty.  In the pre-war years we endeavoured to raise the level of industrial employment by forcing industrial expansion through protection, by subsidising housing, and by organising public works.  However, the general circumstances then were not favourable.  The world-wide trade depression, and the economic war, had reduced the prices of many agricultural products to uneconomic levels and, in consequence, restricted the home market for industrial goods, which is largely determined by the prosperity of agriculture. Fierce international rivalry for export markets resulted in the subsidising of industrial exports to this country, to the dumping of surplus products here at uneconomic prices, to competitive currency depreciations, and other practices which brought the prices of foreign goods delivered here below the cost of economic production and, incidentally, established unfair <Col N="833" /> standards of efficiency upon which Irish manufacturing industry was judged and criticised.  Clearly the measures which were taken then to deal with that situation are not necessary now.  Clearly, also, the prospects of industrial expansion are greater than they were.  The improved conditions in agriculture mean an expanding internal market and the international trade situation improves the prospects of developing export business. We can hope now to promote the growth of industry by means less drastic than pre-war conditions called for and one cause of pre-war political contentions is thereby removed.</P>
      <P>I must make it clear, however, that it is the policy of the Government to continue to afford protection to industry, where protection is necessary to assist new industries during the early stages of their development, or to offset exceptional factors affecting production costs here and not within the control of the industry concerned, or where considerations of national security require the preservation or the encouragement of particular industrial processes, or where unfair trading methods, such as dumping, export subsidies, or similar practices, are resorted to by exporters in other countries to retain their market in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Government's view the power to impose new customs duties, or other protective measures should in the first instance rest with it, subject to the power of the Dáil to confirm, or to refuse to confirm, the Government Orders within reasonable time.  Our circumstances do not permit of a prolonged public examination of the case for protection in any instance before bringing it into effect.  The limited size of our market and our proximity to great industrial states, not merely facilitates forestalling but creates the danger that forestalling on any scale will restrict the possibilities of developing manufacture here for a long time. The Government thinks, however, that investigation of the need to maintain customs duties at particular levels, or of the effect of the duties on the promotion of industry, should be periodically <Col N="834" /> made.  Under the provisions of the British trade agreement made in 1938, such reviews were undertaken by the Prices Commission on the initiative of British trading interests.  We would, however, consider the establishment of the machinery for and the practice of such reviews as desirable in any case, not merely for the purpose of adjusting the levels of customs duties but also with a view to applying other inducements to maximum efficiency. The Government has in mind the revision of the powers of the Prices Commission so as to relate them more directly to the efficiency of production methods in their relation to prices rather than to profits taken by traders and manufacturers.  The amending Bill will, I hope, be ready this year.</P>
    <P>It will also be the policy of the Government to assist and encourage the development of export business in industrial as well as in agricultural goods.  In many industries there is no physical reason why production cannot be organised as efficiently here as elsewhere and substantial industrial exports are practicable even when the present transitory period of world shortages has passed.  Certain proposals for legislation, designed to assist the development of industrial export business, have been approved by the Government and are now being framed in a Bill which I hope to introduce this year.  It is, of course, clear that the development of industrial exports cannot be achieved on an adequate scale until new machinery can be purchased and installed and supplies of raw materials and fuels become more plentiful.  It has nevertheless been decided to relax the restrictions on the export of certain classes of goods.  The restrictions on the export of some categories of woollen piece goods have already been modified so as to enable trade contacts to be built up abroad, and that policy will be extended to other commodities, as conditions gradually improve.  Other manufacturers have also been allowed to undertake export orders but only on the basis that all the extra materials required are specially imported.</P>
    <P>A very large number of proposals <Col N="835" /> for new industries has been received in recent months, covering a wide range of products, although it may be assumed that not all of them will ultimately come to fruition.  It is of particular interest to observe that many of them are planning on a scale which pre-supposes ability to obtain external markets and will not require any form of protection in the home market except against the possibility of dumping.</P>
    <P>It is not practicable, particularly in view of export possibilities, to translate the potentialities of future industrial expansion into terms of new jobs. The number of persons employed in protected industries, which nowadays is merely a classification for statistical purposes, as most tariffs are suspended, was 76,000 in September, 1945, which was an increase of 4,000 over September, 1944, but a decrease of 6,500 on the peak figure, which was reached in March, 1940.  The number of persons employed in protected industries in March, 1940, was higher than it had ever been before or has been since. Employment in industries, which are classified as protected industries, is about one-half of the total employment given in industrial concerns.  Increased industrial production with modern methods and machinery does not necessarily mean a proportionate increase in the number employed, but it would not be unduly optimistic, I think, to assume that a 50 per cent. increase in industrial employment is capable of being achieved in favourable circumstances. Taking the usual calculation of economists, that for every two additional persons employed in production, one further person will be employed in a non-productive occupation, it would seem that such an increase as I have mentioned would provide enough jobs to cancel the unemployment revealed by the present live register.  That would, however, not be a safe assumption, because experience has shown that there is a large pool of available labour amongst persons employed on their own account, farmers' relatives, persons not fully occupied on the land or in their existing occupations, the size of which <Col N="836" /> it is impossible to determine and from which would come some part of the labour force of new industrial enterprise.</P>
    <P>The Dáil has full information concerning the employment and unemployment situation from the admirable reports which are published annually by the Departmental Committee.  The report for 1945 is now being printed and will be available shortly.  These reports give a fuller analysis of the position in this country than any other Government publication, so far as I am aware. The Government began the preparation of these reports in the belief that the systematic publication of full information concerning our unemployment problem would help to secure a realistic and constructive approach to it in all quarters.  That hope may not have been fully realised but it cannot be contended that there has been any disposition to prevent appreciation of the full extent of the problem we have to face.</P>
    <P>During 1945 there was on average only a very slight change in the live register as compared with 1944.  The number of men was slightly higher, the number of women and boys less.  The increased registration of men was, however, not due to decreased employment.  As compared with 1944 the estimated number of persons employed in each week on the average in occupations insurable under the National Health Insurance Acts was 11,100 higher, being an increase of 6,500 males and 4,600 females.  That increased employment was due entirely to increased employment in occupations which were also insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, the estimated number of persons employed each week on the average in occupations so insurable being 11,600 higher than in 1944.  For the first quarter of 1946 sales of unemployment insurance stamps amounted to £237,000, as compared with £220,000 in 1945, the actual increase being £16,569, representing an average increase of approximately 17,000 contributions per week and increased employment in insurable occupations on that scale. The number of contributions paid during the first quarter of 1946 under the wet-time insurance scheme for the <Col N="837" /> building trade was a weekly average of 15,128 as compared with 11,770 in the corresponding quarter of 1945, an increase of over 3,000.  That indicates that about 3,000 more workers were employed in building work during the first quarter of this year than in the corresponding period of last year. Although industrial conditions are still difficult, the available statistics relating to employment show that the movement is in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Reference to employment and unemployment brings in the matter of emigration.  During 1945 20,338 workers, excluding seasonal agricultural workers who numbered about 3,000, went to Great Britain on permits for the purpose of taking employment there. There was also, however, during 1945, a very considerable movement in the opposite direction, a movement of workers back from Great Britain to this country, and in last year the number of outgoing passengers exceeded the number of incoming passengers by only 2,300.</P>

      <P>No.  The only available statistics relate to the total number of passengers travelling out and in.  As a necessary corollary to the figures I have given, I may mention that during 1945 there was a net increase in our total population of 21,400.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if this check is applied on the basis of workers going out as against Irish workers coming back, and not visitors coming back?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no differentiation as between the classes of persons coming back.  The statement I made in that regard is based upon general information rather than statistical knowledge.  The general effect of the emergency upon employment in industry was on the whole much less severe than I had at one time feared. That was due to a variety of causes <Col N="838" /> but I think it can be mainly attributed to the good relations which, taking industry as a whole, existed between employers and employees and to the co-operation, in minimising the effect of emergency conditions on employment, between trade unions and employers' organisations.  It may be that the period of adjustment to new circumstances will be marked by industrial disturbances here, as it has been in other countries, and that the country's economic expansion will thereby be impeded.  In the hope that some more effective means of adjusting industrial differences, without stoppages of work, might be found by the combined efforts of all concerned, I have had discussions extending over a considerable time with employers' and workers organisations and I think I can say that these discussions have revealed a general desire for a constructive and commonsense approach to that problem.</P>
      <P>As an outcome of these discussions, I shall have certain legislative proposals to bring forward for consideration by the Dáil next month.  I wish to say nothing more at present in that connection, as the matter will be before the House again soon, except that the proposals will relate to machinery for the avoidance and settlement of trade disputes, that they will be framed on the basis of the voluntary acceptance of that machinery by the parties using it, without any element of compulsion, and that when they are before the Dáil I will welcome the fullest help from Deputies in making it both workable and acceptable.  I will also ask the Dáil to expedite its passage because it is intended that, when the new measure comes in force, the Standstill Order will be repealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Standstill Order, I think I can say that not even the strongest opponent of it in principle will contend that it has not had beneficial effects for some workers. Although it limited the amounts by which remuneration could be increased during the emergency, it helped to establish the principle of a standard wage and facilitated the enforcement of a standard wage in a number of occupations.  These Standard Rate <Col N="839" /> Orders provide a recognised and accepted basis of remuneration in the occupations to which they relate which will facilitate future wage negotiations, although so complicated were the practices in some trades that, in no less than 540 cases, it had to be deemed impracticable or inappropriate to make Standard Rate Orders.  Altogether, 1,374 Standard Rate Orders were made, and 3,816 Bonus Orders.  Of the Bonus Orders, approximately 75 per cent. were made on the agreed application of employers and workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say the number of people who were affected by both?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be impossible to arrive at that figure.  I endeavoured to make some calculation, but had to give it up as impracticable.  One noteworthy fact revealed by the operation of the Orders was the number of workers in various parts of the country who are not yet organised in trade unions, and, consequently, not able to negotiate effectively with their employers, and for whom the making of Bonus Orders generally resulted in increases which they would not otherwise have secured.  One of the matters we will have to consider when the new proposals for legislation are before us is the position of such workers when their wages are no longer supported by the moral force of a Government Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be foolish to assert that the dangers of uncontrolled inflation, which the Standstill Order and other measures were designed to prevent, have passed.  The recent price increases affecting many commodities in Great Britain is a warning to the contrary. It is well to remember also that it was during the three years after the first world war that inflationary forces were most active.  If the Government has decided that emergency measures can, in the near future, be modified or removed, it is because it believes it wiser to rely on the understanding and good sense of the people in present circumstances when future trends and dangers can be foreseen with some degree of certainty rather than on restrictive <Col N="840" /> measures which were deemed necessary to counter the unforeseeable dangers of the war years.</P>
    <P>The Estimate contains a provision for a contribution to the International Labour Organisation.  A full delegation was represented at the International Labour Organisation Conference in Paris last year where the main business was related to changes in the constitution of the International Labour Organisation consequent on the then pending disappearance of the League of Nations.  A special conference will be held next month in Seattle to draw up conventions relating to employment on ships.  A full Irish delegation will attend, and will co-operate in framing an international charter for seamen which, subject to the examination of the final draft, it is our intention to implement by domestic legislation in due course.  The ordinary annual International Labour Office Conference will be held later in the year at Montreal.</P>
    <P>Apart from the development of industry, the most likely prospect of increasing non-agricultural employment is the expansion of the building and construction industries.  The House is aware that Government responsibilities in relation to housing are discharged by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and for public works by the Office of Public Works.  The Department of Industry and Commerce has, however, been given the general responsibility of getting building activities of all kinds regulated and stimulated in the immediate post-war period.  In view of the scarcity of materials, and for the purpose of ensuring the best and the fullest use of the available resources of the building industry, all building works over a certain value, works costing more than £500 or involving the use of materials costing more than £250, require to be licensed.  On the 30th April the number of licences which had been issued since the 1st July, 1945, the date upon which the Order came into force, was 1,607, authorising work of a total value of £7,720,000.  The main divisions of that total are: local authority housing, £1,385,000; private enterprise housing, <Col N="841" /> £1,939,000; industries&mdash;new factories and factory extensions&mdash;£996,000; schools and colleges, £467,000; shops, £358,000; hospitals, £266,000; repairs and maintenance works coming under the licensing provision, £599,000; the balance was spread over churches, offices, warehouses, recreational buildings, public buildings and the like.  The pre-war annual output of our building industry was valued at £6,000,000. Even making full allowance for increased costs, it is satisfactory that, despite supply difficulties, building activities have been resumed on so large a scale already.  The main building material in short supply is timber &mdash;that is, the soft-wood timber, as used in building.  The position in regard to hard woods is relatively easy.  The minimum amount of timber required by the building industry is estimated at 15,000 Petrograd standards and, to meet the building programme, even that figure requires the enforcement of rigid economies in the use of timber. Our pre-war imports of building timber were 70,000 standards per year.</P>

A buying commission went to Canada recently from Timber Importers, Limited, and it seems reasonable to expect that a quantity of 5,000 standards will be received from that country this year. Further supplies from the Baltic are also possible and, of course, some supplies of native timber will be available.</P>

At the present rate <Col N="842" /> of clearance, the home supply of matured soft-wood timber will be soon exhausted.  On the basis of eliminating timber and substituting other materials, where practicable, it should be possible to maintain, and, perhaps, even to extend, building activities during the year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It includes the Irish supplies, supplies already in stock, the supplies from the Baltic countries and the timber from Canada.  The Department of Industry and Commerce is carrying out its building responsibilities with the advice of various committees, one of which has been established for each important aspect of the problem.  Apart from the central council for the industry, there are five such committees&mdash;the Committee of Builders' Providers, the Committee of Building Contractors, the Advisory Committee on Labour, the Committee of Manufacturers of Building Materials and the Advisory Committee on Timber. Up to the present, building work has not been held up by reason of a shortage of skilled workers but a substantial increase in the amount of building work undertaken would create a problem in that regard.  One of the most disturbing factors which has engaged the attention of the Advisory Committee on Labour is that statistics show that the number of apprentices who are joining the different trades is not sufficient to keep the strength of those trades even at their present level.  On the basis of five years' apprenticeship, and assuming the average life of a journeyman to be 25 years, <Col N="843" /> the ratio of apprentices to journeymen should be one in five or at least, one in six.  Except, perhaps, in the case of plumbers, there is no building craft with that ratio now, the proportion varying from one in nine for carpenters, one in 12 for bricklayers, one in 13 for plasterers, one in 15 for painters to one in 26 for masons.  The Advisory Committee is at present considering that matter and I hope, from its discussions, will emerge a new system of apprenticeship which will ensure that the building industry will have at its disposal sufficient skilled men to enable a high, stable measure of activity to be maintained.</P>
      <P>I must refer also to the Building Research Committee.  That committee has prepared leaflets which have been printed and circulated on economy in the use of timber and the use of Irish timber.  It has also prepared standard specifications for timber, concrete roofing tiles and cement.  It is preparing similar standard specifications for concrete pipes, natural aggregates, interlocking roof tiles, building lines and certain electrical installation materials.  In that connection, I may mention again the legislation for the establishment of an Institute of Industrial Research and Standards which is being prepared and will, I hope, be introduced next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate includes provision for advances to Mianraí, Teoranta, the company established to discharge certain responsibilities in connection with mineral development.  Mianraí, Teoranta, confined its activities during the present year to coal production in Slievardagh, phosphate extraction in County Clare and pyrites production in County Wicklow.  Coal production at Slievardagh has been stepped up to 380 tons per week, which is probably the maximum obtainable from the present workings.  The company is, however, conducting boring operations with a view to locating suitable sites for future development.  The quantity of phosphate rock produced in 1945 was 20,000 tons.  In the present year, 5,000 tons will be supplied to fertiliser manufacturers up to the end of June. The fertiliser manufacturers will take <Col N="844" /> a further 10,000 tons this year for use in connection with next season's fertiliser supply.</P>

      <P>The difficulty in answering that question is to decide what constitutes our full requirements. On the basis of pre-war uses, the answer to the question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The present demand for superphosphate fertiliser is, of course, limited by its price and I think I can say that the supply will be equal to the demand.  It is to be assumed, however, that the demand will expand with reductions in price.</P>

      <P>Phosphate rock can be obtained in County Clare either by quarrying or mining.  The quantities that can be obtained by quarrying are practically exhausted and future supplies from Clare would have to be won by mining which is a more expensive operation.  The total quantities of rock available in Clare do not appear to be very large, so far as the investigations of the Geological Survey reveal. The fertiliser manufacturers dislike using it because they regard it as harmful to their machinery.  It is a low grade rock and their plant and equipment were designed to use the <Col N="845" /> higher grade rock available from North Africa.  Apart from considerations of a practical nature of that kind, there is a further consideration which I think is worth keeping in mind.  In so far as the total supply under the ground is very limited, it is questionable whether it is wise to exhaust it now, having regard to the availability of phosphate rock from abroad and knowing that, when exhausted, the native rock can never be replaced in a million years and that the situation with which we were faced during the emergency may arise again.  It is considered, in addition to these practical considerations, that there are other considerations which would justify leaving unworked some supplies of phosphate rock which would be available and could be developed in any future emergency when supplies from abroad could not be obtained.</P>
      <P>The production of lump pyrites in County Wicklow by the hand-picking process yielded 2,500 tons between March and December of 1945.  That method of production has now ceased. The company will in future concentrate on development by a flotation process and a small flotation plant has been installed.</P>
      <P>The future of Mianrai Teoranta will come up for consideration in a very definite way in the near future.  Its activities in the winning of coal, phosphate rock and pyrites had naturally to be kept going almost regardless of cost during the war.  It is not intended that it should engage in any form of production as a normal activity unless it is economic or likely to become so.  Expert advice has been obtained on the Wicklow mineral area which the company is working and the experts' reports are now being considered. If it should be decided to approve of a concrete scheme for the development of these deposits, a supplementary estimate will be submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will understand that it is not possible in any reasonable time to make even the briefest reference to many of the activities of the Department and I have chosen for comment, at this stage of the debate, matters in which I thought the House would be <Col N="846" /> most interested.  It is desirable, however, to give some brief review of the supply position in regard to essential commodities.  The House is aware that the Combined Food Board, which is an international organisation which sits at Washington and which controls, with the agreement of exporting countries, the available export supplies of a number of commodities, has increased the allocation of tea to this country for the current season to 75 per cent. of pre-war supplies.  That permits a domestic ration of 1½ ounces per week which will become operative on the 1st June.  On the other hand, a temporary difficulty in obtaining shipping for supplies of vegetable oils which have been purchased and are awaiting shipment at Mozambique and Brazil has resulted in the suspension of margarine manufacture. The butter ration, on the present basis, is however secure despite allocations to European relief. An increase for some months next winter may be possible if production is maintained at or above last year's level.  The sugar position is safe, and if production this year equals that of last year and no further relief shipments are necessary, an increase in the ration next year will be practicable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Are any imports anticipated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We have not sought to obtain imports of sugar, having regard to our relatively good position as compared with other countries.  The wheat position is, however, very thin. I hope it will be possible for the Cereals Committee of the Joint Food Board to allocate us the additional number of tons we require before the end of July.  If not, some curtailment of deliveries may be difficult to avoid, if the campaign now in progress to secure a voluntary reduction in consumption does not result in a substantial saving.  Coal supplies showed some tendency to improve in quantity, although not in quality, during the spring but the increase was not sufficient, and not certain enough, to occasion any substantial change in the general fuel position.  The supply of domestic fuel is still entirely dependent on this year's turf production. <Col N="847" /> There has been a recent increase of approximately 10 per cent in the allocation of petroleum products.  That increase, however, does not permit of a corresponding increase in the ration because we had to some extent anticipate it by allowing out greater supplies in the earlier months of the year than the previous allocation would have maintained throughout the year. However, it has made possible a supplementary ration for commercial travellers and others whose private cars are essential to their occupations. It has also solved what threatehed to be a substantial difficulty in the provision of petrol supplies required for the carrying out of large construction works in progress.  The increased supply of paraffin has made a domestic ration in the summer months possible for the first time in five years.  The position in regard to clothing supplies has improved, even if slightly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have decided that we can risk a reduction in coupon values for the coming ration period.  Some improvement in the supply of woollen and worsted goods has been experienced and a more substantial improvement later in the year is confidently expected.  The cotton position is still very difficult.  No increased yarn allocation from Britain appears likely and Brazil has recently prohibited further exports.  An early improvement in regard to cotton goods is not to be expected.  The supply of boots has been improving and the footwear position will be eased to some extent by the re-appearance of rubber boots and children's plimsols.  The world shortage of leather, however, will not be eased for two or three years and our home production of leather is still below the requirements of the boot factories.  The difficulty in increasing <Col N="848" /> the supply of children's plimsols is not due to rubber scarcity but to the cotton position to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>The Dáil will also expect me to deal with recent developments in civil aviation.  My references will be brief, as the matter will come before the Dáil again soon on a Bill to ratify the Chicago Convention, of which the Dáil has approved by resolution, and to effect certain changes in the constitution of Aer Rianta in consequence of the recent agreement with Great Britain.  The agreement with Great Britain provides for the grant of reciprocal rights to Aer Rianta and the British Overseas Airways Corporation in respect of transatlantic operations and includes the condition that British aircraft passing over our territory on transatlantic routes will stop at the Shannon Airport and enjoy full commercial rights there.</P>
      <P>The movement for an international agreement for the multilateral concession of freedom of the air over national territories, which began at Chicago and to which references have appeared recently in the Press, is being taken a step further at the meeting of the assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation which is now proceeding at Montreal. The attitude of the Government to the proposal is not one of opposition, and, if there should be general agreement amongst the States-members of the International Civil Aviation Organisation to its adoption, we would be prepared to agree also.  The adoption of an international convention for the multilateral concession of freedom of the air would involve the deletion from the existing bilateral agreements of clauses providing for compulsory stops at Shannon Airport by foreign aircraft, flying on transatlantic routes, passing over our territory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not consider, however, that we need have any apprehensions as to the future of the Shannon Airport on that account.  The importance and the status of the Shannon Airport on the Atlantic route are now recognised internationally and, in the long run, it is economic considerations and not bilateral agreements which will decide <Col N="849" /> its use.  These economic considerations are all on the side of the Shannon airport and that is the real strength of its position.</P>
    <P>The agreement with the United Kingdom also provides for the reconstitution of Aer Lingus as a joint company which will have the sole right of operating air services between our territory and Great Britain.  Aer Lingus will also operate feeder services to the Shannon airport and will have Fifth Freedom rights in the United Kingdom, that is to say, the right to pick up traffic in the United Kingdom and carry it to destinations beyond. Aer Lingus will in future be owned and controlled as to 60 per cent. by Aer Rianta and as to 40 per cent. by either the British Overseas Airways Corporation or the British European Airways Corporation, or perhaps both. We consider that the arrangement contemplated by that agreement is more satisfactory from every viewpoint than the operation of services between Ireland and Great Britain by two separate companies, one Irish and one English, which was, of course, the alternative arrangement.  Not merely does the joint-company arrangement make for better and more efficient working, but it removes any disposition on the part of either Government to limit the development of air services for reasons associated with the special interests of their national company.</P>
    <P>An agreement has also been made with France under which services by Aer Lingus and a French company between Dublin and Paris will begin on 17th June.  That agreement also gives to French aircraft commercial rights at the Shannon airport.  Agreements with other States are also in process of negotiation, but the Dáil will understand that it is not practicable to refer to them at this stage, or until the agreements have been completed and the date and manner of their publication have been mutually agreed.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have seen the announcement of the intention to operate transatlantic services under the Irish flag.  It is improbable, however, that such services can commence before next year.  Detailed plans have not yet been made, although orders <Col N="850" /> for the necessary machines have been placed.  The matter, however, will come before the Dáil again on the Bill to which I have already referred and full particulars will then be available.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus is extending its services to the United Kingdom and has acquired a respectable fleet of suitable aeroplanes which is adequate to operate all the services at present in contemplation. The company's present fleet comprises three Douglas D. C. 3s, nine Dakotas, two de Havilland 86s, with two other craft used solely for the company's purposes.  I feel that Deputies will have been pleased to note the very many favourable references which have appeared in the Press from people with considerable experience of airline operation in other countries as to the efficiency with which these services are operated.</P>
    <P>Work on the construction of hard-surface runways at Dublin airport is proceeding and the main runway is expected to be ready this winter.  Work on the extension of facilities at Shannon airport is proceeding continuously; the runways are being extended in length, the temporary terminal building is being improved, and it is expected that the construction of a new staff village will begin this year.  It is anticipated that a Bill to establish a free port area at Shannon airport will be ready for introduction in the Dáil during the present year.  It is intended that, in the near future, Aer Rianta, either directly or through a new subsidiary company, will commence the construction of a factory in the vicinity of Collinstown for aircraft overhaul and aircraft repair business.  It will also operate a flying school and air charter services.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that I have given only a thumbnail sketch of the various activities, but my justification for doing so is the fact that a full discussion will be possible when the new Bill is introduced and I feel that the Dáil would rather debate these matters in comfort during a separate discussion than as one of a number of items which naturally arise on the Department's Estimates.  I have not referred to matters affecting turf production or electrical development, or other matters <Col N="851" /> recently under discussion in connection with legislation or which may be under discussion later.  However, if Deputies feel there is any aspect of the work of the Department, in regard to these matters, on which they want information, I shall be glad to give it when concluding the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a statement of some length.  I wonder if there would be general agreement in the House to adjourn now for the purpose of considering his statement and continue the debate on the next day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>I put down this motion for a very specific purpose, and in fact the Minister made a case for it at the close of his speech.  My main reason for wishing to refer the Estimate back is that the Department is entirely too large, too unwieldy and reaching out in too many directions.  It is utterly impossible for any one man, even for the present Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;who is undoubtedly the most active and energetic member of the Front Bench&mdash;adequately and efficiently to supervise and direct its activities.  The Minister's own speech has made that perfectly clear.  He made a long and exhaustive statement, in a very clear way, but to use his own word he was able to give only a thumbnail sketch of many matters covered by this Estimate, which would require a long statement and which would call for fairly full discussion by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that this is the most costly Department of State, that we are asked to vote here over £5,000,000.  There are items which could only be touched on by the Minister, but which in themselves are costing as much as some entire Departments of State.  I felt last year that it was a mistake to amalgamate the Department of Supplies with the Department of Industry and Commerce. I will not be misunderstood when I say that.  It is not conveying <Col N="852" /> any reflection on the present Minister. As I said before, I do not believe there is any other member of the Front Bench who could handle it so well, but it is impossible not to have certain very important branches of this Department neglected, no matter how hard the Minister may work.  I can understand Deputy Norton's suggestion that we might have a better and more informed discussion if we could sit down and read the Minister's statement and go into the various branches of the services which he touched on.  However, we cannot do that.</P>
    <P>There is one matter I want to deal with particularly.  Now 12 months after the end of the war, and facing into another year, we should consider whether (1) it is necessary and (2) whether we can be content to go on as at present with regard to the present fuel position.  Approximately one-third of the total amount asked for under this Estimate is in connection with the production and distribution of native fuel, that is, somewhere in the neighbourhood of £1,500,000 or £2,000,000.  Turf is costing over £5 per ton, when purchased here in Dublin, in the fifth or sixth year of our turf production under war conditions and with all the information and experience we have gained during that time.  That £5 represents the price paid by the consumer plus the subsidy paid by the taxpayer.  It might be no harm, as it has been misunderstood generally outside, to emphasise here again that the 10/- per ton reduction mentioned in the recent Budget statement is not a reduction in the cost of turf to the State. It means merely that the State has to find an additional 10/- a ton by way of subsidy.</P>
    <P>Dealing with this matter last year, I said I agreed with the Minister that, in relation to the production and distribution of home produced fuel, one could not talk about an economic price, in the ordinary meaning of the term.  I agreed that the fuel must be produced, but I am not at all satisfied that it could not be produced, distributed and delivered to the consumers at a much lower cost.  Of course, the smallest part of the cost is in the production.  It is after that that the wastage and expense <Col N="853" /> start.  It is fantastic that we should pay nearly £2,000,000 by way of subsidy to fuel importers or distributors or to the Turf Development Board by way of grant-in-aid, etc., leaving out of the question altogether the losses which are being sustained by county councils and others.  Anyone with any knowledge of the bog areas, of the cutting, saving and drawing from the bog to the roadside and the subsequent transport of turf, and who is looking on at what is happening, knows quite well that there could be a very substantial saving on the amount.  That is one of the matters to which I would ask the Minister to give closer attention. I would go further and say it should be the subject of a special inquiry in all its branches, not only because of its importance but because of the terrific cost of this item alone&mdash; which accounts for about one-third of the total cost of the Department.</P>
    <P>The next matter is the question of fertilisers, which is probably our greatest need at the moment.  I am not satisfied that the full effort called for to make available to us here the last ounce of fertilisers is being made.  I want to warn the Minister, from my own personal experience and contact so far as cereals are concerned and from the information I have got from people engaged in all branches, from the production to the actual turning out of the finished article, that you cannot go on assuming that we are likely to get the same yield per acre sown as we were getting for the first three or four years.  I think the Minister knows&mdash;if he does not, some of his advisers are not giving him the information which should be given to him &mdash;that there is a very substantial reduction in the yield per acre over the last year or two.  Unfortunately that is a progressive reduction.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into statistics. Frankly, I pay no attention whatever to statistics.  I think they are more harmful than anything else.  They are merely misleading the Minister and the Government, because the machinery for collecting statistics&mdash;I am referring to wheat&mdash;as to the acreage sown or the yield per acre, is so loose that it would be utterly impossible to get a <Col N="854" /> set of figures that would be even approximately right.  I was talking to one of the largest growers of wheat in this country only three days ago, a man who had been growing, for a number of years even before the war, an average of over 200 acres of wheat per year.  This year he told me that he has only 35 acres under wheat and the remainder is under beet, because he found that, notwithstanding whatever rotation he could arrange in the difficult circumstances of the last few years, his land was becoming completely exhausted and he had to stop growing wheat on an extensive scale and put a manured crop into the ground, such as beet.</P>
    <P>This was a very important matter all during the war.  It is more important at the moment.  I do not think the Minister will disagree with me if I state that our position in relation to wheat will be more critical and more dangerous this coming year, and next year, than it was at any time during the war.  I think it is quite probable, having regard to world conditions, and particularly European conditions, that we will not get any wheat from outside. That is all the more reason why we should get the fullest return from the acreage sown at home, and we can get that only by having fertilisers made available to the fullest possible extent.</P>
    <P>May I suggest to the Minister that he should discuss with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, the question of insisting on having wheat sown on certain farms merely because the acreage is there, with no regard whatever to the suitability of the land.  I have seen good wheat seed put into ground and you might as well sow it outside in Kildare Street.  It is sheer waste of good seed and a waste of time sowing it.  There is enough wheat land in this country to grow more than our requirements and we ought not to insist, merely by going strictly according to the rules, that, because there is an acreage there, a proportion of wheat must go into that ground, whether it will give a good yield or not.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to a matter that has affected, is affecting and, I am afraid, will continue, to a greater extent, to affect, every section of the <Col N="855" /> community, and that is the cost of living.  The cost of living, according to the official figures, is about 72 per cent. over pre-war.  Neither the Minister nor anybody else who knows anything about the situation will suggest that there is much possibility of that coming down.  I think the tendency is the other way.  Indeed, the likelihood is that that there will be a further increase, and there is little use in the Minister expressing optimism about an increase in the standard of living of our people if we are to have an ever-increasing cost of living.  This is a matter to which one could devote a full speech.  I do not want to go into it in detail.  It has been discussed many times, both inside and outside the House.  It was discussed inside the House on very many occasions during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>As a result of the high cost of living, and because salaries and wages were unable to keep pace with it, it is an undoubted fact that a very large section of our community are to-day on a lower standard of living than they were in pre-war days and, of course, that is particularly true of those who have young families.  I must say that it is almost a mystery to me, having regard to the present-day cost of living, how any family man, working for a wage or on a moderate salary, is able to make ends meet.  There is hardly a Deputy, particularly if he is married and has a family and has the responsibility of maintaining a home, even though he may have a very good wage compared with some of the people I am talking about, who does not find, notwithstanding the official figures, that it is costing more to run his home.  That is true where there are just ordinary living conditions, without any extravagance.</P>
    <P>One of the most important aspects of the cost-of-living figure is not taken into consideration, although it has, perhaps, the most important bearing of all, and that is, not merely the cost of the article, but the quality.  If the quality were compared with the pre-war quality, and if the price were compared with the pre-war price, you would get a real cost-of-living figure, a figure far different <Col N="856" /> from the one we see in the ordinary statistical way.</P>
    <P>With regard to tea, I gather from the Minister that the allocation to be made to this country is approximately 75 per cent. of our pre-war consumption.  Will the Minister tell us whether the subsidy in connection with the price of tea is still being paid, or whether there is any variation in it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still being paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>And there is no variation in the price at which we purchased it.  The Minister mentioned last year that the subsidy was a fairly substantial one, and I should like to know whether it is necessary to continue it, or if it will have to be increased.  The Minister told us that there had been a reduction in the food subsidy of £715,000, and stated that that was entirely due to the reduction in the cost of wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is entirely due to a saving on flour subsidy which, in turn, is due almost entirely to the reduction on shipping freights on the North Atlantic, and to the fact that we have been buying no South American wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Minister said the amount would be £715,000 less.  That is what he is estimating for now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we estimate to save this year as compared with last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the estimated saving is mainly due to a reduction in shipping freights and the ability to get wheat nearer home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that we have not been getting South American wheat in the quantity we got it previously has affected the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The part of the Minister's statement with which I was struck more than anything else was his little homily on Irish industry.  Let me say that I welcome it, and the change in the Minister's approach.  I am not saying this for any purpose, but the Minister is now facing up to the question of Irish industry, and the help it would get from the community, in somewhat the same spirit as that of <Col N="857" /> his predecessor.  The Minister's approach is much more sober and much more realistic now than it was some years ago.  That is not only good for the community as a whole, but from the point of view of the consumer, I venture to say it will be ultimately for the good of industry itself.  I do not think any Deputy who wishes to see the development of Irish industry on sound lines would quarrel in the slightest degree with the Minister's statement on that.  I do not think any Deputy will object to the giving of the fullest possible protection to Irish industry to meet the type of competition the Minister spoke about to-day.</P>
      <P>Personally I am glad that the time has almost gone when anybody could walk in and get a tariff, merely by saying that they were going to start a cap or a shirt factory at some end of the city.  We want to see not only Irish industries established, sound industries that are going to produce articles which we can be proud to buy and to use at home, but proud to export, if the Minister's hopes in that direction are realised.  If we are not going to have industries built on that basis, industries that can produce decent articles and give decent conditions to those employed, then, on the part of the community, they are not worth helping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gathered from the Minister's statement that we are going to have three new Bills introduced.  The Minister still talks about the Prices Commission. In view of what he told us to-day about its future functions, I wonder why he retained the description &ldquo;Prices Commission.&rdquo;  Is he afraid that anything might be said if it was called a Tariff Commission?  I was glad to hear that it will be concerned, as far as industry is concerned, with more than the question of price; that it is going to be concerned with efficiency, quality and so on.  To that extent I welcome the statement.  I think there ought to be a separate body dealing with quality and a separate body dealing with prices, as ordinary consumers' understand the position.  After our experience of the last five years it is absurd for the Minister or anyone else to talk about price control.  There has <Col N="858" /> been no really effective price control here.  I grant that it was, perhaps, impossible in the circumstances of the last five or six years to have price control no matter what machinery was there.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention for the third year to another matter on which I suppose I will get the same promise from the Minister.  There is one branch of industry that everybody believes, rightly or wrongly, has not been effectively controlled, and that is the branch dealing with clothing, the drapery trade generally and boots.  The Minister promised to look into the matter at this time last year but the position is still the same.  I do not know what is the reason.  I know that in this city a suit of clothes, even of the very inferior material that is available, cannot be got without paying from 12 to 20 guineas for it.  The material that it is made from is not what I think we would be proud of.  That is not merely my experience, but I have been told by many tailors in this city, and by many drapers, that their supplies of woollens or worsteds are lower now than at any time during the war, and that the quality is certainly not as good.  There may be reasons for that that are not apparent to people like myself, and there may be reasons why the price of the ordinary lounge suit is beyond the capacity of a man earning a wage or a man earning a salary. These are matters that the ordinary person comes up against every day in the week and that I should like to see dealt with by the Minister.  There are many other points to which I should like to refer, but I do not wish to take up the remaining time that is available to-day.</P>
    <P>Speaking for myself I should like to congratulate the Minister and the Government on the way in which the whole question of aviation has been handled so far, and on the initiative, enterprise, and if I might use the word, imagination, shown in connection with that development.  On that score I think we certainly have no reason in the world to quarrel with the Minister or with his advisers.  I realise to the full its value.  It is a value which cannot be judged from the point of view <Col N="859" /> of monetary return.  I realise to the full its value to the country, but I would not like the Minister or anybody else to over-estimate its value.  I wish sincerely that I could see the same drive, initiative and courage exercised by the Minister and his Department in relation to other matters which are of even greater importance to us than aviation.  However, in so far as aviation itself is concerned, I personally have no fault to find.  I think the matter has been handled very well, if I may say so.</P>
    <P>There are a great many other matters with which I might deal, but I will leave them for other Deputies to deal with.  There is, however, one other matter, with which I have been dealing for the past 24 years.  Unfortunately, the position from the point of view of numbers is no better to-day than it was 24 years ago, or certainly not much better.  There has been a relief in the situation, but that relief came about through circumstances outside our control, and I am afraid it may be only a temporary relief.  I refer to unemployment.  I cannot share the Minister's optimistic hopes in that regard.  The Minister used a couple of phrases to-day which threw my mind back 14 or 15 years, but I do not intend to go into that now.</P>
    <P>As I say, I cannot share the Minister's hopes in this matter.  Quite frankly, I cannot understand why even in present circumstances there should be an average of 60,000 people&mdash;I am taking the figures given by the Minister for Finance&mdash;at the labour exchange every week.  Notwithstanding the shortage of building materials and so on, if the money is available&mdash;and remember we have always been told by the Government that there was never any question of inability to find money for useful employment, that the trouble was to find useful work on which to spend it&mdash;there is sufficient useful work which needs to be done to absorb every able-bodied man who wants to work into employment to-morrow morning.</P>
    <P>I mention merely two matters.  There is sufficient work on the development and laying out of housing and building <Col N="860" /> sites and on the clearing of scrub land to provide employment for these men. I see Deputy Gorry here.  He will agree that, even in his own constituency, there is a very considerable area of land growing nothing but scrub and furze.  It would pay the State to put men working on it.  I will go this distance with the Minister, that it is very hard to distinguish between those who are fully unemployed, those who are under-employed and many of those who are merely signing at the labour exchange.  In so far as the last difficulty exists, the Minister has nobody but himself to blame, because that system of unemployment assistance was introduced by the Minister on the basis not of economic considerations but of political considerations.</P>
    <P>There is no necessity, however, to go back on old matters, but with the amount of money available in this country to-day&mdash;and nobody is so foolish as to deny that there is more money available than perhaps was ever available in this country's history&mdash;and with the amount of work which requires to be done, with the arrears of at least seven years to be made up, there is no reason in the world why we should have an average of 60,000 unemployed.  So long as that number, or anything like it, is there, we cannot be satisfied that the Minister is fully discharging the obligation on him as Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister, I have only barely touched on a number of these points and have not sought to develop any of them.  Almost any one of the points on which I have touched could, without wasting the time of the House, be made the subject of a full speech. However, I have no desire to do that now, but I want again to put this to the Minister as well as to the House, that this Department is too big, too unwieldy and too far-flung to be controlled by any one man.  It cannot be done&mdash;some of the services are bound to suffer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some matters in the Minister's speech to which I should like to refer and some other matters on which I should like to get information.  The Minister has told us <Col N="861" /> of the extent to which building will be an important part of our post-emergency activities, and has indicated the number of licences which have been issued to persons who want to engage in building.  In one portion of his speech, he conjured up the possibility that there might be a shortage of skilled labour.  Anybody who knows the position in the building trade is quite satisfied that there is likely to be a shortage of skilled labour, because, during the past six years, many of our skilled craftsmen were forced by economic circumstances to emigrate to Britain, and very large numbers of them are still there.</P>
      <P>It is not easy for building trade workers who emigrate to Britain, or who are employed there, in present circumstances to maintain a home in Britain and a home here, because it is generally conceded that what the Americans call the &ldquo;take-home pay&rdquo; is somewhat contracted in Britain to-day as compared with the position a year or two years ago.  Therefore, the Minister is looking on our exiled craftsmen from this standpoint, that they are employed in Britain and have to keep a home there and possibly maintain a wife, children and a house here.  Employment in Britain in these circumstances will not in the future be quite as attractive as in the past, but it will at least have one attraction, that is, that, judging by the methods being adopted by the British, every Irish building worker there will be able to get continuous employment, and therefore will probably regard that continuous employment there as a greater attraction than intermittent employment here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows that, in pre-emergency times, building trade workers were frequently idle for three to six months of the year.  While they earned what might be considered a fair wage while employed, when one remembers the long periods of unemployment, their total annual income was substantially less than was suggested by their rate of wages while in employment. Many of these building trade workers at present in England can be tempted to come back here, but you will not tempt them to come back by <Col N="862" /> the prospect of a month's, two months', three months' or six months' unemployment, nor will you tempt them to come back by saying: &ldquo;There will be a lot of building work, but it will be done in such a disorganised way that there may be substantial periods of unemployment awaiting you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like at this stage to suggest to the Minister that he, in conjunction with some of the committees advising him on post-war building, ought to examine very carefully the possibility of evolving a programme which will enable him to say to these building trade workers in Britain: &ldquo;Come back to the Twenty-Six Counties and work at your trade.  We will give every man who comes back, plus those who are here, a guarantee that they will not be a day idle, if they are willing to work, for the next three or five years,&rdquo; at the same time, taking steps to ensure that the building industry is organised in such a way that every time there is a danger of a man being unemployed, he will be sent to a job to do some useful building work.</P>
    <P>I am not unconscious of the fact that that is not going to be an easy job, but the British did it successfully during the war, and the Six-County Government did it pretty successfully in relation to agriculture when they said to agricultural workers: &ldquo;Whether you work or not, we will give you a week's wages, and if, for any reason, you are laid off and go to the employment exchange we will see that you get a week's wages;&rdquo; but they took care at the same time that very few got a week's wages for doing nothing because the system was organised in such a way that every time there were idle hands or idle brains jobs were found for them to do.  I would suggest to the Minister, who has, if I may say so, quite an original mind in these matters, that he should apply his talents to evolving a scheme of that kind which will bring back to us the trained craftsmen who play such a useful part in the constructional activities envisaged by the Minister during the course of his speech here to-day.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the Department's activities to which I would like <Col N="863" /> to make some reference; it is that section of the Minister's Department which deals with the fixation of prices for fruit supplies.  Now, some time ago fruit supplies in the form of oranges and in the form of bananas&mdash;both attractive commodities for young children&mdash;were imported into this country for the first time for a long period. The Department went through the usual formula of fixing prices for those commodities; but, quite obviously, many of the people engaged in the sale of these commodities took no notice whatsoever of the Department's Order. The Department's fixed prices were flagrantly ignored and there was an open black-market in the City of Dublin in respect of the sale of these two commodities.  I am not interested in this at all from the standpoint of what well-to-do people can afford to pay for their luxurious tastes, although I would say that from the point of view of ethics it is not right to exploit any person.  But I am concerned with the situation in which the young children of the working-class and middle-class people find themselves when they cannot get a reasonable quantity of these very scarce fruits because of the open black market and the open defiance of the Department's price fixing Orders.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he ought by now to have had ample experience of the dismal failure of his efforts to regulate prices in respect of these two commodities and, particularly, in respect of the last importation of these fruits and that the time has come when some other methods should be devised in order to ensure that these fruits will be sold to those people most in need of them at a price within their competence to pay. Frankly, I would sooner see a half-dozen corporation markets on established co-operative principles to which all this fruit would go and be sold at a minimum price, if necessary without making a profit, so as to ensure that those most in need of such supplies would get them.  In order to break the black market in these, and other commodities, I think that is probably the best way in which to do it and to stop the unscrupulous fleecing of the people <Col N="864" /> simply because they want a commodity which is in short supply.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the standstill Order and indicated that it was his intention to introduce legislation within the next month to devise a type of machinery which, I think he said, was to replace the standstill Order.  I assume the Minister is referring to his proposed labour courts.  As the question of the establishment of these courts will be a matter of very considerable interest, because they will affect large numbers of employers and employees, the Minister might usefully give us some indication as to the general lines upon which the proposed legislation will proceed, so that it will be possible for us, between now and the introduction of the Bill, to endeavour to get an informed opinion on the matter and thereby make us more capable of debating the entire question in the light of public opinion and, perhaps, at the same time oreate a more intelligent and informed opinion on the Bill before it is introduced into the House for consideration.  I gathered&mdash;more by inference than by anything the Minister actually said&mdash; that it was the intention of the Government to abandon the Standstill Wages Order under the Emergency Powers Act.  I would like if the Minister would confirm that this standstill Order policy is to go and that this new machinery will take the place of the standstill Order policy, which arose out of the withholding of the bonus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That will depend very largely upon the amount of co-operation I shall get in the Dáil.  I cannot give any guarantee as to that. I will have the Bill here as soon as possible, but I imagine the passage of the Bill will take some time.  I shall do all in my power to expedite it.</P>

    <Col N="865" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I might modify that to this extent&mdash;the enactment of the measure will not be the critical date. The critical date will be the date on which it comes into operation, which will be some short period after its enactment.  Even assuming the rapid passage of the Bill through the Dáil there may be a delay of a few weeks. But, as far as I am concerned, it will be expedited in every way and the operative date fixed as early as possible. I hope that it will be the 1st September, but I think I would be unduly optimistic if I said that would be the date definitely.  It may be some days, or a couple of weeks, later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>At all events from what the Minister has said the general intention is to introduce this legislation and pass it into law expeditiously; then, when it has been passed and the critical date fixed for its operation, the Standstill Wages Order will go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And this new machinery will take its place.  I think I probably know more about this than anybody else either in this House or outside it. I think the Minister would be rendering a service to himself and also rendering a service to the employers and workers generally, who are vitally concerned in this matter, if he avails of this opportunity to give the community a general picture as to the lines upon which his legislation will proceed. Really we are getting into pretty well unexplored territory so far as our social and economic legislation is concerned. We are trying out experiments here which have never been tried out before, except perhaps in relation to the railway services.  We are now endeavouring to apply the same principle to a very wide and varied category of workers who have never been used to this machinery; just like new boots and new shoes, it will be a bit tight-fitting and pinching in the first instance.  I suggest, therefore, that the Minister might endeavour to inform public opinion on the matter when <Col N="866" /> replying to this debate so that the widest amount of knowledge will be diffused on the matter and that we may get an intelligent approach to the problem when we come to consider it in the House.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that he would welcome suggestions in the House to make the new machinery work smoothly and get the greatest level of co-operation.  My advice to the Minister now is designed to get both, so as to ensure that whatever machinery is produced he will have the fullest co-operation from all sides.  The Minister must realise from his experience that if that does not happen we are merely wasting our time trying to enact the new legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made no reference&mdash;at least for the three-quarters of an hour during which I heard him speaking&mdash; to the Government's intentions in respect of the marine services.  I do not know whether the Minister intends to reserve his comments for one of the subsequent Estimates, but I think it is customary on the Minister's introductory speech to cover, not merely the activities of his own Department, but also the subsidiary activities which arise out of the main functions of his Department.  The Minister knows, of course, that at the outbreak of the war we were caught very badly on the wrong foot in respect of our marine services. We had no mercantile marine. Some of the ships we had were in fact not under our own control.  The moment the war started many of them who were not already registered on the British register, applied for registration there and those that were already on the British register simply passed completely out of our control.  During the war there was a number of improvisations and we endeavoured to get shipping wherever it was available but, as we were buying in a market in which there was very keen competition, it was extremely difficult to augment the rather fragmentary fleet we had.  If the emergency did one thing more than another, it taught us the value of a mercantile marine.  I hope it has brought to an end the paradox of an island country, that is capable of supplying sailors to the merchant <Col N="867" /> fleets of the world, having no mercantile fleet of its own.  We have had experience, over the past seven years, which ought to have taught us a lesson. I hope the Minister will be able to tell us, on this Estimate, that it is the intention of his Department to give every assistance to the establishment of a mercantile marine that will be capable of transporting our requirements to this country and of transporting such commodities as we have for export and of claiming its share of the traffic on the sea-lanes of the world. A mercantile marine would be a valuable source of employment for our people and a source of wealth in building up a ship-building industry.  We should not again be caught on the wrong foot, as we were in 1939.  We ought to realise now that the building of a mercantile fleet is good national housekeeping, providing employment, providing a defence in time of war and giving useful and profitable service to the community.</P>
    <P>I was interested in hearing the Minister say that the clothing position has improved and will improve further. Quite obviously, it is a long time since the Minister was in a tailoring establishment. I assure the Minister that if he spends this week-end walking around the tailoring shops in town with a view to buying a suit of clothes, he will be a pretty disappointed and footsore man.</P>

I am assured that it is impossible to get a decent suit of clothes in a tailoring shop in town, that what is there is of rather inferior quality compared with what <Col N="868" /> normally ought to be available, and that many tailors, some of whom the Minister would know personally, develop headaches trying to got then-quotas of suit lengths.  Those on offer are of such a quality that nobody will buy them.  It may be, of course, that Drogheda has got a good quota.</P>

      <P>There would appear to be no grounds for the Minister's optimism so far as the supply of clothing materials in Dublin is concerned and I should like the Minister to check up on the information which was the basis of the statement he made.  Certainly it is illusory so far as this city is concerned and so far as my knowledge of my own constituency is concerned.  I must make reference to what is the general opinion in respect of the price of clothing.  There is a widespread opinion that, so far as clothing of all kinds is concerned, very substantial profit is being made on the sale of clothing material, whether in the piece or in the made up article.  If one has regard to the published returns of many firms engaged in that business, there are good grounds for the suspicion that a very considerable and unreasonably high profit is being made out of the wholesale and retail distribution of clothing, at least so far as this city is concerned.  I get letters from time to time, and I suppose every other Deputy gets them, from workinging class families having to prepare one or two children for first Holy Communion or Confirmation.  When they calculate the price they have to pay for little frocks and suits for girls and boys, for stockings, shoes and other equipment of that kind, the total sum is staggering for those people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In pre-war years while the preparation of children for the Sacraments represented a tax on the family income, the parents braced themselves to meet it, but it is a physical impossibility for working-class people to meet the heavy burden which the preparation of their children for these two Sacraments imposes.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that there ought to be a further examination of these clothing prices, and that if necessary the firms that engage in selling this clothing should not be allowed to get away with the fancy prices which are charged, in the main, to working-class people, because of the rightful pride which they take in properly preparing their children for the reception of these two Sacraments.  It seems to me to be nothing short of unscrupulous exploitation to have ordinary poor people, who are struggling to make ends meet, salted, as they are being salted, when they go to buy clothing for their children on these occasions. If the Minister were to get the officials in his Department to prepare a proper estimate of the cost of what that preparation means in the case of a working-class budget, I am certain he would realise that drastic steps should be taken to control the price of that type of clothing.  If necessary, let the fur coats subsidise the cost of it rather than have poor people mulcted as they are being mulcted to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a speech recently in connection with our new industrial policy.  I agree with about 90 per cent. of what he said.  There is one portion of it to which I take exception, and that is where he said that our costs here must be approximately on a level with the costs in competing countries. I do not think it would be a wise policy to base our costs on the costs in highly-industrialised and highly-capitalised countries, with generations of industrial craftsmanship behind them, with financial methods which are quite different from ours, and a national and traditional outlook that is considerably different from ours.  I would say, therefore, that it would be unfair to compel our industries to conform to production costs which are related to factors operative elsewhere <Col N="870" /> which are not operative here and which, in many respects, it might not be desirable to permit to be operative here.</P>
    <P>There were aspects of the Minister's speech which, I think, were commendable. The Minister knows that after 1932 industries were set up here in a panic under the protection of tariffs. A large number of gentlemen of doubtful parentage racially came in here and sought any kind of stable or discussed ramshackle building that they could find for the purpose of setting up what they described as an industry.  A lot of those gentlemen brought in here a variety of second-hand machinery out of which, of course, they made pretty substantial profits for themselves because they were selling to people who knew nothing whatever about machinery, people who had to rely on such technical knowledge as they had themselves.  As the Minister and the Department know quite well, the result of that was that a number of activities euphemistically described as industries, were started here.  They consisted in many cases of converted stables or disused bowries which were equipped with second-hand machinery and with no pretence at all at cleanliness, proper constructional work, hygiene or the ordinary elementary precautions that one would take in endeavouring to establish a new factory.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Minister sets his face as firmly as he possibly can against that type of industrial exploitation or development that goes hand in hand with secondhand machinery, using as a factory tumbled down buildings and with all these out-of-date Babylonian methods, he will have the warmest support of everybody who wants to see here really decent, clean, healthy and efficient industries established.  He should see that anybody who is going to get the benefit of tariffs in the future, or any assistance from the Government in the way of advice or goodwill, will be compelled to conform to standards which will mean that the new factories will be decent factories with up-to-date machinery and that the secondhand stuff will never be regarded as a satisfactory method of launching <Col N="871" /> a new industrial development in this country.  If the Minister aims at that target, I think he will have an abundance of goodwill.  Not only will he have that goodwill, but he will, perhaps, be taking a very substantial step towards curbing the tendency of our industry to be slow and sluggish, to be second rate and third rate, and will be giving the necessary corrective to get it on the main road of decent industrial development, leaving behind the pedalling and the muddling that go hand in hand with what one may describe as side road industrial development of which, unfortunately, we have had too much since 1932.</P>
    <P>There is one matter in conclusion on which I would ask the Minister to give some information when replying, and that is the intentions of his Department in respect of the Workmen's Compensation Act.  That Act is a very unsatisfactory one in a variety of ways. The scales of compensation provided under it for partial incapacity or total incapacity are altogether inadequate. As a matter of fact, in some respects it might be better for a workman who meets with an accident to wish that he had been killed rather than try to have to struggle along on the low pittance that he gets in the form of workmen's compensation.  I think that the Minister's Department must recognise, from <Col N="872" /> the representations which have been made to it, that the present Act falls far short of what industrial legislation should be for the protection of workers from accidents.  It is certainly very far short of the new British measure.</P>
    <P>If we are going to build up a really healthy industrial position here, one of the necessary corollaries must be a good standard of factory and industrial legislation.  Workmen's compensation is the only protection which the worker has.  If he meets with an accident in a factory it may sentence him to economic death.  It may incapacitate him for a very long period, and compel his dependents to suffer acute hardships, even under the present scale of compensation.  I would hope to hear from the Minister that, if industry in its modern complex development is going to have casualties in the form of injured workmen, then industry is going to be required&mdash;I suggest it is a reasonable requirement&mdash;to pay for the casualties which it causes in the course of its activities.</P>
