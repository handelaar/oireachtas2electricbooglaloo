      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state (a) the number of persons (1) residing in the State, and (2) residing outside the State, who entered the design competition in connection with the erection of a new bridge in Wexford; (b) the names and place of residence of the winners of the competition; (c) the date on which the competition was held; (d) whether the prize money arising out of the competition has yet been paid; and (e) whether he has any observations to offer regarding the delay in making these payments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to build a new bridge at Wexford involves an expenditure which at present is estimated at between £150,000 and £200,000.  It will, therefore, be clear that the proposal is an important one affecting as it does the financial interests of the local rate-payers and also the State, which is <Col N="1599" /> expected to make a contribution from the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>In this connection the question whether the bridge should be constructed as a fixed bridge or an open span is of great importance.  Clause 5 of the instructions to competitors is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The county council desire an opening span but are prepared to consider the alternative of a fixed bridge with at least 20 feet clearance above mean high water of ordinary spring tides in one span of not less than 60 feet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Clause 3 of the Schedule to these instructions states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A passage not less than 60 feet wide shall be provided for river traffic in either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  an opening span, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a fixed span allowing not less than 20 feet between soffit level and mean high water of ordinary spring tides which may be taken as 9.70 O.D.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These conditions were not submitted in the first instance for approval of my Department.  Obviously an open span bridge would be desirable if such a bridge could be provided at a reasonable cost.  Both the Department of Industry and Commerce and my own Department feel strongly that a proposal which might prevent the use of a good navigable waterway by vessels catering for the needs of possible future industrial centres along the river should not be accepted unless very strong reasons are produced in favour of a fixed bridge and against the erection of an opening bridge.  I understand the winning designs are for fixed bridges.</P>
    <P>As to (a), (1) and (2), in the question, I have no information.</P>
    <P>(b)  The winners of the prizes were:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  W.J.L. O'Connell, Cork; (2) W. A. Fairhurst, Glasgow; (3) J. J. Roughan, Dublin.</P>
    <P>(c) The instructions to competitors were issued in June, 1943, and the assessors' award is dated the 13th October, 1944.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1600" /> (d)  I understand the prize money has not yet been paid.</P>
    <P>(e)  I have been in communication for some time with the local authority regarding the possibility of obtaining designs on the basis of an open span bridge.  On the 13th November last the county council was informed that they should be advised by their legal agent as to their position in relation to the assessors, the prize winners and the competition.  I have no information to show that this course was followed by the county council but on the 12th March that body again requested approval to the payment of prizes and fees.  In reply, dated 26th April last, the council were asked how many of the 43 designs submitted were for opening bridges and in what respects these designs were found unsuitable by the assessors.  The reply which has now come to hand states that 12 designs were for opening bridges and that the designs were rejected in four cases on the grounds of unacceptable types or treatment of piers, in two cases on the grounds that the number of small spans provided were excessive and that there was an excessive reduction of waterway, and in six cases mainly on the grounds of defective foundations.  It is proposed again to inform the county council that they should act in accordance with the advice of their legal adviser in the matter of paying prizes and fees.</P>
    <P>As regards the inquiry as to the present position regarding the erection of the bridge I understand that last December a conference was held in Wexford between representatives of the Wexford County Council, the Wexford Corporation and the Wexford Harbour Commissioners regarding the necessity for or the desirability of a bridge with an opening span and that in January, 1946, the county council approved of a resolution that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health be requested to hold a local inquiry with regard to the question of providing an opening span in the proposed new bridge.  The application of the council will be considered when provisions in the Local Government Bill regarding the construction of bridges become law.</P>

Children's allowances in the Civil Service are essentially linked with the differentiation between the salaries of married and single men, officers while unmarried contributing by working for lower salaries to the cost of the allowances to which they will be entitled if they marry and have children.  There is no anomaly in the fact that these allowances are not paid to officers whose salaries are not differentiated on a marriage basis and who make no contribution to the cost.

      <P>I know, Sir, that you are an excellent chairman but it really is impossible for us to hear over here. There are times when nobody on this side of the House has any idea as to the sequence in which the Order Paper <Col N="1615" /> is going to be taken, and you have the position of one Deputy asking another Deputy if he has heard what the Minister has just said, or did he hear what the Ceann Comhairle said.  It would almost appear as if there was some kind of confidential chat taking place between the Minister and the Ceann Comhairle and we, of course, do not like to interrupt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be observed that the gross outlay estimated for the Fisheries service is £47,200 compared with £37,331 last year, that is, an increase of £9,869 and, as there is a falling off in the Appropriations-in-Aid of £1,995, the net result is that the 1946-47 total is £11,864 greater than the figure for 1945-46.  This, however, is capable of a simple explanation. Under sub-head A, an increase of £1,884 on last year's figure represents in the main a rise in the cost-of-living bonus together with provision for one additional assistant principal officer in the Department and one assistant inspector of fisheries.  During the war the staff in the Fisheries Branch was not as high as it had been pre-war and we are now proceeding to fill some of the gaps that have been so long outstanding.</P>
      <P>Coming to the heading &ldquo;Sea Fisheries&rdquo;, there is an increase of £560 caused by a provision for this country's contribution as a member of the International Council for the Study of the Sea and for the travelling expenses of a delegate attending the council's annual meeting.  These items were a normal feature in the Estimate before the war, but during the war years no meetings were held and consequently we had only a token entry each year, but this year an international conference is again being held and we are sending a delegate to that meeting. There is no change in any of the other items under this heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under &ldquo;Inland Fisheries&rdquo;, the provision under sub-head F (1) is £750 greater than last year.  This item relates entirely to the statutory disbursements made to local authorities towards loss of income to them arising from the exemption accorded, under the Fisheries Act, 1925, to fishery assessments from ordinary local rating. <Col N="1616" /> Such disbursements have been showing an upward trend in recent years.  In sub-head F (2), the provision for salmon and trout hatchery operations, there is an increase of £890.  This is due, principally, to the grant to the State hatchery at Glenties.  We have to reconstruct there, at a cost of £500, a weir which was carried away during abnormal floods in 1945, and there is also a &ldquo;carry forward&rdquo; from the estimate of last year.  Owing to the death of our fisheries engineer, this work had to be deferred and some of the necessary rearrangements could not be carried out.</P>
    <P>There is also provision for brown trout hatchery experiments, which is £130 more than last year.  This is brought in to meet the cost of replacing wornout equipment at Lough Owel hatchery and generally expanding the output at that place in the hope of meeting, partially at least, the present demand for more brown trout ova.  This hatchery is run by the State in conjunction with an anglers' association.  The only other item under.  &ldquo;Inland Fisheries&rdquo; calling for comment is sub-head F (5)&mdash; miscellaneous expenses under the Fisheries Act, 1939.  There is a relatively large increase there, owing to the fact that the State had taken over on transfer, with the former owner's consent, the fishery known as the Culdaff Bag Nets, in County Donegal.  This comes under Section 65 of the 1939 Act and compensation will have to be paid for the fishery.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Sea Fisheries Association&rdquo; we have three sub-heads, G (1), G (2) and G (3).  There is no alteration in the amount for G (1), that is, the provision for the administrative expenses of the association.  There is an increase of £4,400 under G (2).  This provision is to meet repayable advances from which the association will provide boats and gear on hire-purchase terms to approved members.  It should normally be higher if the association were in a position to meet all the applications, but it is not likely that they will be and they are not, therefore, asking for more than they think they can spend during the coming year, having regard to the supply position. <Col N="1617" /> This provision is a great deal higher than the provision for last year because last year it was impossible to get any supplies at all.  The directors of the association, however, have warned me that, as soon as supplies become available, they will be asking for very much larger sums under this sub-head and I am sure that Deputies will be only too glad to vote such money when supplies are available.  The repayments due by the association on foot of former advances have been very well met to date.  The difference between the £5,000 set down this year and the £600 shown last year accounts for £4,400 of the net increase on the Estimate.  The provision under G (3) to meet repayable advances for work of general development by the association is the same as last year's figure because, again, the association are not anxious to push on with general development while the costs are so very high as they are at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Structural building, etc. We may have a little more about that later on.  Under &ldquo;Appropriations-in-Aid&rdquo; there are are nine items, eight of which are practically the same as they were last year.  There is one big drop, which is in the repayment of advances by the Sea Fisheries Association, of £2,000.  Deputies must not take that to mean that we expect deterioration in the repayments by the members.  What it is really due to is that a great number of the members of the association have repaid in full the advances made to them and they will, therefore, not be making any contributions during the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the total amount of advances outstanding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be able to give that to the Deputy later on; I have not got it at the moment.  That £2,000, with the £4,400 I have already mentioned, goes a good way to make up the difference between the Estimate this year and the year before.  The association, as I mentioned, have met <Col N="1618" /> with a very good response from their members in the way of repayments during recent years, and there are many applicants for boats and gear and, as soon as the supply position improves, very much bigger advances will be made, I take it, to the members and repayments will be on the upgrade again.</P>
      <P>Twelve months ago, when we were talking on this Estimate, I reported that the sea fishing industry had shown good results for the year 1944, when the total value of landings had reached £626,000 as compared with the figure of £233,000 for 1939.  I do not want to suggest&mdash;and I do not want Deputies to make the reply&mdash;that I am complacent or satisfied with the condition of the fishing industry but, at any rate, it is making progress and it is well to be able to report, in these very difficult times, that the fishermen are doing better from year to year. In 1945 the value of the landings of inshore fishermen was £680,000.  It was even better than in 1944; but what is more important, in my opinion, is the fact that the total quantity of wet fish&mdash;by which I mean everything except shell fish&mdash;landed in 1945 was 372,000 cwt.  That compares with 307,000 cwt. for 1944 and 188,000 cwt. for 1939.  Considering the very great difficulties under which our fishermen were working with regard to boats, gear and fuel, it is very creditable that they were able to land such great quantities of fish in 1945. We were glad also, I am sure, that they were able to get an increased return by way of remuneration for the fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Sea Fisheries Association, the directors have undoubtedly been hampered by the lack of supplies, but on the marketing side they seem to be maintaining fairly the satisfactory position reached in 1943.  They continue to pay particular attention to the needs of part-time fishermen in the Gaeltacht in the matter of curraghs, trammel nets and the gear for dredging, etc.  The marketing of frozen escallops from the Connemara area, after the shell-fish have been subjected to a hygienic processing, continues to mean increased earnings for the local <Col N="1619" /> fishermen who engage in the dredging of this shell-fish.</P>
    <P>I think it well to avail myself of this opportunity to say something about certain matters raised here at Question Time recently.  One question was in connection with an international conference recently held in London.  This conference was attended by two officers from my Department.  The object of the conference was to endeavour to work out some agreed measures by which to counteract the damaging results which must accrue from over-fishing in the North Sea and the other waters adjacent to these islands.  We have no direct interest in the North Sea at the moment, and it might be said, therefore, that our part in this conference was purely objective.  But, on the other hand, if there should be severe restrictions in the North Sea, and if fishermen should be driven from the North Sea into the waters surrounding these islands, our interests would become more subjective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there any suggestion to that effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but indirectly it might have that effect if any drastic decisions had been come to.  Owing to the difference in outlook of the various countries attending the conference, there were no agreed decisions on the various proposals put up for the reduction of fishing tonnage or any other remedies suggested. It was decided, however, to appoint a small standing committee to go into the matter more in detail and at leisure and that small standing committee was expected to report back to the conference within 12 months. There was only one concrete decision reached and that was to increase fractionally the minimum size below which fish should not be captured or offered for sale and a like small increase in the size of meshes in codends of trawl nets.  These precautions against the capture of undersized fish, with disastrous consequences for the general stocks, received general assent from all participating at the conference.  Some of those present urged that the restrictions did not go far enough.  At the <Col N="1620" /> same time, it was generally recognised that prescribing minimum sizes for fish and for meshes of trawl nets could not be of value unless there was some major control of fishing operations generally. We might hear more of this international conference when the standing committee reports back.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I was asked in a Parliamentary question whether the matter of our exclusive fishery limits had been discussed at the London conference.  In explaining that no such item was on the agenda, I said that this particular matter had been the subject of negotiations conducted quite separately.  Although these negotiations were necessarily held up during the war years, I have reason to think that we shall soon hear some definite news with regard to a resumption of the discussions.  I need hardly assure the Dáil that if and when any decision is reached, it will be immediately communicated to the House.</P>
      <P>Statements appeared in some newspapers suggesting that the quick freezing of herrings was one of the matters under discussion at the conference. That was not correct.  There was no discussion on the quick freezing of herrings or any other fish.  It was also suggested in some of those newspaper articles that my Department had virtually completed plans for the installation of refrigeration plants at certain points on our coastline.  This also is unfounded.  The application of refrigeration to fish and fishery projects is a development which is bound to come; but it is just as much one for commercial enterprise as is the curing of mackerel or herring or any of the other processes through which fish are put before reaching the market.  This is a matter which the directors of the Sea Fisheries Association might possibly consider trying out, because they must adopt commercial measures the same as any other authority engaged in the fish trade; but they could not be expected to do more than the ordinary firm which is engaged in the trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had also a Parliamentary question about my views on the development of deep sea trawling.  This is a matter which has come up in practically every <Col N="1621" /> discussion on fisheries here for many years.  I have always held the view that I am not interested in the development of deep sea trawling of itself, but merely as a means of assisting our inshore fishermen, whose welfare is naturally my first concern.  We must remember these inshore fishermen, with their comparatively small outfits, are very much at the mercy of wind and weather and they cannot undertake by themselves to keep up a regular supply of fish under all conditions; in particular, they cannot keep up a supply of a good variety of fish to the market at all times.  If by any chance we were depending entirely on our inshore fishermen, I think the demand of consumers would become very insistent for a more regular supply of fish than the inshore fishermen could give them and also a better variety than the inshore fishermen could supply.  We could hardly resist that demand and fish coming in freely from outside would be detrimental to the interests of our inshore fishermen.  The best thing I can see to counteract that pressure and propaganda is to have a deep sea trawling company of our own, because we can control, after all, a deep sea trawling company and direct them as far as we can&mdash;it is very hard of course to order fish from the sea as you want them&mdash;to bring in fish that would be more or less supplementary to the catch of the inshore fishermen and not interfere unduly with the inshore fisheries in their business. I therefore think that a deep sea trawling company is essential as part of our fishing policy in this country. I have made it plain on many occasions that there is, in my opinion, room only for one trawling company. I feel that if we can get one trawling company efficiently managed we shall be going in the right direction.  At my request inquiries have been set on foot&mdash;they are still in progress&mdash;with the object of ascertaining whether such a company can be financed from Irish capital.  Although we have not got definite results, I hope that we may have a satisfactory outcome from these inquiries.</P>
    <P>The Dáil will remember passing an Act in 1939&mdash;the Fisheries Act, 1939&mdash;<Col N="1622" /> and I may be asked in the course of the debate what are our intentions with regard to the implementation of that Act.  There is the question, for instance, of abolishing netting in fresh waters which is provided for in Section 35 of that statute.  During the war years, the arguments against the abolition of fresh water netting outweighed the arguments in favour of abolishing that form of catching fish. The big argument for abolishing fresh water netting is that it will improve the supply of salmon, trout, etc., in the rivers and so attract anglers and improve the tourist trade in general. It has been fairly well established that the income of the country in general would be very much higher by having a good supply of salmon and trout in our rivers for anglers than the income that could be derived from fresh water netting.  During the war, however, anglers were very scarce and, on the other hand, the provision of food was very important.  It did seem a pity to put anybody out of business who was in a position to provide food as these fresh water netsmen were.  I think the time has now come when we can proceed with the implementation of the 1939 Act, so far as the abolition of fresh water netting is concerned.</P>
    <P>I gave a pledge to all concerned, however, when the Act was going through that they should have at least one year's notice before the section would be put into operation.  I am therefore giving notice that I intend to bring this section into operation on the 1st January, 1948.  The notice extends over the whole of next year and the remainder of this year as well. That will be followed, of course, as was also laid down as part of the future policy in the 1939 Act, by a restriction on netting in the estuaries but we can take our time about those things and deal at first with the fresh water netting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister mean to limit the number of nets he will license in an estuary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That was fully discussed when the Act was going through and it was generally agreed that we could limit the number of nets in the <Col N="1623" /> estuaries somewhat so as to give those who were engaged in the business in the first place a better living and, secondly, so as to allow more salmon and trout up the rivers and still benefit the netsmen as the years go on.  It will be a very good thing provided we do not impose any undue hardship on the existing fishermen.  I think it can be done without inflicting such hardship.</P>
      <P>The big matter of the Act was the transfer to the Minister of all the privately-owned or privately-held tidal-water and weir fisheries.  We were obviously held up in taking the necessary steps during the war years for various reasons.  We have to make a good deal of preparation in the way of surveying these weirs and estuary fisheries.  We have also to examine books, titles, etc.  The question of title does not enter so much into the matter but there has to be a good deal of examination of the transactions of the present owners.  During the war we were not able to make any progress in that direction because we had less staff at our disposal than pre-war but we do intend to get on with this work as soon as we can.</P>
      <P>Last year I mentioned that the preparation of a Bill to consolidate in one Act all the Fisheries Statutes from 1842 onwards&mdash;there are about 30 of them in all&mdash;was in hand.  The present position is that such a measure is virtually complete in rough draft form and were it not for the great pressure of work in the office of the Parliamentary draftsman in recent months, I would possibly have the document now in print.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am confident that the Bill will be made available to as without very much further delay.  The intention is, as soon as we get this draft from the draftsman&mdash;the procedure was laid down some time ago in the Dáil&mdash;to place it before the members of the Dáil.  It will be certified, in the way laid down already, to be the law as it stands.  We can then proceed to make any amendments that are necessary in the present law.  When <Col N="1624" /> that is done I hope we shall finally be able to pass a Bill through the Oireachtas that will contain all the laws connected with fisheries in one measure. They are in a very muddled state at the moment and it is very difficult to follow some of the provisions which were changed and altered from Act to Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Supplementary Estimate, I should explain what it covers although I am not in a position to move it yet.  In 1939 I brought an Estimate before the Dáil to enable me to pay £25,000 to the former holders of the estuarine fishery of the River Erne.  Deputies will remember, perhaps, that the holders of the fishery of the River Erne were pronounced by the Supreme Court not to be in fact the owners.  They were not, therefore, under the 1939 Act legally entitled to compensation for their ownership.  It was felt, however&mdash;I think every member of the Dáil agreed when I put it before them &mdash;that they had themselves held the fishery in good faith, believing they were the owners.  It was felt that they were entitled through <i>ex gratia</i> grant to get a certain amount for their interest in the fisheries.  We found that in 1869 the fishery had been bought by the predecessors of the present holders for £45,000.  We also had documents to prove that in 1926 one-sixth share of the fishery had been sold for £12,000, so that the market value would appear to have risen from £45,000 in 1869 to £62,000 in 1926.  In considering their value now, I said we would be safe in paying £25,000, and that in that way we would be well within what would be likely to be pronounced to be the value of such a fishery when we started to operate the 1939 Act.  In 1941 we passed a further sum of £6,000, and I explained on that occasion that we would be better able, when we started operating the 1939 Act, to find out exactly what this fishery was worth. I stated on that occasion that it would not be feasible to pay any more until we had at last got one valuation under the 1939 Act of a similar type of fishery, and that we could then judge what the Erne <Col N="1625" /> fishery might be worth.  We did not contemplate at that time that the proceedings under the 1939 Act would be so long delayed and, in view of the long delay, and the probability that it would be some years before any award would be made under the 1939 Act, I think we would be justified in paying a further sum to the late holders of the Erne fisheries.  I am satisfied that we could issue another £6,000, making £37,000 in all.</P>
    <P>There is another matter arising out of that.  At the hearing before the Supreme Court where the matter was decided, the then Attorney-General's counsel stated that as the case was one of public interest, involving a test of important principles, he proposed to recommend that the Government might make a contribution towards the plaintiffs' costs should the decision go against them.  That promise, which was made on behalf of the Government, must also be honoured.  I am asking the Dáil to vote £1,500 under that heading.  As far as we know the plaintiffs' costs of the appeal were about £2,000.  I am asking the Dáil to vote £6,000 further compensation for the Erne fishery, <i>ex gratia</i>, plus £1,500 contribution towards costs of appeal, making £7,500 in all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There will be arbitration to decide the value of other fisheries.  As soon as we have two or three cases, and see what the arbitrator has awarded for fisheries taken over, we can then come to a fair conclusion as to what amount he would be likely to award if the Erne fisheries came before him.  I think we will be within the amount, including what is being asked for now.  The late holders of the Erne fisheries are being informed that it will not be possible to vote any further moneys <i>ex gratia</i> in this way until we have some headline under the 1939 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that the war only ended recently the Sea Fisheries Association could not get going for lack of materials, but I should like to hear what are the immediate prospects regarding supplies. <Col N="1626" /> The position regarding boats must be a pretty bad one.  Most of the boats were built pre-war, with the exception of some since constructed of native timber.  I saw some of these boats and I would not say that their life would be a long one, as the timber they were built from was green.  I do not know how they were kept together.  The Minister has not told us anything about any contracts with Scandinavian countries regarding supplies of timber for the construction of boats.  There is also the question of gear and twine.</P>
      <P>I understand from reports of meetings of the association that I have seen that the boat yard at Meevagh has been closed down and the gear transferred elsewhere.  I was amazed at that.  I wonder if the Minister had all the facts before him before the decision to close down the Meevagh yard was taken. Why was the boat yard established at Meevagh?  It was placed there on expert advice and time has proved the prudence of that advice.  It was placed at Meevagh because it served boats from Malin Head to Burtonport, which is the most important portion of the Donegal coast for fishing purposes. When boats are fishing at Kincasslagh, Burtonport, Downings, or around Malin, if any of them develop engine trouble there are plenty of other boats in the vicinity to take them in tow to Meevagh.  That was the technical reason for the selection of Meevagh for a boat yard.  The yard was developed under the Congested Districts Board, one of the objects being to give employment in the construction of boats in that poor and congested area.  The Congested Districts Board also established boat yards at Killybegs and somewhere on the Galway coast.  The Meevagh yard was a success but this one at Killybegs, for all practical purposes, was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it is asked why the Meevagh boat yard survived and was a success the answer is that the location was convenient, being midway as a centre of the fishing industry on the Donegal coast.  If boats got into trouble between Tory Island and Arranmore they would have to be taken some 60 miles to Killybegs, and would have to <Col N="1627" /> be towed and, as the Minister is aware, some of the most dangerous waters on that coast lie between Burtonport and Killybegs.</P>
    <P>What I am curious to know is on whose advice this step is to be taken, assuming that it is to be taken.  The matter was referred to at the annual meeting of the Sea Fisheries Association, but no definite statement was made as to whether the Meevagh boat yard was to be closed down and the machinery transferred to Killybegs.  If it is to be done I think it is a fatal step.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that all these fishermen from Malin Head to Burtonport are inshore fishermen, with small vessels, which under no circumstances could make the journey around the coast.  It is some 70 or 80 miles from Malin Head to Killybegs and nobody in his senses will suggest that a small inshore boat, possibly disabled, could sail from Malin Head to Killybegs, and it is equally fantastic to suggest that another boat owner should take a disabled boat in tow from Malin Head to Killybegs, and then come back.  There is, in addition, the matter of the fisherman's time and the cost of the fuel required to tow a boat that distance. This is a highly retrograde step and I hope that whoever advised it will be overruled.  I assume that the technical reason for placing the boat yard at Meevagh was that it is in the centre of the coast-fishing beds, and also to give employment in a poor and congested district.</P>
    <P>There is, first, the point with regard to men having accommodation for the building of new boats and the repair of damaged boats and, secondly, the position of these ten or 12 families who live by working in the boat yard.  From the point of view of these families, this proposal is a cruel one.  What is to happen to these families, I do not know.  They cannot be taken to Killybegs because there is no place there for them.  It means complete paralysis for them and I suggest that the proposal is highly retrograde and technically wrong.  I hope it will not be given effect to.  It is proposal which <Col N="1628" /> would place a burden on the small inshore fishermen which they could not bear.</P>
    <P>As I have referred to Meevagh and to Downings, I might also refer to the cooperage.  During the war, the cooperage was closed down because of lack of material for making barrels and boxes for fish, and the Minister has said nothing about what is to be done with regard to providing barrels and boxes in connection with the curing of herring.  The premises are there, and I should like to see that little industry being resumed.  The coopers were idle all during the war and, I expect, had no income except the few shillings dole they got.  They are expert coopers with technical training, but I expect they could not find employment elsewhere, and I urge that the earliest opportunity should be availed of to secure material to put these men working again because they suffered a lot during the war.</P>
    <P>I heartily approve of the Minister's suggestion with regard to trawlers.  It is a step which should have been taken long ago and one fails to appreciate why it was not taken long ago.  It is not possible to get a pound of fish in any country town on any day of the week, much less on Fridays and other days of abstinence during the Lenten season, and it is a terrible commentary on our lack of organisation that a country like this, which has so much wealth invested elsewhere, is unable to invest sufficient money in an industry which would provide good, wholesome food for the people, and particularly the poorer sections, at a price they could afford.  There is not a town in this State, outside Dublin, in which, on Friday or any other day, it is possible to buy a pound of fish, although we are surrounded by the sea which teems with fish.  England, a great meat-eating country, lands enormous quantities of fish every day in the week although the majority of the people there are not bound in the matter of eating fish to the same extent as we are bound.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which must be tackled in an organised way, with vision and with a plan behind the <Col N="1629" /> approach, so as to develop a taste for fish and to get the people used to it. The development of such a taste is very necessary and it is shocking to think that there is nothing available for our people on Fridays but potatoes, milk, tea and bread when they could have good fish.  I thoroughly approve of the proposal to purchase a trawler.  I think that two or three of these trawlers should be secured, because one trawler may be disabled and laid up for a considerable period at a crucial time of the year.  We could well afford to go further and secure two, if not three, trawlers and it would be money well spent.  One of these could be held in reserve and I think it would be rather too conservative to invest in only one, in view of the fact that the carrying out of repairs, in the event of the trawler being disabled, would take a considerable time.</P>
    <P>With regard to the development of the margarine industry, it has often occurred to me&mdash;it may have been done already, but nothing has been stated in this House, or, so far as I know, outside it&mdash;that there should be an examination of the possibility of getting a quota of whale oils and fats for the manufacture of this commodity. We passed a Whaling Act some years ago.  It was, of course, somewhat of a joke, in so far as the machinery in that Bill was not concerned with providing anything substantial for this country.  It was a kind of nominal matter in relation to protection.  I should like to know if, at the conference recently held in London, there was any discussion as to our right&mdash; we being technically a contributor in the matter, and, I take it, prepared to go further, should the demand arise &mdash;to get from any of these other countries a quota of whale products for the manufacture of margarine and for other purposes.</P>
    <P>Are the whale products that are used in the making of margarine, and for other purposes, in this country bought in the open market and has the Minister any information on that particular point?  Have the manufacturers to go to the local market to buy, or do they get a quota because of the limited supply available?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1630" /> On the Supplementary Vote, I do not think I have very much to say except that it is a very just measure. The <i>ex gratia</i> grant is well founded and eminently justified; and I think the Minister is wise in taking this step until such time as we will be aware of the average price to be paid for these estuaries and the fishing rights in them. When that matter comes to be decided we must, of course, keep always before our minds the fact that the returns from these estuaries vary a good deal. We shall have to keep that fact in mind when finally adjusting the amount of money, if any, to be paid to the owners of these fisheries.  I myself can see a problem arising from this because of the limiting of the fishing in fresh water and in the estuaries. Naturally, if we limit the number of nets on the estuaries larger quantities of salmon will pass up the river to the spawning beds and, in five or six years after any given year, there will be an enormous increase in the numbers of salmon returning to the rivers.</P>
    <P>If you limit the number of nets to a certain number of people these people will ultimately reap an enormous harvest and they will make an enormous amount of money out of the salmon fishery.  The people who hitherto fished in these estuaries and who are refused licences will, of course, be penalised. In the majority of cases these men are very poor and they have no other means of livelihood except what they make during the salmon season, which lasts for about six weeks in the summer time.  When we come to put this into operation I think we shall have to consider seriously making some reparation to these men.  It would be a great hardship on men, who are now 50 years of age and over, and who have been fishing in these estuaries all their lives, if their livelihood is taken away from them without any attempt being made at some adequate compensation.  In my opinion, the amount of salmon caught on the rod would never affect the supply.  It is only where there is intensive poaching that the fry is destroyed and if the rivers are adequately protected and efficiently policed I do not think it would be necessary to put these men out of <Col N="1631" /> employment in the estuaries.  However, that is another day's work and the matter will come before us again when the 1939 Act is put into operation.</P>
    <P>Again, I would like to come back once more to my plea on behalf of the fishermen from Malin Head to Burtonport. A grave hardship will be imposed on these men.  If the Minister has come to a decision in the matter I would ask him now to review it; if the matter has not come before him for a final decision I would ask him to turn down that suggestion, no matter who has made it.  It seems to me that what happened was, somebody looked at the map with some idea of centralisation at the back of his mind and said: &ldquo;We will take them all round as far as Killybegs&rdquo;.  All the Minister has to do in this connection is to ask whoever made that suggestion why it is that Killybegs boat yard was never a success.  The answer is because there were never fishing boats at Killybegs yard.  There was fishing accommodation at Teelin up to some 18 months ago. The Congested Districts Board had provided accommodation for the fishermen at Teelin.  There was a deep sea pier there; there was shelter there and it was some 20 to 40 miles nearer to the fishing beds than Killybegs.  I have been told that the accommodation there has been sold to some private individual and the local fishermen have now no accommodation at all for the landing of fish and they must, therefore, take it round to Killybegs.  I cannot understand why that accommodation should have been sold.  The maintenance of it never cost very much.  The Congested Districts Board maintained it during all those years when it was in existence. These fishermen are for the most part poor and in a small way of business, though highly efficient.  At Teelin there was a good harbour with plenty of deep water at all periods of the year.  I think Deputy McFadden raised this matter in the House within the last 12 months.  Has the matter been finally disposed of?  Have the pier and sheds erected by the Congested Districts Board been disposed of to a private individual and has the <Col N="1632" /> conveyance been completed?  Surely, that was one little piece of property which was a valuable asset to the State and which could have been maintained as an asset to the State for the accommodation of these people who have fished there all their lives and behind whom there is a long tradition of fishing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious on the Minister's figures that the inshore fishermen in this country have enjoyed a very prosperous year.  The Minister, however, must remember that the prosperity in the industry in the past six years is due to the fact that there was a great scarcity of fish in England because at the outbreak of the war the majority of the trawlers were taken over by the Admiralty and used for war purposes.  Since the cessation of hostilities the British Admiralty has released a large number of trawlers and to-day the English fishermen are in a position to supply the needs of their own people; and it is becoming increasingly more difficult for us to sell our surplus fish in England.  The situation is becoming very serious now. Unless something radical is done and a more progressive policy adopted by the present Government there can be no future for the fishing industry.  The fishing industry is very important and valuable and it would be a tragedy if it were again to experience a depression such as it went through after the 1914-18 war.  Therefore, I would impress upon the Minister that he should do everything in his power to help the industry.  In the part of South Kerry where I live, most of the fishermen engage in the industry for only certain portions of the year.  They are generally small farmers who would find it impossible to support themselves and their families if it were not for the money they earn in fishing.  These fishermen are very disappointed that the Government have not made a seriour effort to help the trade.  They realise that the action taken by the Government is not sufficient to meet the problems which must be faced in the near future.  I admit, of course, that the Sea Fisheries Association has done a certain amount of good work, but I warn the Minister that the <Col N="1633" /> activities of that association are not sufficient to get the industry on a sound working basis.  I am glad that the Minister has announced his intention to do something for the industry, but I am very disappointed that he was not in a position to indicate more fully the general policy which his Ministry intends to adopt.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to hear the Minister state that he intends, at last, to set up a deep-sea trawling fleet.  At the present time we have a number of small trawlers, particularly in Dingle Bay.  These trawlers are able to supply our home market with prime fish.  Generally speaking, our home market is in a position to consume all the prime fish landed in this country but, in a short time, we will find that our territorial waters have been over-fished and then the question will be asked: where can we get prime fish and, I am certain, there will be a scarcity of prime fish in this country. Therefore, it is absolutely essential that we should have a deep-sea fishing fleet.  I am not suggesting, of course, that we should have such a fleet to compete for the English market with the British fleet.  That would be very unwise on our part when we remember that after the 1914-18 war the British trawling companies found it difficult to make the boats pay.  We should have sufficient boats to give a constant supply of fish to the home market.</P>
      <P>Of course, the question which the Minister must consider, if he intends to set up a deep-sea fishing fleet, is where is he going to get the crews to man them.  It must be admitted that the fishermen in this country have not experience of working these boats. Therefore, the Minister should have apprentices trained immediately so that they may be in a position to take over and man these boats.  The question is, will we get the young men for that purpose?  I am doubtful, unless the Minister shows that he is serious in his attempt to help the industry. The young men who are expected to become apprentices to that trade must have a sense of security in their jobs because, otherwise, we will not get the young men, especially young men of the right type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1634" /> The great difficulty in the fishing industry will be, not to dispose of the prime fish, but to dispose of the surplus quantities of mackerel and herring landed.  At the present time we can send all our supplies to the British market, but it is becoming more obvious day by day that the English people do not require our fish.  If we cannot find a means of disposing of the surplus quantities of mackerel and herring, there is absolutely no future in the industry.  In the past, we were able to dispose of our surplus mackerel and herring by curing it and sending the mackerel to the American market and the herring to the Continent.  The American market for mackerel is gone. There is no point in indicating why it has gone, but the fact remains that it is no longer available and I do not think we will ever again secure a market there, except on a very limited scale.  Unless we find some means of using our surplus mackerel and herring it will be almost impossible to make fishing pay in this country.  The only possibility I can see of disposing of our surplus fish is to keep it for periods of scarcity during the winter months by the method of quick freezing. The Minister says that that is bound to come.  Therefore, I presume that the representatives of the Sea Fisheries Association who were shown over the experimental station which the British Government have established in Scotland are satisfied that it is a practical proposition.  If it is a practical proposition I think they should disclose the matter to those interested in the fishing industry in this country.  The Minister must remember that the Sea Fisheries Association handle only a very small quantity of the fish landed in this country and it would be of very great benefit if the facts that the Sea Fisheries Association had at their disposal in regard to the British experiment could be disclosed to the trade. If quick freezing is not a success, personally, I cannot see any hope for the fishing industry in this country.</P>
    <P>I have often in this House drawn the Minister's attention to the matter of the transport provided by Córas Iompair Éireann for fish.  Those interested <Col N="1635" /> in the fishing industry are not at all satisfied with the transport provided. We know, of course, that Córas Iompair Éireann have difficulties in the matter of fuel, etc.  It must be noted, however, that it takes fish shipped from Valentia Harbour and Dingle 24 hours longer to reach the British market than it did in the year 1943. Unless we have the same shipping transport which we had in 1943 and prior to 1943, in a very short time, fish buyers will not send fish to England during periods of warm weather. In periods of warm weather the English markets would be glutted and it would be impossible for buyers of fish here to dispose of it.  I know that the railway companies have their difficulties, but I would impress upon the Minister the necessity of trying to secure for the fishing industry the same shipping and transport facilities which they enjoyed in 1943.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that, in an indirect way, the railway company have endeavoured to increase the freight on fish from Valentia Island and Dingle. In the last three or four years there was an arrangement between the fish merchants in Valentia Island and Dingle and the railway company whereby a margarine box of fish and ice would be accepted at an average weight of 1 qr. 14 lb. and 1 qr. 16 lb. That has continued for three years. This year the merchants were informed by the officials of Córas Iompair Éireann that the weight would be increased to 1 qr. 24 lb.  That would represent an increase of approximately 10d. a box.</P>
    <P>The fish merchants, of course, opposed this increase and, by way of compromise, the officials of Córas Iompair Éireann said that they would accept it at an average weight of 1 qr. 20 lb. The merchants pointed out to the railway company that the fishing industry, as it were, has its back to the wall and is fighting for its existence and that increase of rates would be a severe blow to them.  If that weight was accepted, it would mean that the fishermen would receive 1/6 less per 100, that is, per 126 fish. <Col N="1636" /> At the present time to send a box of fish from Valentia Harbour to London entails an expenditure of 6/-.  That amount is necessary to cover all expenses. This increase in freight would mean a cost of 6/6 to send the box to London.  The most we can get for our fish in Great Britain is 5/2 a stone, so it will be seen that the fishermen will have a very small margin of profit.  The fishermen cannot stand a reduction of 1/6 per 100 in connection with their fish.  Their gear is dear and scarce.  The Minister should take this matter up with Córas Iompair Éireann and he should point out to them that in the opinion of the fish merchants at Valentia Harbour and Dingle the trade cannot stand this increase in freight.</P>
    <P>It amuses me when I see the Government providing fishermen with boats and gear when they have never taken any step to provide them with a place in which they could keep their boats during the winter months.  We have many fine natural harbours, but where the harbours are not good and where there are fishing fleets, surely it should be the Government's duty to see that proper piers and boat shelters are constructed, where the boats can be kept during the winter months?  I have constantly raised this aspect with reference to Valentia Harbour, but so far no effort has been made to develop that port. At present over 40 boats are at Renard Point, Valentia Harbour.  I recently made inquiries as to the value of fish landed at that port.  In 1941 there were 53,642 cwt. of mackerel landed, worth £109,000; in 1945 there were 48,690 cwt. of mackerel landed there.  That indicates that it is one of the most important fishing places we have.</P>
    <P>The landing facilities there are simply scandalous.  There is a small slip-way which was never intended for a fishing fleet.  It was only intended as a landing place for people going to and coming from Valentia Island.  I have seen the boats queueing up in order to unload their fish.  Time after time I have seen fishermen unable to land their fish in time for the train.  Frequently, owing to lack of accommodation, the fishermen have suffered a substantial reduction <Col N="1637" /> in prices.  I cannot understand why that port has not been developed. Whenever this matter is raised we are told that the cost would be too high. At the same time money can be procured to develop the tourist trade and to develop industries.  Large sums have been expended on agriculture.  I am not complaining of that, but I somehow think that the fishing industry has been sacrificed in order to provide money for other industries. For some reason or other it is regarded as the Cinderella of the industries.</P>
    <P>I have the feeling that if the Fisheries Department were anxious about this matter and if they suggested to the Department of Finance that the work is very necessary, the money would be provided.  I am not at all satisfied about the attitude of the Departments.  There appears to be hostility as to the development of this particular port.  It is only fair that the fishermen of one of our most important fishing ports should have a decent pier at which to land their catches and keep their boats.  Time after time boats have been unable to come alongside the pier.  In broken weather they are compelled to go three or four miles up the river in order to land fish.  The boats cannot be kept at Valentia Harbour in the winter because there is no shelter to protect them.  I urge the Minister to see that a proper pier is constructed. If a new pier would cost too much we would be satisfied to have the existing pier improved.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not indicated some plan as to how the Government intend to develop the home market.  The home market is good and safe and is well worth developing.  We hear people saying that this community is not a fish-eating community.  If you discuss this matter with Deputies many of them will tell you they never see fish in their districts. It is necessary to develop the home market because in the future we may find it difficult to dispose of our fish in England.</P>
    <P>It is essential to have our territorial waters suitably protected.  Recently I read an article in an English paper about British captains complaining <Col N="1638" /> that unless the Spanish boats are kept outside our territorial waters, the place will be over-fished.  Of course, they are not thinking of us; they fear that in the near future, when, the North Sea waters having been overfished, they move into our waters, they will find them swept clean by the Spaniards.  If we do not give our territorial waters suitable protection we will find that the small trawlers will be unable to operate.  At the moment there are 30 small trawlers in Dingle Bay.  If our territorial waters are not protected the Dingle trawlers will be unable to carry on and the fishermen will not be able to support themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>There is a great scarcity of barrels. I believe there is a limited demand for mackerel in the American markets and for herrings in the continental markets.  I know the British Board of Trade have refused to allow barrels to be exported to this country.  For that reason I would impress on the Minister the importance of getting a good supply of barrels before the season starts.  I know that every merchant is trying to secure them, but so far they have not been very successful.</P>
    <P>The fishermen complain that they find it difficult to get nets and spare parts for engines.  The Sea Fisheries Association did a good job in this connection during the war.  Very seldom did I see a boat held up through lack of gear.  The Minister should do all he can to secure nets and spare parts for engines.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister mention that it is intended to abolish or limit netting in rivers.  There is no doubt the majority of our rivers have been destroyed through over-netting. But netting is not the only cause of destroying the fish in our rivers. There is undoubtedly too much poaching. Even if we limit netting in our rivers, that will not solve the problem, unless the Minister sees that the rivers are protected from poachers.</P>
    <P>I was rather disappointed when I did not hear something about the abolition of weirs.  There is a weir at Waterville and no fish can enter <Col N="1639" /> Waterville Lake because of it.  The Minister should take that weir over so that the fish will have an opportunity of entering the lake.  The Minister must make a serious effort to help the fishing industry.  We enjoyed prosperity during the war years but I am perfectly satisfied now that unless they receive some Government assistance the fishermen will soon be unable to earn a livelihood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the total of the Estimate and the Supplementary Estimate shows an increase of something like £18,000 over last year is an indication of the lively interest now being taken in the development both of inland and sea fisheries by the Minister. Reference has been made to the protection of our fishery waters and I am tempted to ask the Minister how this is to be carried out.  I understand from those who observe matters around the coast, particularly those interested in deep sea fisheries, that frequently our waters are invaded and there is no sign of any kind of ship to protect them since the <i>Muirchu</i> went off the map. Now that we have some corvettes, I do not know whether the Minister has considered the idea of using these corvettes for the purpose of policing our seas.  It is certainly heartbreaking to see some of our fishermen with their hands tied while foreign vessels come and invade our territorial waters.  I do feel that something should be done in that direction.  There may be, perhaps, locked up in the archives of the Minister's Department, some plan for approaching this position.  If he has any such plans in the archives of his Department, it is time I think that the Minister should let the House and those people interested in deep sea fishing know where they stand in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, of course, more intimately associated and more concerned with inland fisheries because I have a greater knowledge of such fisheries.  As one who has fished both for salmon and trout over most of this country, I am not yet satisfied that either the Minister or his predecessor made any real or earnest attempt to grapple with the position.  Some speakers have made <Col N="1640" /> reference to the increase in poaching in this country.  I am aware that poaching has increased to such an extent that some of our inland fisheries, particularly trout streams and salmon rivers, have been almost denuded of fish.  I often wonder whether the Minister or the actuaries in his Department have made any calculation as to the value of the brown trout fisheries to this country.  I have been given an estimate&mdash;of course, a rough estimate.  I have been told that the value of the brown trout fishing in this country is between £1,500,000 and £2,000,000.  Of course, I just mention that figure as one I heard given by some people who, whilst not actuaries, are still useful in making calculations of that kind.  It is only a rough estimate, but even taking the figure as represented by X, those who have any experience at all of inland fishing in this country must know that the brown trout fisheries especially and the salmon trout fisheries have always attracted the best elements of the sporting fraternity across Channel.  I think it will be admitted by anybody who has any experience at all that these sportmen who come across from Britain and elsewhere for the salmon and brown trout fishing proved a very useful asset indeed when they were very badly wanted in this country.  If one wants any proof of that statement, which I have made on more than one occasion during debates on Estimates for this Department, I would ask them to go to any of the lakes or rivers in Kerry or Donegal.  They will see there the interest taken by visiting sportsmen in the rivers and lakes.  I was in Killarney over the week-end for about four days and I can assure you that I heard more English accents than native accents there.  The presence of these people is not due entirely to desire for a good feed, as we heard stated recently, but is principally due to the attraction of fishing alone.</P>
    <P>I notice that under sub-head F (2)&mdash; brown trout hatchery experiments&mdash; for which a sum of £70 was formerly provided, there is now a sum of £200 set apart.  I am wondering is that enough.  I do not see anything at all <Col N="1641" /> by way of grants, not that I am in the habit of urging grants, because I believe, as an individualist, that God helps those who help themselves but I am wondering has the Minister even considered the desirability of encouraging private hatcheries.  I know that the Department are very generous in giving ova to anglers' associations and others.  I am connected with two or three of these associations and we have on occasions got ova and trout from the Minister's Department.  They have been very generous.  I pay tribute to the officials of the Department for the zeal and interest they have displayed in anglers' associations who have hatcheries of their own but I have a feeling that a little more encouragement should be given to clubs who have established hatcheries because they are adding to the national wealth.  There is a very great danger that when we release young fish every year, often as yearlings or year and a half fish, that due to the lack of civic spirit in the country, children coming from school and others will pick these small fish out of the shallows.  That negatives to a very large extent the very good and useful work that has been done by people in charge of these private hatcheries.  When I use the term &ldquo;private hatchery&rdquo; I mean not alone a hatchery run by a private person but a hatchery run by private clubs, without any help from outside beyond getting some ova or yearling trout from the Department.</P>
    <P>Any of us associated with fishing from a sporting point of view must note with alarm the increase in poaching. The conservators in the various districts have been pretty active, but notwithstanding all their activities they are not in a position to employ more bailiffs.  I fear if the industry is to be preserved in this country, the Government themselves will have to establish a section in the police forces of the country to take on the policing of rivers.  I agree that that will certainly mean an increase in the personnel of the Gárda Síochána.  At the moment the Gárda Síochána are doing marvellous work.  They have acted on dozens of occasions as prosecutors of people who have been engaged in taking fish during the close season and <Col N="1642" /> in killing under-sized fish in some of the rivers, but the Gárdaí cannot be everywhere.  There should be a section of the Gárdaí for this particular purpose in various districts where there are rivers which, if properly looked after, would produce splendid fish.  In turn, the preservation of these fish would mean the spending of more money in this country.</P>
    <P>In addition to the activities of the ordinary poacher as we know him, there is a system of poaching which was not quite unknown, but which grew to abnormal dimensions during the war because of the big prices offered for fish across the Channel.  I refer to night lines which have been used in all parts of the country during the last few years. In many cases they have denuded small rivers of fair sized fish.  I could bring the Minister to two or three very fine streams running into the Lee where it was easy in the past to get 1 lb., 1½ lb., or 1¾ lb. fish but where you could now not get fish weighing three ounces, all due to the operation of persons with night lines.  If it was pointed out in the homes and in the schools that that was an injury to the State, and was an offence, I think there would be far better fishing generally.  Some people may say that we can get on without inland fishing.  We could do without many amenities and survive, but I should like to see this country maintaining its reputation as a paradise for anglers.  We have little enough to offer without depriving sportsmen, whether they be English, Scottish or Irish of the pleasure of good fishing.</P>
    <P>I should also like to see the Minister considering the issuing of all-in licences. I know that there he will be up against the various conservators who do not want interference with their rights in fishing areas.  At the same time it is hard lines on an angler who pays a couple of pounds for a licence to find that when he moves to other fishing areas he is charged an additional 10/-. If there could be an all-in licence, with which an angler could go from one area to another, having paid whatever amount of duty the Department had fixed, I think that would have a very <Col N="1643" /> beneficial effect and would attract more anglers.</P>
    <P>On the whole the Minister's statements indicate that he is taking a lively interest in the fisheries, and he has increased his Estimate very considerably this year.  I commend to his particular attention the necessity for helping conservators and others engaged in protecting the rivers.  The small streams are now denuded of sizable fish and, unless protected, in a short time they may not be worth protecting.</P>

      <P>I think now is the time for the Minister to demonstrate to the country our faith in the inland fisheries.  A good opportunity arises after the period of prosperity associated with the fishing industry owing to the war situation.  It is rather unhappy that prosperity only came to the fishing industry in such circumstances as existed for the last five or six years.  I am glad to observe that the Estimate for boats and gear has been substantially increased.  Very much more could be done in that way for the industry.  The question of the home market should be surveyed again and an intensive effort made to have supplies of fish in areas throughout the country where they are not usually available.  The position in that respect has improved and in certain towns in West Cork, 15 or 20 miles from the sea, the improvement is noticeable.  I believe there is a great opportunity for a tremendous development in that respect, but it all resolves itself into the provision of suitable transport.  No matter what may be said to the contrary, our people would readily avail of the opportunity to use fresh fish once or twice every week if they could get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1644" /> I want to be helpful in this matter, and I urge on the Minister the importance of pushing on with marine works that are necessary for the development of the industry.  Something has been done in that respect.  I must say that any representations made by me to the Department's officials have always been given the fullest consideration.  What I would like to see would be a national policy that would afford facilities on a much more generous scale along the coast than was contemplated in the past.  A proposal was made some years ago to have certain experiments in deep-sea fishing carried out, and it was suggested that the Department might make a boat available for that purpose at Kinsale.  I should like if the Minister could inform the House if anything has been done in that regard.</P>

      <P>It was pleasant to listen to the Minister introducing his Estimate for the fisheries. It showed that there is a genuine interest being taken by the Department in the industry generally.  I represent a constituency where grievances arise from time to time in regard to the fishing industry, at Loughshinny, Balbriggan, Rush, Howth and other areas. I have made repeated representations to the Sea Fisheries Association with regard to gluts of fish.  The Loughshinny fishermen have complained sometimes that they have sent fish into the Dublin market which scarcely ever reached the controlled price, and, again, that they have sent fish in for which the price has hardly paid the cost of carriage into the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Deputies have referred to the possibility of getting our people to eat more fish.  We criticise the Government for interfering too much in the various private enterprises, but in this connection I am forced by the fishermen whom I represent in County Dublin to ask the Minister and the Sea Fisheries Association if there is any possibility of the establishment of fish depots in the inland towns.  The fishing industry gives a good deal of employment and the fishermen are definitely up against it in trying to get proper markets for their fish.  If we are to get our people to eat more fish, <Col N="1645" /> the marketing of fish will have to be handled in a practical way, so that the people in inland towns will get fish in fresh condition and so that rotten fish will not be put on the market for them.  The only way in which that can be done is by having the business handled by the Department directly concerned with the industry, because the trouble with private individuals is that they will not handle fish properly for sale in the local towns, with the result that the public&mdash;I hope I am not being uncharitable in saying this &mdash;are asked to buy fish which is almost tainted.  That will kill the trade.  The only way to deal with the problem is by financing it on a national basis and by the establishment of fish depots in the large inland towns and in that way ensure that our people will get decent fresh fish.  The position heretofore has been that the people have bought fish once and have never bought it again. I am glad to hear the Minister is considering acquiring deep-sea trawlers, which will be a help to the fishermen.</P>
    <P>With regard to boats, I have had a number of complaints, from Howth especially.  In years gone by, Howth was the premier fishing port on the east coast, but to-day the fishermen of Howth are in a bad way for lack of suitable boats.  The Minister has already intimated to me his willingness to help these fishermen when boats again become available.  I suggest that the Minister should give more encouragement to the districts I have mentioned&mdash;Howth is not so bad &mdash;such as Balbriggan, Loughshinny and Rush.  There is in Balbriggan a harbour about which the fishermen have made several complaints&mdash;I merely mention the harbour for the purpose of my argument&mdash;and I should like to see a little more co-ordination between the Department of Agriculture and the harbour authority with a view to improving the position there.  I am sorry that I have to say of Balbriggan that the harbour is not what it ought to be from the fishing point of view.</P>

      <P>The same applies to Loughshinny, where there is not even a light in the harbour, and it is only within the last few weeks that, after much representation, we succeeded in getting electric light for Rush harbour.  I wonder if it would be possible to establish in each fishing village a fairly large cold storage premises.  It happens occasionally that there is a glut of fish on the market and fishermen are scarcely able to get a price which will cover the cost of carriage into the city, and, if these cold storage facilities were provided, it would be possible to hold the fish over. Fishing is such a haphazard trade that every effort ought to be made to encourage those engaged in it.  With regard to gear and other requirements, the Sea Fisheries Association have done their best to provide supplies of which the fishermen have been short. The dredging of Howth harbour is another matter which the Minister might have considered, now that there is a possibility of getting larger boats. I should like to see larger boats put into service.  A number of my constituents have only small boats, with the result that they have to return from the fishing grounds after a few hours' fishing and have to depend on reasonably fair weather, and I am glad to hear that the Minister proposes to make certain provisions in this connection. Finally, I want to urge the Minister and the Department to do everything possible to encourage the sale of fish.  It can be done only on the basis of a nation-wide campaign, by the proper handling of fish and by the establishment of special fish depots in the large inland towns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister looked, perhaps, a little bit embarrassed when Deputy Burke was paying him compliments on his expert knowledge of fisheries generally.  I think he should be definitely embarrassed when Deputy Burke, or any other Deputy, compliments him upon <Col N="1649" /> the originality of his introductory statement because, as far as my recollection goes, many of the points which the Minister made in introducing his Estimate this year were made by him in other years and many of the promises which he made and many of the hopes which he held out were likewise made and held out by him in previous years.  The Minister referred to the steps which he is taking to promote deep-sea trawling and to bring about the establishment of a deep-sea trawling company.  I think he expressed similar hopes last year&mdash;or, if not last year, certainly in the year prior to that.  So far very little has been done in this direction.  I was somewhat puzzled by one point made by the Minister in reference to this particular type of fishing.  He said that the deep-sea trawling company would essentially have to be complementary to the inshore fishing and would not engage in any type of fishing which would be in competition with inshore fishermen.  As one who has not any great knowledge of fisheries generally, this particular point struck me as being rather peculiar.  It would seem to me that, if we are to equip a deep-sea trawling company, that company should go out to catch all the fish that are available within the area under their control.  I would imagine that the prime objective of both deep-sea fishing and inshore fishing should be to catch all the fish that can be obtained in order to increase the volume of output to the largest possible extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not quite grasp the figures which the Minister gave in regard to the total volume of fish caught last year or in regard to the value of the fish caught.  I think he gave a figure of £628,000 as the value of the fish caught.  I do not think he gave any figure as to the value of the inshore fish caught; but I can imagine that, even if he did give a figure, it would be very difficult to get a reliable figure as regards the inshore fisheries or the volume of fish caught.  I suppose the only method of obtaining such statistics would be to obtain an accurate account from the people engaged in the fisheries and I am not <Col N="1650" /> at all sure that such an account would be either very reliable or very accurate; but it might at the same time, perhaps, be just as reliable as some of the statistics upon which the Minister has very often to rely.</P>
    <P>Last year I asked a question as to whether investigations had been made into the disease which led to the destruction of the fish in the Liffey Reservoir.  I understand that the trout were almost completely destroyed there by some unidentifiable disease. The fish in the reservoir now are again quite healthy and I would be very interested to know if investigations had shown to the Department what was the nature of the disease which destroyed the fish in the first instance and whether it is likely to recur in the future.  This is an important matter because it will affect our inland lakes in the event of our being able to restock them and increase the amount of fish therein and the feeding available for them.  I believe that there is a future for our fisheries in our inland lakes if they are restocked, and even if it is necessary to introduce some type of additional feeding for them.  I think that particular industry is capable of enormous development.</P>
    <P>I would be glad if the Minister, when replying, would give the House some indication or some information as to the extent to which native industry is competent to supply boats for fishing and fishing equipment.  That, too, is a very useful industry associated directly with fishing and one which requires development and encouragement.  Another matter of supreme importance is the proper development of our harbours and piers for the landing of our fish and the protection of our boats.  This is a matter which should not be neglected.  All pressure should be brought to bear by the Department of Fisheries on the other Departments concerned in this direction to ensure that proper harbours are provided and proper protection available for our fishing fleets.  One outstanding fact which strikes every person residing in inland counties in this country is the complete absence of fish for sale in our inland towns.  There is practically no fish for sale in any of our inland towns.  If <Col N="1651" /> fish were provided in proper condition and in suitably equipped shops the demand would greatly increase.  While we export a very considerable amount of fish, we import large quantities.  In 1938, which would be regarded as the last normal year, the value of the fish imported was £146,000.  The greater portion of that was tinned or preserved fish.  With suitable organisation it should be possible to secure that market and a great deal more.  Even while we import a quantity of fish, there is a large section of our population who cannot buy fish and who would use fish if it were available to them. Therefore, there is a very big home market awaiting development.</P>
    <P>I do not entirely agree with Deputy Burke and other Deputies who suggested that the Department or the Sea Fisheries Association should go into the business of retailing fish.  Private enterprise should be capable of that operation.  It might be possible, and I think it would be desirable, for an organisation such as the Sea Fisheries Association to regulate or control in some way the manner of distribution, that is, to see that persons who act as agents for the sale of fish in towns and cities are properly qualified and equipped for that business and will carry it on in a manner conducive to the interests of the industry.  We know that companies engaged in the wholesale motor and petrol trade, for instance, regulate the manner in which their agents carry on their business. An organisation such as the Sea Fisheries Association should see that their fish is marketed and sold in proper condition.  That is only elementary good business.  If such precautions are taken, I do not think it should be necessary for the Department or the association to engage directly in the retail of fish.</P>
    <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with Deputy Anthony when he speaks about the inroads made upon the supplies of fish in our inland rivers by poachers, but if proper facilities are given and if suitable opportunity were afforded to the poorer sections of our community to engage in this occupation, they would not infringe upon the <Col N="1652" /> rights of others.  This matter was discussed when the Fisheries Bill was before the House and it was strongly urged on that occasion that licences should be made available as cheaply as possible so that all sections of the people could engage in fishing.  One Deputy talked about educating the young people in the protection of the rights of others.  Personally, my only experience of fishing was when as a small boy I engaged in fishing for trout with a sack fixed on a forked stick with a little bit of wire netting on the bottom.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mícheál Óg Mac Pháidín referred to the protection of our territorial waters and spawning grounds.  He indicated that that is a matter that might have been dealt with by the recent International Fishery Conference.  I put down a question to the Minister on that very matter and I was informed that it was not a fit subject for that particular conference and that it was not in fact raised by our representative there.  I agree with Deputy Mac Pháidín that this is a matter of supreme importance to Irish sea fisheries.  If that particular conference was not competent to deal with it, I would ask the Minister to say when replying what international conference is competent to deal with the question of the alteration of the territorial waters limit.  I agree with Deputy Mac Pháidín that further protection than is now available should be afforded.  The consensus of opinion of those who are interested in sea fisheries is that, in all fairness, the limit should be extended, in view of the efficiency of the catching equipment, to at least ten miles.  There will be progressive deterioration in the sea fisheries if the limit of three miles <Col N="1653" /> is retained in face of the ever improving catching facilities.</P>
      <P>On the question of the establishment of a deep-sea trawling fleet, I believe the Minister's advisers are satisfied that there will not be any conflict of interest between such a fleet and the inshore organisation which has been built up.  I should like to feel the same confidence as the Minister's advisers feel in the matter.  I cannot see how the two ideas can be dovetailed into each other.  It is all very well to make plans on the basis of war-time experience but we all know that war time is a particularly good time for selling fish or any other food product.</P>
      <P>Always after a war we experience a lean period.  It seems to me that the English market will not be the plum that it was during the war years.  You will have the North Sea fleet out again in full blast in, I suppose, a very short time.  If there is a future for a deep-sea fishing fleet, I think the Minister would be well advised to leave that matter to a private enterprise.  If the project has any future, there ought to be sufficient private enterprise available in this country to undertake it. If the Minister undertakes it, even in an indirect way, and if it should fail, he will get the full blast of criticism afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to answer a question which I put to him on a few occasions.  I am anxious to know when is it his intention to implement a promise made to us, when the Inland Fisheries Bill was introduced, to reconstitute the boards of conservators. These, as the Minister knows, are repositories of privileges and of rights which are begrudged to anglers and sporting men generally.  I think the time has come when these rights and privileges should be spread out more. The average man is entitled to a little enjoyment on our rivers.  Fishing associations are now becoming numerous and the Minister has at hand very suitable instruments to which he could transfer, either in whole or in part, the duties heretofore carried on by those boards of conservators.  He promised that amending legislation would be brought in and that these bodies would <Col N="1654" /> be democratised, to a greater extent than they are, in any event.  I should like the Minister to indicate if it is the intention in the near future to fulfil that promise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter I would like to mention to the Minister.  He did not make any statement on it, and yet I feel that it must be faced sooner or later.  I have in mind the question of pollution.  We have got pollution all round the coast from sewage and from industrial discharges. There is no doubt that inland towns are able to get over their sewage disposal problems.  I know it is a very big, technical subject, but sooner or later it will have to be faced by the Minister.  You could not eat the shell fish found around Dublin, as the Minister indicated in his reply to me to-day when I asked him a question on the subject. I do not know if the Government feel that they could ultimately clean the shores of this island or will they have to allow them to get worse and worse as industries grow and discharges into the sea become more frequent?</P>
      <P>I am sure that the spread of arterial drainage will bring down a whole lot of matter from inland waters to the sea. The fish could ascend those waters if they were kept clean, but if they are contaminated in the way some of the waters are, it means that no fish can live in those waters and oysters found within miles of those places cannot be used.  I think the Minister should face the problem and see if anything can be done.  We have heard of places where the disposal of sewage, when treated, is profitable.  I cannot believe that could happen to us, situated geographically as we are, but if it could be done, it would make a very big increase in the amenities along parts of our coast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it has been agreed generally that progress in the fishing industry in the future will depend upon the consumption of fish. We are told by those intimately interested in that industry that, now the war is over, Great Britain will be in a position to supply almost all her needs.  I think that will be generally accepted.  We have an advantage over <Col N="1655" /> the people of Great Britain in so far as we have so many fast days and days of abstinence.  Take the Lenten period. In rural Ireland, in the small towns and villages, it is a rare thing to see fish on sale.  Who is to be blamed for that?  I do not know.  The past Government and the present Government have not taken sufficient interest in the development of the fishing industry. In County Mayo any fish on sale there come from Dublin, a distance of 130 or 160 miles as the case may be, the further west you go.</P>
      <P>In the West of Ireland there are as good fishermen as you will find in Kerry, Dublin or Galway, but there is no encouragement, no market wherein they could dispose of their fish.  We have Lecanvey, Blacksod and other places.  In Lecanvey there is no pier or proper landing-place.  There are a number of people in that area who are very interested in developing the fishing industry if they were provided with proper facilities and got encouragement. Mayo is a county that has been very much neglected in the past.  Since I entered this House the needs of Mayo have scarcely been considered at all.  That has been particularly noticeable in connection with the development of the turf industry. I think the claims of the county so far as the development of fishing is concerned should receive sympathetic consideration from the Government unless they consider that Mayo is outside their jurisdiction altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to develop and encourage the consumption of fish, fish will have to be marketed in an up-to-date manner, particularly from the point of view of cleanliness.  If we had in each town one fish merchant who could cater for the retail of fish under proper conditions&mdash;with plenty of ice and marble slabs to display the fish instead of confining them in some old box or barn where one would have to stuff one's nostrils because of the stench&mdash;our people generally would consume a good deal more fish than they are doing at present.  In the same way as a person will not eat at a table at which the cutlery and other appointments are not clean, people will not buy fish if the <Col N="1656" /> conditions under which they are sold are not clean and hygienic.  I think we would have a splendid market for good fish in this country if it were properly developed.  It has been a great cause of complaint in my county that during the Lenten period and indeed at other seasons of the year, not as much as a herring can be got for love or money.  The old folk who have still a liking for fish&mdash;as far as the young are concerned they have no liking for it, because they never had an opportunity of developing a taste for it as the fish was not available&mdash;often say: &ldquo;How is it that since we got a native Government, we cannot get any fish&rdquo;. That is the cry in practically every town in my county.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bartley stole some of my thunder in his references to the privileged section of the people.  That was what I meant when Deputy Anthony talked about the Mayo mentality.  I do not care whether he may describe it as a Galway mentality, a Mayo mentality or a Connaught mentality, but I regard it as the working-man's mentality.  If he thinks that the working-man has not as much right to enjoy these privileges as any person who comes here from abroad, any person whose sole claim to the exclusive use of these privileges is that he can produce a wallet of notes, and use this country as a happy hunting ground, then the Deputy cannot claim to be representing the people.  I think that the time has come when legislation should be introduced to ensure for our own people the enjoyment of these perfectly legitimate rights, so that they will be placed within the reach of everybody, rich and poor, simple and gentle.  That is my attitude to this question but I apologise to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for having interrupted the Deputy.  I was beginning to doze off while the Deputy was speaking but I could not go to sleep listening to such nonsense.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister has returned to the House, I should like again to mention the claims of Lecanvey, a district near Westport.  One of my colleagues, Deputy Kilroy, has informed me that he understands the people there are getting a grant for the erection of a pier.  I hope the Minister will <Col N="1657" /> give them every encouragement in their efforts to have that pier erected and that if deep-sea trawlers become available, the claims of the people of that district will be considered sympathetically because, as I have already said, Mayo has been very much neglected of late.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of protection of our deep-sea fisheries, not only the Spaniards but even the French have got the impertinence to come inside our territorial waters.  I think the Government should see that every possible protection will be forthcoming to ensure that our territorial waters will be defended against any outsiders who may attempt to fish within these waters.  I should like to repeat that the development of the fishing industry will depend to a large extent on the manner in which the fish are presented for sale to our people.  A lot will also depend on the facilities made available for fishermen who are prepared to spend their time and risk their lives in this very dangerous occupation.  On these two things, the conditions under which the fish are marketed and the facilities which are made available for the fishermen, will depend the success of the industry.  I think our people have as much, if not a greater liking for fish as the people of any other country and they will consume all the fish that can be made available.</P>

I hold that the lakes and rivers, the coastal and deep-sea fisheries of the country, are the property of the people of the country and, as in the instance when compensation was provided for the confiscators of our land, I want to put on record my objection, at all events, to the proposition to provide compensation for those who confiscated our fishing rights in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want particularly to refer to the Minister's warning of his intention to put into operation in 1948 the recent <Col N="1658" /> Fishery Act passed by this House, particularly with regard to the disposal of net licences in the estuary fisheries.  We are very much concerned with that decision in my constituency because the Boyne is well known as one of the biggest salmon fisheries in the State outside the Shannon itself.  I would ask the Minister to consider seriously the methods he will adopt when he comes to reduce the number of nets or the abolition of net fishing altogether on the River Boyne.  Not only many people in the villages of Baltray and Mornington but many urban dwellers in the town of Drogheda make their living from net fishing.  It may be only a seasonal occupation but it is a very important one for these men and their families.  I have a suspicion that the people who will come here every season to enjoy fishing as a pastime will be getting more consideration than the people who have actually to earn their living and maintain their families through net fishing.  I hope the Minister will not be too drastic when he comes to make a decision on these matters.</P>
    <P>I am going to open a very old sore, one with which the Minister is very well acquainted and that is the provision of a septic tank for the mussel industry on the Boyne.  I am not oblivious to the fact that the Minister had a sworn inquiry held recently concerning the mussel industry, but I think it is my duty as a public representative to bring to his notice the fact that Drogheda Harbour Board have to use their dredger to take mussels from the river Boyne and deposit them out at sea.  I wonder what the Minister would think if a farmer with a hundred tons of wheat or potatoes had to dispose of them in that way during the season, by putting them in the sea.  I maintain that the mussel industry is a valuable one, and I remind the Minister that the cost involved in the provision of a septic tank on the Boyne would be saved in the unemployment benefit that is now paid during the winter months.  People who in the past earned a living by fishing are not now able to pursue that calling, owing to the fact that they are debarred from sending mussels to the <Col N="1659" /> British market when no purification tank is available locally.  I hope the Minister will give the request favourable consideration this year.  I make allowances for the difficulties that existed during the emergency, but now that they are coming to an end, I hope a tank will be provided this year.  I appeal to the Minister to try to do something and not to have thousands of tons of wholesome food destroyed, when it is possible to avoid doing so. The proposition is an economic one because there is a market that will take all the mussels offered to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin referred to an Act that was passed through this House some years ago in connection with the whaling industry.  It is not a matter to joke about.  We have men who are quite capable of taking their part not only in sailing such boats but in working whaling factories.  There are men in Drogheda who took part in the construction of whaling factories, and I see no reason why this nation should not be in a position to establish a whaling factory and man it with Irish seamen.  Whaling factories elsewhere are manned by many Irish seamen, including some from Drogheda.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will see his way to establish deep-sea trawling.  Men from the east coast of Ireland are manning fishing trawlers in England. Why should they not man Irish trawlers?  I trust the Minister will succeed in his efforts in that regard. While I may be poaching the territory of Deputy Burke and Deputy Cosgrave, I wish to direct attention to the need of making transport available to small fishing villages.  I make no apology for so doing in regard to Loughshinny where there is a hardy race of fishermen.  There are six or seven motor trawlers and a large number of ordinary fishing boats there, but the fishermen are very badly served as regards transport for the delivery of their catch to market. I have been visiting that district for a number of years and when transport was supplied by the Great Northern Railway it was anything but satisfactory, as was also the service provided by private lorry.  The people <Col N="1660" /> there are entitled to special consideration owing to the fact that they are five miles from a railway station. Deputy Burke mentioned Balbriggan and Howth, but these places have railway connections and are not badly served for transport.  Loughshinny is five miles from the railway, and transport provided by lorry has not been satisfactory for a number of years. Recently those interested pooled their resources and purchased a lorry with which to deliver fish to the market, but I understand that some objection has been taken to that arrangement.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consult the Minister for Industry and Commerce to see if some equitable arrangement could not be arrived at, so that the fishermen could use the lorry for one purpose only, to deliver fish to the Dublin market.  I understand that occasionally when the fishermen have good catches for Fridays they find, owing to lack of transport to the Dublin market, that the fish may have to be held over till Saturday morning.  I impress upon the Minister the desirability of taking a special interest in these men.  He should see that they are allowed to use the transport they have provided and get the benefit of a favourable market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies paying the usual compliments to the Minister, and watering them down later by mentioning various complaints.  At one stage I thought we might soon have an election.  I should like to impress upon the Minister the point made by Deputy Walsh, because a difficulty has always presented itself as far as Loughshinny is concerned.  The Minister should make representations to the other Departments concerned, as the request seems to be a reasonable one, particularly when it is remembered that Loughshinny area is outside that covered by transport belonging to Córas Iompair Éireann.  As far as I know Córas Iompair Éireann only serves certain parts of North County Dublin, while the other portions are served by the Great Northern Railway.  While the Deputy mentioned that Balbriggan, Skerries and other towns on the railway <Col N="1661" /> line are amply served, the same does not hold as regards Loughshinny. I suggest to the Minister that an exception should be made in this case in order to facilitate the people of that area.</P>
      <P>Difficulties present themselves to fishermen in County Dublin as well as to fish eaters.  The fishermen are dissatisfied with the prices they receive for their labour while, on the other hand, fish at all times is dear in Dublin. It is an extraordinary commentary on the whole fishing industry that that was the position until recently.  The price of fish has been excessive in Dublin, and as far as I can gather, fishermen are inadequately remunerated. The other difficulty also presents itself that in a number of these small fishing villages like Howth, Balbriggan, Loughshinny and Rush, on certain days, fish in excess of the market demand is caught, and if the Minister and the Sea Fisheries Association could devise a plan which would even out the market, or enable fishermen to dispose of the fish caught, either in Dublin or in other parts of the country, on the days on which there is an excessive catch, or on which the demand does not exhaust the supply, he would be doing a great considerable service to the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>These people are in the difficult position that fishing at any time gives them only a fairly comfortable existence.  In fact, on most occasions, it cannot even be said to do that, and the complaint time and again is that, when the fish are available, the market is not available. I would congratulate the Minister, as Fianna Fáil Deputies have congratulated him, if we could get from him a plan to give these fishermen a stable and remunerative market and to give fish to the citizens of Dublin at a price cheaper than obtains at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the protection of territorial waters, grievous complaints were made to me last year that, even in Dun Laoghaire, foreign trawlers came within the three-mile limit.  The Minister has told us that corvettes are to be made available and that these will do something to protect these waters.  I hope they will, because I have been told that at any time in the <Col N="1662" /> morning and sometimes late in the evening&mdash;but especially in the morning&mdash;these fishing boats were to be seen fishing inside the territorial waters, but by the time any boat could get out to them, they had disappeared. I suggest that protection should be given, and the sooner the corvettes are put into service, the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>I promised Deputy McMenamin that I would give him figures for the amounts due by the Sea Fisheries Association by way of repayable advances.  I am sorry that I have not been able to get the figures, but I shall let the Deputy have them in the course of a day or two.  With regard to his point about the issue of boats and gear, I can only say that the acute shortage has not yet disappeared. There is a world shortage of timber&mdash;hence the great difficulty of providing the hulls for the boats.  It is nearly impossible to get engines so far, and, so far as gear is concerned, the position is not very much better. The Deputy will realise that when I tell him that the British fishermen are complaining as bitterly as ours about the great lack of equipment, gear and so on.</P>
      <P>Deputy McMenamin also referred to the shifting of the boat-yard from Meevagh to Killybegs.  All I can say is that the Sea Fisheries Association are equally interested in all their members and may be relied on to be just as impartial and just as anxious as was the Congested Districts Board. <i>Prima facie</i>, therefore, when they propose to make this change, I have to come to the conclusion that they have good reasons for making it.  I do not altogether agree with the Deputy that the position is that there were many boats in the vicinity of Meevagh and not many in the vicinity of Killybegs. I do not think that is the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very many more boats at the moment in active fishing in the Killybegs area.  The failure of the boat-yard in Killybegs was connected with the industrial school there, and I think that gives the <Col N="1663" /> explanation.  I do not want to go into the details because I should require to see a very strong case put up against the action of the Sea Fisheries Association before I would be convinced that they had done anything wrong or unjust.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A man might be imbued with commonsense, even if he had not done so.  With regard to the trawler company, I hope I did not leave the Deputy under a wrong impression.  I did not mean to give the impression to the Dáil that my idea of a trawler company was one trawler.  I think we would need at least six, in the light of our experience, if we are to fill the deficiencies in fish supplies as provided by the inshore fishermen.  I agree with Deputies generally that we should try, if at all possible, to increase the consumption of fish, and, that being so, we may want even more than six trawlers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What are you going to do with the inedible qualities of fish which the trawler brings in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the quantity were big enough, we might be able to do something about it, but at present the waste &mdash;if it can be so described&mdash;goes to the making of fishmeal, which is the only thing which can be thought of at the moment.  Deputy McMenamin also <Col N="1664" /> referred to Section 37 of the 1939 Act. So far as I and the Department are concerned, the provisions of that Act must be carried out as enacted.  It is true, of course, that if we stop freshwater netting, the estuarian netmen will reap the advantage eventually, because it is natural to expect that more fish will get up the river when the freshwater netmen are put out of commission and that after some years&mdash;three to five years&mdash;there will be a bigger run of fish generally and the estuarian netmen will reap the first benefit.  The provisions generally will then come into operation.</P>
      <P>This matter of the development of the home market is one which has given everybody a good deal of worry.  One of the first things the Sea Fisheries Association did after being set up was to try to develop the home market. They put vans on the road, but difficulties arose in that connection, too.  If any Deputy has any good ideas&mdash;I do not say this in any critical spirit&mdash;with regard to the development of the home market, getting fish more generally used in the inland towns and also getting fish more generally used from the point of view of variety and so on, we should be very glad to get them.  There are certain classes of fish brought in by our trawlers, as mentioned by Deputy Dillon, which are not used to any great extent in this country and which perhaps could be used, even as human food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, struck a very heavy blow at the expanding home market when he fixed the same retail price for fish in Ballybay and Ballaghaderreen as he fixed in the City of Dublin, leaving the fish merchants in these remote towns to pay the freight out of their own profit, which often meant that they had to sell the fish for less than what it cost them, so that they had to get out of selling fish altogether?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If these fixed prices are to continue as a peace-time measure we should, I admit, give very much more thought to the various consequences <Col N="1665" /> involved and the different conditions obtaining in the different places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Or, at least, to the freight rates from the distributing centres to the point of consumption; otherwise, the people cannot sell fish. God knows, it is a chancy enough trade as it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Healy appeared to be under the impression that this trawler company would be Government owned and Government controlled. I have been making an effort for many years now to induce private enterprise to take up this trawler business.  In my opening statement here to-day I again adverted to the fact that once more I had appealed to those who are interested in the fishing industry, from the commercial point of view, to come together and form a good and efficient trawling company.  As I mentioned also in my opening statement, I had some hope that a good trawling company may be put into commission as soon as good boats, and so on, can be obtained.</P>
      <P>With regard to quick freezing and cooling, that no doubt is practicable from the technical point of view; but from the financial point of view it is a different matter altogether.  Again, this is a case purely for private enterprise. I do not see how the Government could come in and set up a freezing plant here and there.  It is a matter for those engaged in the industry to do that, including the Sea Fisheries Association.  If they did go into this business it is not to be expected, at present costs at any rate, that they can put up these plants except at the very, very big centres because the capital cost involved in putting up freezing plants at all the centres where fish is landed would be entirely uneconomic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of transport was raised, both by Deputy Healy and by some other Deputies&mdash;Deputy Healy in particular reference to the place with which he is concerned and other speakers with regard to Loughshinny. All I can promise is to do what we can on this transit question but, of course, the transit companies have <Col N="1666" /> their point of view too.  We may not get all the conditions the fishermen would like, but we shall do the best we can.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke about harbours and piers and slips.  The machinery for dealing with these is now very much easier from the administrative point of view.  Hitherto, it was a very long and laborious type of procedure which we had to pursue in order to get the various Departments concerned to agree.  Now, we have established a liaison committee, representative of all the Departments concerned. This committee will meet regularly to deal with the various harbours and landing places and so on. If there is a good case for development the committee will give it every consideration.</P>
    <P>With regard to protection, I do not think there is just now, very urgent reason for the protection of our sea fisheries.  Deputy Anthony raised two points in connection with it.  During the war there was no great need for the protection of our sea fisheries.  It is to be expected, however, that now that the war is over foreign fleets will come back again.  We are now very much better equipped to deal with the protection of our sea fisheries than we were pre-war.  The Department of Defence has a number of suitable patrol vessels, which it had not got before the war, and I think we should be able to look after our interests now so far as that particular aspect is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Will those patrol boats be stationed at various ports throughout the country or will they be concentrated in Dublin Bay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment they may be concentrated in Dublin but once the question of protection arises they will be distributed throughout the various ports.  Deputy Anthony also raised a question in connection with our inland fisheries and their protection from poachers.  I agree that is a problem which requires closer consideration.  I have come to the conclusion, just as Deputy Anthony has, that we shall have to avail of our police force in this respect and that they shall have to play a much bigger part in the protection of <Col N="1667" /> our inland fisheries.  At the moment I do not think they could do much more than they are doing, but the possibility is that we shall have to increase the personnel in the future.  As Deputy Anthony has pointed out they would be very useful in the protection of our inland fisheries.</P>
      <P>As to the control of our inland fisheries and the boards of conservators generally, this is a matter which can be dealt with and discussed very much more profitably when the Consolidation Bill comes before the Dáil because that Bill will contain the clauses of the existing Acts dealing with boards of conservators, their constitution and powers and so on.  When that comes before the Dáil there will be every opportunity then to suggest a better scheme.  I do not say the present scheme is ideal, but when one gets down to suggesting improvements it is not always an easy matter to implement them.  However, we shall welcome any suggestions that may be made.</P>
      <P>The brown trout fishery is very important. I have no idea as to what its actual value is, but I do admit that it is important particularly to the extent to which it attracts anglers. This is a matter which will be considered very carefully in order to ensure that it is developed to its fullest possible extent.  With regard to the supply of ova, there are certain difficulties in the way there.  We do make certain grants to local associations&mdash;private hatcheries, as Deputy Anthony described them, whether they are owned by an individual or by an angling association. For some time we have been making certain grants to these and if we thought that more money could be usefully spent in that direction I do not think that we would have any difficulty in getting a little more for the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered the desirability of promoting pike fishing competitions in brown trout rivers and lakes, because I am told that one pike is capable of destroying a whole hatchery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of keeping <Col N="1668" /> pike down in numbers has been considered from time to time.  I cannot give the Deputy a definite answer that we have come to the conclusion that such fishing competitions would be useful; perhaps they would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister ever considered the possibility of inaugurating a scheme whereby persons would bring pike to the local Gárda station and the sergeant of the Gárda could there cut the tail off the pike, keep it, and pay the person 1d. a lb.?  I think that some such scheme as that would do a good deal towards clearing pike out of our rivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but I do not know what the number of pike would be, or what the cost might mount up to in the aggregate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sea Fisheries Association is a trading organisation and I feel that they are best qualified to deal with this matter of supplying fish to shops in local towns.  As I have said already, they did try that and the possibility is that they may be disposed to go into it again in the future.  It must, however, be remembered that they are a trading organisation and they are bound to do the best they can for their members; they are not justified, therefore, in losing money on a project of that kind unless they have some hope of getting it back again by some expansion of the trade.  Unless there is some hope of making the supply to shops in inland towns an economic proposition, I do not think they can do very much about it.  I do not think that any Deputy will expect the Government <Col N="1669" /> to engage in a business of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody else flopped&mdash; quite right.  I was asked about some individual harbours, but I do not think it is necessary that I should deal with these individual harbours, because what I have said generally covers them all.  Wherever there is a good case, from the point of view of fishery development, very sympathetic consideration will be given to it by this representative committee of the various Departments concerned.  Take Arklow, for example.  That harbour has been considered, and I expect that something will be done about it before very long.  Deputy Cogan asked me about the Liffey reservoir and the disease of the fish there.  The Liffey reservoir, of course, is private property, owned by the Electricity Supply Board, and we do not, therefore, interfere unless we are asked to.  We have been in touch with the investigations that are going on there and, if Deputy Cogan wants it, I could get him a report, but I do not feel that I am at liberty to say anything in public about it without the consent of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not know exactly how it is brought in.  There are various theories.  Deputy Cafferky spoke about a particular pier at Lecanvey.  I was told by an inspector of the Department of Fisheries that he was there recently, that the pier is all right but that there are no boats, so that it is one of those cases where, evidently, the pier was built in the wrong place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question raised by Deputy <Col N="1670" /> Dockrell, with regard to pollution of the foreshore, is under continuous investigation. A commission sat on that and a very extensive report was issued, about 40 years ago.  There has been no great change, certainly no change in bacteriology or chemistry since then and no great change, probably, in the conditions.  We have that report but any particular cases will be investigated and, if anything can be done to improve matters, of course, it will be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh has raised, as he says himself, the annual question of setting up a mussel tank at Mornington.  I think I informed Deputy Walsh before that when we were setting up a mussel tank, more or less as an experiment, some years ago, we chose County Kerry because it appeared to be a bigger centre at the time than the centre at Mornington.  I think we may say now that we feel the experiment was well warranted and that we would be justified in going on with another septic tank as soon as supplies and so on will permit and I think Mornington, or the vicinity at any rate, would probably be the next most important centre.  I do not know that Mornington exactly would be the centre but that particular vicinity would probably be the place for a second septic tank to be set up.</P>
    <P>The only other point was that raised by both Deputy McFadden and Deputy Bartley, with regard to the exclusive fishery limits.  As I said in my opening statement, that question was not raised at the London conference.  As I explained, that was an international conference dealing with the supply of fish and the probability of over-fishing in the North Sea.  The question of exclusive fishery limits did not come up.  That question, so far, anyway, has been one for discussion between the two Governments primarily concerned, that is, the British Government and ourselves, and I think it would be very much better if we can come to an agreement with the British Government on this question of the exclusive fishery limits and, as I said here to-day already, we expect to be able to resume our discussions on the matter in the near future.</P>

      <P>That for the purposes of any Act of the present Session to charge and impose certain duties of customs and inland revenue (including excise), to amend the law relating to customs and inland revenue (including excise), and to make further provisions in connection with finance, it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of a sum not exceeding £5,000,000 to the transition development fund to be created under such Act.</P>
      <P>This arises out of Section 30 of the Bill at present before the Dáil.  That section gives authority for the payment into the new transition development fund, out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas, of a sum not exceeding £5,000,000 in the current financial year.</P>

I do not want to press the Minister unduly; I recognise his difficulties; but if he can, either on the section, on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, or in connection with this motion, name to us a representative group of schemes, for the prosecution of which he intends to avail of this transition fund, I think it would enable us to discuss the section when it arises and the Estimate more intelligently than we can otherwise hope to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 is a relieving provision and I undertook in my Budget statement to bring it into the Bill.  It is designed to bring up to date the existing legislation exempting from income-tax and surtax wound and disability pensions and gratuities in respect of wounds or disabilities where such pensions or gratuities are granted under the Army Pensions Acts.  The existing legislation for exemption covers the Army Pensions Acts, 1923-1943. It does not cover the Army Pensions Act, 1946, which was passed early this year.  The proposed new section will remedy this defect by securing that all <Col N="1674" /> relief for pensions and gratuities of the type in question granted under the previous Army Pensions Acts from 1923 to 1943 will apply to the 1946 Act as well.  They will be all exempt from tax.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the provision for carrying losses forward.  It is another relieving section which extends the period of six years within which, under Section 14 of the Finance Act of 1929, losses incurred in a trade or profession can be carried forward and deducted against subsequent profits.  The section applies to cases where the six years' period includes one or more of the emergency years, 1939-40 to 1945-46, inclusive.  It secures that, to absorb the loss carried forward, the profits of six non-emergency years will, if necessary, be available.  The section will benefit those concerns which fared badly during the emergency and did not make sufficient profits to absorb any losses carried forward.  Such concerns would not, in effect, derive adequate relief from the existing law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new principle. It lays down that the persons who have made a loss in any given financial year prior to 1946 may avail of the profits of any years between 1946 and 1952 to offset that loss and claim, if needs be, that they have no obligation for income-tax at all.  Let us assume a firm lost during the six years of the emergency, taking one year with another, £6,000 and in 1947 revealed a profit of £3,000, in 1948, £2,000 and in 1949, £1,000.  Can they carry forward their £6,000 loss to obliterate all profit in the three financial years which I have described, or are they allowed to carry out this operation of offsetting the emergency losses against the profits of only one post-emergency financial year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing the loss is incurred in 1934-35, the concern will be entitled under the existing law to carry forward any portion of that loss for which it has not otherwise obtained relief and to deduct it from the assessments for the following six years, 1935-36 to 1940-41, inclusive.  For any of those years it can carry forward the loss from 1934-35. Since these six years include two emergency years&mdash;that is 1939-40 and 1940-41&mdash;the section will apply to the trading concern in question.  These two years will be added.  If, however, the loss had been incurred in the year 1932-33, the six years' period would have ended in 1938-39 and, as that period does not include any of the emergency years, the section would not apply.</P>

      <P>This section will apply only to very big concerns who can employ well-paid technicians in order to assist them in the investigation of their problems.  That is very proper, but I would like to point out that a lot of small firms have problems which to them may be more important than to the bigger firms who can <Col N="1676" /> employ technicians.  In this country we have very skilled workmen capable of being trained in new industries.  What we most lack is technical knowledge. The smaller firms have been deprived of the scientific research bureau.  It was closed down.  The Minister seems to recognise that scientific research is urgently required by firms in this country.  He is giving the larger firms relief, but at the same time he is depriving the smaller firms of chances, of which they were beginning to avail themselves, of bringing their smaller problems before the scientific research bureau.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In this section there is provision for allowing relief on such sums as are given to any research institute by any firm.  We have tried to cover the research institute which will be set up in substitution for the existing research bureau and also for the emergency research bureau that has gone out of existence.  There will be before the Dáil sometime soon, I hope, a Bill to set up in a permanent form a research institute which will have wider powers than the existing research organisation.  This section provides that if a firm does not do the job itself, it can pay a university to carry out research work, or pay this organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>In paragraph 3 of Section 5, there is provision for relief spread over a period of five years.  Then in sub-section (4) it is stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;where an asset representing capital expenditure on scientific research, ceases at any time from any cause whatever to be used for such research, relating to the trade carried on by the person who incurred the expenditure then,&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) no allowance under this section in respect of that expenditure shall be made for any year of assessment after that in which the cessation takes place.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That means that if a man qualifies for relief for a five-year period and the capital expenditure ceases during that period, he loses all benefit at the time <Col N="1677" /> he ceases to expend money on research.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (3) sets out the relief to be granted in the case where a trader on or after the 6th April, 1946, incurs capital expenditure on scientific research relating to the trade which he is carrying on.  If a person on or after the 6th April, 1946, incurs capital expenditure on scientific research and afterwards starts a trade which is related to the research, he likewise comes within the ambit of the relief.  If a trader incurs the expenditure while carrying on his trade he is required, if he desires the allowance, to apply to the Inspector of Taxes within 12 months after the end of the year of assessment in which he incurred the expenditure.  On the other hand, if a person incurs the expenditure and afterwards begins the trade, he is required, in order to obtain the allowance, to apply to the Inspector of Taxes within 12 months after the end of the year of assessment in which the trade was started.  The relief takes the form of allowing a sum equal to one-fifth of the expenditure as a deduction in charging the profits of the trade to tax for the year of assessment in which the expenditure was incurred (in the case where the trader incurs the expenditure while carrying on his trade) or in which the trade was commenced&mdash;in a case where a person incurs the expenditure and then sets up the trade and for each of the four following years.</P>

      <P>My point is that if he has qualified for benefit for a five years' period and that then his capital expenditure ceases during that period, is he going to forfeit the remainder of the benefit in the subsequent four years?  Under sub-section (4)&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Sub-section (4) relates to the case in which an asset representing capital expenditure on scientific research ceases at any time and from any cause <Col N="1678" /> to be used for scientific research relating to the trade.  Paragraph (a) secures that in such circumstances no allowance under the section shall be granted for any year of assessment after the cessation. Paragraph (b) provides for the granting, in the case of a cessation, of any unexhausted balance of allowances. It enacts that if the total of the allowances already granted when added to the value of the asset immediately before the cessation is less than the capital expenditure incurred in the first instance the difference (that is, the unexhausted balance of allowances) shall be allowed as a deduction in charging the profits of the trade for the year of cessation.</P>

      <P>On the Second Stage of the Bill I raised the question whether the Minister could give an indication on this section as to whom these facilities were proposed to be extended.  Is it open to any person who is anxious to undertake mineral exploration to apply for benefit?  As I understand the position, Mianrai Teoranta will soon go out of existence. At least, the Minister for Industry and Commerce foreshadowed that it will soon be brought to an end.  At the same time, in addition to phosphate deposits, it has responsibility for certain coal deposits.  Can the Minister say whether this section would exclude any firm or company from relief from expenditure which had been made either directly or indirectly from moneys provided by the Oireachtas? In the event of Mianrai Teoranta going out of existence, will its successor be entitled to relief, in view of the fact that the original expenditure or portion of the expenditure was provided out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot put my finger on the section at the moment, but there is a sub-section which prevents the State paying twice.  If the State has paid, by way of subsidy or otherwise, for mineral development that <Col N="1679" /> subsidy is not going to rank for relief from tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the definition of a &ldquo;mine&rdquo;, can the Minister say what materials will be determined to be minerals?  Take gypsum.  Is that deemed to be mined?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If it comes out of a mine then it is mined.  If it comes out of an open quarry then it is not mined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is rather conflicting because under that definition the product of an open cast coal mine would not be deemed to be mined.  I believe that some of the operations in Arigna are carried on in an open cast mine.  I do not know if there are any open shafts employed in extracting gypsum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in a couple of these mines and there were shafts sunk.  I brought forward this section so that where a firm undertook the hazardous adventure of going underground for minerals we would allow them the expenses incurred of opening up shafts.  For instance, in the case of an open cast coal mine or quarry you know what you are going to get but where a firm has to go underground the seam may be very thin and may run out.  The whole seam may shift and may be of a particular type.  That is the case it is designed to meet.  To my mind mining means going below the earth and sinking a shaft of some kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can find out, the definition is contained in sub-section (1) and, we must bear in mind that in litigation for the purpose of establishing before the special commissioners or the circuit judge or a tribunal the right to this relief the tribunal will have to refer not to what our intention is but to what is in the Act.  If this becomes law the section will contain the words &ldquo;the word mine means an underground excavation made for the purpose of getting minerals&rdquo;.  Take a deposit such as gypsum.  There are two courses open. One is to pursue it through a quarry operation, that is to clear away the <Col N="1680" /> overlying deposit and extract such mineral as you can get. It appears to me that a situation might easily arise in which a man would preserve a deposit which ought to be blasted away, if the most efficient and economical methods were used in exploiting mineral deposits.  Is it the Minister's intention to promote such excavation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is largely experimental.  It is the first step towards giving relief for mine development. My instructions to the Revenue Commissioners and to the Parliamentary draftsman were to draft it in such a way that it would only treat mines as underground excavations. The words in the section are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The word &lsquo;mine&rsquo; means an underground excavation made for the purpose of getting minerals.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If we do not drive them underground to get minerals, I do not know where we will stop.  Deputy Hughes will explain to Deputy Dillon at great length the sowing of seed and ploughing. Seed is put into the ground for the purpose of extracting from it minerals, phosphate and so on.  If you do not drive them underground for minerals, a farmer might claim deposits on the soil as being for the purpose of extracting minerals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the difference between mining and quarrying. You could quarry while there is an out crop and have people working on the outer fringe, but if you are going to work for minerals properly, you will have a mine.  I think it is well to distinguish between the two.  This activity is going to be very limited.  I direct Deputy Dillon's attention to paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-section (5) and I should like to know how they are to be operated.  Paragraph (a) reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) the inspector of taxes shall estimate to the best of his judgment the life (in this sub-section referred to as the estimated life) of the deposits, but shall not estimate such life at more than 20 years.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how an inspector of <Col N="1681" /> taxes is going to do that.  It is an expert's job.  It will depend on the kind of organisation that the owner is going to set up.  He may be slow in doing that or he may increase his organisation. I should like the Minister to tell the House how that is going to be operated, or where that idea came from. I know that the object is to encourage people to start mining operations.  Is there any such provision in British Acts, or where was this idea got?</P>

If, after discussion with the owner of the mine, they arrive at a life of 20 years, they will allow 5 per cent. on 20 years.  If it happens that they are going to work the mine in ten years, he will allow one-tenth for each year.  If after nine years, the one-tenth has not worked out, and they estimate that the mine will go on for 20 years, he will then make an adjustment.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not consider dropping this definition of &ldquo;mine&rdquo;?  In Great Britain there are varieties of mines.  If you could get contact with mining people and with the claims made, there would be a volume of case law as to what the reasonable life of a mine would be. Assisted by that, the judges of this country, if reference were had to them, would be able to determine pretty reasonably what a mine was, or if any given enterprise was, within the meaning of the Finance Acts, a mine; but if we create a completely new definition of a mine, what we are really doing is laying a trap for every applicant for benefit under this provision and preparing a paradise for revenue lawyers.  You will find some unfortunate wight litigating with the Revenue Commissioners on the definition of a mine and the Revenue Commissioners making up their minds that, if he gets away with that definition, they will be getting applications from every quarry owner in the country and bringing this particular section to the Supreme Court to get a fence put round it, to get it limited.  If, on the other hand, a whole body of case law is there and the applicant whose application for exemption is turned down refers the matter to a competent lawyer in this country, reference will be had to the case law of analogous claims in Great Britain, and reasonably certain advice will be tendered as to what way the judge will go if his attention has been directed to the existing case law in determining whether a specified case comes within the definition of a mine or not.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is approaching this problem from a slightly wrong angle.  I take it that both sides of the House are agreed that what we want to do is to help organisations which are legitimately undertaking a mining operation, but I think we also want to exclude, if we <Col N="1683" /> can, the ordinary quarry owners, the people who are quarrying limestone and granite.  They cannot go astray on it&mdash;we want to exclude these.  I would be prepared to undertake that, if there is any difficulty about this business, we are not going to let it get into the hands of lawyers to make sport and to bring it before the Supreme Court, but will examine each particular case which comes along in which a man claims he is doing a mining operation. We can ask; &ldquo;Is it reasonable that the State should give him a particular relief?&rdquo; and if we find that he is not covered by this Finance Act, he can be covered in a Finance Act a year hence.</P>

      <P>Suppose the very reverse happens?  Suppose somebody comes in and beats the Revenue Commissioners on an appeal?  Suppose this fellow, having preserved the umbrella of clay or stone by propping it up and going in under it, instead of blasting as he would normally have done, in order to come within this definition of &ldquo;an underground excavation made for the purpose of getting minerals&rdquo; brings the Revenue Commissioners to the Supreme Court and there gets his decision, are we then to have a situation in which we bring in an amendment in the next Finance Act providing that where a man digs under a heap of clay, where a reasonable person ought to have blasted it out of his way, it will not be deemed to be a mine for the purposes of Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1946?  There, I think, is a most evil principle, that is, an <i>ad hoc</i> amendment of the law to set aside the court's interpretation of legislation.  It means that a citizen in good faith, trusting the laws as we have made them, goes to court to get them interpreted, but when the courts have interpreted them, if the interpretation does not suit us, we bring in an <i>ad hoc</i> amendment to rob him of the benefit of his judgment.  The less we do that, the better for the stability of the country and the confidence of our people in the law.</P>

      <P>I feel that there is a point in what Deputy Dillon says.  If, as has been the case in England, a mine is defined as a result of experience and the definition has been satisfactorily concluded as a result of cases decided, I think a definition of this kind may be upset.  The definition may be water-tight, but it does appear, looking at it superficially, that the matter may give rise to litigation and that, within the next 12 months&mdash;it might even escape notice for the 12 months and come up within the next 18 months &mdash;a case might arise and, in a subsequent Finance Act, the Minister will have to bring in an amendment to deal with it and to make it retrospective in order to rule out the particular applicant or applicants who raised the matter.  The Minister should reconsider it.  I have a recollection&mdash;I do not know if it is accurate&mdash;that a definition of mining is given in the Minerals Act in England, and I suggest that, before he decides to pass this section, the Minister should have it reconsidered in order to see if the definition is water-tight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always open to reconsider it, but personally I would say that, as a mine owner will only earn, at most, a relief of income tax on a fraction of his total expenditure, he is not likely to go to the trouble of propping up a couple of feet of subsoil in order to earn it.  It will not be worth his while.  If it is more convenient for him to throw away the top soil, he will do so, and if he intends to go below the ordinary clay, he will come to a stratum of rock.  Normally, if coal is not open, if it is just covered with clay, it is found under a stratum of rock.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister give the licensed trade any indication as to whether he has discussed the problem with the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to when the licensed trade will be informed, authoritatively and finally, what they are to do in regard to these increased impositions of duty?  Are they restricted to increasing the retail prices at which they distribute this merchandise to the actual amount of the duty imposed by him?  I think in one case&mdash;I cannot remember whether it relates to the wine duty which comes under Section 8 or this duty which comes under Section 7&mdash;a situation has arisen that if a licensed trader is restricted by the Standstill Order affecting wines, beers and spirits, the extra duty is levied at a rate which involves the publican in charging 1¾ extra, and it is physically impossible for him to do so. Any rational arrangement, I think, will be very acceptable to the trade, but I suggest to the Minister that he has a duty, in view of the rates he has elected to fix, to ensure that an expeditious decision will be given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to how that duty is to be passed on by the publican without any breach of the existing law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this section is the queerest section that has ever been brought in.  The effect of this section would be to bestow on the dance hall proprietors of this country a sum of £65,000, and that at a time when the National University of this country is starving for funds, unable to pay its professors, unable to provide equipment, and unable to erect accommodation for the higher education of the people because we cannot afford to give them any money.  We are asked here to waive a revenue of £65,000, not to secure relief for the widow and the orphan, not for the benefit of the sick and infirm, not to secure added comfort for the blind or the afflicted, but to ease the burden on the backs of the down-trodden dance hall proprietors of this country.  It is with the greatest difficulty that we have succeeded in preventing the erection of dance halls at every crossroads in the country.  It is perfectly manifest that if there is one industry in this country which is booming and will continue to boom under any conditions and, apparently, at any price, it is the dance halls.  Up to 3/9 you could fill the Albert Hall in any rural area in this country.  I admit that after you pass that figure the crowd begins to dwindle and half the company turn up in dinner-jackets that do not fit them.  But below that, all and sundry are prepared to go as often as the opportunity offers and, apparently, have sufficient money to go as often as the opportunity offers. Surely, if there was ever a tax which no reasonable citizen in this country could object to pay, it is a tax on dancing.  I said on the Second Stage&mdash;and I now repeat it&mdash;I am not one of those who condemn dancing as something that ought to be discouraged on the ground that it is in itself evil. Like everything else, it is capable of being abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I know, there is nothing intrinsically evil in it.  But it is the kind of luxury which is eminently taxable. If there is a desirable purpose for <Col N="1690" /> which such a tax might be used I suggest to the Minister that here is a purpose which is desperately in need of money and, far from reducing the tax on dances, I think it would be perfectly legitimate to raise it to such a figure as would yield £100,000 per annum to be offered to the National University of Ireland for the purpose of repairing the manifest and scandalous deficiency in its existing revenue.  I do not believe there would be one single word of protest from one end of Ireland to the other if the usual revenue system were departed from in this particular case and the dance hall duty were deliberately earmarked for higher education in this country. Ninety-nine per cent. of the people paying this tax would gladly pay it, and a little more, if they were satisfied it would mean something approaching an adequate endowment for the starved universities to which their children will in large numbers some day be going.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Dillon I would say that if we wanted £100,000 and if the Dáil decides that the universities should get that £100,000, or whatever figure they will decide on, it is up to us to collect it in the best way possible.  I think the revenue raised from the tax on ceilidhthe and dances was the worst means by which that could have been raised.  First of all, it was a very costly tax to collect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I cannot give the Deputy exact statistics but I have asked the Revenue Commissioners. This tax has to be enforced by the revenue officers throughout the country. There are dances in all sorts of remote parts.  The revenue officers have to go there to inspect and examine and they get into trouble with people in remote localities who resent the inspection of the dance by the revenue officers.  There is much more than the ordinary dance halls involved in this question.  As far as the commercial dance halls are concerned.  I hope they will not benefit a single penny.  I hope, as a result of taking off <Col N="1691" /> the expense of managing their hall in such a way as to comply with the revenue requirements that, when they are free, they may not only reduce the price of admission by the appropriate amount of tax taken off but by something over and above that which represents their cost in collecting for the Revenue Commissioners these particular duties.  If the people of the country who attend ordinary commercial dances have any wit they are not going to give, when the remission of this tax comes into operation, the price they have been giving heretofore. I think it would be most unfair if these commercial dance halls were to charge such prices.  But let that be between the patrons of the commercial dance halls and the proprietors.  The owners of commercial dance halls should reduce the price of admission by about 20 per cent. in the lower ranges.</P>

      <P>I am taking a charitable purpose.  I do not think political organisations, whether they support Deputy Dillon or myself, would come within the term &ldquo;charity.&rdquo;  The Revenue Commissioners would not be charitable enough to regard them as charitable organisations.

      <P>It cannot be for the St. Vincent de Paul.  You may not raise funds through the medium of a dance for the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  I think the Minister is getting rusty on the rules.  His attendance at his conference must not be as regular as mine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing it is for a charitable organisation, the duty has to be collected or they have to get the Revenue Commissioners to agree, first of all, that it is for a charity which they can recognise as a charity, and <Col N="1692" /> secondly they have to keep expenses within 30 per cent.  If the total receipts are, say, £30 and the committee's expenses run up to £11, they are out. Some of them have resorted to subterfuge, even though they have incurred £11 expenses, to show the Revenue Commissioners an expense sheet of £10.  A number of cases occur in the courts every year where all sorts of people are prosecuted for offences against this particular excise duty.  I do not think it has served the country well.  If we want money we can collect it more cheaply, we can collect it without doing so much damage to local initiative and charitable initiative. When a committee come together to run a dance for the Red Cross or some other charitable organisation they have, I think, sufficient trouble to look after the details of organising the function without giving them the extra job of satisfying the Revenue Commissioners and keeping books and so on that would satisfy the Revenue Commissioners. I think it is a good thing for the country to get rid of it.</P>
      <P>I was fortunate in being able to have a number of reliefs to give in this particular year.  I felt that some future Minister for Finance, next year or the year after, might not be in the same fortunate position and, even though he was convinced that this tax should go, could not bring in the relief as the only relief.  I brought it in simply because we were able to bring in a number of reliefs with it and I was conscientiously convinced that it was a duty that should go and, even though Deputy Dillon can make a little bit of play with it and compare 90 per cent. relief on the tax on dances with something that would appeal to the universities, we will have to put up with it.  It is a good job of work to get rid of this for the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something in what the Minister says and also something in what Deputy Dillon says in relation to this reduction as far as entertainment duty is concerned.  The Minister indicates the problem of enforcing this tax in rural areas, where halls exist.  I would have dealt with this by drawing a line, by allowing a dance or entertainment up to, say, 2/-, <Col N="1693" /> to be exempt, because halls in outlying districts very rarely charge more than 2/-.  It is only in large towns and cities, where there is an urban population, that dances go above 2/- to 5/-, 10/-, £1 1s 0d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the 3/9?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I am drawing the line at 2/-.  Let anything above that be taxed and then you will have no trouble in enforcing the tax, and, if a revenue officer comes along and finds that a proprietor is defaulting, let the fine be pretty severe.  It was indeed a big shock to most people to learn that entertainment tax was removed, in particular, when there was no consideration given to old age pensioners or to other sections, that it was the most unexpected section of the community that got consideration, namely, the dance hall proprietor.  It is a very weak excuse indeed to say that it would be impossible to enforce the tax because, to my knowledge and to the knowledge of Deputy Dillon and of the Minister, dances in rural Ireland are generally from 1/- to 2/- except in very exceptional cases, perhaps at Christmas and St. Patrick's Night, when it is 2/6.  In towns like Castlebar and Ballina, where there are big dances, they are £1 1s 0d, 10/-, 5/- and you will not get the ordinary young man or woman to go because they cannot afford it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The middle class, as they call themselves, or the upper class&mdash;you may call them what you like; I have one particular name for them, but I would not be allowed to use it here&mdash;would not associate with that section of the community.  They want a 5/- dance. The people who go there are considered respectable, whether they are or are not.  Tax these people, make them contribute towards the general good.  What you get out of it could be used in helping those who are less well off.  I think it was a big mistake. I can see the Minister's point that it is very hard to take into court the proprietors of small dance halls in the outlying districts because they have defrauded the Revenue Commissioners. The way out is to draw the line and have no tax on any dances up to 2/-. <Col N="1694" /> There are charitable dances or dances for foreign missions or for very poor persons.  The bread-winner of a family might die and a dance is organised to assist his widow or orphans.  The admission fee runs from 1/- to 2/-, and that applies everywhere in Ireland.  The dances run in the big ballrooms in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Drogheda, Galway and Sligo are on a different footing.  The people there have money to spend&mdash;to throw away, in my estimation.  These are the people who should be taxed.  It is a handy way of getting money and no one can grumble.  If they grumble they can stay at home.  Some person may say: &ldquo;I consider the Minister an abominable man to put a tax on our only entertainment.&rdquo; The Minister is not forcing them to pay that tax.  It is not compulsory and they can stay at home if they wish.  They will not go to the dance if they cannot afford it.  If you put a 10/- tax on some of them they will still go because they have plenty of money.  It is very foolish to cut out the entertainment tax in regard to those dances.  The Minister should draw the line up at the limit I have mentioned.  In that way you will satisfy the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says: &ldquo;Deputy Dillon might make capital out of this and Deputies must not mind him.&rdquo;  I think if I had said that the Minister was wrong in taking off £65,000 in relation to dances and leaving the old age pensioner unprovided for, I would have left myself open to that charge, because we all know that £65,000 cannot effectively be passed on to the relief of the old age pensioner.  But I have pointed out a service that urgently needs a sum approximately commensurate with the volume of revenue that is now being abandoned, and I make a case that nobody denies, that a very valuable service could be rendered genuinely more efficient by the appropriation of this sum to it and the only reason such sum is withheld is that the Minister for Finance has consistently said: &ldquo;I will not deny the desirability of the service advocated, but the difficulty is that the money is not there.&rdquo;  Now that he has the money, <Col N="1695" /> now, when reviewing reliefs which he could contemplate in the situation in which he found himself at the beginning of this financial year, I think there is an obligation on him to look at the good claims for additional financial assistance that were outstanding and unsatisfied for the want of money and then to look at the people who are bearing tax burdens and who require relief, if and when he had money to give them the relief, and to weigh the claims of one against the other.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that, when reviewing the list of cases for which he would have liked to make better provision than he was making, he thought of the old age pensioners, but when he thought of them in the context of £65,000 it was manifest that sum enabled him to do nothing effective for them.  But he must have found somewhere in that list of deserving services which were in want of money the universities, and the moment he found them he might ask himself the question: &ldquo;Could £65,000 per annum, in addition to their existing grants, do them any good?&rdquo; He must have said: &ldquo;Oh, yes, that will be a very substantial contribution which would solve a great many of their most urgent problems.  Even if it was not enough for everything, it would help them materially.&rdquo;  Now, once he has made up his mind that the universities can use that money and give good value for it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Minister do when he is considering remitting a tax?  Does he whistle: &ldquo;Pop goes the weasel&rdquo; and wipe off the tax, or does he consider the claims made upon him and the resources at his disposal?  I am envisaging the procedure which a conscientious Minister would follow. Having ascertained that this sum could greatly relieve a truly necessitous and desirable service, he was bound to look at the other side of the account to see <Col N="1696" /> would the retention of this taxation impose an insufferable burden on the tax-paying public.  I think he would have seen at once that the dancing public, by the evidence of their own activities, deny the possibility of their being an overburdened or overtaxed section.  The very fact that they go to dances is in itself an admission that they are financially circumstanced to meet a modest impost of this kind. I do not think I can be fairly charged with making capital.</P>
      <P>If the Minister took my advice and deleted this section and announced that he was going to add the proceeds of this tax to the revenues of the National University, he would find his name well and favourably remembered in academic circles for many years to come.  He would have done something long over-due; he would have used the £65,000 for a very good purpose; he would have set a precedent which, I think, would be followed by Ministers who come after him, where they are confronted with a small tag-end of revenue from the total revenue point of view, with the claim of the university always to be canvassed, and where it would be manifest that to maintain a tax would not bear unduly on a vulnerable section, and that it would be a good thing to throw it into the general revenue of the university because what was a very small sum and a very light impost, a soft tax from the revenue point of view, might be a very valuable contribution to the slender funds of our university.</P>
      <P>This regular practice of appropriating the tag ends of revenue of that kind in perpetuity to academic institutions like the university would make a very effective and adequate subsidy for the endowment revenue which learned institutions in other countries very largely depend on, because they have amongst their <i>alumni</i> numbers of people who have earned great incomes and who, in disposing of their benefices, generally think of their <i>Alma Mater</i> whereas in this country no such persons exist.  I suggest to the Minister that he might set a headline in providing that the place of these benefices would be taken in this country by such tag-ends of revenue as are represented by the dance tax.</P>

If the Deputy wants to do it, it would be much easier to put an extra farthing on whiskey and there would be no extra expense in collecting it than to keep on the tag-end of a tax that is not a soft tax, that is a difficult tax and that is creating a lot of trouble and hardship and, I think, some dishonesty in parts of the country by people who are ordinarily well meaning.  They cannot understand why if they want to run a dance for a charity, for a local church or something of that kind, the revenue commissioners step in and keep them down to 30 per cent. in their expenses and why when they reach 31 per cent. the Revenue Commissioners have to carry out the law and collect the tax.  I am not very long Minister for Finance, but I have got a number of letters from priests and others saying: &ldquo;Oh, well, we were only 1 per cent. over the 30 per cent. and why should we have to pay tax?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There is a certain general trend in connection with revenue matters of this character to shift the burden of proof from the person who alleges the revenue offence on to the person who is accused of it. I understand that the Revenue Commissioners have, under some statutes, the right to come upon your premises and to challenge you to prove that in respect of certain commodities found there duty has been paid and that, until you are in a position to do so, the Revenue Commissioners are entitled to hold the goods under their control, that, until you are enabled to demonstrate that duty has been paid, you are not entitled to get them back from them.  I want to make this perfectly clear: my experience of the Revenue Commissioners in matters of this character and in respect of income-tax and anything else of the kind has been that, if you play square with them, they play square with you.

    <P>At the same time, there may be exceptional cases in which there is a genuine and <i>bona fide</i> difference between a citizen and the Revenue Commissioners, the Revenue Commissioners honestly believing that an <Col N="1702" /> attempt is being made to evade the law, and a malicious attempt at that, and the person against whom the Revenue Commissioners are acting believing that he is in good faith and entitled to the protection of the law. When you get into the sphere of beliefs, or of declaring a thing to be deposited in a place with intent to defraud, you are getting into a very ambiguous kind of country in which the question of intent and not the net actually done bulks largest.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that, if the powers prescribed in Section 23 are to be enjoyed by the Revenue Commissioners, the general power they have of shifting the burden of proof on to the person who has deposited the goods, or who has removed the goods, will not be exercised, but that it will be the duty of the Revenue Commissioners to prove that the goods were removed by the person charged with the intention of defrauding rather than merely to make that allegation and put the person charged on his proof that this was not so.</P>

      <P>I do not think the general powers of the Revenue Commissioners arise on this section alone. The Revenue Commissioners, under the existing law, if we do not pass this provision, have the powers contained in Section 32 of the 1827 Act.  If we do not pass this, it means among other matters which follow from it, that they can seize goods manufactured from foreign-grown tobacco but cannot seize them if they are manufactured from home-grown tobacco.  They can still charge three times the revenue, if they are manufactured from foreign-grown tobacco, but cannot do so, if they are manufactured from home-grown tobacco.  This really brings the Act of 1827 up to date.</P>

      <P>This section is the section which provides the legal authority for the setting up of the transition development fund.  Under the Money Resolution, which was passed earlier to-day, we can put into that fund a sum not exceeding £5,000,000.  If this particular section passes through both Houses it is my intention to introduce a Supplementary Estimate which will show in as much detail as possible the purposes for which the moneys will be provided.  I gave a few examples in my Budget speech of the way in which the moneys would be drawn out of that fund and paid for specific purposes.</P>
      <P>I instanced the farm improvements scheme; and I told the Dáil that after the Estimates had been prepared last December we considered a sum of £400,000 would be sufficient to cover all the applications made during the year.  However, when the applications came in it was found that there were more than had been anticipated when we allocated the £400,000.  Out of the transition development fund we can provide for the surplus applications, which total £60,000.  As farm improvements are very desirable I feel that the farmer should be given every encouragement in that direction.  I told the Minister for Agriculture to accept these applications and he told the applicants to go ahead and that we would pay the State's share of these improvements.  If this particular clause in this transition development fund did not exist we would have to introduce a Supplementary Estimate in order to meet our commitments to the Department of Agriculture and for the Department of Agriculture to meet its commitments to the farmers who applied for the grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government will be introducing his Estimate one of these days&mdash;perhaps to-day.  There was one matter about which we were both anxious, that is, housing.  We are both anxious that housing should proceed as rapidly as possible with the available material in the country. <Col N="1706" /> As Deputies are aware, building materials are very dear at the moment and the pre-war subsidy on post-war housing costs would leave a very large sum to be met either by the incoming tenant or by the local authority.  It is impossible to calculate how the prices of materials will fluctuate during the next few years, and it has been decided to leave the pre-war grants as they are.  If tenders, however, are made which are reasonable, having regard to building costs, a free grant will be made available out of the transition development fund to local authorities to enable rents to be reduced to a reasonable level having regard to the current rates of wages.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government will deal with that matter in due course.  He has asked me to provide in the Estimate for a payment out of the transition development fund to enable grants to be made to local authorities in regard to houses which have been built over the last few years in order to reduce rent charges and to reduce the burden on the local authorities, which they would have to meet if only the pre-war housing grants were available to them.  As the Deputies are aware the Minister for Local Government is encouraging the local authorities to go ahead and build houses, even though they are dear, and he has promised them that he will come to their assistance.</P>
    <P>There is one other suggestion which has been made&mdash;I do not know whether we shall agree to it or not&mdash;that is, that the agricultural rates relief, which was provided for and foreshadowed in the Budget, should be met out of this fund; but that is a question which has not yet been decided.  I think, perhaps, it could be borne on this particular fund.  Apart from housing and farm improvements, the local authorities have quite a number of other schemes under consideration and some of these should, I think, be proceeded with as rapidly as possible under present conditions.  We all want to see water and sewerage works carried out throughout the country.  If that work is undertaken this year is is undoubtedly going to prove much <Col N="1707" /> more costly than if it were postponed for a couple of years, or until such time as material became freely available. It is, however, very desirable that public health works of this kind should be undertaken as rapidly as possible.  If a local authority has a sewerage scheme under consideration and that scheme would cost £20,000 under present conditions, but would only have cost £15,000 pre-war, then if they have a tender for £20,000 and we consider that the scheme is a desirable one we can give them a grant out of this transition development fund.</P>
    <P>This fund is designed to meet unknown circumstances.  It is being set up in order to give the Minister for Finance the opportunity to meet a fluctuating situation, and to meet demands that cannot be budgeted for, cannot be estimated in the exact concrete form that departmental expenditure is estimated for in the ordinary Departmental Estimates.  If, last December, we could have foreseen that an additional £5,000,000 worth of development work could be undertaker during the coming financial year and could have foreseen how the expenditure would have been segregated, then we would have asked for those sums in the ordinary Departmental Estimates.  As Deputies are aware, in the Book of Estimates there are, not only sums providing for social services and other things, but very big sums of money, upwards of £7,000,000, I think, which is earmarked for development works of various kinds.</P>
    <P>This fund will enable us to undertake more development work than was anticipated last December and if I can give any more detailed information about how exactly portions of this £5,000,000 will be spent in the coming year, I will give it when the Estimate comes up for consideration.  We are really asking the Dáil, in establishing this fund, to put me in the position of not having to turn down a good proposition simply because it was not estimated for last December by Departments.  I believe we all know that very much more than £5,000,000 should be spent on capital development. We do not know, however, how <Col N="1708" /> much can be spent in this financial year.  This figure of £5,000,000 for the transition development fund was merely a shot of mine as to the extra development work that we may hope to undertake in this financial year.</P>
    <P>If we do not reach it, it cannot be helped, but I hope we will reach it and that local authorities all over the country will look around them and see what improvements are there to be made, what material is available, the number of unemployed in the district and, if they can get ahead with the work, I am prepared to help them to meet the extra costs that are due to the prices of materials in the existing circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.M. Dockrell Mr. H.M. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extraordinary section and it is approaching a problem in an extraordinary way. We could all sympathise with the Minister in trying to make some sort of estimate as to the trend of prices in the next few years but the Minister seems confidently to expect, inside the next few years, a big drop in prices. What is to be covered under this scheme?  The first item is the farm improvement grant.  Most of us would approve of the Minister's idea of seeing that improvements to existing farmhouses would not be held up for want of additional subsidy or because the amounts required had been somewhat under-estimated.  It only goes to show the extent of the problem which this section is intended to relieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I wish to call the attention of the House to is the Minister's statement that sewerage and water schemes, though costly, will have to be gone on with.  Some of us on this side thought that the Government had six years in which to develop that type of scheme so that housing could proceed immediately materials became available.  We also thought that possibly some of the labour that had to emigrate from this country during the war might have been held at home if more development schemes had been initiated earlier.  It seems as if the old problem will arise, to which attention has been called from this side of the House, namely, that the lay-out of sites is going to <Col N="1709" /> compete with the actual building of houses.</P>
    <P>In regard to houses, the Minister says that he hopes local authorities will be able to let their houses at a rent that bears a certain ratio to existing wages and that, in order to enable them to do that, he will make grants to them out of this development fund, and that he is also going to make it retrospective to some of the schemes that are either in course of being carried out or, I presume, actually carried out.  I would like the Minister to produce some formula&mdash; because somebody will have to produce it some time&mdash;so that we could understand how the ratio of the rents to existing wages was to be determined. I would like the cost of living brought into that formula.  In any case, it would be most desirable for the Minister to let us have the details as to how that is to be arrived at.  At present it would seem as if the amount of the grant was like kissing, to go by favour.  We would like to have something more precise.</P>
    <P>I would like to call attention to the fact that there are a number of houses being built or just erected, and there are houses under contemplation, and they are not in any way covered by the statement the Minister has made. I refer to the speculative builder and his enterprise.  Why does the Minister think that those people can become philanthropists and put up houses without knowing the cost?  The Minister says he cannot calculate it.  When will the Minister produce details in order that people who are contemplating the building of houses may be able to know what they are going to cost?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>But he will reduce the rents by the process of <Col N="1710" /> reducing the cost of the houses to the local authorities, and I am suggesting that if the Minister is interested in the cost of houses to local authorities he might also interest himself in the cost to other sections of the community. How far the Minister is right in assuming that materials are going to fall very much in the next few years, I do not know.  I suppose the Minister is not a prophet either.  With the world shortage of building materials and a very limited supply, it looks to some people as if it is only the production of the material that can bring down the cost.  In other words, there will be no reduction in the cost until the supply gets somewhat nearer the demand.</P>
      <P>Probably the Minister is aware that at the present time it is nothing unusual to see 100 weeks quoted as the time for delivery of certain building material?  That does not suggest that there will be any considerable price reductions in that class of material in the near future.  I wish the Minister would become more precise and arrange some formula for the local authorities in order that they can make up their minds about the rent they may be expected to charge and, as regards the much bigger class of persons who are not covered by the Minister's statement, he ought to give us the benefit of his attention towards that class.  We want houses built and people will not build them without knowing where they stand.  The sooner the Minister realises that, the sooner the job will be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand Deputy Dockrell's difficulty.  First of all, there are no grants to be given out of this fund to speculative builders to build houses for private people.  This fund is designed to help State, semi-State and local authorities to get ahead with their work. So far as builders are concerned, if the local authority in the town of Dundalk or the City of Dublin ask for tenders for, say, 100 houses, the builders will consider the houses required and will put in their tenders for £500 a house or £700 a house.  If it is decided that the scheme should go ahead and should get a grant out of this transition fund, the contractor <Col N="1711" /> will get his full £500 or £700 a house, whatever the cost may be, but that might mean the rent, if nothing further was done than to give the help that existed prior to the war, would be twice or twice and a half the pre-war rent for that standard of house.</P>
      <P>If the local authority, however, under present circumstances, having issued its call for tenders, considered they were reasonable, they would pass them on to the Minister for Local Government and he would decide, having regard to the charges that will have to be imposed, whether the tender was a reasonable one in relation to present costs and recommend, if necessary, not only the pre-war subsidy, but an additional grant of a certain amount out of this transition fund.  If we could foresee what are to be the building costs in Kerry, Dublin, or Dundalk over the next couple of years, or even over the next six months, we could make out that formula to which Deputy Dockrell refers.  It is because we cannot foresee what the tenders are likely to be in the circumstances of the different local authorities, with varying supplies of building materials in all sorts of districts, that I am asking the Dáil to give us this elastic system whereby we can come to the assistance of the local authority in relation to its needs.  If we were to give a formula at the moment, it might easily be too much in certain districts and too little in others.</P>
      <P>I believe that, difficult as the supply position is at the moment, if we can get a reasonable output of work from building employees and if we can get the master builders to accept a reasonable standard of profit we can get ahead with house building, and, taking into account that the interest charges would be greatly reduced, that perhaps without very much out of this transition fund in certain cases we can build houses to let at a reasonable rent having regard to the existing level of wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have the situation throughout the country that there are local materials available, the transport of which do not cost very much.  In other <Col N="1712" /> districts, if you use that same material you would require a good deal for transport.  All these factors will have to be taken into consideration viewed from the standpoint that transport costs are very high and transport facilities very scarce. It is because of the uncertainty of these facts we are asking the Dáil to give us this elastic system.  I know it is going to be very much more troublesome to operate than a rigid system in which we would announce well ahead of the time that for all the contracts in the next two years we would bear a certain proportion of the costs or that we would give a certain fixed grant but that would not fill the bill under present conditions.  It is because it would not, that we have fallen back on this system.  I am quite prepared to admit that it is going to cause a lot more difficulty to local authorities, to the Minister for Local Government and to myself than a rigid system.  I think we shall have to put up with the disabilities of this system in view of the uncertainty of the price situation.  All I can hope is that we can make a start in the next couple of years with house building.  If we postpone it for another couple of years, not only will the expert staff that should be working preparing plans, lose heart in their work, but we might have a dispersal of skilled labour.  We would then be in a serious position to start in a couple of years hence.  Let us get on with what we can do and take the disabilities of the system.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to think that costs are in an absolutely chaotic condition at the moment.  I should like to suggest to the Minister for the purpose of estimating the formula which evidently he has in his mind but which he has not yet disclosed to us, that a rough and ready guide to present costs would be somewhere about 50 per cent. over pre-war prices.

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,338,860 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1947, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and certain Services administered by that Office, including Grants and other expenses, in connection with Housing, Grants to Local Authorities, sundry Miscellaneous Grants and Grants-in-Aid, and certain charges connected with Hospitals.</P>
      <P>This Estimate, for a total amount of £2,006,860 under the title Local Government and Public Health, covers the expenses of the central Department and in addition numerous grants which will become payable to local authorities and other bodies in respect of certain services administered by them. It does not, however, cover the expenses of the sub-divisions of the Department concerned with health insurance and the registration of births, deaths and marriages or the sums required for the maintenance of patients in Dundrum Asylum, each of which has a separate Estimate.  From the volume of Estimates, in the hands of Deputies, it will be seen that there is an increase of £108,411 in this year's Estimate as compared with the preceding year.</P>
      <P>This increase is mainly due to increased grants for public social services. Taking the increase under the various sub-heads it will be seen that the largest, £48,000 is for the treatment of tuberculosis.  The amount provided for this service in the Estimates for 1932-33 was £114,750.  Last year for the same service we provided £217,750, or almost twice as much as in 1932-33, and this year, as I have indicated, we are asking for £265,750. The figures I submit to the House speak for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to obviate any misunder <Col N="1715" /> standing and, perhaps, confusion in the debate which I know will follow the introduction of this Estimate, I should remind the House that when the Estimates for 1932-33 were submitted to Dáil Éireann by the Minister for Finance, the Estimate for the Department of Local Government and Public Health was prepared by the then Minister in charge of that Department, the present Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Mulcahy.  Whenever, therefore, I refer to the 1932-33 Estimates, the figures I give may be taken as a measure of the concern which the present Opposition had for the social welfare of the people when it was in power.</P>
    <P>The next increase in the Estimate is in respect of housing grants.  In 1932-33 which, I submit, was a fair criterion by which to appreciate the services which we are now offering to the people, the then Minister for Local Government, the present Leader of the Opposition, asked for £1,523 for grants to local authorities under the Housing (Ireland) Act, 1919, and for £10,000 under the Housing Acts, 1925-30, as amended by the Housing Act of 1931. The total contribution, therefore, which the Government of that day were prepared to make towards the housing of the people was £11,500.  In that connection I think I could not do better than to put before the House an extract from the debate which took place on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government on the 29th April, 1931.  Deputy Tadhg Murphy was then speaking and, in the course of his speech, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The figures I have got would indicate that since the Housing Act, 1924, was passed less than 300 houses were built by boards of public health for rural labourers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was interrupted by the then Minister, Deputy Mulcahy, who said &ldquo;385 were provided&rdquo;.  The ring of triumph in Deputy Mulcahy's voice, as he announced the figure, still resounds in the heavy volume that contains the report of that debate.  The number, 385 houses for over 140,000 labourers, built in seven years after the passing of the 1924 Housing Act is, I think, an <Col N="1716" /> achievement of which the present Opposition might be proud.  The birds of the air have their nests, the beasts of the earth have their lairs, and in Deputy Mulcahy's day Irish rural workers had a share in 385 cottages. I suggest that Deputies on all sides of the House should bear that figure in mind, when we are told that our people have to bear costs of government to the extent presented in the Budget, or when Deputy Hughes says, as no doubt he will say, in the discussion of this Estimate: &ldquo;We are spending money lavishly, slinging it down the drain very often,&rdquo; or when Deputy Morrissey expresses this view: &ldquo;We have piled up taxation and rates to an extent that is having a paralysing effect on the cost of living, and the vast increase of taxation and rates is, perhaps, the biggest contributing factor to the great increase in the cost of living.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When these things are repeated in this debate, I ask Deputies to keep in mind the figure given by Deputy Mulcahy, as a result of his seven years' effort to try to house the workers in rural areas&mdash;385 cottages.  I also ask them to keep in mind the £11,500 which figures in the Estimate for 1932-33, as the amount which the Government of that day proposed to provide for the housing of our people.  This figure of £11,500, which I might describe as Fine Gael's ironic gesture to the homeless poor, must be kept in mind when we come to discuss the amount I am asking the Dáil to provide this year for housing purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in which the Labour Party is, is one of glorious inactivity.  It has never been able to do anything for the people.  I was dealing with the provision I am going to ask the House to make for the housing of the people.  Last year the Dáil voted £611,670 for this service. This year I am asking for £657,690, of which approximately £612,000 will go to local authorities and £45,000 to private persons and public utility societies.  The £658,000 is a very large sum.  It is, in fact, something more than 57 times the £11,500 which would have met Deputy Mulcahy's requirements in 1932-33.  But then we do not expect either local authorities or private persons to work the miracle of building houses without money.  This is not all we propose to do this year to help to house the people.  In his Budget statement the Minister for Finance informed the House that he proposed to set up a transitional development fund for the purpose of enabling local authorities to carry out at once, even in this period of abnormal costs, works of social and economic importance, under conditions which would not impose undue burdens upon the ratepayers or other interests immediately concerned.  Out of this fund generous assistance will be given to local authorities to encourage them to proceed with their housing plans as expeditiously as the supply of materials will permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of the supplies likely to become available for the current 12 months, it is estimated that the supplementary and extraordinary grants, <Col N="1718" /> which will be paid to local authorities in respect of building schemes initiated in this financial year, will amount to about £340,000.  With the sum of £657,890 to which I have already referred, and which is to be provided in the ordinary course under sub-heads R and S for grants under the Housing Acts, this will make £1,000,000 available by way of grants to accelerate and assist the fulfilment of the Fianna Fáil housing programme. But the House will remember that, speaking last year on the Estimate, I undertook that local authorities who proceeded immediately with the execution of their housing plans would receive additional financial assistance as soon as conditions permitted us to determine in a reasonable way what supplement should be added to the existing statutory grants to meet the abnormal conditions now prevailing.  In fulfilment of this undertaking, it is proposed to make, also out of the transition development fund, supplementary grants to local authorities in respect of houses built by them since 1st April, 1945.  These retrospective grants will be made on the same terms as will apply to houses now being built by local authorities, or, as I have said, which will be begun by them during the current financial year.  It is anticipated that the amount to be provided under this head will be about £120,000.  All told, therefore, £1,120,000 for housing will be given this year by the Government to provide homes for the people.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the money which is to be expended will yield a rich return to the nation in happy homes and happy families, in children free from disease and reared in decent, Christian surroundings.  But I have also no doubt&mdash;and I should like to answer in advance the criticisms which I know will be forthcoming&mdash;that, in proposing to spend so much money for such a purpose, I shall be bitterly criticised by Deputies who, when their Party had responsibility for this problem, rated their obligations to the houseless poor at £11,500 a year.  I know that I shall be told again by Deputy O'Higgins that &ldquo;costs are beating the head of every family and breaking up our homes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1719" /> On the other hand, I know that Deputy O'Higgins, the county medical officer of health, will impress on his council the need to tackle the housing problem in his area in order to prevent the breeding of diseases and death.  I prefer in this matter to disregard the harangues of Deputy O'Higgins, in his role of politician, and to listen instead to the wise counsel of the zealous, energetic and efficient public official.</P>
    <P>I turn now to a group of social welfare grants under sub-heads J (1) to L (2), numbering nine in all, and covering such services as child welfare, milk grants, fuel grants, children's footwear, medical treatment for schoolchildren, etc.  In 1932-33 the corresponding group of sub-heads was only four, and the amount provided for the services covered by it was £64,780. This year, I am asking for £793,000 for needs which were more exigent in the black days of the 1931-32 depression than they are to-day, but which a Government, shutting its eyes to the plight of the people, failed in those days to provide for.  As Deputies will see from the Volume of Estimates, the expenditure of this year on the several groups of services to which I have referred, <i>videlicet</i>, for the treatment of tuberculosis, for housing, for social welfare is expected to reach about £1,716,440.  It is a very large sum indeed&mdash;how large we can realise when we set it against the figure for 1932-33 of £191,036.  The difference is over £1,500,000&mdash;£1,525,404 to be exact.  Who should wear sackcloth and ashes for that fact?  I suggest it should be the callous administration which, 15 years ago, refused to provide for the needs of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you allow me to proceed, Sir?  I asked the question; &ldquo;Who should wear sackcloth and ashes for that fact?&rdquo; That is a question which apparently loosens floods of remorse in members of the Opposition. I am not going to answer it again as precisely as I have already answered it, but I am going to say this: It should certainly not be this Government that is striving, to the best of its ability and with full regard to the resources of the community, to ensure that no one among us, weak or sick or poor, shall go uncared for or untended, or be houseless or hungry. <Col N="1721" /> When, therefore, the Fine Gael Opposition beg us, as Deputy Hughes did less than a month ago&mdash;and I quote his exact words&mdash;to &ldquo;reverse engines so far as this policy is concerned&rdquo;&mdash; the policy for which I am asking this money and the policy which, since I am asking the Dáil to vote money, I am to explain to the House&mdash;I say &ldquo;no.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I say no, because to go back to Deputy Mulcahy's policy in regard to housing, tuberculosis, or social welfare would be to deliberately breed revolution. The plain fact is that when the Opposition were in power, and they will criticise this Estimate now, we might have had less taxation but we had also more starvation.  They saved the pounds and the pennies; but they did not save the children's lives, nor provide for the aged and the destitute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Our policy differs radically from theirs in that regard, and we have no apology to make for that fact.  Naturally, a progressive social policy like ours involves an increase in departmental staff.  I make the Opposition a present of the fact, in presenting this Estimate, that the Estimate for my Department for this year provides for a staff of 482 as against 255 in 1932-33.  The figures merely reflect the difference between the conditions which obtain when the direction of a Department is semi-moribund and when it is vigorous, zealous and progressive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister in charge of a Department is content to let things drift, so that he may enjoy an intellectual siesta between one general election and another, he can economise in staff.  But if he wants to get things done and if, in contrast to his predecessor, he has a progressive mind and forward policy to carry out, he must make good all the penny-wise and pound-foolish economies which he inherited from an effete régime; and he must enlist a sufficient and competent staff to give effect to his programme. He knows that when he does <Col N="1722" /> that he will be subjected to much ill-informed criticism and gross misrepresentation; and that he will be required to listen patiently to reiterated clichés about the growth of bureaucracy and swollen taxation.  But if he can point, as we can, to good work well done, he can disregard all this, and do his duty, because the people will evaluate such shallow diatribes at their true worth. Deputies have only to compare the manner in which the Estimates for 1932-33 were presented with the way we put them forward to-day, to appreciate the truth of what I have said.  So far as the Volume of Estimates for 1932 goes, it would not be unfair to say that it does not indicate whether even the rudiments of a conscious organisation existed in the Department. All sorts of staff and all sorts of officers were jumbled together, higgledy-piggledy, like prize packets in a bran tub.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, as a very experienced hand, I should be foolish not to anticipate trouble.  We have a housing section in my Department and I challenge anyone to find any reference to a housing section of any kind in the Estimates for 1932-33. Perhaps a Minister who had only £11,500 to spend was not permitted to have a housing section.  Perhaps, if he had a separate entry in relation to a housing section, it would be patently clear from the meagre staff he had under that head that he intended to do very little to house the people.  But I, however, want to have a housing section in my Department and I want the Dáil to vote me a considerable sum of money in order that I may have a housing section to do the work which I intend to do.  I want a housing section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only have I persuaded the Government, through the Minister for <Col N="1724" /> Finance, to provide £657,000 in the Estimates for housing, but, as I have already told the House, I shall obtain from the transitional development fund such additional assistance for the local authorities as will leave them with no financial excuse for deferring the execution of urgent housing programmes. Naturally, with this programme before me I need a housing section and an extensive one.  Deputy Mulcahy might have been able to do without one when he was in power; and, no doubt if he were in power to-day, he would still be able to do without one.  But the Minister for Local Government in a Fianna Fáil Administration cannot put himself in that position.  He has work to do, and the Government of which he is a member&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In the Estimates, therefore, as I present them there will be found provision for a housing section with a staff of 70, together with one general housing inspector and 11 temporary housing inspectors, all at a total cost of £25,144 per annum.</P>
      <P>Now I assume&mdash;and I think I am entitled to assume&mdash;from the speeches on the Budget that it is the policy of the Opposition to close down on housing, to dismiss the 82 officers, and to save this £525,000; and, as a natural corollary, to condemn no less than £60,000 families to continue to live in festering slums and condemned houses until disease and death solve the housing problem for Fine Gael.  I can only say that may be the policy of Fine Gael, but it is emphatically not the policy of this Government.</P>

      <P>So much for housing. Now take public health.  I am not going to ask the Deputies whose consciences are now so tender to look at the Estimates for 1932-33.  I think it is a painful subject for them.  They have already evinced their annoyance when that fatal year 1932-33 was mentioned so I shall refrain from asking them to look at the Estimates for that year. It is perhaps unnecessary.  They know what is in them.  But they will find there no mention of a public health section.  The Government of that time evidently did not consider this question sufficiently important to direct attention to it by a specific estimate in the Estimates for 1932-33.  I have no doubt that the Cumann na nGaedheal Minister in that year could have told the Dáil how many babies died within the first month of their birth from preventable disease, and could have given the figure, I have no doubt correctly, to not less than three places of decimals and without hesitation.  But, prior to the advent of the Fianna Fáil administration, no Government in this country did very much about it.  We are doing it.  It costs a great deal of money and it requires a reasonably large staff to do it, but we are tackling this problem of public health seriously and earnestly and, I am glad to say, we are meeting with a reassuring measure of success.</P>
      <P>It is not our policy to let the children die, just because Deputy Hughes wants us &ldquo;to reverse engines&rdquo; or Deputy O'Higgins seeks to intimidate us by alleging that in framing the Budget for this year&mdash;the Budget which is intended to cover this Estimate&mdash;the Minister for Finance was thinking in terms of figures and not in terms of human beings.  Anyone reading the speech which Deputy O'Higgins delivered in the debate on the Budget will see that it was Deputy O'Higgins himself who was thinking in terms of figures and not in terms of human beings.</P>

      <P>Speeches like those of the Opposition may produce an unfavourable reaction to the Government on simple or narrow minds, but I see no reason to be ashamed of the fact that I have to-day in my Department a section wholly devoted to public health problems.  It has an administrative staff of 34, together with 17 medical, ophthalmic and veterinary inspectors, and the salaries of this staff, inclusive of bonus, amount of £25,950. I am sure that the majority of Deputies will agree with me that, from the viewpoint of the health of the people, this is money well spent.  I gather, however, from certain speeches on the Budget and on the Public Health Bill, that quite a number of Deputies do not share this view, and it is my purpose now to convert them and let them see the error of their ways.  They tell us, like Deputy Morrissey:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We propose to spend £24,000,000 in the provision of hospitals and public assistance institutions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We do.</P>

      <P>We come to the important question of road transport. Road transport has for very many years played a rôle in our economy which has been increasing continuously in importance.  The well-being of all sections of the community&mdash;and, by no means least, of agriculturists&mdash; is significantly affected by the efficiency or otherwise of our transport system. This is a truth which was borne in on all of us during the critical periods of the emergency.  In those days, where <Col N="1728" /> should we have been without our road transport?  If our roads had broken down, our road transport would have broken, down, and with that road transport our whole economy would have broken down.  But, our roads did not break down, thanks to the attention which had been devoted to them, and the money which had been spent on them, in the period from 1933 to 1941.  During that period we had so improved our roads, and spent so wisely in doing so, that they were able to stand up to the abnormal conditions that have obtained from 1940, and have come through the test triumphantly.</P>
      <P>The figures given in this year's Estimate for the staff of the roads section will indicate why they did stand up.  Since Fianna Fáil took office, the planning, improvement and development of our road system have become a major concern of the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  Because the fundamental economic importance of having a first-class road system was recognised by us, our roads section was set up.  It has a staff of 23, at an inclusive cost of £10,892.</P>
      <P>I may say that no provision for a corresponding section was set out in the Estimates for 1931-32.  For all the Estimates for that year tell us, the roads of the country might have been anybody's business or nobody's business.  I am not saying that the roads did not get some attention, but I do say that they did not get all the attention which their importance in our economy deserves.  When we realise how ill equipped my Department was 14 years ago to deal with public health, housing and roads, it will not astonish us to learn that no attention whatever seems to have been devoted to the important problem of civic planning.</P>

Surely I must explain why it is necessary for me to set up a new section in the Department of Local Government and Public Health and to <Col N="1729" /> set it up this year.  Surely Deputy Dockrell, who is an Opposition Deputy and therefore wants everything fully explained, wants to know why it is necessary to set up this new planning section?  I understand that the Deputy is a man who has a great regard for financial probity, who is very concerned to ensure that expenditure would be kept down and taxation with it, and he is not going to ask me to expect the House to take a Vote of this sort without having the items fully explained.</P>

      <P>It is, because the Deputy was not here then and I would like the Deputy, if he is going to vote in a division on this, to know exactly what I am asking him to do.  I was saying, Sir, that the first of the Planning Acts was not passed until 1934 and, therefore, of course, we had no town planning section.  In this year's Estimate, as I have indicated, will be found provision for the new town planning section, which is to be set up under a principal officer with a qualified town planning officer, or member of the Town Planning Institute, on the technical side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that some years ago the Government of the day had no use for such an officer and I suppose I shall be expected, because no use was found for such an officer then, to accept the view that no use could be found for such an officer now.  But to-day the circumstances are different.  You have a Government with a different outlook, a progressive Government which recognises the outstanding contribution which trained technicians, by the exercise of intelligent foresight and imaginative skill, can make to the solution of the complex problems which will arise in the course of the physical reconstruction and development of our towns and countryside.  If the House wishes to criticise the proposal to spend money on this new section in the Department, I will admit that a Government without enterprise and without vision, a Government dominated by men whose capacity for practical affairs was smothered in a lawyer's <Col N="1730" /> wig, would have no use for a town planning section.  They would, perhaps, adopt Deputy Costello's present attitude towards aviation development, or Deputy McGilligan's attitude towards the holiday industry&mdash;the attitude which he expressed here in the debate on the recent proposals to increase the resources of the Irish Tourist Board&mdash;or they would adopt Deputy Dillon's attitude, the attitude of another lawyer, towards wheat and beet and peat.</P>

I know there are Deputies who will oppose this, most of them lawyers, some of them lawyers at any rate, men who, taken from their musty precedents, would stand like bats blinking in the light of day at the progress of the world around them and they would want the Government of Ireland to stand still.</P>

      <P>Another provision which the Dáil will find in this year's Estimate and for which no counterpart will be found in the Department's Estimates years ago is for the turf section.  The need for that section will, I hope, become rapidly less until it ultimately disappears.  It was established towards the end of 1941 to deal with the problem which had been created by the sudden interruption of our normal supplies of imported fuel. When it was first established, the nation found itself faced with an emergency of the gravest kind.</P>
      <P>In 1939 we imported practically £3,000,000 tons of coal.  In 1941 our imports were suddenly and drastically reduced to about half this figure and continued to decline until, in 1944, they were only three-quarters of a million tons.  This was the emergency to cope with which the aid of my Department and authorities under it was enlisted. Immediately our help was asked the road-making organisations of all the local authorities in those areas where the peat deposits were of sufficient importance to justify it were switched off from their normal work to the job of fuel production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period from that time until the end of the last cutting season the road-making staffs of the local authorities, under the direction of the turf section of my Department, have produced almost £2,500,000 tons of fuel, a figure which represents by far the most important native contribution to the solution of our fuel problem.  Not only did the road-making organisations of the local authorities produce this huge quantity of turf themselves, but they made it easy for others to produce turf.  Under the aegis of the Department they acquired and developed turf banks and leased them to other producers. <Col N="1732" /> They worked in co-operation with the Turf Development Board and by propaganda encouraged private producers and organised groups, such as parish councils and turf societies, to win turf.  Without their help I think I can say the domestic fuel position in the non-turf areas would have been desperate indeed.</P>
    <P>The County Councils spent over £5,500,000 on the work, the greater part of which has been recouped by the various purchasers.  The part unrecouped is represented by the value of turf on hands and by sums due to the councils, but not yet certified for payment.</P>
    <P>When we remember that the task of providing fuel for the nation's need was undertaken, at almost catastrophically short notice, by men, the great majority of whom had no previous knowledge of the job, and who had to acquire their technique and perfect their organisations as the works progressed, I think we have every reason to be grateful to them, and to the staff in the section in my Department under which they worked.  That section is not a very extensive one; its personnel numbers only 12 and its annual cost is less than £3,000, but without it I doubt whether the community should have done so well in regard to fuel as, in fact, it did.</P>
    <P>I have given the Dáil some account of the services for which we require this amount we ask for this year.  It is not as full or as explicit an account as I should have liked, and I have given at least such an account of the services as the position will permit me to give.  I have outlined some of the reasons why an active and progressive Minister and his Department would require a much larger staff than sufficed for his predecessor in 1931-32.  I now propose to refer to some of the more salient features of our works during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>We have, for instance, almost completely overtaken the arrears which had accumulated in the audit of accounts of local authorities.  As the House is no doubt aware, for a variety of reasons, these audits were for some considerable time heavily in arrear.  I must safeguard myself from misrepresentation <Col N="1733" /> by pointing out this uncomfortable fact, that at the 31st March, 1932, the number of audits in arrear was 516; on the 31st March, 1943, it was 492; on the 31st March, 1944, it was 466, and on the 31st March, 1945, it was 441.  To this figure of 441 had to be added 256 new accounts arising for audit in the next financial year, which gave a total of 697 accounts to be dealt with last year.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the audits has been a matter of great concern to me since I became Minister for Local Government.  Accordingly, when Deputy Childers was appointed Parliamentary Secretary I assigned to him, among other tasks, that of dealing with this problem.  Since then very close attention has been devoted to it. As a result, I am happy to say now that, following the reorganisation which has taken place in the audit section, and the additional staff which we have been able to obtain, 631 out of the 697 audits were completed on 31st March last, reducing the outstanding arrears to 66.  These will be cleared off in a month or so, and the current audit work for the present financial year has already commenced.  Henceforward all concerned can feel assured that local authority audits will not be long delayed after the closing of accounts.</P>
    <P>I have already drawn attention to the fact that this year it is proposed to set up a town planning section in the Department.  Were it not for the need to concentrate attention upon the complex problems thrown up by wartime conditions, this would have been done some years ago after the passing of the 1939 Planning Act.  As it was, the work arising out of the Planning Acts was temporarily entrusted to the housing section of the Department. That section, however, will now be more fully occupied in getting the resumed housing drive under way. Moreover, it is my intention to induce local authorities to give their close consideration to the need for careful planning in the development and improvement of their functional areas. It is, therefore, urgently necessary to constitute the new section.  With the establishment of a town planning section, it will be possible for the <Col N="1734" /> Department to be of greater assistance to local authorities than hitherto during the various stages in the preparation of a town and district plan. Though a considerable amount of educative work, by way of explanatory pamphlets and model clauses, has been done already in order to help local authorities to take advantage of the Acts, nevertheless, when draft planning schemes are prepared and submitted, the responsibilities of the Department will be considerably increased and will fall mainly on the new section.  The specially trained officers of the section will confer with local authorities on the questions which will arise in the preparation of draft planning schemes, will assist them in their difficulties and will, it is hoped, convince local authorities that planning, if carried out in time, is a sound and economical business proposition.</P>
    <P>Last year 21 local authorities resolved to make planning schemes, bringing the total number of districts in which the Planning Acts now apply to 57. In addition, two authorities have taken the initial steps.  Other local bodies are giving consideration to their powers, particularly in view of post-war development.  So far only a small number of draft schemes have been completed but the work generally is well advanced and preliminary reports and surveys have been or are being made.</P>
    <P>The next matter to which I propose to refer is the condition of the rate collection.  Last year, I am happy to say, it showed a marked improvement, the percentage collected during the year being 94 as compared with 90 the previous year.  The financial position, therefore, of local authorities has improved generally and this is reflected in the diminished amount of temporary borrowing from their treasurers by way of overdrafts.  It is gratifying to be able to say that every county council had a credit balance on its ordinary revenue account on the 31st March last.  Not only is the present position satisfactory but I think that it will perhaps be more satisfactory in future because there are two new factors which should help county councils still further to conrecoupe <Col N="1735" /> solidate and improve their financial position.  One is the increase in the grants from the Road Fund which I was able to announce earlier this year and the other is the increase in the Agricultural Grant announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement.  At this point I should like to impress on all managers, their personal responsibility for ensuring that all moneys owing to the local authorities for which they act are expeditiously and systematically collected. One of the most important duties of managers is to see that the finances of their councils are in order and the most serious view will be taken of any failure to fulfil this obligation fully and satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on roads is normally the largest single item in the estimates of county councils.  Partly on account of shortage of road surfacing materials such as tar and bitumen, and partly on account of the diversion of labour to agriculture and turf, the condition of roads in recent years suffered some deterioration.  County councils generally have responded to the offer of increased grants by widening the scope of their road schemes and it is expected that by this time next year there will be considerable improvement in the condition of the roads.  It may be well to emphasise that the increased grants which were made this year were made on a temporary basis only, limited from year to year; no question, therefore, arises of stabilising them at their present figure.</P>
    <P>Housing must remain one of the main preoccupations of the local authorities and the Department.  The efforts made to induce housing authorities to continue building, despite increasing difficulties, is proof of our determination to solve the housing problems with the least possible delay.  While the falling off in new construction, due to shortage of materials, continued during the last year the number of houses built was not unsatisfactory having regard to the scarcity of essential materials. Of 695 houses erected, 656 were in urban areas, mostly in Dublin City, and 39 in rural areas.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, local authorities have, at the instance of the Department, <Col N="1736" /> been engaged in making a survey of the housing requirements in their areas.  This survey is now practically complete.  As a result it is estimated that approximately 60,000 houses will be required to meet the needs of workers in all areas.  Roughly half the total is required in the four county boroughs and less than one-quarter of the total in other urban areas.  The remainder, comprising between 16,000 and 17,000 houses, is required in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Where surveys have been completed, local authorities have been urged to prepare schemes that can be commenced when building materials become available.  As a result land has been acquired in urban areas, excluding Dublin City, for over 6,000 houses and in rural areas for over 3,000 houses while proposals for the acquisition of land in a large number of urban and rural areas have also been approved or are at present under consideration. Plans have been prepared and, in the majority of cases, approved for the erection of over 6,000 houses and for the development of a further 442 sites.</P>
    <P>In Dublin City, in which a considerable number of Deputies will be interested, schemes for 2,717 houses are ready for contract.  Tentative proposals for the acquisition of sites for a further 2,157 houses are being considered. In addition the reconditioning of tenement houses in several streets is proceeding satisfactorily and further reconditioning schemes providing for a total of 354 flats have been prepared by the corporation and compulsory purchase orders made.</P>
    <P>In Cork City, almost 4,000 additional houses will be required.  Sites comprising 170 acres have been acquired. A scheme for 200 houses on which it is hoped to commence work at an early date has been drawn up.  I cannot say that I regard the rate of progress in Cork as very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>I was prompted to put down two questions, which appeared <Col N="1737" /> on the Order Paper to-day, because I felt that the House would be concerned to have full and frank information when we were going to legislate on an important branch of agriculture, and in view of the fact that legislation dealing with this industry, for which the Minister was responsible, might be written down as a failure, I felt that the House would be anxious to ensure that the problem should now be constructively handled. For that reason I pressed the Minister to publish the report of the Departmental committee he set up.  In view of the importance of this matter we should be clear as to what the Committee of Inquiry on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy stated.  On page 91, paragraph 314 of their report they state:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The survey which we carried out in the course of our inquiry clearly indicated, however, that there are a number of important problems affecting agriculture which should be examined and reported upon.  We do not believe that it would be possible for a part-time body, such as this committee, to carry out the investigations we have in mind.  We consider that a small full-time body would be more suitable for the purpose, and we accordingly recommend the setting up of a body to be known as the agricultural inquiry and advisory council, consisting of a chairman and two permanent members, with powers to co-opt from time to time, subject to Ministerial sanction, other persons with technical or special knowledge of the particular subjects delegated to the council for investigation and report.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of subject are set out, the second one being &ldquo;the processing and marketing of pigs and bacon.&rdquo;  I do not think it could be interpreted that the intention was to have a Departmental committee whose report would not be published.  I cannot understand the attitude of the Minister, when he says that the investigations made by the Committee on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy were of an informal nature.  In the second minority report made by Dr. Kennedy <Col N="1738" /> he states: &ldquo;Responsible witnesses have given it as their opinion that no scheme of reorganisation or control will be effective while the existing system of ownership is maintained.&rdquo; We are rather puzzled by the Minister's attitude.  It will be observed from the White Paper dealing with the reorganisation of the pigs and bacon industry that, having dealt with the history of the industry in recent years, the report sets out certain objectives which should be aimed at if the future of this important industry was to be secured.  On page 10, there is set out Government policy for the implementation of these objectives.  If the Minister for Agriculture wants this House to be helpful in regard to legislation for a new plan for the reorganisation of the pig and bacon industry he should be frank with the House and put all the facts before it.  I submit that the House is definitely entitled to that information.  I do not think it is fair to the committee merely to present their recommendations and say that is Government policy, as far as the type of machinery that is necessary to achieve these objectives.</P>
    <P>A number of commissions were set up and they concerned themselves with this problem.  In 1938, there was a committee of agriculture which made definite recommendations.  Then we had the Vocational Commission which also made recommendations.  There was also the Second Minority Report on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy which made definite recommendations. The Minister set up a Departmental committee, ignoring completely the recommendations made by various commissions that sat in public.  He bases his plans on a secret document &mdash;one that he has refused to publish or to make available to the House.  I want to know if the Minister still persists in refusing to publish the report of this Departmental committee.</P>
    <P>I take it that the report was a reasoned one, and that the members gave reasons why it was necessary to set out the objectives that appear on page 9 of the White Paper.  I take it they made certain definite recommendations. When replying to my questions the Minister stated that the answer to the first part was in the <Col N="1739" /> affirmative, that the committee's objectives in the White Paper were correct, but that with regard to the second part such recommendations as were made in the report of the Departmental committee referred to, were in the nature of advice tendered in the course of day to day duties by officers of his Department and he did not propose to publish the terms of the committee's reports.</P>
    <P>Why not?  Why should not the House be entitled to full information about this matter?  If the Minister thought that the committee was a suitable and capable one to examine the problem, particularly in the light of the history of that branch of agriculture, I am sure he realises the importance of ensuring that the plans he is going to implement by legislation are plans that will bear fruit.  If we are not able to do it at this stage I am afraid there is no future for the pig industry.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is about to bring in a Bill surely the House is entitled to know the reasons for his proposals, and on what grounds these proposals were made.  The House is entitled to know whether the Minister has departed from the recommendations made by the committee, and, if so, why he has done so.  Is there anything in the report of which the Minister is ashamed?  Does he disagree with the committee's recommendations? Is the House expected to make decisions with regard to legislation, dealing not merely with the pig industry but with the bacon industry, and which, so far as we can gather from the White Paper, is to be very drastic, and to give drastic dictatorial powers to a particular body?</P>
    <P>Is the House not to be told whether or not that is necessary, whether the scheme of amalgamation and the closing down of certain industries is necessary, to what extent redundancy has occurred, whether any examination has been made by the committee, and, if so, to what extent, and on what they base the conclusion at which they arrived?  Surely if we are to do our business properly, we are entitled to all that information, and, if the Minister intends to persist in the attitude he has taken up, we are <Col N="1740" /> entitled to hear why he has adopted that attitude and why he has departed from the recommendation of the Committee on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy that a permanent body be set up to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>Reading that paragraph any reasonable man would come to the conclusion that that body would be one which would sit in public, a body before which any section of the industry could go and tender their views and a body of which the report would be available to the public, as well as the evidence submitted to it.  If the House and the country are to be asked to make up their mind on such a matter as this, we are entitled to all the information available.  The Minister's attitude is: &ldquo;A document has been presented to me.  I refuse to make that document available to the House, but I expect the House to agree with the proposals in the Bill I am submitting.&rdquo;  That is a shocking attitude for the Minister to adopt.  He argues that this is a Departmental committee.  Why should it be a Departmental committee?</P>
    <P>In the second question to-day, I asked the Minister if he was prepared to publish the names of the witnesses who gave evidence before this Committee on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy and to publish the evidence, and he says that these witnesses were not informed that their evidence would be published and that the examination was of a more or less informal nature. I do not think anybody reading Dr. Kennedy's report could come to the conclusion that it was of an informal nature.  He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Responsible witnesses have given it as their opinion that no scheme of reorganisation or control will be effective while the existing system of ownership is maintained.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why is it that the committee did not report on this important branch of agriculture?  A considerable amount of evidence was submitted.  Why did they pass over that branch of agriculture? Were they told not to deal with the pig industry?  Why all this secrecy, if the Minister is anxious, as I presume he is, to solve this problem in respect of which he has failed three <Col N="1741" /> or four times already?  Even before the emergency, the pig population showed a downward trend, and, during the emergency, there was a steep fall in the number of pigs.  I do not blame the Minister for that, but he knows very well that, even before the emergency, the condition of the industry was not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>If the Minister expects the House to be helpful in framing legislation which is to be useful and beneficial to the industry, he is taking up a very wrong attitude in refusing to make all the facts and all the information available to the House.  I take it that, if this committee did its work properly, it submitted a reasoned report, but, in this White Paper, no reasons are given for the proposals set out on the last page.  The Minister is treating the House in a very summary way and he is not being fair to the committee. I again appeal to him to change his attitude and to make available to the House and the country the full report of that committee.</P>

      <P>The Committee on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy recommended in their final report that a small permanent body be set up to deal with certain subjects with which they had not time to deal.  One of these was pigs and bacon, but I could not see how it would be possible to get a small number of competent men to deal with these subjects on a full-time basis, unless we went to the Civil Service.  That explains why the personnel was chosen from the Civil Service.  It was estimated that the committee should be able to deal with these subjects in two to three years, and I do not think it would be possible to get, say, a businessman to give his full time to a job like that, if he is to be told at the end of two or two and a half years that his services are no longer required. Deputy Hughes says that I ignored all the recommendations of commissions which previously sat in relation to this pigs and bacon business.  That is not true, because the biggest report issued was that of the Pig Industries Tribunal in 1933.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a very exhaustive report and the first Pigs and Bacon Act was based very closely on the recommendations of that tribunal. I dealt with it at length on the Estimate and I admitted that it was not altogether successful, but I said on that occasion that I had followed the report of that tribunal and had had the unanimous support of the Dáil for the Bill that was introduced.  We have now to face up to the fact that it was not a success and the time has come when we should endeavour to make things right.  I do not know that Deputy Hughes can make any point as to the Dáil not being in a position to deal with this new Bill, at whatever time it is introduced, because of their not having the reports before them of the various committees and so on. After all, very big measures have passed through this House dealing with matters in which no commission of inquiry ever sat at all; despite that fact, Deputies were in an admirable position to discuss the subject matters of such Bills.</P>
      <P>I was asked as to why it was not possible for this emergency committee to deal with pigs and bacon.  All I know is that the entire personnel of that committee interviewed me in that connection.  Up to that time the chairman presented the various interim reports himself; but on the last occasion, when the report on tillage, feeding stuffs and so on was being presented, the entire committee came and handed me the report.  At the same time they asked me to read a particular paragraph in the report.  I do not remember at the moment what the exact paragraph was, but in that they said that they felt they could no longer devote themselves to these various subjects and they recommended that a small full-time committee should be set up to deal with the matters left over. That was their own decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Hughes's suggestion that the pig industry was declining before the emergency.  As a matter of fact there were in this country in 1940-41 as many pigs as there had been in prior years to that; 1931 was an extremely high year and it would not be fair to make a comparison <Col N="1743" /> with that, but there were as many pigs as there were in at least half the years between 1923-31.</P>
    <P>The important issue in this is whether the reports of a Departmental committee, or a report issued by officials of a Department, should be published or not.  Now I hold very strongly that such reports should not be published.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister is entitled to call it a Departmental committee, or treat it as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will say a report issued by officials of a Department.  I shall give my reasons now as to why I think a report should not be published. A Minister is answerable to the Dáil and officials of a Department are not. A Minister is advised by the permanent officials of his Department; sometimes, perhaps, he may reject their advice, but not very often.  It must be admitted by everybody I think that the officials we have in the various Departments are very able men and very painstaking in their work.  In practically all cases, therefore, they give very excellent and very sound advice.  At the same time the Minister will sometimes differ from his officials and, while grateful for their advice, he will say that he does not accept it because he thinks otherwise.  Now I have found from experience&mdash;and I am sure anyone who knows anything about our Departments will agree with me in this&mdash;that the really good official is the man who will argue very strongly even though he knows that in the long run you are not going to agree with him; and the bad official is the man who tries to find out in advance what your opinions are and then tenders the advice which he thinks you would like to get.  Now he is no good.  The good official is the man who holds to his own opinion and argues strongly in favour of it and endeavours to convince the Minister that he is right; of course, when his advice is turned down, like a good official he carries out his Minister's orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What then would be the position if the Minister were to publish the advice he receives from his officials?  If he <Col N="1744" /> agrees that such advice should be published, if you like, to avoid embarrassment, and if that advice is carried out to its utmost limits that means then bureaucracy pure and simple because the Minister is no longer responsible to the Dáil.  The officials are then responsible for the policy and the Minister is merely there to defend the officials after they have made a decision.  Or, let us take the other side of the picture: suppose, that the report is published and the Minister then says he does not agree with it.  That could lead to a very serious position in my opinion because if the Minister disagrees he must state his reasons for doing so and, however meticulous he may be in stating his reasons, the officials may feel that their point of view has not been put with sufficient force.  After all, the officials are human like everybody else and they may feel that they are placed in a false position because they have given certain advice which was not substantiated or properly supported by argument in public and they may think they will be labelled &ldquo;duds&rdquo; by the general public.  If that position should arise you would be then faced with the position where all the officials would descend to the level of what I have already described as the bad official; that is, they would try to find out in advance what the Minister's opinion is and, having found it out, they would then tender advice in accordance with that.  When matters reach that stage the higher official is no longer of any use.</P>
    <P>As Deputies realise, higher officials have two functions.  Their first function is that of administration; that in itself is not a very difficult matter because the Acts and the Orders are there and they merely administer them.  That is done without reference to the Minister except perhaps now and again when some new point arises where a direction is necessary or where a case comes in where some slight variation is required because it does not happen to be on all-fours with prior cases of a somewhat similar nature.  Once the direction is given the officials then carry out the administration side of it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1745" /> But the really important function of the higher officials is to give advice, if the Minister wants it; or if he comes along with some new policy the officials invariably can put forward ideas with regard to that policy. That advice may be that because of their experience and so on they do not believe that it is workable; or, again from their experience, they might even advise the Minister that he should go farther than he proposes.  The position is, then, that if a Minister wants his officials to advise him, without fear or favour, that advice must not be published.  If such advice is published in the present case that would inevitably lead to a demand for publication in every subsequent case.  The <Col N="1746" /> officials would naturally become more and more careful about the advice they tendered.  To a great extent I think any such attempt at publication on our part would destroy the effectiveness to a very great extent of the higher officials.</P>
