      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the Limerick Dock area, which up to last year was treated by the Electricity Supply Board as a public thoroughfare to which public lighting rates were applicable, is now being treated on the same basis as a private concern, the harbour commissioners being compelled to pay for the lighting of this area at the higher rate chargeable to private consumers; and whether, as the dock area is not, in fact, privately owned, he will consider this matter with a view to taking the necessary steps to having the charges for current imposed on the harbour commissioners in respect of the lighting of these grounds restored to the public lighting rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that consumers of electric current in Limerick, which is immediately adjacent to the power station, are compelled to pay for lighting and heating at rates which are 30 per cent. in excess of those obtaining in Dublin; and if, in view of the increasing importance of Limerick City and the disadvantages which these high charges impose on business undertakings, he will consider introducing legislation to enable the same rate to be charged to all consumers of electric current throughout Éire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take these two questions together.  I have no functions regarding the fixing of the scales of charges for electricity and I am not prepared to interfere in the case to which the Deputy refers, nor to introduce legislation to amend the existing statutory provisions relating to the fixing of those charges.</P>
      <P>As regards the alteration in the scale of charges for lighting in the Limerick Dock area, I understand that owing to changes made by the Limerick Harbour Commissioners in the number and period of lighting of lamps situated inside the Harbour Commissioners' Dock it was deemed impossible to regard this lighting as conforming with the conditions applicable to public lighting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will not contend that the Limerick Dock area is not a public area?  If, for instance, the Electricity Supply Board were suddenly to charge the authorities in Limerick and Dublin for lighting the streets, will the Minister say that he would take no action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The authorities in Dublin and Limerick are charged for lighting the streets.  The law places an obligation on the Electricity Supply Board to frame these charges so as to produce a certain result in the revenue. I have no function in the matter and I do not propose to take any action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be some regulation as to what is a private concern and what is a public concern, and if there are differential rates for private owners and public concerns, are not the Limerick Harbour Commissioners within their rights in asking to be assessed as public owners rather than as private owners?</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  In regard to the second and third parts of the question I would point out that the post is one to which the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, as amended, applies. I understand that the statutory request was made by the local authority in June, 1945, and that the delay in making a recommendation has been due to circumstances outside the control of the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>

      <P>In order to implement Government policy of enabling persons with approved service in the Army or auxiliary defence services during the emergency to compete for the post of attendant (male and female) in district mental hospitals instructions were issued by circular letter dated 18th December, 1945, to Letterkenny District Mental Hospital authority in conjunction with all other mental hospitals to proceed without delay towards the preparation of new waiting lists or panels (to replace all existing waiting lists or panels) of persons desirous of being appointed to the office of mental hospital attendant.  At the same time, notification was conveyed to them that an extension in the upper age limit should be allowed to candidates who enlisted in the Army or auxiliary defence services during the period of the emergency.  It was thus made compulsory on all persons who were not permanent attendants and who had not the requisite service in the Army or auxiliary defence services to compete for any further examination if they desired to have their names admitted to the new waiting list.</P>
      <P>The temporary male and female attendants numbering 23 now employed in the Letterkenny Mental Hospital entered the service as the result of an examination and have carried out their duties satisfactorily, and four of the 23 have passed the preliminary examination of the General Nursing Council.  All the temporary male attendants, except one, have had service in the Defence Services and with this one exception their names are being retained on the waiting list without further examination. As regards the female nurses, it has been ascertained that as none of the applicants for admission to the new waiting list which it was proposed to set up had service in the Defence Services the manager has decided to admit the 14 temporary female attendants to the list.</P>

      <P>The Minister to be appointed to co-ordinate the income maintenance services will, no doubt, as one of his first tasks undertake a comprehensive review of the scope, as well as of other aspects of those services, including widows' and orphans' pensions. It is not deemed expedient, pending that review, to amend individual schemes.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appears to be under some misapprehension as to the relationship between the Pigs and Bacon Commission and my Department. Two distinct sets of functions are involved, namely, the functions of the Pigs and Bacon Commission pursuant to the Pigs and Bacon (Amendment) Act, 1939, and those of the veterinary examiners of my Department under the Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935.</P>
      <P>Inspection of activities in, and examination of prescribed records kept at, licensed curing and slaughtering premises, including those of the Monaghan Curing Company, are carried out by authorised officers of the Pigs and Bacon Commission in accordance with the provisions of Sections 46 and 47 of the Pigs and Bacon (Amendment) Act, 1939.  The commission is responsible for the manner in which its officers carry out their duties. Veterinary examination of all such premises is carried out by veterinary examiners of my Department in accordance with the relevant provisions of Sections 47 to 59 of the Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935, and statutory regulations made thereunder.  Reports in regard to such examination are not transmitted to the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  I am satisfied as to the manner in which the duties of the officers of my Department have been carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards (d), I understand that an investigation is being made by the commission with a view to taking any <Col N="1124" /> action which may be necessary and I am not in a position to give information on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied at present that the commission was carrying out its duties satisfactorily, when, in fact, to his knowledge, 120 sides of bacon could be taken out of the factory and delivered to Amiens Street station without the authority of the Bacon Commission and in flagrant violation of their rule?  If that is going on in one factory, what may be going on in the others?  With that knowledge, does the Minister not consider it necessary to have an examination, not primarily into the Monaghan Bacon Curing Company but into the Pigs and Bacon Marketing Board? Surely they are the people whose work should be inquired into?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

      <P>Does the Minister consider that the type of investigation to be carried out by the board is sufficient under the circumstances, or does he not think there is responsibility on himself to see that the administration of this commission be investigated at the moment?  Surely the matter is such a serious one that there is responsibility on the Minister to carry out the investigation himself and not leave the commission to investigate their own affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two questions arising there.  Firstly, as to whether the commission is taking the necessary action or not, they are taking action, as far as investigation goes.  Seeing that legal proceedings may eventuate from that, I do not think it would be proper to go into that matter any further at the moment.  As regards the other question raised by the Deputies, whether the commission is competent to carry out this investigation generally or not, I have never had any information to the contrary&mdash;to the effect that they were not or are not carrying out their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether the commission at any time asked for the returns made by the veterinary section to the Department of Agriculture, to see whether they tallied with the returns made by their <Col N="1125" /> own inspectors?  The Minister tried to suggest that I misunderstood the position. I am quite clear on it, but I was anxious to know whether the returns of the veterinary inspectors were submitted to the board for their opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that question.  In the ordinary way, the Department does its work and the commission does its own work.  As far as I know, there would certainly be no objection on the part of either party asking to check up on the other through its returns.  I do not know exactly what happened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree that approximately 120 sides of bacon&mdash;which is a considerable volume &mdash;left the Monaghan Curing Company on one occasion, in defiance of the commission's regulations and was not detected by the commission.  If that is happening in one small factory, what may be happening in the larger ones? With that in mind, does not the Minister think the time has come for him to inquire into the commission's work? Without such an inquiry, how can he hope to answer categorically to this House for the due performance of the duties this House imposed on that commission?</P>

      <Col N="1129" /> I have repeatedly indicated the Government's position in relation to the teachers' strike.  I have no information as to the teachers' intentions other than the various statements and reports which have appeared from time to time in the public Press and, in the circumstances, I can only again express the hope that despite the nature of these reports and statements, the teachers will decide in the interval before the schools are usually due to reopen to reconsider their attitude with a view to enabling the work of the schools to be resumed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the offer made by the Government to the teachers was the result of negotiations and correspondence over a prolonged period of several months.  The offer which was made by me in the first instance to the teachers was quite substantially improved.  Finally, at the request of the teachers' representatives, the Government formulated its final offer.  That final offer was communicated by me to the teachers' representatives.  I made it quite clear both in writing and personally in interviews which I had with them, that it was final and could not be changed or reconsidered.  I need not go into the question any further, beyond saying that quite obviously in its relations with persons who are paid from State sources, the attitude of the Government must be quite different&mdash;and I hope it will continue to be different&mdash; from its attitude when it is asked, through the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to act as mediator in ordinary industrial disputes between private employees and their employers. The Government has a certain responsibility in regard to this matter, as to who is going to determine the remuneration which public servants are going to draw.  Is it the public servants are going to determine the question by coercing the Government, by strike action, or is it the Government who is going to determine it, having given it full consideration?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that recently there has been delay in answering calls to &ldquo;Dial O.&rdquo;  The delay is due to the fact that the number of switchboards in the exchange is not sufficient to enable the greatly increased traffic to be handled with due expedition. Hitherto it was not possible to obtain additional switchboards, but a few have recently become available and are at present being installed.  These will be in operation soon and will give some relief but, until switchboards are obtainable in sufficient numbers, it will remain difficult at periods of pressure to avoid delay in answering calls to &ldquo;O&rdquo;.  The matter is receiving very special attention and I am hopeful that some further improvement will be feasible before long.</P>
      <P>I should like to add that the equipment in the Dublin automatic exchanges is also heavily overloaded. Additional equipment has been needed for some years past as well as various items for replacement of worn-out parts.  These have hitherto been unobtainable, but the contractors are at present carrying out an extension of the system which, when completed, will remedy the present position.  Unfortunately, owing to the complex character of the installation, it will be several months before relief is obtained.</P>

Craftsmen in private employment will have their claims or disputes decided under this Bill, but it would be impossible to have such disputes so decided if the craftsmen were employed by a local authority.  The purpose of the amendment is to make it possible to bring within the scope of this Bill manual employees of a local authority so that they can have access to this court in the same way as if they were manual employees with a private employer, or in some semi-State undertaking which was covered by the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>We discussed this matter at considerable length on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I have little to add to what I then said.  There are practical difficulties in applying this particular measure to the employees of local authorities.  I do not think that you can get round these practical difficulties by an amendment of this Bill. I think it is correct to say that the court established by the Bill could act in relation to any industrial dispute with the consent of all the parties concerned, but it would not be suitable to provide for the power of that court being invoked by the employees of a local authority on their own initiative, having regard to the provisions in local government legislation.  I think that if at any time the principles on which this Bill is based are to be applied to <Col N="1148" /> the conditions of employees of local authorities there will have to be an examination also of the consequential changes required in other legislation. On the specific point referred to by the Deputy, I would point out that it is the practice of local authorities to remunerate craftsmen in their employ upon the same basis as craftsmen employed by private employers, and I assume that that practice will continue.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion when we were discussing this, the Minister's main argument in favour of non-acceptance of this particular type of amendment was the difficulty, from his point of view, of getting representation from the local authority before the labour court.  I think, by referring to the discussion on that particular occasion, the Minister will find that that difficulty is more apparent than real and that no trouble should, in fact, arise in that particular direction.  I want to reiterate the point I made on Committee.  On that occasion I pointed out that these workers at the present time have certain rights under both the Conciliation and the Industrial Courts Acts, both of which are being revoked under the Second Schedule here.  As I pointed out on that occasion, you are revoking those Acts and all that they imply so far as the workers are concerned and you are replacing them by no other machinery of any kind.  I did think we had succeeded on the last occasion in impressing on the Minister that whatever about the officers or the clerical staff, a genuine and a very good case was made for the inclusion of the manual workers.  From these benches here we would like to press that amendment as strongly as we possibly can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The revocation of the Conciliation Acts does not, in my <Col N="1149" /> opinion, affect the position at all.  The Industrial Disputes Act has, in fact, not been in operation here&mdash;at least, not the main part of that Act which provides for the creation of a permanent industrial court.  Only Part II of the Act, which provided for the setting up of an occasional court, was in fact utilised.  In such circumstances in the future it would not be impossible for the labour court established under this Bill to be similarly utilised.  The establishment of an industrial court in the past was an act of the Minister; action was taken by him generally with the consent of the parties to an industrial dispute.  I have said that the labour court established under this Bill is not debarred from acting in a similar capacity in relation to an industrial dispute where the parties concerned desire it.</P>

I think it would be wrong to imply, by accepting that amendment, a change of attitude which has not in fact taken place.  If this question comes to the stage at which it is decided that legislation in relation to the employment of staffs of local authorities is required proposals should be submitted to the House in the form of a Bill rather than action by way of Ministerial action.</P>

Is the Minister satisfied then that he is fulfilling his obligation in the matter by leaving the largest section of manual workers in the State without any machinery of which they may avail to have their conditions bettered, or secured, or to bring about harmonious relations?  The Minister has most emphatically stated that they cannot be brought into this machinery and that such machinery cannot be made effective in their case.  If that is so, surely the obligation is on the Minister to provide alternative machinery and surely the obligation is all the stronger. I take it from what the Minister has said that he is satisfied that he cannot fit that particular class of workers <Col N="1151" /> into the machinery of this Bill. Surely the obligation is on him then to frame machinery which will give them benefits at least as great as those which are supposed to be conferred by this particular measure when it comes into operation.  Surely that obligation is on the Minister.  Why should this particular section of the workers be treated as outcast?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion on which we discussed this matter I rather thought the Minister was sympathetic in his attitude in relation to improving the position of the manual employees of the local authority.  We have discussed the position of officers and clerical staff of local authorities and I understood from the Minister's general attitude that he was considering the question of including, within the scope of this Bill, the manual employees of local authorities.  I am rather surprised at the attitude the Minister is adopting now.  Speaking from recollection, I think he said on the last occasion that a further examination might disclose some grounds for including them and this might be the best way of extending the principles of this Bill to the manual employees of local authorities.  I cannot see on what grounds the Minister contends that these employees should not be included under this Bill.  On the last day I quoted possibilities which might make it highly desirable for local authorities to apply the principles of this Bill to their manual employees. Perhaps I might briefly advert again to the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It frequently happens during the summer time that the road workers employed by the local authorities are transferred to the cutting of turf on the bogs.  The employees of Bord na Móna are likewise employed in cutting turf on the bogs.  If the employees of Bord na Móna have a dispute with the firm employing them they can have the dispute referred to the labour court under this Bill.  If the employees of the local authorities have a dispute with the local authority as to their rates of wages, or the cubic capacity of the turf which must be cut in a particular way, <Col N="1152" /> then there is no means of having the dispute referred to this court.  Consider a situation which might arise. You have a particular bog or group of bogs.  On the right hand side of that group a dispute arises between the turf cutters of the semi-State organisation, employing them with money provided by the State through the medium of this House.  That dispute can be referred to the industrial court set up under this Bill.  If there is a dispute on the right-hand side, where the workers are employed by the local authority, that dispute cannot go to an industrial court.  All the workers concerned are producing a national fuel.  In the one case the State has provided the money.  In the other case it is the money of the local ratepayers which is at stake.  The Minister on the last occasion said that the reason why the employees of the local authority could not go before the court was because the local authority had no representation on the court.  It was demonstrated to the Minister that there was no real substance in that argument since Bord na Móna would likewise have no representation on the court and, therefore, that special employer of turf workers will be at no greater disadvantage, or no special advantage, in having its case decided by an industrial court any more than the local authority.</P>
    <P>Now, that is something which could easily happen in County Kildare, or in several other counties.  Why, in a case like that, can we send one dispute to the court and why must we keep another dispute away from the court? It is not good sense.  If there is likely to be a dispute which may last for a considerable period the obvious thing and the sensible thing to do is to take it to the courts and get a judgment as soon as possible.  By excluding the employees of local authorities from this Bill the Minister has made is impossible for such a dispute to be referred to the court on a complaint being made by the employees.  That is undesirable procedure from the point of view of the Minister.  I am not sure that the local authority will be bound to pay the rate of wages fixed for turf workers by an industrial court if the employees <Col N="1153" /> of Bord na Móna, working on the other side of the road, go before the court and secure an award.  Could chaos go further?  If we were setting out deliberately to muddle affairs, we could hardly reach a higher state of perfection.  That is what will happen if we allow this situation to develop. Take the case of water and sewerage schemes.  Not infrequently, local authorities carry out these schemes by direct labour.  Local authorities may carry out some of the schemes by direct labour and others by contract.  If a dispute arises with the employees of a private contractor engaged on a water and sewerage scheme, they can go to the industrial court, but if a dispute arises in the case of the employees of a local authority engaged on a water and sewerage scheme, they cannot go to the industrial court.  Does not commonsense suggest that their case should go to the industrial court?  What is the case for excluding manual employees of local authorities from the provisions of this Bill?  The only case the Minister made was that local authorities were not represented on the court, but other bodies whose employees can go to the court will not have representation either.  The next reason the Minister gave was rather obscure&mdash;that there would be some technical difficulties in the way.</P>
    <P>Technical difficulties will arise under this Bill in a very large number of cases and they will have to be dealt with.  I think that the Department of Local Government could well adjust its legislation, if it impedes the application of this Bill to local authorities, so as to bring manual employees of local authorities within the provisions of the measure.  They should consider it good business to do so because of the assurance that, in the future, they would have machinery for smoothly adjusting differences which may arise between the employees of a local authority and that local authority.  On reconsideration, I think that the Minister should accept the position that this court be entitled to deal with disputes between the manual employees of local authorities and the local authorities. If, at a later stage, more appropriate machinery is evolved for application to <Col N="1154" /> employees of local authorities, then they can be switched from this Bill to whatever other Bill is introduced, but, in the meantime, I think that the Minister ought to put the local authority in possession of the useful piece of machinery provided for settlement of disputes in this Bill.  The Minister may say that he will not do that.  That is not reasoning.  The Minister has not reasoned so far as the manual employees of local authorities are concerned.  He has simply said: &ldquo;I do not want to do that&rdquo;.  That is not an argument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  The argument I advanced concerning the suitability of this court in the matter of disputes affecting the classes of persons named in Section 4 applied, I admit, much more forcibly to salaried, pensionable staffs than to manual workers. In the case to which the Deputy refers, where turf workers might be employed on adjacent bogs by a local authority and Bord na Móna, there is this fundamental differences between Bord na Móna and the local authorities: Bord na Móna can decide of its own responsibility to adjust the remuneration of these employees or their conditions of employment, or to negotiate with them and arrive at an agreement concerning their conditions or remuneration or, if the matter goes to the court, accept the verdict of the court on these issues. The local authority is not so free. Deputies may argue that they should be equally free.  That, I submit, is a separate contention.  The fact is they are not free and, consequently, there is a significant difference between the position of a local authority and the position of Bord na Móna or any other employer of turf workers.  It was that I had in mind when I referred to difficulties&mdash;not to technical difficulties of the kind that Deputy Norton understood me to mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An amendment to this Bill alone would not alter the position of the staffs of local authorities.  If the Deputy intends that the position of turf-working employees of local authorities should be the same <i>vis-à-vis</i> the local authority as that of employees of Bord na Móna <i>vis-à-vis</i> Bord na Móna, it <Col N="1155" /> would be necessary to have consequential amendments to Local Government legislation.  It may be that the view I expressed in Committee, that when this court will have been established and its method of functioning is known, when the position of local authorities in relation to their staffs is re-examined, there may be a decision that this court is as suitable as any that could be established but that decision has not yet been made.  So far as Deputy Morrissey's argument is concerned, he advanced the view that, if local authority staffs do not come under this Bill, they should come under some corresponding legislation. That is an arguable view but what I shall contend in relation to amendment No. 4 is that, if they are to be brought under this or any other legislation, it should be done by a separate Bill which the Dáil would have a full opportunity of examining, rather than by order of the Minister.  I do not want to traverse the ground we covered so fully in Committee.  I have given this matter a great deal of thought.  It seems to me that the wiser course is to leave the Bill with Section 4 as it stands, and not attempt to extend its scope to cover classes of persons which it was intended to exclude when all the provisions of the Bill were being framed.</P>

      <P>We are wiping out and changing a great many laws in the Schedules to this Bill.  I take it we are doing that because we think it is desirable to have harmonious relations between employers and employees and so prevent strikes.  All we are asking is that that should be applied to the only section of manual workers which is not already within the scope of the Bill.  We are now told that the sole objection to that course is the overriding authority which the Minister for Local Government has and which cannot be removed.  That is the Minister's case in a nutshell.  He has mended his hand somewhat inasmuch as he no longer contends that these workers cannot be fitted into the machinery of the Bill before us.  The only reason, so far as I can follow the Minister, for his refusing to accept the amendment is that to do so would necessitate the amending of existing local government statutes.  If that is the only difficulty, that is a difficulty we are getting over in relation to Bills every day in the week.  I want to put this point. Employees of local authorities have to man and are responsible for the functioning of various essential services. Are we to wait until something similar to the teachers' strike arises?  Supposing there is a dispute between the employees of a local authority engaged on some essential service, such as fire-fighting, or a waterworks, and the local authority, as a result of negotiation, are prepared to give them an advance or go some way to meet their demands, but the Minister will not allow them, as he has done, and a strike ensues, are we to stand by helpless with nobody able to do anything in the matter, the Minister digging his heels in in the same way as the Minister for Education is doing and the employees digging their heels in in the same way as the teachers and the community suffering between the two?</P>

      <P>Surely it ought to be brought into harmony with the provisions of this Bill.  Just look at what we are doing.  I referred on the last day, and Deputy Morrissey on this occasion, to the fact that employees of a local authority engaged on various essential services, such, for instance, as the control of a water supply in a city or urban area or fire-fighting activities, will be excluded from the scope of this Bill.  There may be a fellow carrying a sandwich board in O'Connell Street for some firm.  It does not matter to the community whether or not he carries a sandwich board.  It is not an urgent public service.  In fact, it is a type of employment which ought to be prohibited.  But a person carrying a sandwich board in O'Connell Street, if he has a dispute with his employer, can go before this court.  If a person picking up race cards on a racecourse after a race meeting has a dispute with the racecourse executive, he can go before this court if he has a dispute with his employers.  But if a person is responsible for putting out fires in the City or Dublin, or for ensuring that Dublin gets a proper sewerage and water service, he cannot go before this court.</P>

      <P>A dispute of that kind can continue, just as the teachers' strike has continued, simply because there is no suitable machinery for bringing a dispute of that kind into an atmosphere in which the matters in dispute can be settled by reference to an industrial court of this kind.  The only objection is that the Minister for Local Government has some kind of control which makes it <Col N="1159" /> desirable to keep them out.  But, if a dispute arises between the employees of a local authority and the local authority, in order to avoid the prolongation of that dispute the Minister for Local Government could consent to accepting the award of the court and in that way save whatever majesty he desires to save under existing legislation.  I feel that the Minister is not acting wisely in excluding these employees.  I would not press the amendment at this stage if we got a definite promise that a Bill to provide similar machinery for employees of local authorities would be introduced at an early date.  But, apparently, the Minister is not in a position to give that assurance and the only course, therefore, is to press the amendment.</P>

I should like to remind him that from the inception of this Bill he has set out to get a measure of agreement from the House as a whole on its various sections.  I think he will admit that, from this side of the House in any case, he has got a response, so far as it could be made, to make the Bill better than we found it on introduction.  On the Minister's side, I am bound to say that I checked up so far as I could the number of undertakings the Minister gave on the Committee Stage and I find that he has implemented them all in the series of amendments which he has produced for the Report Stage.  Throughout all this discussion there was, obviously, a desire on the part of the Minister to ensure that he would get the co-operation of those on this side of the House so that the Bill would be a workable and a good Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From our experience of the work of local authorities, particularly in the rural areas, during the last five or six years and the scandalously low rate of wages and the bad conditions, we are unanimous that if there is any section of the community that should be brought within the ambit of this Bill it is those rural workers.  I would say to the Minister that, if this amendment <Col N="1160" /> is not acceptable to him, then he will have to understand this particular section will be a blot on the Bill so far as those of us who understand local conditions are concerned.</P>

      <P>As I pointed out in Committee, the County Wicklow local authorities are the largest employers of skilled and unskilled labour in the erection of houses.  I understand the Minister pointed out that the local authorities always follow whatever award is given in the area.  But it is probably six months before the county manager agrees to give the wage awarded by the tribunal set up for private employers and another four months or six months before the Minister sanctions it.  In a case like that, where you have contractors engaged in the erection of cottages and they pay a higher wage than the county council and the county council workers go on strike, what remedy have we?  There is no court to which they can go and they may remain on strike while the workers engaged by ordinary employers will continue their labours at higher wages.  I appeal to the Minister to bring manual workers under this Bill and not allow the county councils, in their cottage erection programmes, under direct labour schemes, to have a preference over ordinary contractors.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, Section 4, line 10, before sub-section (2) to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) The Minister may by regulation made under this sub-section declare that any class of worker mentioned in paragraphs (c) to (h) of sub-section (1) of this section is a class of worker to which this Act applies and thereupon the provisions of Part VI of this Act shall apply and have effect accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to traverse the ground already covered in relation to amendment No. 2, or to repeat the practical argument that has been put forward in favour of the inclusion of certain workers that are now excluded.  In the course of the debate, it appeared to me that in relation to one particular section, namely, manual employees of local authorities, the Minister was setting up straw men to knock down. The two points he made were, first, that the inclusion of this class of <Col N="1163" /> workers would require the amendment of existing local government legislation and, secondly&mdash;the point he made in his final statement&mdash;that he would not like to give effect to the purpose of amendment No. 2 without having afforded the Dáil an opportunity of considering it.</P>
    <P>The whole point of amendment No. 4 is to provide rapid machinery by which the Minister could give effect to some of the undertakings that he has given to the House, namely, that on having experience of the working of the court that it is proposed to set up under this Bill and of its applicability and suitability to certain classes of workers, it would be considered then whether it would be practicable to extend the functions of the court to include these excluded classes.  The purpose of amendment No. 4 is to give the Minister that power by regulation.  That means that the Minister is not being coerced to do anything that he is not desirous of doing and, if he does so order by regulation, the Dáil will have an opportunity of discussing it.  The only point of difference is whether we should wait until such time as the Minister or some other Minister may make a decision in relation to some of the excluded classes and then await the introduction of the necessary legislation or whether the Minister should be provided with machinery in the present Bill which could be availed of as and when a decision may be taken either by the Government or by the responsible Minister.  I do not think that the amendment in any way imposes any strain or coercion upon the Minister.  It merely affords a rapid means of giving effect to such decisions as may be taken either by the Minister, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health or by the Government as a whole in regard to any of the excluded sections.  I cannot see that any principle is involved and it would afford Deputies on these benches an opportunity of addressing queries to the Minister or to other members of the Government from time to time as to the progress that has been made in considering the working of the labour court in relation to its <Col N="1164" /> applicability to these excluded sections and as to when they might be in a position to give effect by way of decision to such conclusions as they had arrived at.  Then this machinery would be available at short notice to bring into effect what we have been trying to do in seeking for direct conclusion in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not imagine the Deputy will have any difficulty at any time in finding occasion for addressing questions to members of the Government. The main objection I have to this amendment is that its acceptance by me might be interpreted as conveying the suggestion that at any time such an Order might be made.  I think the Deputy can take it as certain that such an Order would not be made and, therefore, it would be wrong, even by implication, to convey otherwise.  The arguments I advanced on amendment No. 2 hold good.  If it should be decided at any time that legislation of this character should be applied to any of the classes of persons named here, it would be a major decision of policy. It should, therefore, be given effect to by legislation rather than by Ministerial Order.  Apart altogether from that aspect of the matter, I think it is quite clear that the application of these principles to these classes of persons would require special consideration as to details and it is possible, and also probable, that in many respects the details of the measure which would apply the principles would be different from the details of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced by the Minister's arguments against this amendment.  It really asks that the machinery that is being set up for the preservation of industrial peace should cover a wider area.  The Minister has expressed objections to the inclusion of certain types of workers.  He has expressed confidence in the ability of this machinery to preserve peace in the industries that are covered by it.  I cannot understand why he will not take to himself the potential powers conveyed by this amendment which would enable him in certain eventualities to avail of this machine which it is hoped <Col N="1165" /> will be functioning successfully in other industrial spheres.  The Minister is not coerced into using the machinery at any time or place but if a serious dispute should arise there is not a suitable machine available at the moment to deal with it.  If the Minister were to accept this amendment he would have a machine standing by, in perfect running order.  He refuses to take power to make it available for him in order to prevent disputes developing and continuing.  I cannot advert to present disputes, but if such a machine were available, a notable dispute that has taken place would not be able to continue in its present form. Similar disputes may arise, and all the Minister is being asked to do is to leave it open to himself to apply the machine to a particular dispute, if, in the wisdom of the Government, it appeared that the time had come for applying it.  It is merely arming the Minister with powers which he ought to be glad to have to enable him to deal with these disputes.  I cannot see any major issue as grave as that which may arise in relation to the serious dislocation which might be caused, and this proposal might be the means of enabling him to wind up a particular dispute.  The Minister should seriously consider taking this power, which is to be used at his own discretion.  That is all he is asked to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point put in the amendment has not yet been answered by the Minister.  What is it that is required if the amendment is passed&mdash; merely that the Minister would have power from time to time by regulation to bring in certain of these excepted classes who have been deliberately excluded.  It is proposed to give the Minister power to say by regulation that the provisions of this measure shall apply to any of these groups of excepted people.  There are six of them&mdash;possibly only five now.  What is it that would be applied&mdash;resort to a court which, in the end, is asked to say, when a trade dispute arises, what are the terms upon which the dispute should be settled, having regard to the fairness of the terms proposed and the <Col N="1166" /> prospects of these terms being accepted?</P>
      <P>What is there in principle to distinguish these people from a measure which only, in the end, relates to them and does not provide anything in the way of compulsion?  It simply means that if there is a dispute between any of these classes of workers and the people who employ them, a body, recognised as a statutory body under this measure, would be asked to examine into the merits of the dispute, to report on these merits and to say what, in their view, would be a fair settlement. The two things which they are asked to pay attention to are the fairness of the terms proposed and the prospects of these terms being accepted. I cannot see why, the result being so small in a sense&mdash;certainly a result not reached by compulsion&mdash;the Minister should object to agreeing that he might find it possible, in relation to a particular dispute, to say that some of these classes would be brought in from the point of view of having the dispute examined into and a recommendation made as to the terms considered fair.  Why should the Minister think it is impossible?  Why should he now say that he cannot conceive any circumstances in which it would be fair, possible and just to have a dispute considered by this court and a recommendation made as to terms of settlement?</P>

      <P>I have explained that there is nothing in the Bill which would prevent the court being utilised, with the consent of the parties concerned, to investigate and report on any dispute.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if there may be objections in a general way, the Minister here is only asked to take power, which will operate only when he decides to operate it, to apply the provisions of this Bill to the categories of workers set out in sub-section (4), or, rather, to certain of these categories. There is, therefore, no compulsion on the Minister to apply the provisions of this Bill to these classes of workers, nor is he being put in the position of compelling workers to accept the provisions of the Bill.  The whole thing is a purely voluntary operation.  The Minister is being asked to take power to make regulations which will enable him to bring these workers within the scope of the Bill (1) if they desire to operate the Bill, and (2) only for the purpose of having whatever dispute exists adjudicated upon by this industrial court or by an arbitration court, the adjudication being in the form not of an award which must be accepted compulsorily but of a recommendation.</P>
      <P>The Minister is simply being asked to avail of this piece of machinery if, at any time, the circumstances require the application of this Bill to the types of employment set out in sub-section (4).  The Minister is not being committed to a course of action or a course of conduct which he does not himself initiate, because he is not compelled to do any of these things, unless he himself makes the regulation.  If he does not make the regulation, he has not to bring these workers within the scope of the Bill; but if he does make the regulation, he will presumably make it only after careful consideration and only because he is satisfied that it is desirable to make it and because he has no other machinery which would serve the same purpose as this machinery when he makes a regulation from time to time bringing these grades of workers within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing is being foisted on the Minister by the amendment.  It merely gives him a power which he need never use if he does not wish to do so, but which, if it should prove to be useful <Col N="1168" /> next month or next year, will be at his disposal.  If, after careful consideration, he says: &ldquo;I think it is desirable to use it&rdquo;, he can do so, instead of having to come to the House for a new piece of legislation and having to get it through all its stages here and in the Seanad.  This is a handy piece of machinery in reserve which can be utilised if the Minister ever so desires. He cannot be compelled to use it&mdash;the initiative rests with himself all the time.  Why will he not take this power?  It seems to me to be something for which the Minister ought to be asking rather than something which we should be offering to him.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, Section 10 (2), line 49, to delete the word &ldquo;four&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;two&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this amendment for the reason that I consider that the members of the court are not applicants.  They listen to the case put forward by each party.  If you have four members on the court, you may have the two employers lining up with the two employees' representatives and, instead of deciding the case on the facts as submitted to them, they may decide on what may happen outside.  Under the Bill, the members of the court must not be officials of a trade union.  Why have a trade union to instruct the other man, who may not be an official?  My experience of tribunals is that you get a speedier decision from three members, and there is very little objection or unnecessary delay.  If you have two employers or two employees retiring to a room to consult one another, I do not see how there is to be harmony in the court.  I take it the Minister is going to select the best representatives from either employers' or workers' side.  Certainly the man selected should not require the assistance of a colleague. If it is necessary for him, after hearing the facts and the evidence, to have the assistance of some colleague, I say that man should not be selected for the court.  If an individual is unable to make up his mind on the case <Col N="1170" /> submitted, after hearing the evidence from the workers and from the employers, he is not fit for such a judicial capacity.  I think it would detract from the harmony of the court to have more than three representatives.  We have had experience of many thousands of cases coming before the Wages Tribunal and these would be the first cases that might come before a labour court.  Under this Bill there will be two representatives from each side. My experience, like that of other Deputies, is that there would be speedier decisions and more harmony by having three men who are detached from any organisation and by letting them decide the case on the facts submitted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will remember, when I introduced the Bill, it provided for a court of three members. I had formed the view originally that a court of three would work more expeditiously and possibly more harmoniously than a larger court.  During the course of the discussion in Committee, however, it appeared there was some likelihood of agreement on the basis of a larger court and some practical arguments of considerable weight were advanced in favour of a larger court.  I would refer particularly to Deputy O'Sullivan's argument concerning the desirability of having two people of like mind on each side who would consult with each other wherever cases of particular intricacy or difficulty might arise; and to the possibility that each worker or employer member would arrive more confidently at his decision if he found it was confirmed by a colleague of his own rather than if he had to act entirely on his individual judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, in consequence of the apparent agreement in favour of a larger court, I decided to use the fact that the court was to be five instead of three members to incorporate in the Bill a device to meet the admitted difficulty of ensuring expeditious disposal of business at a time when business might be unduly heavy.  The device, which is provided for in an amendment, provides for dividing the court into two parts, in such temporary circumstances.  Of course, that would <Col N="1171" /> not be practicable if the court were of smaller size and, admitting that that difficulty exists, elaborate alternative provision would probably have to be made to meet it.  On the whole, therefore, I think it wiser to leave the Bill as it is.</P>
    <P>I do not think the loss of expedition and possible loss of harmony in consequence of the larger court will prove to be serious.  In fact, in time of exceptional pressure of business, the larger court will permit of expedition and I think there should be little risk to harmony to an extent that will not be resolved by the proposed method of arriving at decisions.  We do not expect that all the members of the court will agree on all questions. They might disagree on some questions, but there is a provision that will ensure that the persons coming before the court will get a decision, even if there is a difference of views among the individual members.  On the whole, it seems to me that the balance of argument is in favour of the larger court.</P>

      <P>I am also one of those proposing to go back to the original structure of the Bill, namely, two representatives.  This is a court and three judges&mdash;that is what they really amount to&mdash;will quite easily be able to ascertain the facts.  The Minister said he was struck by the argument that people could consult one another, but having five will enormously increase the difficulties of the court in getting one mind on a problem.  Where any dispute is submitted to the court, no doubt there will <Col N="1172" /> be some sort of argument as to the merits of the dispute and if there is any doubt about any question the facts can be easily ascertained and witnesses or documents could be called for.  The Minister has said, quite rightly, that if this amendment is accepted, he will have to undertake redrafting the Bill as far as substitutes for these people are concerned.  I do not think that would be a bad thing at all, as there is a possibility that there might be sickness or other trouble in connection with some of those representatives and he might very well find himself at a time when he could not get his court established.  I would suggest to him to go back to the original wording. When you have five, it is getting up to a rather large committee, in which the debates will go on even amongst the members, and I suggest that he should accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In the various courts established under other statutes in no case was more than three required to constitute a quorum.  As I understand it, this court will consist of three independent persons.  Before being appointed they will have to sever connection with their organisations.  If a representative of wage earners has, at the present time, any official trade union position he would have to resign, so as to be independent, and to be able to exercise his private judgment. I think a smaller number is best.  In the opinion of a good many people who were consulted, apparently the court, as constituted in the original draft of the Bill, was considered to be the proper constitution.  I intend to support the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Pattison has referred to the position of other tribunals.  One board that comes to my memory is the Trade Union Tribunal, consisting of a chairman and four ordinary members.  It can be admitted that, in the main, a board of three is regarded as a more ordinary board.  I am swayed by the argument of Deputy Dockrell that if there were five members there would be more discussion, that it would be a debating society where matters could be worked out by argument.  As long as it would <Col N="1173" /> not be too prolonged I would be in favour of having considerable debate behind an industrial court before any decision was come to.  For that reason I would be in favour of a board larger than is now proposed.  On the other hand, we have to realise that it is a rather painful thing that there is disunity at the moment and that the Minister set out&mdash;he still adheres to it&mdash;so that in the organisation of the court he would apply to an organisation representative of workers to give him a member.</P>
      <P>The various groups might be asked to nominate, and the Minister will make an appointment from amongst those nominated.  That from the trade union angle could not be considered as desirable as the method by which a representative body would send forward a name.  However, the situation being as it is I cannot see what other solution there is at the moment than to set up two&mdash;two&mdash;one.  The safeguard with regard to this arrangement is that this measure could only work if those forming the court agreed not merely to the fact of a court being established, but to the personnel.  If the personnel of the court is not very fully agreed upon, to step it up in its operations, I do not see any harm in having this method.  Those who will be asked to send representatives from the employers' side will not suffer from the particular weakness that is on the other side at the moment.  In face of the situation prevailing I do not see how anybody could ask the Minister to have a set up of three.  I think we should stick to the enlarged court.  On the present basis I want the enlarged court.</P>

      <P>While it is agreed that a small court makes for expedition, it is necessary, in view of the important matters to be considered, that some variety should be brought to bear on the questions at issue.  The difficulty with regard to labour has been emphasised.  If that difficulty continues it can be got over only by having two representatives.  There is also a difficulty with regard to employers.  In view of the fact that employers are not united in one big organisation it would <Col N="1174" /> be difficult to find one representative with a grasp of all the problems which employers in many industries have to face.  It would be very difficult to find one representative of employers who understood the problems of industrial and commercial employers who, at the same time, would have a good grasp of agricultural matters.</P>
      <P>I am strongly in favour of having at least two representatives of employers' interests, as well as two representatives of labour.  I am also in favour of having one of the representatives of employers a person with a knowledge of agriculture.  I do not want it to be taken that such representatives should be regarded as employers' representatives in the narrow sense.  We will have to regard them as judges, inasmuch as they should have personal knowledge or some grasp of the problems with which they will have to deal.</P>

      <P>Later I have amendment No. 10 which, though not drafted in the way which I consider ideal, is the best thing I could get in a hurried week-end.  It gives me the ground for arguing my point on this amendment.  I suggest that the Minister will be able to build up support for the chairman and the two representatives on each side in the way here indicated.  I want to add two extra members and I suggest that the Minister should consult these organisations or groups of individuals, receive from them nominations and take from among the nominees of these two other members&mdash;one who would be a person knowing something about certain matters and another who would have a knowledge of certain other matters. I mentioned this matter on Second Reading, but I have no hope yet that it will be carried.  It has been said in regard to proposals of this sort that they pass through three stages, the first being that in which they are laughed at, the second that in which they are received with a certain amount of hostility and the third that in which they are seriously discussed. I do not believe that this will be even seriously discussed; whether we have even got to the laughing stage I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked that this court should be made a court which would make some new approach to the question of conditions of employment.  I suggest that we should try to get a body which will endeavour to move away from the discredited <Col N="1176" /> ideas of the last quarter of a century in regard to terms of wages when wages were viewed as something which had to be subtracted from what would otherwise be regarded as a just gain by the employer.  New methods of fixing wages have been evolved in recent years largely through the influence of encyclicals and nowadays in fixing wages we think of the purchasing power of the rest of the community, in terms of what will be effected by the new money on the communal life of the workers by helping to raise the whole standard of living. I should like to have the court built up on the lines Deputy Pattison suggested in the last amendment but to apply it only to certain representative people.  I do not know whether there are individuals on whom two likely disputing parties would ever agree, whether one could get a group of people who would not be simply actively interested or advocates for either side but who would be people who could take a broad liberal conception of the relations that should exist between workers and employees.  It would be far better to have such a court with assessors added.  We have got representative bodies but we hope that both workers and the trade unions will think in terms not merely of advocates but will think along broader lines.  I must say in answer to myself on that issue that both will start off on the representative side.</P>
    <P>I went to the Constitution to see what assistance I could get in framing these amendments and I found in Article 45 these directive principles on social policy.  It is stated that the application of those principles shall not be cognisable by the courts.  The attention of the Oireachtas is directed merely to the Article and we are asked to promote legislation along the lines of the social views which are developed in Article 45.  We are asked to see that&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the State shall strive to promote the welfare of the whole people by securing and protecting as effectively as it may, a social order in which justice and charity shall inform all the institutions of the national life.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> Then it is stated that&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the State shall in particular direct its policy towards securing that the citizens (all of whom, men and women equally, have the right to adequate means of livelihood) may through their occupations find the means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot think but that that is an echo, but put in another term, of what has been urged in numerous encyclicals in the last 50 years.  At the same time, we are asked to make provision for things for which the majority of our people could not make any adequate provision.  The matter of credit would have to come into this and would certainly have its influence on the background of the discussions that will take place in the court.  In addition to that, when we come to the private property Article, while the State here acknowledges that men have the natural right to the private ownership of external goods, in sub-section (2) of the Article it is laid down that&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the State recognises that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What these principles are I do not know.  That phrase has in one case come before an ordinary court in this country for interpretation and evoked the view of one judge that the phrase had no meaning, that it was merely a political shibboleth and that there were no standards by which these principles could be tested, certainly that the principles could not be brought down to any such level as enabled him to find standards which objectively he could apply in particular cases.  That is not the last word to be said on the principles, and I do not imagine that the phrase was put into the Constitution merely to have a decision of that sort given so that the matter might rest there.</P>
    <P>I take it that those who framed the Constitution had some idea of social justice and of the principles upon which social justice might be established <Col N="1178" /> throughout the country, particularly in relation to the ownership of private property.  When the Minister proceeds to set up this court, we suggest that he should add two other people to it, one of whom would be taken from amongst a list of people sent in who have a knowledge of the principles of social justice.  I can well imagine to whom I would go if I wanted to get suggestions as to where to find people who might be regarded as having some knowledge of social justice.  The other phrase I do not like.  What I have asked is that the Minister would invite organisations who have knowledge and practical experience of social services to submit a list of names.  This is also from the Constitution.  Of course it is a peculiar paragraph of the Constitution but it is now the build-up of the Seanad&mdash;the administrative panels of certain people having knowledge and experience of public administration. That is the text of the phrase I have quoted.</P>
    <P>I do not like the phrase.  It does not completely express the view that I hope to put before the House.  In a hurried week-end, it was the only thing that came to my hand to give me a foothold on which to argue the point here.  I really would like to find out if there are not people in this country who could be put on this court, people having some idea of the effect of wages on the community as a whole, say, as consumers.  I want to avoid misconception when I speak of consumers. When I do so I do not mean those who will always be frightened by any increase in wages.  I am rather thinking of the consuming population of people who, while being consumers, will have to live, either themselves or their sons or daughters, by getting occupation in some line of work, and who will be able to appreciate the other point of view that I mentioned earlier&mdash;of not thinking in terms only of some possible small rise in the cost of a commodity. I do not at all accept it that any increase in wages necessarily means an increase in the cost of the commodity. When I speak of consumers, I am thinking of those with views with regard to a better standard of living and a better status for employees generally <Col N="1179" />&mdash;thinking of better production as leading to a better life for the whole community. It is that viewpoint that is at the back of the new ideas that we will be discussing to-morrow in connection with U.N.O.</P>
    <P>I would like to try to make the Constitution real.  We have there expressed the view&mdash;it was certainly implied in the passing of the Constitution&mdash;that there is something called social justice, and that there are principles which regulate it.  If that be the case, and I accept it as the case, then there must be people who will be able to tell a court of four or five persons what is social justice in relation to the particular matter that is being discussed, and how the principles which underlie it and as known may be applied to the dispute. In that way, one may be able to have this whole matter of the conditions of employment and of wages considered away merely from the pressure and the counter-pressure of employees and employers, and arrive at decisions to make modern the medieval conception of the just wage, measured by some standards of objectivity in dealing with any disputes that came before the court.</P>
    <P>In other countries where arbitration courts either of the compulsory or voluntary type have been established, there has been an acceptance of the view that prior to the setting up of any court, there is required, as a definite condition precedent to that, the establishment of certain social legislation, legislation which would accept the sort of thing that we have accepted in the Constitution.  We have at least accepted the headlines, though we have not yet worked out the details.  Is not this an occasion on which the details might be worked out in respect of disputes that may come before this court? If we are to have this court, would it not be a good thing to have two people on it with minds better informed than those who might be thrown up by the conditions leading to individual disputes, whether in regard to wages or conditions of employment: by people who might be able to put the whole <Col N="1180" /> matter into a bigger framework and who would look at it in a more liberal way?  When one reads about social justice, wage standards and the just wage, and when one thinks that these are matters to be determined by the court, I cannot conceive any employees who would not willingly accept this as an experiment, and would not feel that it would be a good thing to have such views expressed in the case of a particular wage dispute.</P>
    <P>I think it will be agreed that no wages in this country have for years measured up at all to what would be regarded as the ordinary standard to enable people to make provision for domestic needs, not merely to live, and not merely to live in frugal comfort, but to be able to do something more than that&mdash;to be able to acquire, in the words of one of the encyclicals, some private property or some private sustenance of their own.  I could imagine people being scared at this.  I could imagine all sorts of cranks parading themselves as being knowledgeable along certain lines.  There is the safeguard that the Minister will have to be satisfied.  He will get nominations and will have to make his choice from amongst the names sent up.  There is the bigger safeguard that, if the court is not built up in a way which appeals to the likely disputants, then the court may be brought to a standstill.  I suggest that the court would be liberalised by having people on it who could lend their assistance in that way.  The proposal is that there would be only two out of seven.  Therefore as regards the people who could lend their advice in the way that I speak of, one could hardly say that their voices would be the determining voices in any dispute. They might lend weight to one side or the other but will anyone say that they would not like to have weight lent on the basis of this being practicable? If it is practicable, and if it is possible to get people who are able to discover what social justice is, and what its principles are, will anybody object to having the principles of social justice applied to a wage dispute in this way?  I do not think that anybody would be brave enough to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan has raised some very wide issues which can hardly be adequately discussed at this stage on this Bill.  Let what we are doing here be quite clear.  Wage rates for all classes of workers in this country have been determined largely by a process of bargaining.  This Bill is based on the assumption that they will still be determined largely by a process of bargaining.  In the past, however, the process of bargaining was not always successful in settling particular issues without resort to strikes or lock-outs.  The sole purpose of this Bill is to try to minimise the possibility of disputes about wage rates leading to strikes.  It is framed on the assumption that the process of bargaining will, however, be the primary method of determining what the levels of wage rates are to be.  I am quite prepared to agree that a process of bargaining may not produce rates of wages in any occupation which would be considered best on the basis of some theory of economic policy or of social policy.  If, however, we are to endeavour to secure that wage rates are related to some economic or social theory, we cannot do so by the machinery proposed here.  We would have to take powers of control over all wage rates and over all forms of remuneration if we were to get the desired results.  This court is to be a voluntary court.  It will be used by those engaged in the process of bargaining when they have reached difficulties which cannot be resolved except by some such machinery as that set out in the Bill.  My objection to the amendment is that it is an attempt to introduce into this machine something that does not fit.  If we were to put responsibility on the court to relate wages to economic and social theories, then this court would have to be given powers that we are not proposing to give it.  If, on the other hand, we appear to give this court responsibility in relation to social and economic theories we take the risk that people will not use it because it cannot have such responsibility and relate it to the process of bargaining which is a necessary concomitant of such a court.  I shall not dispute with Deputy McGilligan the point that employment and prosperity are conditional <Col N="1182" /> upon adequate purchasing power being available amongst the people.  I shall not, however, agree that the best way of ensuring an adequacy of purchasing power is by altering the wages paid to workers in employment.  There are other ways in which that can be done and in circumstances much less productive of practical and social difficulties.</P>

      <P>By a reduction of taxation, thereby leaving more purchasing power in the pockets of the people is another way.  There are a multitude of ways by which a deficiency in purchasing power can be assisted.  Other kinds of difficulties might arise which would affect purchasing power.  In other countries difficulties have arisen because of too much purchasing power. If we contemplate adjusting wages to rectify such a situation we shall find ourselves in difficulties which cannot be resloved by a court of this kind. My main objection to the amendment is that it is trying to do something which this instrument is specifically designed not to do.  We are trying to complete the process of bargaining by which wages are regulated at the present time in a manner which will minimise, if not altogether avoid, the ultimate risk of a strike or lock-out. If we give this court responsibility for the social and economic consequences of the wages actually applied in particular occupations, then we shall have to go much further than is proposed here.  We shall have to give the court coercive power and we shall have to ensure that every form of earned remuneration will come within the ambit of the court.  My main objection, therefore, to this amendment is that it would give to this court responsibilities <Col N="1183" /> and functions which, if the people believed that this court possessed such, would result in no application ever being made to the court and we would thereby nullify the purpose for which the court is established. I think we ought not to adopt this amendment, but that we should rather confine the court within the narrow, practicable and limited sphere which it is proposed to do under this measure.  We should constitute the court in such a manner as will make it quite clear to those who will use it what its limited functions are.</P>

      <P>There is such a thing as social justice and there are principles relating to social justice which are known to somebody.  I do not think we are so devoid of intelligence or information in this country that we will agree to the suggestion that there is nobody in this country <Col N="1184" /> competent to adjudicate on matters of social justice.  Was it to be interpreted, when this Article was introduced, that we were going to call in an outsider to help us?  I did not ask to have the service regulated by principles of social justice.  I merely asked that on the court to be set up there should be one man out of seven who would know what the principles of social justice are and who could inform his colleagues in relation to the matters under dispute.  I have another amendment in which I ask that one of the things to be considered should be the principles of social justice.  In this amendment now under discussion I merely ask that one man out of seven would be a man well informed as to the principles of social justice.  The Minister says wages are built up by a process of bargaining.  Very good. Let them continue to be so built up. But let us give them a new touchstone; let us give them a new higher level, namely, the principles of social justice which are referred to specifically in our Constitution.  Let us have one man who will advise the other six when any dispute arises as to what the principles of social justice are.  Let the bargainers thereby know that their demands are below the principles of social justice or that they are too high. That is all we want to do here in this amendment.  Let us have the bargaining process but let us also have the application of those principles of social justice which are sanctioned in our Constitution.</P>
      <P>The Minister made one point that too much purchasing power might be bad for a community.  Of course it might.  I hope I have not said anything in any speech of mine here to-day which might be interpreted as approaching this matter from only one angle, namely, always and ever-increasing purchasing power.  There is a time when too much purchasing power might be very bad.  Too much purchasing power in relation to too few goods would be disastrous.  The people I have in mind would realise that and they would be the very people who would have their minds attuned to every phase and would be competent to advise this court, or to warn it.</P>

I think the tendency which has developed throughout the world of trying to regulate the whole economic system through the medium of social services is not the proper way.  Neither do I think that such regulation can be brought about through a multiplicity of industry.  It think it is much better to have fewer and well paid industries, by means of which the people are given control of their own lives and an opportunity of rearing up dignified, responsible citizens by giving them wages which they can spend on the provision of their domestic needs, putting on them the responsibility of wise spending.  I think that is the proper way rather than by means of social services or a reduction in taxation.  A reduction in taxation is a good thing if it means that the cost of living is going down for certain people. The imposition put upon the people is akin to a wage reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made another point that if we give this court this power we would have to give them control over a lot of other things and that we would be giving them power to coerce the people into this, that and the other. That is only true if the Minister's preamble is accepted as correct.  What I am urging here is some idea of an economic theory.  I introduced the question of full employment as one matter. I merely gave that as an example and not as an inherently fundamental argument.  There is no necessity for anything in the nature of control under this amendment of mine.  The only things which the court will have to consider are the people themselves, their strength, the part they play in the life of the community, the trouble they may cause if a dispute takes place and continues for any length of time, the strain&mdash;either physical or mental. Under my amendment the net result is that in this court there would be one man out of seven who could say to them, &ldquo;Remember, gentlemen, these demands fall far short of what social <Col N="1186" /> justice demands in this country.&rdquo;  That does not entail any crippling of the functions of this court.  It simply means, in relation to a particular dispute as to conditions of employment or as to wages, there will be one mind on the new court informed by the teaching of the Catholic Church which can interpret the principles of social justice for the other six.  I think when we have this pious Constitution we ought to implement it when the opportunity arises.</P>

      <P>This amendment relates to amendment No. 12.  I do not know if it is desired to discuss the principle of amendment No. 12 on amendment No. 8.  I mentioned in the course of the Committee Stage discussion that I would produce this amendment, which provides an alternative method of selecting workers' members of the court in circumstances where the Minister considers it undesirable to take the procedure which would be the normal procedure under the Bill and more than one organisation of trade unions of workers is in being.  The proposal in the amendment is that, in such circumstances, the Minister will invite nominations from representative trade union organisations of workers and appoint two members from those so nominated, the members so appointed to hold office for whichever is the shorter period&mdash;the period of their appointment or until the Order bringing that provision into operation is revoked. The intention is that the Order would be revoked if circumstances arose which would permit of both nominees being appointed on the nomination of the one trade union organisation without any dispute.</P>

    <P>My object is to increase the circle from which the Minister can, ultimately, draw people for this court from the employers' side.  Possibly, the Minister will say that I have taken a strange way of bringing that about, because the effect, at the beginning, might be rather to limit the scope of the Minister's choice.  I believe that it would be for the ultimate good of everybody if the employers were, to an increasing extent, organised in various groups. Of course, nobody thinks that an employer's representative chosen from a trade union would fail to do justice to unorganised employers.  I merely wish to increase the power and prestige of the court by inviting employers to organise more and more as trade unions and be more and more able to give an effective, united and representative opinion to the court on matters concerning industrial disputes.  Accordingly, I ask the Minister favourably to consider this amendment.</P>

If the Deputy tells me that that is so, I am quite prepared to accept the amendment, which means that the Minister would be limited to trade unions of employers as distinct from organisations of employers, which might not be registered as trade unions.  The amendment should be: to delete &ldquo;an organisation representative&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;a trade union&rdquo;, so that it would read &ldquo;a trade union of employers&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This amendment is intended to meet a point which was raised on Committee Stage as regards the right of the Minister to turn down nominations made by the trade unions.  I pointed out then that no trade union would continue to send names to the Minister if they were to be turned down.  I suggest in this amendment that whatever nomination is made should be accepted automatically by the Minister, so that we shall not have a handpicked body which would be representative of the Minister rather than of the workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This provision was the result of a suggestion from trade <Col N="1189" /> unions consulted in connection with the Bill&mdash;that the Minister should have some responsibility for the persons who actually constitute the court.  I am not very keen on maintaining the provision because I think that, in practice, it will prove to be inoperative, that Deputy Everett is right in this regard&mdash;that, if the Minister turns down the nominees of trade unions, he will cause a row but may not succeed in getting a second nomination if the rejection be on general grounds.  There are provisions for removal of a member for special reasons which, I think, would be adequate.  My main dislike for the provision is that it will prove impracticable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I was thinking of the case in which, by reason of illness, or getting into bad repute for some personal reason, a member could be removed.  The Minister would exercise the power in (4) (b) for some different reason&mdash;on the grounds of unsuitability of the member from the point of view of his standing in Labour circles or something of that kind.  I cannot see any organisation of trade unions, having their nominee rejected in that way, not protesting very strongly and, possibly, refusing to make an alternative nomination, which would bring that whole section to a standstill.  That is why I would not be averse to the principle of the amendment, but I should like to get some guidance from others who would be concerned in the operation of the court.  The theory underlying this provision in the Bill is that the Minister should have some responsibility in relation to the persons constituting the court; that, even though the primary right of nomination rests with the organisations of trade unions, the Minister should have a function which would give him responsibility in relation to their general suitability or their suitability having regard to the circumstances at any time.  On consideration, I think it is desirable to leave it out, because I cannot see the circumstances <Col N="1190" /> under which there would be one organisation of trade unions in regard to which the Minister would exercise that function.  Perhaps, it may be agreed that the insertion of the new sub-section (5) does in fact remove the primary argument advanced in favour of this provision.  If there is no objection, I am prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any great argument in favour of it.  So far as the present wording is concerned, I think it is beneficial to a certain extent to leave a certain responsibility on the Minister and not to place him in the position, if the court, say, did not prove satisfactory to all parties concerned, to be able to say: &ldquo;This is your court; I have no responsibility for it.&rdquo;  Secondly, while I am as ready as anyone to defend the trade union movement, we are only human beings and we may make mistakes as well as anyone else.  As the section stands, having made a mistake, we could not rectify it.  If our attention is called to the fact that a nomination might be given further consideration, further consideration might be given to it and a change might be made in the nomination.  It does not in any way imply that every time a nomination is made there will be a sending back of the nomination. It is a proviso that may be availed of in circumstances that might arise.  The most important argument, I think, in favour of it is that it will not divest the Minister of all responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good argument. The argument is really this: That, while it is highly improbable that any Minister would attempt to use this power, except in very exceptional circumstances, if the exceptional circumstances did arise, he would have the power, and, in the absence of the power, he could do nothing.  I think it is wiser to leave it as it is.</P>

The situation you are contemplating is that of a representative trades union being asked to nominate somebody, that the Minister will find objection to him, and the trade union will bow to that and say: &ldquo;We will nominate somebody else.&rdquo;  I can imagine a situation in which a person, on any consideration that may be thought of, may be considered desirable and he might afterwards prove not to be a suitable nominee.

I can see a Minister deciding that, because of experience or some view of his own, a member of the Oireachtas should not be nominated.  That is the best illustration I can get at the moment.  At present members of the Oireachtas are not debarred from being nominated as members of the court.  I think there are good reasons why a member of the court should not be a member of the Oireachtas.  The Minister might have a member of the <Col N="1192" /> Oireachtas nominated by an organisation and say, &ldquo;I decline to accept him; not that I do not think he would be an excellent member, but for the reason that he is a member of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.

      <P>Under sub-section (6), we are dealing with the case of a member of the court being removed after appointment and there we will require, as I think we have, very careful safeguards, because the removal of a member of the court who occupies such a position publicly would have wide repercussions.  Under the section we are dealing with now and which we propose to amend we are in fact dealing with what is a private recommendation from a trade union body sent to the Minister and probably it will be dealt with privately between the Minister and that body.  At that stage, there might be certain reasons which would urge the Minister to suggest reconsideration. In that case, there would be no question of hurting the dignity of the trade union, and, very possibly, of hurting the dignity of the individual involved.  It would be a question of reconsideration.  Sub-section (6) is dealing with an entirely different question.</P>

The trade unions will have as much information with regard to the nominee as the Minister will have.  I would not deny to the Minister the power to remove afterwards, but I do object to this.  When a trade union organisation, on the invitation of the Minister, nominates a member of the court they will nominate him because they believe he is the most suitable man in their organisation to represent them on the court.  That man will not allow his name to go forward if he knows that he may not be appointed by the Minister.  If such a person were not selected by the Minister, I do not believe any other man in the organisation would allow his name to go forward and the Minister would have endless difficulty.  I cannot see any responsible trade unionist allowing his name to go forward, believing that he will be at the mercy of the Minister. Once a union with full responsibility selects a person, he will be in duty bound to accept.</P>

So far as we are concerned, we think that is a very good course, and the amendment is acceptable. On the point when the Minister comes to make his selection, I observe this in the final paragraph: &ldquo;He shall make the appointment from amongst the persons so nominated.&rdquo;  Are we to understand that in the final selection the two nominees will be representative of the two organisations which are in existence?</P>

If we cannot get a court constituted by agreement between existing organisations, the only solution is to give the Minister fairly wide power so that he can contact the various interests concerned and proceed as appears best to him. The Minister will have the compelling necessity of getting a court that will be acceptable.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6, Section 10, to delete sub-section (5), lines 17, 18 and 19 and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(&nbsp;) An ordinary member shall, unless he dies, resigns or is removed, hold office&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  if appointed under sub-section (4) of this section, for such period, not exceeding five years, as shall be fixed by the Minister when appointing him,</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> (b)  if appointed under sub-section (5) of this section, for five years or, if the regulations, by virtue of which he was appointed, are sooner revoked or annulled, until such revocation or annulment.</P>
    <P>This amendment is consequential, the intention being that the persons nominated under sub-section (5) by the Minister will hold office only so long as the circumstances that compel resort to sub-section (5) exist.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6, Section 10, to delete sub-section (8), lines 26 and 27, and substitute the following sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(&nbsp;) The chairman shall devote the whole of his time to the work of the court.</P>
      <P>(&nbsp;) An ordinary member shall not hold the office of trustee, treasurer, secretary or any other office in, or be a member of any committee of, a trade union, or hold any office or employment which would prevent him from being at all times available for the work of the court.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment about which I have some little doubt.  The Bill provides that the members of the court will devote their whole time to the work of the court.  That is not altogether essential, and it may constitute a difficulty in practice.  I devised this amendment to express what we want to secure; first, that the members of the court will cease connection with trade unions of employers or workers and act as members of the court other than as representatives of these organisations, and, secondly, that they will always be available for the work of the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not press the amendment if there is any objection, but it seems to me it is desirable not to make the sub-section too restrictive in its effect. If we achieve the purpose set out in the amendment it will be sufficient.  There may be difficulty in getting employers' representatives who will be accepted as <Col N="1198" /> such and who, at the same time, will be able to devote the whole of their time to the work of the court.  Amendment No. 14 would permit of the possibility of a person being nominated as an employers' representative while remaining as director of a company or in some post of that kind which would, nevertheless, leave him available at all times for the work of the court.</P>
    <P>That is the purpose of the amendment. It has been suggested there may be some practical difficulty in getting two employers' representatives prepared to give all their time to the work of the court and have no other form of employment and, consequently, it was desirable to limit the sub-section to the precise purpose.</P>

      <P>Why not say so?  It is stated, for instance, in the Constitution, with regard to judges, that they are not to hold any other office of profit or emolument.  Could not the same thing be said about the chairman? The situation with regard to an ordinary member is that he shall not hold the office of trustee, secretary, treasurer, or any other office in, or be a member of any committee of, a trade union, but apparently a man could be overloaded with business affiliations, all bringing him in profits and still be a member of this court.</P>

It is because sub-section (8) might be held to exclude from membership of a court a person who had some <Col N="1200" /> other employment than that which did not interfere with his membership of the court that I thought the amendment was necessary.</P>

We have three parties&mdash; the chairman, the employers' member and the workers' member.  It is, therefore, essential, to get an equal balance. In so far as the workers' members are concerned, they may be a member of a trade union but they may not be a member of the committee or hold a minor office as secretary, trustee, and so on.  Yet, so far as the individual is concerned, there is no pecuniary benefit accruing from the holding of such office.  The trustee is an unpaid officer and, while he may have a sentimental interest in the welfare of his union, there is no personal gain to him from it.  Take the position of the chairman of the court.

Suppose somebody succeeds in effectively breaking a black market regulation or something of that kind and the knowledge of the transaction does not come to the Minister or to anybody else in authority for nine months after it has been perpetrated, does the limitation envisaged here run from the alleged date of the offence or from the date on which the Minister first became apprised of the commission of the offence?

Take, for instance, the negotiation of gold coins, or something of that kind.  Suppose a man bought a very large number of gold coins and carefully secreted them for the statutory period of 12 months and then walked down O'Connell Street and bade all comers defiance, the Minister might be in a position to see at once that the man purchased the gold coins but, as he bought on the 1st January, 1947, and it was then 1st February, 1948, under this proviso, he is powerless.

      <P>You are, I think. I do not know if Deputy Cosgrave's premises are correct, but if they are, you are interfering.  The Deputy has made the point that under the Order dealing with pigs and bacon matters, the period was extended not merely by the unlimited time, but in this way, that whatever limitation there might be at any time on the taking of summary proceedings, it dated in certain connections from the date of the receipt of certain information and not from the date of the offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the reason that it was apparently considered that there might have been a relaxation of that unlimited time in which to take proceedings. I do not know what was in the mind of the draftsman but some reason made him provide that a prosecution should run within a limited time, the starting point of the limited time being the date of the receipt of the information.  The Deputy has said so, and I understand it is correct.  The Minister, I think, will agree with me in this, that, if there is such a power to date the limitation period from the date of the receipt of information, that power will no longer exist once this measure has been passed.  The summary prosecution of any offence under Section 6 of the Act must take place within 12 months from the date of the offence and not from the date of the receipt of information.</P>

      <P>Personally, I am all for limiting it.  If the Government, with its horde of inspectors, cannot find out offences in time to have them prosecuted summarily inside 12 months, the individuals should be allowed to get away with it.  The only thing I want to say about it is that I am not sure about the power of swinging over from summary prosecution to indictable offence.  I am not sure that it is as easy as the Minister thinks, to say: &ldquo;We have the man, but it is too late to prosecute him within 12 months.  We will make it an indictable offence and prosecute him anyhow.&rdquo;  It is not so easy in all cases to do that.  The Minister, apparently, thinks it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose one might as well fight the last rearguard action in a matter of this kind.  I cannot help feeling that most Deputies approach it rather in a spirit of levity, without any feeling that it is a matter of real significance.  I think they make a great mistake in that.  Deputy Breen and I, who do not see very many things from the same angle, found ourselves, I think, in substantial agreement at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in taking the view that while a strong case could be made, and was, in fact, made, for reviving the practice in an Irish Parliament of having the presiding officer of the Parliament suitably attired in official garb, the whole significance of that step would be obscured and vitiated if a similar provision were made for any other functionary of Oireachtas Éireann.  I have always emphasised&mdash; and I think rightly&mdash;that in a Parliament such as we have, which is a system of government extremely difficult to make work, the success or failure of the best intentioned men will depend very largely on the way in which the functions of the Ceann Comhairle are discharged and the attitude of Deputies on all sides of the House to the person who fills that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use concealing, if you have some experience of the work of this Parliament, that cordial as may be the sentiments of all Deputies for the <Col N="1209" /> various occupants of the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle, his position of prestige in this House bears no relation to that of the Ceann Comhairle. For instance, he never loses his Party character, he remains an active member of the Party for which he was elected by the electorate.  It is true that, by convention, he is expected to be rather a shadowy figure, but that is purely by convention.  There is nothing to prevent him from entering most vigorously into the proceedings of the House.  It is quite otherwise with the Ceann Comhairle; he is required to withdraw entirely from his normal activities and there is a special provision that, in consideration of that withdrawal, he is always returned unopposed&mdash;not, as in Great Britain, by courtesy, but under the law&mdash;and is automatically declared elected for the constituency for which he was first nominated.  No such provision attaches to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I do not think any Deputy will deny that it is common experience that, when the atmosphere of this deliberative Assembly becomes somewhat turbulent &mdash;as happily it infrequently does&mdash;a very material contribution to the restoration of calm and forbearance is made by the return of the Ceann Comhairle to the chair.  That does not arise essentially from the personality of the present occupant, though doubtless it makes a substantial contribution, but is due to the fact that the Ceann Comhairle is recognised by Parties on all sides of the House to be not only the maintainer of order in the House but the defender of the rights and privileges of each individual Deputy, no matter where he sits.</P>
    <P>All that sums up, in my mind, to a position which should be marked out as quite unique in our social fabric. Therefore, to prescribe robes for such a person seems appropriate and I could well envisage that we would provide that there should be a ceremonial robe, such as the chief justice may wear on the day of the opening of the courts, which would be placed on the Ceann Comhairle's shoulder on the day of his election to the position of Ceann Comhairle; and that he would have a work-a-day robe, such as judges <Col N="1210" /> usually wear in the ordinary day-to-day proceedings of the courts, which the Ceann Comhairle would ordinarily wear during the ordinary proceedings of the House.  But the moment we proceed to confer a similar raiment on the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, we are not adorning the office of Ceann Comhairle: we are simply ensuring that, if the occupant of the Chair is wearing a dirty suit, we have provided him with something with which to cover it&mdash;and that is a very different thing.  The question is whether we are trying to ensure that, if the occupant of the Chair is not properly dressed, we will cover him up with some kind of nightshirt that will make him look decent, or whether the provision of a robe or gown for the Ceann Comhairle is a mark by the Legislature, the supreme authority of this country, that its first officer and principal member is somebody who commands the respect and deference of every citizen in the State.</P>
    <P>I remind you solemnly that the British House of Commons, who, in matters of this character, are no fools, when persuaded for reasons of expediency to allow someone other than the Speaker to preside over their deliberations, consented to that arrangement always providing that neither in his attire nor in his place would he usurp the position of the Speaker himself. We have provided in this House that there should be only one Chair from which the Ceann Comhairle or his deputy would preside.  We have not here the same rite of traditional regalia and apparel which is available to an ancient ceremonial State such as Great Britain, but we have a good historical precedent for providing a suitable robe for the Ceann Comhairle. We might possibly carry over to the Parliament we have to-day the tradition of the independent Parliament which was destroyed by the Act of Union 150 years ago, by arranging that the ceremonial gown of the Ceann Comhairle would be identical with that of the last Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, John Foster.</P>
    <P>I know that matters of this kind are important, but I also know with profound regret that few of my colleagues in this House appreciate that fact.  We <Col N="1211" /> have got along very well without any robes for the Ceann Comhairle in the past.  I would much sooner that we should continue in that way than that we should start distributing them broadcast.  If we start putting robes on the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, we will be putting robes on every other official and dignitary of this Oireachtas before we have finished&mdash;and when we do, we have lost the opportunity to do something very valuable and, furthermore, we have instituted a system whereby, if we start distributing robes of that kind generally, we will bring nothing but ridicule on our institutions.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I strongly recommend the House to reject the proposal put forward.  The Committee envisages the possibility of rejection, as they had not made a categorical recommendation to the House.  They have simply incorporated their views in a report and categorically stated that they wished the House to take the final responsibility in making the decision. I urge the House most strongly to reject the proposal to provide robes for any officer of this House except the Ceann Comhairle and I remind the House that, if they reject that advice, they will, in my judgment, seriously withdraw from the unique position which the Ceann Comhairle holds at present.  Whether we like it or not, we are going to suggest to succeeding generations of the Members of this House that, in some measure in any case, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle shares the Ceann Comhairle's powers. That is an entirely false view.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle functions, and should only function, here as the deputy of the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that in motions for the closure and, I think, in motions for the suspension of Deputies, the Ceann Comhairle must occupy the Chair.  That proviso is clearly named to mark out the fact that in measures which strike at the fundamental rights of Deputies, the judgment of the Ceann Comhairle himself must be taken, as to the propriety of such a proposal being considered by the House, before it proceeds to come <Col N="1212" /> to a decision.  These safeguards are of incalculable value.  Without safeguards of that character Parliament cannot work.  Unless there is accepted the duty of the Ceann Comhairle to protect and defend minorities against majorities, Parliament will break down. If you detract from the position of the Ceann Comhairle you are striking at the very foundation of Parliament. Whether you believe these things or not it is important that they should be put on the records.  If you do not believe them then you do not understand them.  If you understand and believe them you ought to be vigilant now in this matter, which, superficially, may appear to be trivial, but, in fact, is a precedent to diminish the position that a Ceann Comhairle could ever hold in this House, and will be marked as the first crack in what is in fact the citadel of our liberty, in the independence and safety of Parliament and every elected Deputy, no matter where he is.  I strongly urge the House to reject the proposal contained in this tentative report.</P>

      <P>As the representative of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, I should tell the House that when we deliberated on the question of providing a gown for the Ceann Comhairle, and also for the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, we had all the matters to which Deputy Dillon has referred present to our minds.  I should say, first of all, that it is the duty of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to examine this question from every angle.  The reason why such a Committee has been functioning in this House at all is because Deputies would not have the same time to devote to matters of this kind that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges have.  As the House is aware, the matter has already been discussed in the Dáil.  While there was a certain divergent viewpoint it seemed to me that the majority in the House, judging by those who spoke for their Parties, were in favour of providing the Leas-Cheann Comhairle with a gown, as well as providing the Ceann Comhairle with a gown.  It was not our idea to detract in the least from the primacy of the Ceann Comhairle <Col N="1213" /> when we suggested that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle should be provided with a gown and, in proof of that, I direct Deputies' attention to paragraph 3 of the Report, which reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Committee decided that the gown to be worn by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle should be of a design distinguishable from that to be worn by the Ceann Comhairle, thereby marking the relative status of the two officers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That proves that the Committee were well aware of the step they were taking.  They were also well aware that in providing a gown for the Leas-Cheann Comhairle they were not detracting from the primal position of the Ceann Comhairle in this House. Therefore, I submit this report to the House, as the representative of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and I strongly urge the House to accept it.</P>

    <P>Perhaps we might consider amendment No. 25 in connection with this amendment. In the Act of 1941, and in this Bill, as it left the Dáil, phraseology was used which, it was suggested, might imply that where a local inquiry was to be held, the Minister for Local Government should hold the inquiry in person. Amendment No. 25 is for the purpose of removing any doubt in that regard if such a doubt exists.  In amendment No. 25 it is provided that &ldquo;for the purpose of removing doubts it is hereby declared that any reference, in the Local Government Acts, 1925 to 1941, to holding a local inquiry shall be construed as meaning and as having always meant causing a local inquiry to be held by an inspector of the Minister.&rdquo;  Amendment No. 4 carries that principle into the first section to which it is relevant, that is Section 31. It makes clear that the Minister is to cause a local inquiry to be held by one of his inspectors and is not to hold the inquiry himself in person.</P>

      <P>In the Seanad, the original text was thought to be ambiguous because it might refer only to a case in which a person should not, say, for reasons of propriety, function by deputy.  Other circumstances were adverted to, for instance, in a case of illness in a family or because an officer was allowed to go abroad to take a course of study. Now, because he was abroad, he could not discharge the duty of his office and, therefore, to make the matter quite clear these words &ldquo;cannot or&rdquo; were inserted so that, if by reason of any physical disability, or from other cause such as I have mentioned, he received leave of absence for a particular purpose, and could not function in person, he might be allowed to appoint a deputy if the Minister was satisfied that the circumstances warranted it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be quite clear as to what this means.  What is the new procedure to appoint a deputy? We all know through our acquaintance with local government administration that officers of local government bodies are sometimes called away to other duties and that they will apply sometimes to the local authority for protracted leave in which event it becomes the duty of the local authority to appoint a <i>locum tenens.</i> The local authority must then be satisfied that the person who occupies the position of <i>locum tenens</i> is satisfactory and efficient to perform the particular work which requires to be done in the absence of the excused officer.  Is this a new procedure, permitting persons, who should not and cannot perform their duties, to appoint deputies, an abridgment of the right of the local authority to determine who the excused officer's <i>locum tenens</i> should be? <Col N="1217" /> Heretofore I think it is true to say that if a servant of the local authority wished to be excused, it behoved the local authority to determine the conditions of employment which should apply to the <i>locum tenens.</i>  Are we to infer that under this amendment if the incumbent under the local authority cannot perform his functions, he may appoint his deputy and that the matter of the terms between himself and the deputy should be a matter which the incumbent who cannot perform his duties may decide without any reference to the local authority or are we to gather, whatever the nature of the agreement made between the incumbent and his deputy may be, its terms and conditions must be submitted to the appropriate Minister before the Minister's approval is given to the arrangements envisaged under the section?  I think the House is surely entitled to have an answer to these questions inasmuch as this House has been gravely exercised in the recent past about the conduct of a servant of a public authority who was rendered legally incapable of discharging his duty as a result of his appointment to another office and who appointed a deputy.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us what is the consequence of this proviso in relation to such facts as existed in that case?</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether a local authority has power under the authority the Minister will have under this section to grant an office-holder leave of absence for such a protracted period as seven years?  I read a report of the proceedings of a county council the other day, and that county council proposed, on the request of the holder of an office, to grant seven years leave of absence from a particular position, and considered a recommendation from that office-holder that a nominee of that person should be appointed to the vacancy.  I want to know whether, under the powers exercised by the local authority in these circumstances, the Minister must sanction under this section of the Bill, every six months an indefinite leave or whether alternatively the local authority has, without the Minister's sanction, <Col N="1218" /> power to grant seven years leave of absence.</P>

      <P>I raised the categorical point&mdash;the performance of the duty. This section refers not only to the circumstances where the holder of an office should not perform his duties, but there is also a new reference to the holder of an office who &ldquo;cannot&rdquo; perform his duties.  Now, he may be prevented by physical infirmity; he may be prevented by an act of God or of the king's enemies, but he may also be prevented by the operation of law.  Suppose the holder of an office envisaged by sub-section (1) of Section 38 is a dispensary doctor in the town of Monaghan and is appointed a Parliamentary Secretary of Rialtas na hÉireann by law, he cannot perform the duties of his office.  Is not that so?</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Where the appropriate Minister is <Col N="1219" /> of opinion that, on account of special circumstances, the duties of a particular office should not be performed during a particular period by the holder of the office in person, the appropriate Minister may by order authorise the holder to perform the duties of the office by deputy during that period.&rdquo;</P>

Are we giving that man, who is prevented by the operation of law from continuing to discharge his duties to the local authority, the right, subject to the approval of the appropriate Minister, to name his own deputy, and to reserve to himself the right of determining the terms on which that deputy should be employed?  Does the Minister now undertake, if that right is recognised by this section, to make himself responsible to the House that if, in the future, any such arrangement is made, he will have brought before him the terms, and will satisfy himself that the terms proposed by the incumbent of the office for his deputy will be equitable and fair?  If he undertakes that responsibility, will he go on to tell us whether it will, in his judgment, be fair and equitable for the incumbent of that office who is in receipt of £360 per annum to pay his deputy £250 and retain £110 simply for signing the cheques?  We are entitled to an answer, and I await it with interest from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I have listened with great patience to Deputy Dillon discoursing at great length on a number of issues, incidentally on the issue as to what the position of the Deputy Speaker in the House of Commons is as compared to our Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I hope that the Deputy will have enough patience to listen to me.  I was saying that this section has got nothing to do with dispensary doctors.  They are provided for under other enactments and other regulations. This section would be much more properly applicable to the position of a county medical officer of health who, for instance, because of his parliamentary duties in this House, was unable to discharge his proper duties as a whole-time officer of the county council; or it would be more properly applicable to the case of a whole-time officer or employee of a county council who had to apply for leave of absence, as some have had to do.  The position of dispensary doctors and of other part-time officers is covered by a completely different set of regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this section was to enable the Minister, where special circumstances arose, to grant leave of absence.  It was pointed out that because there was ambiguity, arising from the fact that the word &ldquo;should&rdquo; had various nuances of meaning, it might, in this context, be ambiguous and that it might relate merely to the propriety of an office-holder functioning in person in certain circumstances.  In order to make sure that the case of physical disability by reason, perhaps, of absence from the country&mdash;if, for instance, a whole-time person were asked to go abroad in order that he might attend either to his private affairs in abnormal circumstances or to attend a course of study, or to pursue some special investigation which might be of advantage to him <Col N="1221" /> in the discharge of his duties, and that it was probable the Minister might take the view that as the section stood he could only give authority for this officer to act as deputy in circumstances in which, in the opinion of the Minister, it was improper for that officer to operate in person&mdash;it was to meet that particular point that the Seanad pressed this amendment on me, and I accepted it.  It has got nothing whatever to do with the case of dispensary doctors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then, the question of a medical officer of health is a matter that I intend to pursue for some considerable time.  The Minister is quite mistaken in imagining that this amendment does not apply to dispensary doctors.  He is quite mistaken in imagining that the words &ldquo;cannot or&rdquo; do not raise very special, very important and very novel questions, the most interesting, to my mind, at the moment being the question of the person who is rendered unable to discharge the functions of his office by the operation of statute law.

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 14.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking on amendment No. 14 when we adjourned. I had pointed out that the three sections constituting the court were the chairman, the members nominated by the employers' organisation and the members nominated by the workers' organisation.  While some of the points I am now going to put to the Minister may not be covered so far as this Bill is concerned, I am quite sure that he will bear them in mind when he is exercising the powers given to him under the Bill.  In so far as amendment No. 14 and the disability of the workers' representatives who may be members of the court are concerned, the amendment proposes that an ordinary member may in effect only <Col N="1222" /> be a member of the court; and he is debarred from other offices which would not, in fact, in any way affect his position personally or bring him any pecuniary gain, such as an unpaid trustee, an honorary secretary, etc. Yet the disqualification is fairly definite. On the other hand, when we come to the other two sections of the court there are rather wider implications concerned to which I think consideration should be given.  The most important matter concerns the chairman. While it is laid down that the chairman shall devote the whole of his attention and time to the work of the court, I think both the Minister and the House will accept the principle that it is absolutely essential that nothing should occur in relation to the position of the chairman which would in any way prejudice the general attitude as to his impartiality or lack of partisanship.  Yet the amendment makes it possible for the chairman to be a large shareholder in some concern, such as the Bank of Ireland, with very wide industrial and commercial interests and ramifications. At the same time he may be held to be not entitled to hold a position as director of a small private company because in that case he would receive a small fee in recognition of his services.</P>
      <P>It seems to me the first position, where he would be a large shareholder in either an industrial, commercial, or financial concern, with very wide contacts, is such that the ordinary parties appearing before the court would be unable to have exact knowledge as to where his interests commenced and where they ceased; that would raise a very awkward situation if it subsequently became known that he did, in fact, have pecuniary interests in any concern which was the subject of inquiry by the court.  For that reason I think the Minister, in making his selection, should keep that particular point in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same way, in relation to the employers' representatives, there are not the same rigid conditions laid down in their case as in the case of the workers' representatives.  Earlier in <Col N="1223" /> the debate to-day reference was made to the position which might arise of regarding the members of this court as being almost in the category of judges and completely divorced from their previous background.  That is not my view of the court.  I do not know if it is the Minister's view.  While I agree that the workers' representatives should not continue to have an active official interest in any workers' organisation, I think it must be admitted that one of the reasons for the appointment of the workers'&mdash;or, indeed, of the employers'&mdash;representatives is that they have a certain background and certain interests and certain general viewpoints. It is in order to strike a balance that the two sides are represented on the court.  Nobody expects that the workers' representatives, having been active members or officials of a trade union, could overnight step into membership of the court and discard all their previous views and beliefs.  If that were to happen the court would have no value.  In the same way nobody expects the employers' representatives to do that.  We all accept that the members of the court must be competent, in so far as their personal abilities lie, to approach questions in an impartial manner and there must be no shadow of doubt that they are doing so.  I had one experience in the past where such a doubt existed in regard to a court of this character.</P>
    <P>From that experience I would urge upon the Minister that he should bear this in mind and widen the actual application of the sections in the Bill, not only in relation to the question of holding full-time office outside the court but also in relation to safeguarding the position of the chairman in every way.  Somebody mentioned that we should try to make it analogous to the position of a judge.  A judge is not debarred from having private holdings in a commercial enterprise. While nobody would expect that to be the position in this particular case, large holdings in an industrial, commercial or financial concern might mean a great deal more than actual full-time office in a small private <Col N="1224" /> company.  Nothing can be done at the moment in regard to the Bill because it would be extremely difficult to find a suitable clause to cover the situation. The Minister is given certain responsibility in regard to the appointment of a chairman and the final selection of the employers' and workers' representatives.  I think he will have to assume responsibility for ensuring that members of the court are not put in a position where, regardless of their personal impartiality and lack of partisanship, grave doubts might arise because of certain connections they might have.</P>

      <P>I am not concerned about the second paragraph because I do not think it makes very much difference.  A member of the court can still continue his membership of the union.  I think that is all he would desire to do for sentimental reasons.  As far as definition is concerned, I think the Minister will agree that it is a much tighter paragraph than that in relation to the chairman or other members of the court and I think there should be an even balance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The important point is requiring the employers' representatives, and particularly the chairman, not to be engaged in the hearing of cases in which they have some pecuniary interest.  The Minister can select a person to act as chairman.  To all intents and purposes he may be a person who is associated with a particular industry.  He may intimate that he is discontinuing his association with that industry but privately he may be a substantial stockholder in a company, or group of companies, and that is something which would not be disclosed to anybody.  It would be unknown to the Minister and unknown to the applicant's organisation; but it might, nevertheless, influence his <Col N="1225" /> judgment in a particular case.  It may be difficult to make provision in the Bill to ensure that that cannot happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  This point is raised merely to direct the Minister's attention to the necessity of taking precautions to ensure that the chairman will not be a person who will be put in the position of adjudicating on claims which in any way affect either his interests as an employer, or a stockholder, in a company or group of companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has repeatedly emphasised throughout this debate that the success or failure of this court will largely depend on what happens during the first year or two of its operation.  Because he is not satisfied that it is possible to choose an ideal person as chairman during the probationary period, he has fixed five years as the period of the first chairman, with the intention, I take it, of giving the chairman a more enduring tenure thereafter.  I suggest that he ought to make provision, if he intends to provide something analogous to judicial tenure for the ultimate chairman of this body, with full salary and pensionable rights, that, if the temporary incumbent for the first five-year period should have his term of office terminated by the Minister, he will be given his pension rights as if he had survived the whole term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may never arise but the incumbent of the office should have complete independence of the Minister or of outside interference.  He should be able to say: &ldquo;Doing what I believe to be right in this period of office is not going to get me kicked out at the end of five years and, if it does, I will get all the benefits I would have got <Col N="1226" /> if I had kowtowed or been subject to undue influence and had remained in office during the whole period.&rdquo;  In view of the Minister's prudent efforts to ensure that the court will enjoy confidence from the first day, I think that he should do as I suggest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that the selection of a person as chairman must be the responsibility of the Minister and that there should be no intrusion upon that field of responsibility. I suggest to the Minister, however, that when he is considering means of getting suitable persons, he should elicit, as far as possible, the opinions of those on all sides who would be directly concerned as to not only the suitability but the acceptability of his possible choice.  I think that he will agree that the key to the proper functioning of the court is the chairman.  All of us would, probably, have our viewpoint as to the type of person who would be suitable, but if, through any unforeseen chance, a selection were made by the Minister which, while it might not be open to attack on specific grounds, would not be acceptable, it might be unfortunate. It would be helpful to the Minister and to the chairman if, by private means, the Minister was able to assure himself that the lines along which his mind was running would meet with general approval by those who would have to use the court.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 provides &ldquo;A person shall not be appointed to be chairman or a member ... unless he is ordinarily resident in the State.&rdquo;  It seems to me that it would be possible, in view of the <Col N="1227" /> terms of that provision, to appoint a person who is ordinarily resident in the State and discover at a later stage that he was not resident in the State. &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; seems to relate to the time of the appointment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And so would the Deputy's amendment.  The section says that a person shall not be appointed unless he is ordinarily resident in the State.

It would be necessary to put in a consequential provision&mdash;that if the person so appointed ceased to be ordinarily resident in the State, he should cease to hold office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment would, I think, put a greater obligation on him to remain in the State.  Looking at the section, a person so appointed would say &ldquo;That is all right.  I am not to be appointed unless I am ordinarily resident in the State.  That related to the time of the appointment and I am not obliged to remain ordinarily resident in the State after the appointment&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I think it is better to leave the position as the Bill leaves it&mdash;that, if the member ceased to be ordinarily resident, it would be regarded as a reason which could be stated for his removal.  The Deputy's amendment, in view of the earlier wording of the sub-section, does not make sense.  The sub-section says that a person shall not be appointed unless he is ordinarily resident in the State. What the Deputy wants to say is that he shall not continue to be a member unless he continues to be ordinarily resident in the State.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 30, before Section 11, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Whenever the chairman is of opinion that for the speedy dispatch of the business of the court it is expedient that the court should act by divisions, he may direct accordingly, and, until he revokes his direction,&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the court shall be grouped into&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  a first division, consisting of the chairman (who shall be chairman of the division) and a workers' member and employers' member selected by him, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  a second division, consisting of the deputy chairman (who shall be chairman of the division), the other workers' member and the other employers' member;</P>
      <P>(b)  the chairman shall assign to each division the business to be transacted by it;</P>
      <P>(c)  each division shall, for the purpose of the business so assigned to it, have all the powers of the court and the chairman of the division shall have all the powers of chairman.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the amendment which I foreshadowed in Committee.  It provides for the possibility that, during the temporary period, the burden of work coming to the court would be too heavy for it and would involve delay in the despatch of business.  The amendment provides that, in such circumstances, at the discretion of the chairman, the court may be divided into two parts.  That is, I think, the most satisfactory way of dealing with the position, if it should arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>The new section is welcome in so far as it meets one of the points put forward from these benches.  The procedure, however, does not appeal to me.  Why should the chairman alone have to make the decision? We have a court consisting of five members.  The decision to divide into two parts and to assign the business to be transacted by each part <Col N="1229" /> should be made by the whole court.  It is essential that there should not be any impression given that the chairman is above the court.  I do not see why the court should not decide this question rather than the chairman. The same question arose in regard to the chairman's powers if a particular member could not act.  It was decided to leave that to the chairman, because it might involve personal questions which would be known only to the chairman.  In this case, it would be preferable to have the whole court in plenary session deciding to divide and assigning the business to be dealt with by each division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this is the most practical way of dealing with the matter, and it is not much at variance with the practice adopted in the High Court and the Supreme Court.  The President of the High Court divides the business between the individual members and the Chief Justice has certain powers of decision as regards the members who shall constitute the Supreme Court.  In so far as it is primarily a matter of arrangement for the expeditious despatch of the court's business, it might be left to the chairman.  The Bill makes it clear that, ordinarily, the court is to consist of five members.</P>
      <P>It is only in the special circumstances that may happen in various eventualities that the chairman can exercise this power of dividing the court.  The court, presumably, will have to decide by a majority, in any event, if there is a conflict of opinion between them. But, in practice, it is the chairman who will be arranging the order in which business will come before the court, and he will be able to foresee that business is likely to be forthcoming at a rate which the court cannot dispose of and decide whether congestion is likely to arise.  From the point of view of machinery, I think it is better to leave it to the chairman.</P>

      <Col N="1230" /> In page 7, Section 16, after the word &ldquo;appeal&rdquo; in line 14, to insert the words &ldquo;other than an appeal on a question of law&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This particular question was discussed on the Committee Stage and the Minister then indicated that he felt he was meeting the position by the introduction of an amendment on a supplementary list which is now incorporated in Section 26 (6).  This amendment is put down again to ensure that, as a matter of vital principle, the individual's rights will not be prejudiced by the operation of the labour court. Actually, in its original form, we were advised that that particular section was not constitutional and because of that we should like to have the assurance of the Minister that the individual's rights will not be prejudiced. It was represented to us legally that we might find ourselves in conflict because of the operation of this section.</P>
    <P>Take a workman's compensation case.  A man may claim compensation and his employer may turn down that claim for compensation on the ground that the worker was alleged to be exceeding the duties for which he had contracted.  At that stage it may be found necessary to examine the contract which was the subject of a registered agreement and the interpretation of that particular agreement is a matter for the labour court.  It would be a question then, supposing a negative attitude was taken, of what was to happen the man's case.  But supposing the labour court interpreted it in favour of the man so far as his contract was concerned, he has to proceed to a court of law because the labour court is not in a position to assess damages.</P>
    <P>There would seem to be an unnecessary set of movements so far as the individual is concerned.  What we are particularly concerned about is to ensure that any rights in common law which are inherent in the individual are not prejudiced by the adoption of this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The sub-section which I moved in Committee, and which was accepted, was intended to provide that there should be no prejudicing of any <Col N="1231" /> rights of the worker under any other Act or any other Part of this Act.  I think that is wide enough to meet the point the Deputy has in mind.  The fact is that questions of law are not likely to arise at the labour court except questions concerning the jurisdiction of the court, which can, of course, be taken to the ordinary court and decided in the ordinary court.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a bad illustration. I think the best illustration is the one I gave the other day, namely, a worker taking action for arrears of wages and a question arising in the court as to whether a particular agreement applied to him for the purpose of determining the amount of the wages. That action would be taken in the ordinary court of law, but the question of the application of the agreement to an individual worker would be a matter for the labour court.  No question of law can in fact arise at the labour court except a question of the jurisdiction of the court.  If there is any question as to the jurisdiction of the court, that matter can be taken to the High Court for decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is as a result of that examination that I am satisfied that there is no necessity for any provision here; that the only issue of law that could arise would be one affecting the jurisdiction of the court.  On that, there is no question as to the power of any citizen to go to the ordinary court of law to have it determined.</P>

      <P>There is no appeal by the individual to the labour court.  It must be taken by a trade union.  Let us take the case of a non-union member.  A trade union would naturally be very slow to make representations to the labour court on behalf of a non-union member.  What redress has that non-union member?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The redress is under Section 30, which provides that a registered agreement shall apply to every worker covered by the agreement, irrespective of whether the worker or his organisation was a party to the agreement.  The rights of the worker under that agreement are enforceable in the ordinary court. They are enforceable as a contract between the worker and the employer.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;A registered employment agreement shall not prejudice any rights <Col N="1234" /> as to rates of remuneration or conditions of employment conferred on any worker by another part of this Act or by any other Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That seems to conceive a situation in which a person's rights will be wrapt up in this Act or in another Act.  Is it not desirable to ensure that a registered employment agreement will not prejudice whatever rights a worker has under another part of this Bill, or under any other Act or instrument?</P>

      <P>If there is an individual worker, not a member of a trade union, who becomes subject to a registered employment agreement, he is not prevented from enforcing any rights to better rates of remuneration or better conditions which his individual agreement entitles him to enjoy, merely because an agreement has been registered.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not quite faced Deputy Keyes' dilemma, which brings the Minister within the ambit of the Constitution.  Deputy Keyes envisages a worker who becomes <Col N="1235" /> affected by a registered agreement made by the union catering for the trade to which he belongs.  This isolated individual alleges that his employer is not giving him the benefits to which he is entitled.  He goes to the civil court.  The employer raises in the civil court the issue of the correct interpretation of a registered agreement, whereupon the civil court stops the proceedings and says: &ldquo;Recourse must be had to the Labour Court&rdquo;.  But the isolated individual has no machinery for getting into the labour court.  The only person who can go there is a trade unionist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The members of the court do not want to be drawn into the matter.  The position is that a citizen of the State finds himself with no legal remedy for a wrong, because the civil court refuses to function until it has before it a report from the labour court.  All the employer need do is to sit back and the isolated individual has no machinery to enable him to get into the labour court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Who says so?  A trade union can go before the court and complain that an employer or a group of employers will not observe an agreement and the court can make the employer or employers observe the agreement under Section 31.  But if a question arises in an ordinary court where an individual worker is enforcing his contract against his employer upon the applicability of a registered agreement, then that question must be referred by the ordinary court to the labour court for its determination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us say the registered agreement provides for a levelling out.  These people had a contract by which they got a certain remuneration or special conditions.  As a result of negotiations a new agreement is drawn up, which provides for a levelling out of rates of pay and conditions of employment.  The effect of the agreement would be to bring them from a higher level of pay and good conditions to conditions less favourable. Let us assume that agreement is registered.  Clearly, that is the rate of pay to which these workers will be entitled; that is the rate of pay and conditions of service provided for in the agreement.  Is it certain that by Section 26 (6) their right to go to a court and sue for the fulfilment of a contract which the employer was not willing to keep and which was broken only by the negotiation of a new agreement to which perhaps these workers were not part, is still kept open?

If the workers were a party to the agreement then, of course, their old contract terminates and the agreement will regulate the conditions of employment for the future.  If they were not a party to the agreement, if they only came into it incidentally, because of the general application of a registered agreement, their own contract is still in force as between them and their employer unless the <Col N="1239" /> employer takes steps to terminate it and substitute a new contract for it.</P>

      <P>The Minister previously said: &ldquo;Go to Section 30 and get your remedy.&rdquo;  Section 30 provides no remedy.  It says: &ldquo;If you have a contract for wages and conditions which are less than those in the agreement then you are levelled up to the agreement and that is the floor of your conditions.&rdquo; What I am asking, and what I originally asked, is, is the saving clause, Section 26 (6)&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Section 26 (6) only relates to rights given by Act of Parliament, but if there is a contract between a worker and his employer we do not interfere with that contract. It is still enforceable by the worker against his employer.  It cannot be altered except as a result of a new contract. The only case where this Bill interferes with that contract is where it provides for lower wages or worse conditions than a registered agreement. If it provides for lower wages or worse conditions than a registered agreement, then the contract is deemed to be amended so as to provide for the wages and conditions in the registered agreement, but if the contract already provides for those wages, or better, then it is not interfered with by any provision in this Bill.  It is still enforceable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the net point. Take, for instance, a large firm which employs, say, 500 workers.  The union negotiates with the firm and finally, on one particular point, the firm says: &ldquo;We are giving so much in respect of 400 workers; we are doing something else in respect of another 80, but we are not prepared to continue to give certain privileges to this last 20.&rdquo;  The union people, after long negotiation, come back to their members and say: &ldquo;After a long period of negotiation, this is the best offer we can get.  We have done very well for 400, have got an improvement for another 80, but the one thing they dug their heels into the <Col N="1241" /> ground over is that they will not continue particular privileges that the last 20 have had for the past 20 years&rdquo;. That goes to the members on a ballot and the members by a majority accept the agreement and the agreement, therefore, is an endorsed agreement and can be duly registered.  It confers substantial benefit on the majority of the members concerned but 20 have lost the privileges which they previously had and they are powerless to influence the decision of the 500 employees. Have the 20 a right to go to the court, if they have a contract with the firm, and say: &ldquo;Although my union made an agreement in this matter, because they had to make it in the circumstances, and they did their best to protect our rights, we want, nevertheless to sue on the basis of the contract which we had with the firm&rdquo;?

      <P>Suppose a group of workers have an agreement which fixes the terms of their employment as well as the rates of pay and suppose the trade union catering for that type of worker decides to register the agreement. There is no doubt that the registered agreement will have effect beyond the membership of the union, that it will have effect with regard to all workers of that class.  One knows that frequently in the courts, in connection with a very ordinary type of proceeding under the Workmen's Compensation Act, questions arise as to what is called added risk or added peril.  That has to be determined in connection with the actual agreement. The courts look at the contract and see what are the terms of the man's employment.  Did he take any added risk?  Did he expose himself to peril, bringing him into danger, which resulted in an accident and incapacity to which he was not bound to expose himself under his contract of employment? A man hereafter brings a case before the courts for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act and the judge has to decide whether it is one of these added risk cases and he will, apparently, under this Act have to halt his proceedings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking a case which clearly turns on interpretation. You want to find out what are the limits of risk to which the man exposed himself under the contract of service and the courts have to determine whether he added to that unnecessarily, whether he subjected himself to what they call an added peril.  That all turns on the interpretation of his contract of employment, his contract of service.  Under this, as I understand it, the workmen's compensation proceedings would have to be stopped and that contract referred to the lay court to find out what are its terms and the proceedings then resumed in the ordinary court.</P>
      <P>I may give another example.  There is a very ordinary type of action which appears in the courts&mdash;an action for wrongful dismissal.  A man presents himself to a solicitor and produces his contract of employment, in which the conditions subject to which he is to serve are laid down and under which there are certain recognised ways by which he may be dismissed. The man, having been dismissed, goes to the solicitor to find out if he has been dismissed in accordance with the contract or not, and the solicitor advises that he has not been so dismissed, and says: &ldquo;You have an action for wrongful dismissal and you are worth £400 or £500 in damages.&rdquo;  That case comes before the High Court as any action involving more than £300 must be heard by the High Court.  Are the High Court to be stopped midway in the course of their hearing to decide whether the man was wrongfully dismissed until they get an interpretation from the lay court of what the terms of the contract are?</P>

      <P>Does the Minister with any equanimity contemplate that type of proceedings&mdash;that the normal court procedure may have to be held up in order to see whether what has occurred is what the court describes as an added risk, and must they go back to the lay court to find out what it is about, in very ordinary cases of <Col N="1247" /> actions for damages or wrongful dismissal which turn entirely upon the technical point of what were the methods of dismissal permitted under the contract and whether they had been broken or not?  Is it really contemplated that the High Court should be interrupted in its proceedings, if suddenly it emerges that the case turns on the interpretation of a contract and should say: &ldquo;We are sorry; under Section 32, we cannot deal with it.  Go back to the lay court and bring us back their interpretation.&rdquo;  Is that contemplated?</P>

      <P>They deal with the same point, and if I am entitled to argue it, I would say that I can well imagine&mdash;I understand that the Labour representatives here would prefer the lay court to the ordinary court in respect of some contracts; I deplore that attitude of mind, but, if it is their attitude of mind I do not suppose that any words I say will change it&mdash;those who represent Labour in this House saying: &ldquo;We do not want all sorts of legal quibbles&rdquo;&mdash;to take the lowest interpretation put on the processes of law&mdash;&ldquo;or any legal delays arising from the interpretation of agreements,&rdquo; but I think their views would be met by saying that where the interpretation of any contract may lead to a trade dispute, it might be referred to the lay court, instead of to a court of law; but once you have your contract formed and registered, I suggest that if we have courts in the country and they are properly manned by an independent judiciary, they are the people to whom the interpretation of an agreement ought to be left, where people's rights depend upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can well imagine the Labour representatives here saying: &ldquo;We do not want this niggling sort of legal business about interpretation.  We want a broad judgment, and if it is a <Col N="1248" /> question of what men have agreed to, we want to be able to get back and find out their minds at the time they made their agreement&rdquo;&mdash;matters which the court unfortunately will not consider, the court viewing only the bare matters in front of it.  I can hardly conceive anybody contemplating with equanimity the two situations arising&mdash;and they are only two of many I could bring forward&mdash;that proceedings in the ordinary court should be held up to enable the lay court to determine what the agreement means and that the party should then hark back to the ordinary court to get the result declared there.</P>
    <P>I think it is a matter that should be reconsidered.  I can understand the Minister getting into this position when thinking entirely of a labour dispute, an agreement putting an end to a dispute and some trouble arising later as to what the parties meant.  It is like the interpretation of a treaty as between two countries which was never ordinarily accepted as a legal document to be adjudicated upon according to the canons of the law&mdash;a question of finding out what the parties meant, and, if they had not written in their views properly, it would be necessary to rewrite it according to their intentions.  I can understand that as the background to Section 32, but certainly not the two ordinary matters I have referred to.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not see that what is emerging here is that, in fact, all Deputy McGilligan's representations are made on behalf of individuals? In effect, Deputy McGilligan sees, as we all see, that a trade union caught under Section 32, in fact, welcomes being caught.  They want to go back to the labour court and get this lay interpretation on the lines laid down by Deputy McGilligan here, but it is the individual to whom Deputy Keyes first referred that we are thinking of and for whom these whole provisions are introduced.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy realise <Col N="1249" /> that that may cause trade disputes, that the question of the interpretation may affect the ordinary conditions of employment of three or four hundred others?  A trade dispute might arise on the question whether certain men come into the category of carpenters or plasterers and are thereby entitled to a different rate of wages.  The determination may affect also the rate of wages to which other men are entitled. The labour court should decide that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's difficulty is comprehensible, but I think he is creating a wholly unnecessary complication by directing this labour court into a whole vast region of civil proceedings, where manifestly the Minister himself does not want to attract them nor do the trade unions or the legal profession.  There has been pretty general agreement all round the House that, in the interpretation of issues generally between the unions and combinations of employers, the labour court is quite adequate, but there does not seem to be any inclinaation on the part of anybody to deprive an individual citizen of his civil rights in the civil courts to pursue his claim according to the civil law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of Section 32, without any saver for individual persons who are not members of unions and who do not propose to proceed through the medium of a union, is to deny the civil rights which those persons have.  In the case of the small man, and if you have a general agreement controlling shop assistants in Earl Street and you have one girl in one small establishment who is not a member of a union and she goes to the District Court to sue her employer for the wage he should have paid her in accordance with the terms of the registered agreement covering all shop assistants, all the employer has to do is to say, <i>bona fide</i> or <i>mala fide:</i>&ldquo;I raise the interpretation of the registered agreement&rdquo;.  Instantly, although its interpretation may be as plain as 1, 2, 3, the civil court must stop its proceedings, the registrar must refer the matter to the labour court, where the individual or girl must go and plead her case, either by counsel if the court will permit her, or alone, as <Col N="1250" /> to her interpretation of the arrangement. When she has prevailed in that court, she must come back to the civil court and resume the litigation.  It is manifest that it is not within the resources of any individual labouring man or woman to travel from court to court in that way.  It will be as much as these people can do to get into the District Court at all, but if you are going to enable an employer to haul them from one court after another you are, in effect, depriving them of their rights.</P>
    <P>It is in the nature of the same difficulty that Deputy McGilligan's whole problem arises.  Are you going to inject that labour court into all the civil courts of the country where you have differences between employer and employee as to the employee's right under a contract of service between them?</P>

      <P>I am not a lawyer, but I have been listening to this discussion and I am somewhat confused as to how some of these instances could possibly arise in the one case. For instance, it has been mentioned that a worker sues an employer in the civil court and there is a question of the agreement.  Now, surely the employer would have had to state that he did not consider that that worker came under the agreement&mdash;or some other point such as that?  Surely the court would send for the registered agreement and perusal of that document would probably make short work of the rest of the case?</P>

      <P>Supposing both parties go into court&mdash;an employer who is not a member of an employers' organisation and an employee who is not a member of any trade union&mdash;and both say: &ldquo;We admit the girl comes within the ambit of the agreement.  This question does not arise.&rdquo;  Then the girl comes forward, saying that she is paid so much and is getting dinner and tea value so much and that that is not in accordance with the agreement. Whereupon the employer rises and <Col N="1252" /> says: &ldquo;I say it is in conformity with the agreement.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At that moment, the proceedings must stop in the civil court and the registrar must send the registered agreement to the labour court, with a query&mdash;&ldquo;Does the deprivation of sugar in your tea, or whatever it is, or does the pay given to this girl constitute a breach of the registered agreement?&rdquo; Until the civil court gets back from the labour court an <i>ad hoc</i> interpretation of the meaning of the registered agreement, it cannot proceed to do justice between the two parties.</P>
      <P>Is it argued here that any individual employee, in the type of employment catered for by trade unions as a rule, can afford to go into a civil court with a vindictive employer and get justice under those conditions?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question may be muddy, but I do not think it is quite as muddy as Deputy Dillon and Deputy McGilligan are trying to convince us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us are aware of cases that are not covered by ordinary legislation. In the same way, while there has been what is regarded as a dismissal it would not in the ordinary way cover many cases of that kind that come before the court.  It seems to me that while we are very concerned for the interest and welfare of individuals, the point made by the Minister should be given consideration.  Take the case of dockers mentioned by Deputy Dillon, who are working constantly, and we get an interpretation from the civil court.  That interpretation may affect hundreds of dockers working in similar employment in the city.  In that case we are going to get an interpretation <Col N="1253" /> by a civil court partly on the question of law.</P>
    <P>That is an interpretation which has been removed outside the whole atmosphere on which the original Bill was drafted, and is apart from the knowledge and experience of those in this court.  While I am as anxious as Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Dillon to make provision for the cases they have in mind, I think it is a question of choice of the lesser evil. For ordinary civilians, if the question of interpretation arose, I would prefer an interpretation from this court, rather than have it decided by a civil court and possibly have further legal proceedings.  I knew when I went to the labour court I would at least have a decision which would be, if you like, one from a labour atmosphere, by people familiar with conditions, and familiar with agreements.  As far as I was concerned, that agreement, if in my favour, would be binding.  I would feel, as far as individual workers are concerned, that the weight would be put on the side of the individual worker, to give him the benefit of the agreement.</P>
    <P>The point I am more concerned with, and that nobody seems to have raised, is that mentioned by Deputy McGilligan as to the interpretation required by a labour court in regard to workmen's compensation.  If they could cover that they would finally settle the legal question affecting workmen's compensation. It is a question to which I do not see any solution.  The difficulty is in allowing interpretation of an agreement by the civil court.  You are opening up consequences which are not only wide, as far as they affect great numbers, but undermine the whole basis on which you establish this court. Whether you could get a compromise which will maintain the authority of the labour court on the question of interpretation and, at the same time, safeguard the legal basis of the individual who has a claim, I do not know.  I feel inclined to stand over the procedure in the Bill.  It is not a question of having to go from court to court.  We are dealing with a fulltime court.  If a civil court at any <Col N="1254" /> time requires an interpretation of a decision an adjournment normally takes place for a few days.</P>
    <P>In so far as labour agreements are concerned I think you will find, in relation to the majority of civil cases, that there would not be many questions of interpretation raised, because there would be no clause in the labour agreement on which a doubt could arise, if a person had a claim for wrongful dismissal.  It would be only a question of rates of pay or hours of work.  Normally they are not questions that can raise a difficulty and bring to a head legal proceedings on the part of an individual worker. There is the difficulty that it is a choice, if you like, between the proper functioning of this court and the other step to safeguard certain aspects for the individual.  I agree, as far as the point raised by Deputy McGilligan is concerned, that an interpretation in a case of workmen's compensation which, in fact, would be final might prejudice and render nugatory the whole basis of legal compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Larkin stated that the ordinary contract usually dealt with the matter.  It does not.  That is not the angle from which the courts approach it.  They approach it in this way: What are the ordinary conditions?  If there is no contract, what are the customs of the employment?  If there is a contract the situation is, whether a man has put himself in greater danger of disability than he should have under contract. They would say that if it was a gratuitous act on his part, and that he did it against his employer's orders or warnings, then, in certain circumstances, he is deprived of an award. If it was a question of death or of serious disability, compensation would arise.  Deputy Larkin was very precise in saying that contracts made between employers and employees did not deal with that question.  The courts deal with ordinary risks and then consider the particular circumstances.  In so far as they call for consideration of agreements that will have to be referred to the courts to say what are the limits.  What is the limit except <Col N="1255" /> the danger of accident occurring?  I do not agree when it is said that there will be no appeal.  If the matter of an unconstitutional agreement is raised, you cannot prevent the courts using it.  All the verbiage that there is no appeal, goes for nothing.</P>
      <P>I can well understand people saying: &ldquo;We do not want to go to the courts to get a court view on certain claims.  We, certain Labour people, have made agreements with certain other people.  We know what was in our minds.  We believe, when the circumstances are brought back to the memory of the court, which listened to what is registered in front of it, that it will know what conditions were in our minds and, if the thing is not properly written they will re-write it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own court work brings to mind certain cases where there was agreement, and no re-creating of the conditions under which an agreement was written would bring about a better record than that in certain written documents.  I will give an example. A case took place in the last six months in which a man claimed that he was wrongfully dismissed.  The whole issue turned on that point.  The judge said the plaintiff had no merits, that the issue was a mere technical point.  The question at issue was in regard to a concern which has its main organisation outside this country, but which has a number of branch committees operating here.  The question arose entirely as to whether there was a complaint, whether that complaint had been registered in the complaint book, and whether that complaint had been adjudicated upon by the Irish committee before it was sent to the English committee.  As it so happened it was not recorded as a complaint, but the objection was that it was dealt with by the committee on the other side. The judge interpreted that as being wrongfully done.  He said that should have gone through the course, the complaint written, the complaint considered and a recommendation made to the committee on the other side and inasmuch as that had not been done, that man was given an award of something over £100.  Nobody would give <Col N="1256" /> a new interpretation to that, because it was an association, an insurance corporation, which laid down these conditions for employment.  You could not get any interpretation of that. Supposing that were registered as between the employees and the employers concerned, that case would have to be interpreted in this lay court with certainly no better knowledge of the origins of the agreement than any court had that would have to interpret it.  They would have to send back their interpretation to the court and the court would have to adjudicate upon it. That particular case would rule the occupation of thousands of employees in this country.  We are discussing Section 16 and Section 19.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the two sections which are covered by these amendments.  Section 16 says: &ldquo;No appeal shall lie from the decision of the court on any matter within its jurisdiction to a court of law,&rdquo; and the amendment to that was &ldquo;other than an appeal on a question of law.&rdquo;  Supposing there had been an agreement willingly entered into between, say, employees and the Minister.  I do not think the matter would have been written down in any other way.  The whole point arises as to whether people going into a room, discussing conditions of individuals in relation to their employment and thereafter proposing to bring in these conditions if accepted as model conditions before other employees, is a breach of the Trade Union Act.  That is purely a matter of legal interpretation.  If that question hereafter arises, the matter will have to be referred back to the lay court.  I do not believe that this was ever contemplated, but, personally, I have not such a clear mind on it, because I am not familiar with the circumstances that led Labour representatives to what to me is an unexplained and explainable hostility to the courts.  One matter has been mentioned&mdash;the well-known gibe about the delays of the law.  These delays are caused only because of the fact that the law courts have to deal with a very large amount of business which is disposed <Col N="1257" /> of in the circumstances in a well settled way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Larkin said that he would rather have these things done by some method other than by an appeal to the court because of this delay.  If he wants to shorten the extent to which use might be made of it, then that could be done by saying that there can be one appeal and one only.  I do not know what the objection is to having the trained minds of independent people adjudicating upon such matters as the application of an agreement in certain conditions.  I can understand a situation in which employers and employees would say: &ldquo;Well, there is an agreement which is badly phrased. Certain circumstances have arisen which we did not contemplate and we will have to adapt the agreement to meet the new situation and re-write it.&rdquo;  They may say: &ldquo;We will go back to the court for an amendment. There it is and the court can adjudicate upon it.  If it is something which the court cannot deal with, we will have to get the legislative body to interfere.&rdquo; Why should that matter not be left to the trained minds of people accustomed to adjudicate upon such issues?  Notwithstanding all the lessons of history, all the fights that have been made against the old oppressors, the kings, and the new oppressors, democratic governments, to try to establish one body of people to stand apart from the Government and the kings, and put them in a position where they may be independent, when one thinks of the time, the energy and even the blood that has been expended, it is rather lamentable that this thing on which so much was spent in getting it achieved, is now being, so to speak, discarded and we are having a lay court instead of having some body of trained experts to determine these questions.  I am not saying that there may not be certain objections to that procedure although I think they are gravely exaggerated and magnified but I think it would be much better to have these trained experts and this independent personnel to deal with it.  I do think that the application of an agreed interpretation to an individual should be a matter for adjudication and no <Col N="1258" /> matter how you may seek to sidetrack it, you are driven into the courts unless you are prepared to break the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not manifest that the Constitution gives me the right to go to the civil courts as defined by the law of the country and get my rights under the law?  Any statute which purports to withhold that right from me and to drag me away from the civil courts as constituted by the law and bring me before other courts is manifestly unconstitutional.  If the matter is brought before the Council of State, the Bill will be declared unconstitutional and a great deal of unnecessary trouble will be caused because this particular point is not faced at once.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the key to the dilemma is to provide a different procedure where the plaintiff is a trade unionist from that which is appropriate where the plaintiff is an unattached citizen.  If you face that difficulty now and deal with it, I think that many of the objections that have been urged here will fall to the ground.  If you do not, you will end up in a constitutional crisis which will render the Bill nugatory.</P>

A small group of workers in a firm has a contract with an employer under which the employer undertakes to pay certain remuneration over a certain number of years.  The union registers the agreement and later negotiates and registers a fresh agreement.

What I want to know is that if an agreement is negotiated with a union which provides for the payment to these people of a lesser rate of wages or for the observance of conditions not as good as those contained in the agreement, will the registration of the agreement deny the persons adversely affected access to a court to compel the employer to fulfil his contract?</P>

      <P>In this case I am bound to say that I agree with the Minister.  Deputy Larkin quoted the case of a number of workers employed somewhere or other.  The union gives notice for a termination of the agreement. In that situation, how is all the machinery that is being envisaged to be brought into play?  I suggest that you have to assume that there was some sort of agreement which was denounced by the labour section.  They now proceed to negotiate a new agreement. I rather think that the case argued here by Deputy Larkin was a very extreme one.  It has been said that the position of 90 per cent. of the workers under it was bettered, and that the position of 10 per cent. of them was worsened.  The Deputy wants to know if the 10 per cent. can say to their union: &ldquo;You cannot worsen our conditions.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There must be some other conditions which Deputy Norton has in his mind and which he has not yet communicated to the House.  From the point of view of the employer, the position would be quite impossible.  Does Deputy Norton suggest that where a ballot is taken by a union, those who vote against, or make a protest against the agreement, are not bound by the agreement? Would they not be bound to communicate that decision to the employer? I imagine that if they did, the employer would say: &ldquo;Well, now we must have an agreement; have it on or off; we must know who is affected.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I cannot conceive Deputy Norton going in later and saying to the employer: &ldquo;Look here, 10 per cent. voted against this because they were not covered by the agreement&rdquo;.  I think if he did that he would be told that that information ought to have been disclosed at the time that the general agreement was being negotiated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell misunderstands the position.  The case that I took was this.  A number of employees in a particular firm say to the union: &ldquo;Look here, these conditions which we have at the moment are the best conditions which the union could previously get for us; we took them as an instalment by way of being able to get something better subsequently; they are conditions which could stand a good deal of improvement; <Col N="1263" /> we want you to serve notice on the employer that as and from such a date we want them stepped up by 10 per cent. or 20 per cent.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy that point for the sake of peace.  A dispute takes place.  The employer says that he is not prepared to concede what is being asked.  A strike then takes place, and after a while there are negotiations.  The negotiations are protracted because the union is endeavouring to get what it originally hoped to get.  The employer is prepared to give certain things, so that the point is reached when you may get the employer to recognise that he will concede certain things to certain grades of employees in that firm and that he will do certain other things for other grades.  But he finally digs his heels in and says: &ldquo;That is as far as I am going to go; certain people employed in this place had privileges which, I think, they should not have enjoyed for so long; the circumstances in which they got the privileges have entirely changed and, not alone am I not prepared to give them any increase in wages, but I am not prepared to continue with this contract because it is now out of date having regard to the circumstances in which it was introduced; to those people in the future I propose to pay only what is permitted.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me take the case I quoted previously&mdash;£6 per week wages instead of £5, plus 5 per cent. commission, making a total of £7.  The union negotiating that agreement will take it to their members and say: &ldquo;This is the best we could get for you.&rdquo;  Now, 90 per cent. will say: &ldquo;After all, it is a substantial improvement and we will take it.&rdquo;  But 10 per cent. will say: <Col N="1264" />&ldquo;Yes, but under this agreement, which is the best you could get from our employer, we are going to get less.&rdquo;  What I want to know is, if the 10 per cent. who have an agreement with the employer, under which he is bound to pay them a certain rate of salary and commission, can sue in the ordinary court to compel the employer to carry out that agreement?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it?  I take Section 24.  It defines an employment agreement as an agreement &ldquo;relating to the remuneration or the conditions of employment of workers of any class or workers in any trade or industry&rdquo;&mdash;not of &ldquo;such&rdquo; workers, but of workers&mdash;&ldquo;made between a trade union of workers and an employer or trade union of employers&rdquo;.  Now, I may be wrong in this but I understand that to mean: suppose there is an organisation dealing with people working in foundries and there is a trade union representative of these workers which makes an agreement with certain employers, does that bind all foundry workers?  Am I right in that?  I think I am.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be expressed to bind all foundry workers and will be accepted by the court for registration if the court is satisfied the people who made the agreement are substantially representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is no explicit exclusion it will bind them all. But the section does not say of any &ldquo;such&rdquo; workers; you want to limit it to the group who are negotiating.  In the day when Ford manufactured tractors here for export to Russia and other countries it was their habit to let out work; they gave an enormous <Col N="1265" /> amount of work to certain foundries, notably one in the County Cork. Fords gave good conditions with regard to continuance of employment.</P>
      <P>They were objected to somewhat by trade union leaders in this country because of some of the conditions which they operated with regard to hours of working.  But they undoubtedly gave continuance of employment and good rates of pay.  Suppose now a dispute takes place between foundry workers generally all over the country and you have the people in Macroom&mdash;that is one of the particular places I have in mind now&mdash;with a good contract of employment which could only be broken by six months' notice on the part of the Ford Works at Cork, and suppose the trade union representatives of foundry workers negotiated certain conditions and those conditions were ruled up into an employment agreement and registered, as I understand this measure, the Macroom people would no longer be able to go before a court of law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

I thought that it was an employment agreement with the consequential result that it could not worsen the conditions of the people who had better conditions than the employment agreement gave.  But, once ruled into an employment agreement, everything goes before the lay court as I understand it.  If the Minister assures me that under Section 30 two things will remain over&mdash;the employment agreement, so far as it governs conditions of employment of a particular class, and a special contract which will not be regarded as part of or have anything to do with the private agreement, then the situation is clear.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The point the Deputy was trying to make was: he was assuming the union was negotiating on behalf of its workers and that the workers were bound by a contract made on their behalf by the union.  If that is the case, the workers have no rights except the rights under the contract made for them by their union.  But if they had an agreement existing independently of the union's agreement then they can enforce that agreement against their employer and, presumably, they will do so if that agreement provides better conditions. If it provides worse terms, then Section 30 deems their contract to be amended.</P>

As far as Section 30 is concerned it says, for instance, that if the Macroom workers are paid £10 a week and the rates throughout the country are £5 per week and an employment agreement is brought in which brings the rates throughtout the country up to £7 per week, then all contracts are to be read as if they included £7 a week.</P>

Ordinarily, the court would consist of five members but, if a member were ill, it would be desirable that the court should still be able to function.  Obviously, the absence of one member must involve the absence of a second member.  If one of the employers' members is absent, one of the workers' members would have to remain off also.  If the five members are not able to act, the court would then be reduced to three.  The same position would arise if, in any particular case, for personal reasons&mdash;say, association on the part of one of the employers' members with the business in question or some similar reason affectting one of the workers' members&mdash;one of the members of the court was unable to act.

    <P>I was not present at the discussions on Committee Stage, and I was not able to follow up in the Debates what the House determined in regard to this question of voting.  The original proposal was that if there was a majority of the court in favour of a certain course, the majority should rule accordingly.  That was, I take it, a majority of those who could vote.  It is now provided that, if a majority of the ordinary members agree, the question shall be determined accordingly. <Col N="1272" /> According to the new amendment, No. 25, if a majority of the ordinary members do not agree but a majority of all the members agree, there can be a determination accordingly.  Suppose there is a case in which one or two of those members do not want to vote. Does a majority of the ordinary members mean a majority of those present and voting or a majority of the four?</P>

      <P>This is a different type of court.  This is a court consisting, not of five judges, but of two workers' representatives and two employers' representatives and a chairman.  They can pronounce a combined opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Court of Criminal Appeal consists of three judges.  It has been decided that there is to be one decision of that court. This is copied from that.  There is no other opinion to be pronounced and the existence of another opinion is not to be disclosed.  The Minister as a member of the Government must know that the first thing the Minister for Justice finds out in a case of that kind is whether there was another opinion in respect to the individual.  Despite the prohibition against the disclosure of another opinion, he asks for the disclosure. That is the procedure so far as I know.  In the matter of a constitutional question, we debated on the Constitution whether or not when a constitutional question was discussed there should be publicity given to the fact that there was a different point of view.  Two points of view were canvassed in this House.  One was that there should be only one declaration so as to pretend at least that it was unanimous.  All the judges were so clear about what a constitutional case meant, that there was no variation of opinion between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point of view.  I spoke in favour of that and I said that it would lead to constitutional development to have the expression of different points of view.  They would then know what were the matters that <Col N="1278" /> exercised the minds of the judges.  In any event, you always have a majority decision.  Here you are not dealing with any such sacrosanct matter as the Constitution of the country and why must we have this pretence that there is no view other than the majority view, particularly when it may mean in the end that two employers have voted one way, two employees the other, and the chairman has stated his view?</P>
    <P>Yet the Minister wants us to pretend to the public that it is what the whole five agree to.  I can understand the Minister saying: &ldquo;I do not want any other opinion stated for the court except the one,&rdquo; and he goes on to say that the existence of another opinion shall not be disclosed.  People are human beings and these things are disclosed. I submit it is only bringing the law into contempt.</P>

      <P>I do not think so.  Since we discussed this matter on an earlier stage, the members of this Party considered it more closely and it appeared to us to be more restrictive than the amendment we suggested on this sub-section on the last occasion.  Whatever is intended in the section, we have the Minister's assurance that it means a certain thing.  When we seek to find out where the Minister got his assurance, we are told it comes from his legal advisers that the section has that certain meaning.  In our amendment we approach this matter in stages.  We suggest that the agreement is expressed to apply to all the workers of a particular class and their <Col N="1280" /> employers.  That is the top of the tree, as it were.  We then come down to all the workers and their employers in a specified trade or industry.</P>

      <Col N="1285" /> Amendment No. 36 relates to and is consequential on amendment No. 38. Perhaps I might mention the purpose of amendment No. 38.  It was mentioned here that it was desirable that an agreement which was for an unspecified period should be capable of annulment on six months' notice by either of the parties.  That is the purpose of the first part of the amendment. There was also a suggestion that, on the expiration of a period for which an agreement was registered, it would continue subject to three months' notice by either party.  That is the purpose of the second part of this amendment.  The effect would be, therefore, that if the agreement is not for a stated period, then, after 12 months, either party can give six months' notice of its annulment.  If it is for a stated period it will continue at the end of that stated period subject to three months' notice by either party.</P>

Amendment No. 41 provides that the court shall publish in such manner as it thinks fit notice of the registration of the agreement together with such particulars of the agreement as the court considers necessary; that when it is varied the court shall publish details of the variation; that when it is cancelled, the court shall publish notice of the cancellation and, to meet the point raised by Deputy Larkin, we are putting on the court the obligation of publishing from time to time lists of registered agreements together with such particulars of the agreements as the court considers necessary, with the ordinary provisions already in the Bill that the court will cause to be <Col N="1286" /> supplied to any person who applies therefor and pays the prescribed fee a copy of the registered employment agreement.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>(4) (a) Where a registered employment agreement is expressed to be for a specified period, it shall, if in force at the end of that period, continue in force until its registration is cancelled in accordance with this sub-section and the terms of the agreement providing for its duration shall be of no effect.</P>
      <P>(b) The registration of an employment agreement to which paragraph (a) of this sub-section applies may be cancelled by the court on the application, made after three months' notice to the court, of all parties thereto representative of workers or of employers.</P>

    <Title>In Committee. - Adjournment Debate&mdash;Prices of Wheat, Beet and Milk.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In the question I put to the Minister for Agriculture to-day I asked if he had received a copy of a resolution adopted unanimously by the South Tipperary County Council relating to increases in the prices of wheat, beet and milk.  That was a resolution <Col N="1289" /> with which the three political Parties together with the Independents agreed and in that respect it was unique.  I suppose we are about to reach the millennium&mdash;that there will be no opposition. It might be a grand omen for the future.  The resolution reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That this meeting of the South Tipperary County Council appeal to the responsible Minister to increase the price of milk by at least 3d. per gallon as milk at present prices would not cover the cost of production.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The present price is about 10½d.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We also call upon the Minister to increase the price of wheat and beet so that the farmers would have some little return for their labours&mdash;wheat by 10/- per barrel and beet by 10/-per ton.  We are also of opinion that 17.5 is too high an average for the sugar content of beet as scarcely any beet has so high an average.  We consider we are fully entitled to those prices as the cost of production, manure, etc., is excessive at the present moment when compared with the price of agricultural produce.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply to-day was a gem, a classic.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have seen a copy of the resolution mentioned by the Deputy.  The prices for wheat of the 1946 crop were fixed by the Emergency Powers (Cereals) Order, 1946, made on 12th June 1946.  No alteration in these prices is contemplated.</P>
      <P>As regards milk prices, it is not proposed to depart from the terms of the White Paper recently issued on the subject.  I do not fix the price of beet.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In Heaven's name, to whom are we to appeal, if not to the Minister for Agriculture?  That resolution was sent to each T.D. for the county&mdash;I am the only T.D. who is a member of the South Tipperary County Council&mdash;to each county council&mdash;many of the replies from whom were favourable and I expect that every reply will be favourable&mdash;the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The reply of the Minister was the weakest I have ever heard in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> With regard to milk, the cow is described as the foster-mother of humanity and the bedrock of agriculture&mdash;a perfect description.  On the small Munster farms they sell the calves at ten to 12 months' old.  The calves go to the small farmers in Connacht who keep them for four or five months and make money on them. The small farmers in Munster cannot keep them beyond that age, although the larger farmers can keep them a little longer.  I should like to remind our Leinster friends that their economy depends on the bullocks from Munster which are so despised.  They have to keep tilling their land&mdash;it will not grow grass.  After a year or two, having taken a couple of crops of hay, they must break it up and their economy will fall when our bullocks cannot come on.</P>
    <P>Our cow population is being steadily diminished.  I milked 32, but now I am down to 16, and that is typical of what is happening all over Munster. The Leinster fattening districts, from Wexford up, the district around Athy and so on, which eat the rye-grass, hay, oats, turnips and mangolds depend on our bullocks, and, last but not least, the bullock is the manure maker on the farm.  There is no other animal able to make manure in bulk but the bullock. The cow does it for us on the Munster farm.  The whole economic structure of this country will fall when the cow goes down, and yet nothing can be done to increase the price of milk.  The bacon industry and even the poultry industry depend on it.  Separated milk and skimmed milk are better than meat and bone meal for the production of eggs.  It is pretty hard to keep a herd of cattle going, in view of the incidence of disease and so on.</P>
    <P>With regard to beet, there must be a sugar content of 17.5 per cent. before the full price can be secured, and, when carriage is taken off, we in the remote areas get about £3 6s. od.  About three months ago, the Minister for Finance took 1d. off the pound of sugar.  It read well and there were headlines in all the papers about it.  To the average family of five, it represents 3¾d. or 4d.  What could you buy for that? <Col N="1291" /> Would you get any sugar for it?  We people in the country can get a little porridge or a bit of bacon and egg, but what about the unfortunate people who have none of these and who cannot get jam?  Yet if the Minister had put one-sixth on to the price of the farmers' beet, there would be some chance of these people getting it.  It would represent about the 10/- a ton we asked for.  We have also the position with regard to the meagre butter ration as a result of the depleting of our cow population.  Think of all the jam which could be made from crab apples, blackberries, fallen apples and so on which are all going to waste instead of being converted into jam.</P>
    <P>They tell us: &ldquo;We made you grow wheat.&rdquo;  They woke up and told us we could grow wheat.  Our forefathers knew that we could grow wheat.  But for how long can we grow it?  We grew it in '53 for three years during the Russian War and for three or four years of the American Civil War and when that war was over, in the late 60's, the land grew nothing but scutch grass, and there was a bigger emigration from this country in the next decade than there was in any 20 or 25 years.  We are told by the politicians: &ldquo;We made you grow wheat.&rdquo;  What is the legacy of the wheat?  The land is growing nothing but the scutch grass which follows the wheat.  There is no antidote to Providence and scutch grass is the legacy that has followed wheat, when you grow it too long.  Pay the man who likes to grow it, but there is definitely more work where the cow is and more men are employed.</P>
    <P>A certain member of this House made a test and found that, comparing County Wexford with the rural part of County Limerick, there are more men employed in Limerick.  The cow is the great employer of labour.  Too much continuous wheat growing is drawing an overdraft on the bank of nature and when the bill is presented for payment there are no reserves to meet it.  Let the man who thinks his land is good enough to grow wheat grow it and pay him for it, but he will find out very soon that he cannot continue to grow it.  Of course, wheat <Col N="1292" /> must be grown: you cannot let people starve, while the emergency is on.  It was grown in the last war under the aegis of the British Government, it was grown in the Crimean War and in the American Civil War and will be grown in any future war.  No political Party need to tell us what to do. The two generations of tradition before us have told us and these are the things they talk about at the fireside. We know what the farms are able to do and do not want much lecturing.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to indicate in his reply what will be done about these three things.  You could put a man working in every third house in the country, but the men are not to be got, owing to the flight from the land. They are good judges and they know the work is white slavery.  I was down on a Saturday evening at 3.30 and drove around three miles of the country, and between 8 and 9 o'clock I dropped into two different farmers, and winding up at 9.15 p.m.  I found a poor devil coming in with a pair of horses after having cut hay.  The farmers are working night and day. There is no parallel for the slavery of the Irish farm.  I have lived over 20 years in this city and I am not talking through my hat.  I know the two sides of the question as I am now over 20 years at home in my native Tipperary. Within the pages of <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>&mdash;and nowhere else&mdash;will you find a parallel for the slavery of Irish farm life.  It led up to the American Civil War, yet we are told nobody is responsible in this House.  Here is your document, in which all Parties are agreed that something must be done for farm production, to end slavery.</P>
    <P>I am not sent here as a supplicant, a cadger or a beggar, nor would I come here for that purpose, nor would those who sent me here send me for that purpose.  The horse wants a rest. The Almighty made the seventh day holy and a day of rest.  The men who have been working up to 9 o'clock on Saturday have to get up at 6 o'clock on Sunday to milk the cows.  They may cycle back eight or ten miles after a hurling or a football match, to <Col N="1293" /> milk the cows again on Sunday evening. It is the whitest of white slavery. The men on the land must be paid properly or the flight will continue. We have 65 per cent. of the population working eight hours a day&mdash;I myself worked a long time at eight hours a day&mdash;and 35 per cent. working in what I call not the Irish Free State but the &ldquo;Slave State,&rdquo; as the tail is wagging the dog.  We want equality of effort, equality of reward and equality of sacrifice.  We want a fair price for our stuff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very hard to reply to the Deputy, as I do not know exactly what he wants me to say in answer to this very hysterical appeal of mixed economics and very mixed history. First of all, he wants to know who fixes the price and he says I gave a nonsensical reply.  I could not have been more precise in telling him who fixes the price of the three articles.  I was very precise in telling him who did it, but he wants to know again.  I told him that under Government Order the price of wheat was fixed&mdash;the Irish farmer is getting the highest price in the world for wheat.  I do not know what sort of slave conditions you have in other countries amongst farmers, but the farmers growing wheat&mdash;even in Great Britain, where they are paying the men £4 a week&mdash;are getting less for their wheat than our farmers. There you have the slave conditions that Deputy O'Donnell talks about.</P>
      <P>The price of milk was fixed in a Government announcement in the form of a White Paper, which I pointed out to the Deputy at Question Time to-day. The price is not as high as the British farmer is getting, as the greater part of our milk is used for manufacturing purposes and not as liquid milk.  That part of our milk consumed as liquid milk in towns, villages and cities is getting a good price, as the farmer supplying it must produce the whole year round.  That is much more expensive than if he is producing in big quantities in the summer time for the creameries and producing scarcely any during the winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I told the Deputy I do not fix the <Col N="1294" /> price of beet.  There is a beet company which makes contracts with farmers for the growing of beet and it is a free contract.  If the farmer signs that he will grow beet at a certain price, he is bound to do so, but if he does not sign the contract he need not grow any beet.  Deputy O'Donnell did not point out that these prices should be increased. If he had made any comparison with pre-war prices or with prices two or three years ago, there might be some way of understanding his impassioned demand.  The price of beet is twice what it was pre-war.  Have the farmers' costs been doubled since the war began?  His rent is the same, his rates have increased by something like 40 per cent., his labour costs have not gone up 100 per cent.; so that his costs cannot have gone up by 100 per cent., while the price paid has gone up 100 per cent.  I do not think there is any great complaint there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>He is getting lower returns, of course, from the yields.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He is getting a lower yield from the acre of beet, it is true, and that is why a very much higher price is paid compared to the pre-war prices.  I suppose we would not serve any great purpose by going back over the history of the last century in wheat growing, though I must say it is the first time I ever heard it stated by a member of this House, or by any one else, that our farmers only grew wheat during three wars&mdash;the Russian War, the American Civil War and the First World War&mdash;and then left the land to scutch grass.  The returns show that wheat was grown generally in this country all through the last century and began to decline only in the late '60's.  It had declined greatly by the end of the century.  It was not a case of growing wheat for the Russians or the Americans; it was a gradual turnover, towards the end of the century, from tillage crops to livestock, as livestock was doing comparatively better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot remember exactly in what way the lessons in <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> might be lessons for Irish farmers. Deputy O'Donnell advised us to read the book, and to see there a parallel <Col N="1295" /> to the conditions under which Irish farmers were working.  Prices are fixed for wheat, beet and milk.  The year the farmer grew his wheat he knew the price, when the farmer grew beet he knew what the price was, and, I suppose, I may say that he continued in milk production knowing the price of milk.  I do not think this is the year that these things should be reconsidered.  I must say that I disagree entirely with the Deputy when he said that there should be a Minister responsible for the fixing of prices.  I always hoped when this emergency was over that there should be established some machinery for the fixation of prices, which would be independent of the Minister for Agriculture, <Col N="1296" /> and I would expect members of the Deputy's Party and of other Parties to agree with that view.  I would expect that they would agree that there should be some machinery and some basis for the fixation of farmers' prices which would not be affected by a resolution passed by South Tipperary County Council, or by an appeal by the Deputy to the Minister for Agriculture about any particular prices.  These are matters, now that the emergency is over, we may be able to deal with when the Dáil resumes, and I hope, between all of us, we may decide on some good system or some proper machinery for the fixation of these prices in future.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.24 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 24th July.</P>
