    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he has made or will make arrangements with the British Government to grant facilities to enable wives now resident in Éire to join their husbands who are employed in Great Britain, especially in cases where the husbands have procured the necessary housing accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would invite the Deputy's attention to the reply I gave to a similar question which he addressed to me on the 11th October last.  I informed him on that occasion that the British authorities were not prepared, owing to housing and supply difficulties, to grant facilities to enable Irishmen going to work in England to bring their wives and families with them.</P>
      <P>I understand that the same general considerations still apply in this class of case and that the British authorities are not prepared to grant facilities to enable wives now resident in Ireland to join their husbands who are employed in Great Britain.  The Deputy will appreciate that, even if the housing problem is solved in a particular case, there still remains the supply problem, and British official announcements indicate that this problem has, if anything, become more acute in Great Britain in recent months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is aware that the British Government and other Governments made arrangements to take English brides away to America to their husbands and facilities were granted.  Is it not possible for this Government to approach the British <Col N="1522" /> Government and ask them to allow the few, hundred brides in, where the men have settled down, or apparently settled down, in England?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy realises that in one case it means taking people away from the supply problem and relieving it, whereas in the other case it means accentuating the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to convey to the Taoiseach is that Governments have agreed amongst themselves to grant these facilities and a hundred or two would not make much difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is clearly ignoring the difficulty.  He is talking about taking people away from Britain.  This is a question of bringing people in, where the supply problem is very acute at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach be able to say whether the British authorities make any discrimination between the wives of Irishmen in permanent employment in Britain, as against the wives of Irishmen who are there for a temporary stay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that, at the moment, there is any differentiation made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say whether the British restriction applies where a wife has an offer of employment from some British source?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different matter, where the wife is going over and, getting employment, but even that, I think, has been stopped now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>I am unable to say when the new superannuation fund in respect of that section of the staff of Córas Iompair Éireann at present in membership of the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund will be brought into operation.  I am informed that legislation must be promoted in Great Britain before the transfer of the members and assets from the fund to a new association can be effected and that this may involve some delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say.  Different views are held on that aspect of the question.  It is probable that the provisions of the Transport Act of 1944 would be adequate and that the new arrangement would be implemented here without additional legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that there is a scarcity of whiskey at present in many areas throughout the country and if he will take steps to prevent the export of whiskey until the needs of this country are first met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there is evidence that the quantity of whiskey at present being released for consumption, though considerably greater than the quantity of home produced and imported whiskey released in prewar years, is not fully sufficient to meet the demand.  Exports of whiskey are restricted at present and export quotas have been established for registered exporters.  Before these quotas were established, the supply position was very carefully reviewed. In view of the importance of maintaining an export trade in whiskey, I do not consider it desirable to reduce the existing export quotas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that a number of persons, normally resident in Northern Ireland, joined the Defence Forces of this State during the emergency period; that, on demobilisation, they have returned to Northern Ireland; that they are not entitled, during periods of unemployment in Northern Ireland, to receive unemployment benefit; that they are being discriminated against in regard to employment; and whether, having regard to these considerations, he will take suitable measures to secure the payment to such people of unemployment benefit in respect of periods of unemployment after demobilisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No such case has come to my notice, and I have no information on other matters mentioned in the question.  Unemployment benefit cannot be paid out of the unemployment fund to persons resident outside this State, and there are at present no arrangements under which unemployment insurance contributions paid in this country are available for unemployment benefit purposes elsewhere.</P>
      <P>As I have stated previously, certain proposals relating to this matter have been made to the British Government, but I am not in a position to give any indication of the results, if any, which may follow therefrom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister realises the hardship imposed on any such person who, having served in the Army here during the emergency, has now returned to his home.  He happens to be in the Six Counties and he is debarred from receiving any benefit in respect of the contributions which the State paid on his behalf whilst he was serving in the Army.  In view of the fact that there appears to be ingratitude to that person who has so served, could the Minister devise some arrangement by which the hardship so involved would be relieved?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that a child from Castlebar suffering from tuberculosis was sent to Peamount Sanatorium by the Mayo County Council, on the recommendation of the Mayo Tuberculosis Officer, in October, 1945; if he is further aware that this child was discharged from Peamount Sanatorium on or about the 8th November, 1945, due to action taken by the Mayo County Medical Officer of Health, although the Peamount authorities required the child for further treatment; if the child was discharged from Peamount without any provision being made for her transport home, or for her future treatment; if he will state under what authority the county medical officer of health acted as he did; and if he will hold a full inquiry into the case so as to prevent a recurrence of such action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally the arrangements for the admission of a tuberculosis patient to an extern institution are made by the local authority on the recommendation of the appropriate medical officer of health and my Department is not made aware of such arrangements.  I have made inquiries as to the circumstances of the case to which the Deputy refers and it has been ascertained that the patient obtained admission to Peamount Sanatorium as a result of recommendations from the county council staff but without the knowledge of the county <Col N="1527" /> medical officer of health or the tuberculosis officer.  The patient had been previously in Creagh Sanatorium which is under the control of the Mayo County Council and was discharged therefrom at her father's request on 14th September, 1945.  The patient was in Peamount Sanatorium from the 25th September, 1945, to the 8th November, 1945.  It appears that her discharge was made as a result of a communication addressed to the sanatorium by the county medical officer of health in which he intimated to the resident medical superintendent of the sanatorium that the local authority would not be responsible for the maintenance of the patient beyond the date specified as the date of discharge.  It would seem that the county manager was not aware of that action.  I am having further enquiries made as to the exceptional procedure that appears to have been adopted in this case and I shall communicate with the Deputy as soon as the enquiries have been completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Early in 1938 land was compulsorily acquired for a hospital site in Cahireiveen.  Sketch plans were prepared but owing to the financial position of the county at that time and the large commitments already entered into for hospital improvements the proposal had to be deferred.  Sketch plans were again submitted in January, 1941.  In the emergency conditions which then prevailed there was no prospect of the work being undertaken. I will now be prepared to consider the proposal in conjunction with other hospital proposals throughout the country but I cannot give any indication when the work could be allowed to proceed to contract.  The estimated cost in 1938 was £22,700. There is no present estimate of cost available.</P>

      <P>The price at which produce of the 1945 wheat crop may be purchased from growers by holders of seed wheat assemblers' permits, for sale as seed, has not yet been determined.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed to fix a special price for the purchase from growers of the produce of pedigree seed wheat which is being distributed commercially by Pedigree Seed Growers, Ltd., during the current cereal year.  The intention is to make a provision in respect of wheat suitable for seed purposes, similar to that contained in Article 23 of the Emergency Powers (Cereals) Order, 1945.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will fix a minimum rate per hour, according to the size of the mill, to cover hireage charges for threshing mills during the coming season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of controlling the charges for the hire of threshing mills, on the lines suggested by the Deputy, has already been fully <Col N="1531" /> considered.  I am satisfied, however, that the Deputy's suggestion would be unworkable, on account of the wide variation in the sizes of the mills used and in the conditions under which the machines are hired in different localities.  The only practicable method of fixing maximum charges is that provided for in the Emergency Powers (No. 361) Order, 1945.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the practice is growing up, apparently, in this House of not giving an answer to a question but of referring Deputies to some other document?  I suggest that is not satisfactory.  First and foremost, it prevents us getting the information set out in the question put on the records of the House, and, secondly, it deprives a Deputy of the right to ask, if he wishes to do so, supplementary questions. That practice is becoming quite a common one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is raising a very wide question on a rather small issue.  The fact of the matter is that the information which the Deputy requires in this instance is already on the records of this House; it is in the Library.  I think when a Deputy asks for information which has already been published&mdash;information in respect of which the State has gone to the expense of publishing for Deputies' information&mdash;that, rather than go to the further expense of repeating it in the Official Reports of the Dáil, it is preferable that the Deputy would refer to the publication in which the information is contained for his own guidance and for the guidance of other <Col N="1532" /> Deputies who may want similar information in the future.  The Deputy asks for information with regard to stamp duty on sweepstakes.  That information is published every year and I have given the Deputy an indication of the document in which it is published and it would be easier and better for him to consult that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>But there was something else I wanted to ascertain.  The Minister's statement, in my opinion, makes the position much worse.  It is obvious that this is now a deliberate policy.</P>

      <P>In order to obtain the information asked for in the first part of the question it would be necessary to have inquiries made into the proceedings at the trial of every prisoner now in custody with a view to ascertaining whether, in the course of <Col N="1533" /> these proceedings, the prisoner claimed to be a member of an unlawful organisation. The time spent on these inquiries would be entirely wasted in the great majority of cases.  Moreover, the institution of such inquiries would create the mischievous impression that any convicted person, whatever his offence, is entitled to special consideration if he states that he is a member of an unlawful organisation.</P>
      <P>For these reasons I do not propose to institute such inquiries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question evidently refers to one of the 15 lots of timber on different State forests, tenders for the purchase of which were recently invited by public advertisement.  In the case of the Cappoquin lot, eight tenders were received of which two were below the valuation of the timber as calculated by the forestry division, the choice of purchaser being therefore confined to the remaining six firms. This lot comprised a large number of trees suitable for conversion into building timbers and after careful consideration of all the factors involved was allocated to a Cork firm mainly engaged in the building industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that prior to the emergency the Headboro' Saw Mills dealt <Col N="1536" /> exclusively in native timber and the Cork firm in question mainly in imported timber but I also understand that prior to the emergency the trade of the Headboro' Saw Mills was mainly a local trade in estate and agricultural requirements whereas the trade of the Cork firm was mainly in building timbers.  In present conditions all saw-milling firms have to depend very largely upon native timber for their supplies and whilst I am most anxious to assist those firms which have always dealt in native timber to keep going I am not prepared to give them a monopoly and must endeavour to spread the available supplies as fairly as possible.  The Cork firm in question tendered for four lots and secured one. The Headboro Mills tendered for one lot only and I cannot agree that any firm has an exclusive right to any particular lot of timber.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Dáil adjourned on Friday last I was dealing, in connection with the Turf Development Bill, with certain arguments which were advanced by Deputies opposite, and which appeared to be directed against the principle of developing systematically our peat resources, on the ground that at some stage supplies of imported coal might become available at lower prices.  In that connection I stated that, whatever may be the prospects concerning <Col N="1538" /> future coal supplies, it will always be good policy to develop our own resources, and that there is now, by reason of the work done by the Turf Development Board, good reason to believe that by mechanised peat production it is possible to make available from our own resources solid fuel which will be of a consistent and satisfactory quality, and which can be sold in wide areas of the country at all times at a lower cost, value for value, than coal is ever likely to be sold at. Again, time will prove whether that expectation is well founded.  Having regard to the work already done and the information gathered as the result of that work, I think there is very little room for doubt that the hopes now entertained will be realised in the event.  We have, of course, an immediate fuel problem, which cannot be met either by increased coal supplies or by mechanised turf production, because both methods of improving the fuel supply of the country will take some time to operate.  I think there is no prospect whatever that increased fuel supplies to a substantial extent will become available in the near future and, as I have already stated, the programme for mechanised turf production set out in the White Paper, and which it is intended to implement, will take some years to complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan believes, or endeavoured to convey the suggestion, that it is possible for us now to obtain increased supplies of coal by means of a bargain with the United Kingdom and that the Government has failed in its duty by not seeking to make such a bargain.  In that connection he referred to a recent statement reported in the Press by the British Minister for Fuel and Power.  Mr. Shinwell is reported as having stated, as one reason why coal miners in Great Britain should produce more coal, that if more coal was available for export it would be possible to obtain increased food supplies from this country in return. It is, of course, correct that if we could obtain more coal, more fertilisers and more equipment, we could increase the production of foodstuffs here and, consequently, the surplus over and <Col N="1539" /> above our own needs available for export.  But, Deputy McGilligan is aware and the House is aware that there is no bargain with Great Britain involving the exchange of cattle or other foodstuffs for coal nor are our exports of cattle or, other foodstuffs related to our imports of coal.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan put in juxtaposition to that statement by Mr. Shinwell a statement I had made here in 1943, that we had no bargaining power.  That statement was made by me in 1943 in relation to the circumstances of 1943 and was directed to the contention which was then being put forward that we could in that year have secured increased supplies of coal or other materials from Great Britain by utilisation of what was described as our bargaining power.  It was, of course, a dishonest debating trick to relate that statement, made in the middle of the world war, at the most critical period of the war, and which related to the circumstances of that time, to a statement made last week by a British Minister, for the purpose of showing some contradiction.</P>
    <P>It is no longer true that we have no bargaining power.  As circumstances permit of variation in the forms of production here or as trade with other countries who are now anxious to obtain supplies of foodstuffs, cattle and other farm products, from us, develops, our bargaining power increases but it still would be a dangerous illusion to believe that we have the world by the tail and that we can dictate the terms upon which the world will trade with us.  That is not true and it is merely, I think, an indication of Deputy McGilligan's usual contempt for the intelligence of the average person that he put forward that suggestion here knowing himself that it was untrue but in the expectation that some people less familiar with our general national position might be induced to believe it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may apply my remark to Great Britain.  I have endeavoured to bring the House to realise that the problem of coal supplies from Great Britain is not a temporary problem, is not due to any political decision of the British Government to refuse supplies to us, but to the bad position in which the British coal mining industry now finds itself. There were published only last week the British coal production statistics for the month of January and they showed a reduction of output compared with the month of January, 1945, of over 100,000 tons.  I believe that at some stage the decline in British coal production will be arrested and that output will begin to rise again but that has not been accomplished yet, as the most recent statistics make clear.</P>
      <P>The suggestion which Deputy McGilligan was trying to convey was that we need not have a coal problem here if the Government would go to Great Britain and use this alleged bargaining power to insist that the British would send us more coal than they are sending us now.  I have pointed out that a very small further diminution in British coal production will create a situation in which Great Britain will have no coal surplus to its own requirements available for export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is always open to us to refuse to supply our products to Great Britain except on conditions.  We might find that we could not make a bargain upon that basis.  I warned the House when I spoke on this matter in 1943 that we could not bluff on that issue. We knew then, as the British knew then, that the alternative to sending our surplus cattle to Great Britain was not to send them anywhere, to keep them at home even though it meant maintaining them at home by the use <Col N="1541" /> of feeding stuffs which were required for other purposes here.  It is no longer true that we could not sell a substantial proportion of our agricultural surplus outside Great Britain. We could.  Buyers from other countries are now coming here seeking to obtain supplies and we may in fact have to restrict the quantities they will be allowed to withdraw, because of possible reactions upon our internal situation, but there is no basis for the suggestion that it is a simple matter to extract more coal from the British by some process of bargaining with our agricultural surplus. I do not know if the whole of the Fine Gael Party is in favour of this idea of Deputy McGilligan of refusing to sell our cattle to Great Britain except on the terms that we dictate but, if they are, it is certainly a new orientation of that Party's policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The coal supplies we are now getting from Great Britain are equivalent to about 40 per cent. of our normal pre-war imports in quantity. The main consequence on our position of that contraction in total supplies is due not so much to the decline in tonnage but to the serious deterioration in the quality of the coal we are receiving. The great bulk of the coal which is coming here now from Great Britain is of a quality which ordinarily would not be saleable at all before the war. Whatever our prospects may be of getting increased quantities from Great Britain, we do feel that we should receive coal of a better quality and in recent months the main burden of the representation made by us to the British authorities has been directed towards obtaining supplies of a better quality.  If we could obtain even the same tonnage in coal of a better quality it would have most beneficial results <Col N="1542" /> upon the adequacy and the cost of the transport facilities which we can provide here, on the production of gas, electricity and the industrial commodities for the manufacture of which coal is being allowed.  The quality of the coal available has a very direct bearing upon the cost of the production of electricity.</P>
      <P>Deputies asked a number of questions concerning the probable cost of producing electricity from turf and made comparisons with the cost of producing electricity through coal at the Pigeon House or by water power at the Shannon.  If people are going to make comparisons between the cost of production of electricity at the stations now existing and the station yet to be created, they must make due allowance for the fact that construction costs will in future be substantially heavier than they were before the war.  I do not think anybody is optimistic enough to believe that the cost of building power stations, whether hydro stations or steam stations, will in future fall as low as before the war, and in determining the cost of electricity, both from hydro stations and from steam stations, but particularly from hydro stations, the capital charges arising are a substantial item.  Deputy Morrissey appeared to think that the introduction of this Bill required from him a boost for the Shannon scheme.  He was mainly concerned to demonstrate that the Shannon scheme was a bigger project than this Bill provides for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No such comparison entered my mind.  This proposal to develop our peat resources or to produce electricity from peat is not put forward by me as something better than the Shannon scheme or any other hydro-electric scheme.  It is being put forward as a necessary corollary to the development of water-power for electricity generation purposes.  It may have done Deputy Morrissey good to have emphasised here the importance of the Shannon scheme to this country during the war.  Nobody disputes that. If the Shannon scheme had not been <Col N="1543" /> begun in 1927, it is probable that the development of electricity generation here by local authorities and private individuals would have mainly taken the form of fuel-burning stations.  The Dublin Corporation might have developed the Liffey, but, undoubtedly, the bulk of our generation capacity would have been based upon imported fuel.  Nobody is questioning the soundness from the national economic point of view of developing the Shannon. The Shannon was a good scheme, so good that we are going to have two or three more like it in the next five years or so.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan was on sounder ground when blowing his own trumpet. He made the case that he was the pioneer of the idea of national enterprise in the development of our resources. Undoubtedly, the first major development of natural resources by the State, as distinct from private individuals or local authorities, was the Shannon scheme.  If Deputy McGilligan had not begun that process on the Shannon scheme in 1927, somebody else would have begun it, either in connection with electricity or something else, at a later stage.  I do not think there is anyone who would seriously contend that it would be possible for us to secure an adequate and systematic development of our turf resources by mechanical means otherwise than as a State-sponsored enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned that in making any calculation as to the comparative costs of producing electricity between one station and another, or by one process or another, due allowance must be made for all the circumstances. There is little difference in general design between the power station to be constructed on the Erne and the Shannon power station.  Although the character of the area and the general circumstances require variations in the particular layout, in essence the water-power of these rivers is harnessed for the generation of power.  Deputy McGilligan made what was to me a meaningless calculation as to the cost of current from the Shannon if capital charges were ignored.  In the generation of power from water, the only charges which <Col N="1544" /> matter are the capital charges.  Once the embankments, dams, canals, and power stations have been built and the machinery installed, the actual operation and maintenance charges are negligible.  The only item determining the cost of current is the capital charges resulting from the initial expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Erne scheme will be comparable in size to the Shannon scheme, but it will cost more because, despite the reduction of interest upon advances, the actual outlay on physical equipment, dams, embankments, stations and plant will be higher, due entirely to the increase in the cost of construction or the cost of equipment arising since the war.  Any comparison, however, between the cost of generating current at the Shannon or the Erne with the Pigeon House or any turf-fired steam-station must make due allowance for one important fact.  We cannot rely entirely upon water-power to provide our electricity needs.  Water-power is contingent upon weather conditions and, when the Shannon was developed, it became essential that there should be developed at the same time adequate steam-power capacity to operate as a stand-by for the Shannon. Construction of the Erne hydro-power station will also involve an increase in steam-plant capacity.  Every hydro station will involve an addition to steam-plant capacity and the actual cost of generating current in consequence of the establishment of a new hydro-power station must make due allowance for the expenditure which will also be incurred in the establishment of a corresponding steam stand-by plant.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, any comparison to be made now between the cost of generating current at a turf-fired station and the cost of generating at the Pigeon House must make allowance for the fact that the Pigeon House was taken over by the Electricity Supply Board from the Dublin Corporation without compensation and that, consequently, there are no capital charges to be met by the Electricity Supply Board in respect of the capital expenditure upon the station incurred by the Dublin Corporation. Capital expenditure on the <Col N="1545" /> station has been incurred by the Electricity Supply Board since, but it would be a false standard of comparison to take the actual ascertained cost of production at the Pigeon House for the purpose of determining the economic value of a turf-fired station.  However, as information was asked for, I will give it.</P>
    <P>The cost of generating electricity at Ardnacrusha in 1944-45 was .3024d. per unit.  The cost of generating electricity at the Pigeon House in 1944-45 was 1.5165d. per unit.  The cost for the Pigeon House reflects the abnormal increase in the price of fuel and, to some extent, reflects also the deterioration in the quality of the fuel.  Pre-war, the cost of current produced by the Pigeon House was .6632d. per unit. The estimated cost of producing electricity at the Clonsast steam station will be on the basis of turf at 20/- per ton, .725d. per unit and, on the basis of turf at 25/- per ton, .810d. per unit. It is clear, therefore, that, on the assumption of the Turf Development Board that it can produce by mechanical means turf delivered to the turf station adjacent to Clonsast bog at some price between 20/- and 25/- per ton, it is entirely an economic proposition to proceed with the construction of that station.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants the price to the consumer, he must make allowance for transmission costs and a number of other charges which are not included in that calculation.  In order to compare the economy of a turf-fired station with any other type of station these figures suffice.  It is true that the cost of production at a hydro-station will be lower than the cost of production at a steam station, whether the steam station is fired by coal or not.  As I pointed out, a water-power station must be supplemented by a steam station, in any event.  Consequently the actual charge per unit from a water-power station is not a sufficient indication of the position.  As I have stated, we could not proceed to meet our electricity needs by water-power stations only and, although in <Col N="1546" /> present circumstances it appears desirable that the board should proceed with water-power projects, that is due to the anticipated continuance of our fuel difficulties and the fact that it would take some time to step up mechanised turf production to the point at which an increased generation capacity on a substantial scale can be kept going on turf alone.  At some future stage, the board's generation plant will have to be supplemented by further steam plant corresponding to any new water-power station now decided upon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That depends entirely on the nature of the load.  The enormous increase in the demand for electricity which took place here between 1932 and 1939 was mainly due to the industrial expansion which occurred during that time.  The big increase was in the industrial load, and an increase in the industrial load is more attractive to the Electricity Supply Board than an increase in the domestic load, because it is more uniform throughout the day, and frequently continues throughout the night in the case of continuous process industries, whereas the domestic load reaches a very sharp peak at certain hours of the day.  The capacity of the stand-by plant required is largely determined by the flow of water to the hydro stations and the general nature of the load.  We have here in this country a demand for electricity, which runs into acute peaks as compared with some other countries where the demand is more uniform throughout the day and the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the industrial load is likely to be more uniform, that would not be so.  Deputy McGilligan also made very inaccurate calculations as to the consumption of electricity per head in the Six Counties as compared with the consumption <Col N="1547" /> per head here.  The Deputy reached an amazing result by cutting off 500,000 from the population of the Six Counties and 150,000,000 units from the consumption of electricity here. The consumption of electricity in the Six Counties at the moment is 400,000,000 units, and that does not represent 400 units per head, because the population of the Six Counties is at least 500,000 more than the Deputy stated.  Our consumption of electricity is not 300,000,000 units but 450,000,000 units.  While it is undoubtedly correct that the consumption of electricity per head in this country is still below that of many other countries, as I pointed out here when introducing legislation last year, the difference is not as substantial as Deputy McGilligan represents it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have here a specific problem which does not exist either in the Six Counties or in Great Britain.  It is much easier to sell electricity in areas of congested population, in towns and cities, than it is in a country where the bulk of the population live in scattered farms and rural areas.  The problem of rural electrification is about to be tackled by the Electricity Supply Board.  I believe that with the advent of electricity to rural areas, there will develop in the course of a short time a substantial revolution in the technique of farming here and a very steady and rapid increase in the demand for current by rural users.  However, we recognise the fact that our national development has been retarded by the delayed increase in the use of electricity as compared with other countries, and if we are going to make our production as efficient and our town and rural life as comfortable as it is elsewhere, we must succeed in getting a very considerable expansion in the use of electricity.  Preparations have been made for that.  The rural electrification scheme has been approved by the Dáil; the necessary finance has been made available to the board; the necessary powers have been given to it to undertake the work and, as the House is aware, a generation programme is under way which will provide the board in the course of a <Col N="1548" /> few years with sufficient current to meet all requirements.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies complained that the calculation as to the price of this mechanically-produced turf mentioned in the White Paper is too indefinite. The White Paper states that turf will be produced on 24 bogs at a price which will vary between 20/- and 25/- per ton.  On re-reading the White Paper, I realised that the form of words used might have created misunderstanding. It was not intended to convey that there was any doubt as to the price at which turf could be produced on any one bog, or that the board could at this stage only give an upper and lower limit.  The intention was to convey that the actual cost of producing turf will vary from bog to bog.  In some cases it will be as low as 20/- per ton and in other cases as high as 25/-.  Over all the bogs which the board will develop the average price will be 22/- or 22/6.  I want the House to understand that the actual capital investment required in the case of each bog has been determined, the operation costs have been estimated as closely as possible and the board is prepared to give, if required, a firm figure which would represent the maximum cost of production at any one bog.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister state at this point what are the headings which this figure is supposed to cover?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital expenditure set out in the White Paper will be incurred first of all on the purchase of the bog, then the drainage of the bog, on equipment such as production machines and railways, on the construction of houses for the staff to be employed and for working capital. Arising out of a remark made by Deputy Mulcahy, I want to make it clear also that it is intended that work will start simultaneously on every bog of the 24 listed.  It is not intended to begin on four or five this year and four or five next year.  It is proposed to start work simultaneously on all the bogs although some of them will be brought into production earlier than <Col N="1549" /> others because drainage problems may be more difficult in the case of some of the bogs and there may be other factors which will result in more expeditious development in certain cases.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to the size of the project with which the board has been authorised to proceed in relation to our full needs.  Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Hughes, of course, were mainly concerned to disparage this undertaking of a Fianna Fáil Government in case we might claim credit for it as a great national project, but Deputy Larkin and other Deputies dealt seriously with the possibility, recognising that we will need, to meet our fuel requirements in the next five or ten years, to increase substantially the output of machine produced turf.  I recognise the fact that this scheme could fairly be criticised as too small.  It may cost £3,250,000; it may put six or seven thousand people into work; it may involve a large technical staff and produce 1,000,000 tons of machine peat per annum, but it is still small in relation to the resources available to us and to our need for the development of these resources to meet immediate requirements. I mentioned, however, that the scheme set out in the White Paper is not intended to indicate any limitation on the activities which the board may undertake.  It represents a project which we believe the board can easily encompass, but if it can do better than that&mdash;either get into production at the rate of 1,000,000 tons a year at an earlier date than that contemplated in the White Paper or, having gained for its staff experience in the problems that will arise, can undertake the development of a larger number of bogs &mdash;they will get from the Government every encouragement to do so and we will be only too glad to introduce here the supplementary legislation to provide the finance required for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to the constitution of the board, and urged that persons should be chosen because of their familiarity with peat production <Col N="1550" /> problems and their general technical qualifications.  I can assure the Deputy that there is little risk that the Government will have any other considerations in mind.  I know the Deputy suggested that persons were sometimes chosen for boards in charge of State enterprises on political grounds.  The suggestion has also been made elsewhere recently.  I am quite sure that, in Deputy Norton's case, that suggestion was not the outcome of pique that he has not been chosen for one of those boards.  The fact of the matter is that, when the Government embarks upon a project of this kind, it is giving a hostage to the electorate and must make sure that the job will be well done.  If there were only political considerations to be kept in mind by the Government, then it would be obviously in its best interests to ensure that these projects were entrusted to people who could direct them successfully, as failure would react on the Government's interests.  However, I do not think I need assert that the Government in these matters is not concerned solely or even mainly with Party considerations. It believes that the national development of the country by means of particular projects, such as the development of our peat resources, the generation and sale of electricity or other activities of that kind, can in our circumstances be better performed by State enterprises established and directed under statute than by private business enterprise.</P>
    <P>A query was also addressed to me as to the marketing methods which the board will employ.  The board will be free to employ whatever marketing methods will bring the turf to the consumer at the lowest price.  In that connection, I would like to say that, during the emergency, we, of deliberate policy, which was fully explained to the Dáil, decided that the hand-won turf produced under the emergency scheme would be sold through existing fuel merchants.  We were anxious that those fuel merchants, the business concerns previously operating here, should be kept in business during the emergency years <Col N="1551" /> and that there should be the least possible disturbance in employment.  That was done by giving the business of distributing turf to them, even though we knew that their interest in turf would not be as high as it should be, and that their experience was not altogether suitable for the proper discharge of that businéss.  We knew it might involve a higher cost for distribution than if a single marketing organisation, specially designed for the distribution of turf, had been created for each centre.  I explained to the Dáil at the time why we decided to use the existing fuel merchants, and there was no dissent here.  It may be that some proportion of the subsidy now being paid in respect of turf in the non-turf area could be saved by scrapping the existing fuel merchants' organisation, by taking the turf entirely away from them and setting up an <i>ad hoc</i> organisation specially designed for that particular work; but I do not think that, in the long run, would be a desirable practice.</P>
    <P>In the future, however, this Turf Development Board will be a commercial organisation, and will be free to adopt whatever commercial practice is most economical.  It will sell the turf itself to individual consumers, or will market it through agents who are dealing in turf and whose equipment and organisation make them suitable to deal in it, or will give it to any person who wants to buy on wholesale terms and sell on a retail basis.  I stated, in the course of my introductory speech, that it was not at all contemplated that there would be any restriction on the production or sale of hand-won turf; that, in fact, the machine-won production would not interfere at all with hand-won production.  In case any misunderstanding might be created by my observations in that connection, I want to make it clear that those remarks related to circumstances in which the fuel scarcity problem has ceased to exist.  So long as it is necessary to retain rationing of turf in the non-turf area, then, of course, there will be restrictions on sale in that area, and on movement of turf in and out of it. I do not contemplate that it will be <Col N="1552" /> possible for us, this year or next year, to reach the position in which we will have such an abundant supply of fuels of all kinds that rationing can be abandoned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; I said that in introducing the Bill.  Deputy Dockrell made a very elaborate and what appears to be a very absurd calculation as to the cost of turf.  He based that calculation upon certain assumptions which I am anxious to get out of his mind.  The bulk of the cost of turf under the emergency scheme in Dublin or in areas along the East coast is represented by the loss involved in putting the turf into dumps and storing it there.  Deputy Dockrell has never grasped that fact.  In order to meet the fuel needs of Dublin during the emergency, it was not necessary merely to produce turf, since in addition to a fuel problem we had a transport problem. The whole of the turf produced in the Western counties for the East coast area had to be transported over a system inadequately equipped for the purpose at the times of the year when transport facilities could be provided, and those transport facilities had to cease entirely once the grain harvest and the beet harvest began to come in. It was necessary, therefore, to devise a system of bringing turf into Dublin in April, May, June and July, and storing it in dumps here.  That involved a double handling of the turf, substantially higher labour charges, and a loss of turf itself due to crumbling and evaporation, which has been <Col N="1553" /> estimated to be 20 per cent. of the total.  Therefore, 20 per cent. of the cost of turf in the dumps in Dublin represents a loss due to the fact that the turf had to be put into dumps. The storage and distribution charges involved were substantially higher than they would have been if turf could be produced and sold on a commercial basis as available.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, it is not intended that this machine-won turf should be sold in small lots to domestic consumers in Dublin.  I mentioned already that the programme of the board will be to sell the turf, if possible, in the districts immediately adjacent to the bogs on which it is produced.  Perhaps one-half of the 1,000,000 tons contemplated in the scheme will be sold to the Electricity Supply Board to feed generating stations located on the bog verges.  The other half will be sold for industrial and domestic use in the immediate areas where it is produced and in these areas it is estimated that the cost of turf will, value for value, be substantially lower than the cost of coal.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell made his calculation on the basis most favourable to coal.  He brought the turf from Turraun to Dublin, added a whole lot of charges that would not ordinarily arise, and related the cost to the cost of coal in Dublin.  Why not relate it to the cost of coal at Athlone?  Turraun turf will be sold at Athlone and why not add to the cost of coal in Dublin the charges involved in bringing that coal to Athlone?  If the Deputy follows that procedure, he will get a fairer estimate of the cost of turf in relation to the cost of coal, even if coal prices were to revert&mdash;as at present seems most improbable&mdash;to pre-war prices, or anything like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Alfred Byrne, in his usual insinuating way, asked who gets the profit on the turf now being sold in Dublin.  He knows, I am quite sure, that there is no element of private profit at all, except to the extent that the coal merchants in Dublin who distribute that turf to individual consumers, including bellmen, get any profit.  The turf is produced by the country councils or the Turf Development Board.  They recover, in the price <Col N="1554" /> received for the turf, their actual costs of production, and nothing more.  It is transported to Dublin and sold there by an organisation set up by the Government for that purpose, called Fuel Importers, Ltd.  They make no profit. The turf is heavily subsidised, as the Dáil is aware.  Deputy Byrne's question was merely intended to convey in a mean manner to the citizens of Dublin that the price of turf was unduly inflated by the introduction of an element of private profit.  Having regard to Deputy Byrne's tactics in these matters, his was the type of remark that one would have expected from him.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the desirability of further developing our coal resources.  The development of our turf resources in no way interferes with plans for the development of our coal resources.  One is not exclusive of the other.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan expressed the view that it was undesirable that the workers employed on the bogs should be housed in camps and he urged that houses should be constructed for their accommodation where they could live with their families.  That is the intention but, as I pointed out, turf production by this method involves not merely permanent employment for a substantial number of workers, but also seasonal employment for an equivalent number of workers.  These workers on seasonal employment, drawn mainly from the western seaboard counties, can best be accommodated in camps and hostels, such as the Turf Development Board now operate.  I would advise Deputy Commons and the other Deputies who spoke about the conditions in the hostels, to find out for themselves whether there is any foundation for the stories they have heard.  The workers are well looked after and well-fed. Deputies reading about rationing in Europe will notice that the expectation is that the majority of the people in Europe will get rations of foodstuffs sufficient to give them 1,500 calories per day.  It is assumed that the quantity of food required to maintain an average person in reasonable health is equivalent to 3,000 to 4,000 calories <Col N="1555" /> per day.  The rations supplied to the turf workers in the camps are equivalent to 5,800 calories per day.  There appears to be, therefore, no possible foundation for the suggestion that there is anything inadequate in the rations provided for the turf workers.</P>
    <P>I do not think there are any other matters arising out of the debate that I need refer to at this stage.  Reference was made to the proposals set out in the White Paper to encourage the use of turf by requiring the installation in houses, institutions and factories, established under Government direction or with Government assistance in the turf-burning areas, of equipment suitable to the use of turf.  Our problem during the war has been very considerably accentuated by the fact that in most houses, factories and institutions the ranges, grates and boilers installed were designed to use coal and were not suitable to the utilisation of turf, but with properly designed equipment in boilers, grates and ranges, turf is just as suitable a fuel as coal and can give equally satisfactory results.</P>
    <P>The intention is that the Turf Development Board will complete whatever experiments are necessary to ensure that there will be put upon the market suitable equipment for the utilisation of turf for domestic or industrial use and those who should be expected to use turf because it is cheaper than other fuel will be required, as a condition of Government assistance, to instal such equipment.  It is also intended that the Turf Development Board should investigate the possibility of producing from turf other industrial products.  Deputy Larkin inquired as to intentions in that regard and I want to make it clear that while the main function of the Turf Development Board is to produce turf for sale as fuel, if they can, as a result of experiments, find a use for by-products of turf for industrial purposes, they will be empowered to engage in that work.  Some other matters were mentioned, but they were mainly points of details which can be more usefully discussed in Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this legislation is to make provision for the maintenance of a shipping service between Galway and the Aran Islands, and for the payment of subsidies to the company operating the service. The House is aware that a steamship service is the only regular service available for the public transport of passengers and goods between the mainland and the islands.  As well as carrying the necessaries of life and the mails, the vessel brings live stock to the fairs on the mainland.  It also performs the service of the Irish Lights.  The maintenance of the service is essential to the economic life of the community living on the island. It has been in operation for many years but, owing to the limited amount of traffic available, it has never been self-supporting.  To secure its continuance it has, therefore, been necessary to subsidise it from public funds, and the Galway Bay Steamboat Company has been in receipt of subsidies varying in amount since the year 1891.  Prior to 1930 the total subsidies payable amounted to about £1,000 per annum.  Between 1931 and 1945 the annual subsidy averaged about £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1936 we passed the Aran Islands (Transport) Act.  That Act made provision for the payment of annual subsidies in respect of the operation of the service.  It provided also for payment of occasional subsidies to meet the cost of overhauls of the vessel. The amount of annual subsidy was <Col N="1560" /> limited to £300, and the Act provided that no subsidy should be paid in respect of any year subsequent to 1945. Under that Act an agreement was made in 1938 with the Galway Bay Steamboat Company for the operation and regulation of the Aran service. It provided for a fixed annual subsidy of £300 and in addition an extra subsidy to be paid on the occasion of the periodic overhaul of the vessel operating the service, namely, the S.S. <i>Dun Aengus.</i>  The extra subsidy was limited to the amount by which the overhaul exceeded £1,200 and was not recoverable from insurance or other sources.  That agreement terminated in December last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When did the subsidy terminate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year.  During the emergency, owing to the shortness of coal and the poor quality of the fuel available, the service was seriously curtailed in recent years.  Despite the reduction in the services, expenditure for fuel and wages greatly increased. The revenue formerly earned by the provision of tender services for ocean liners ceased.  Although the company's charges were increased, it, nevertheless, operated at a heavy loss during these years, and so critical did the position become last year that it was found necessary to pay an extra subsidy of £700 under the authority of an Emergency Powers Order.  The vessel is now due for overhaul and the company has no funds available to discharge that liability.  There is no statutory provision for the payment of subsidy to meet the cost of overhaul, or to cover the annual loss incurred in working the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to re-enact the provisions of the 1936 Act empowering the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to contract for the carrying on of a shipping service for the carriage of passengers and goods between the City of Galway and the Aran Islands.  The contract may include provisions relating to the maintenance, repair, insurance and disposal of the vessel, frequency and times of service, regulation of charges <Col N="1561" /> and other relevant matters.  Provision is also made in the Bill for the continued payment of an annual subsidy in respect of the operation of the Aran service and for an occasional subsidy to meet the cost of the periodic overhaul of the vessel.  The amount of annual subsidy necessary to ensure the continued operation of the service is not specifically determined.  It may vary, depending on operating costs, the availability of supplies and the possibility of the resumption of certain profitable services, such as tender service to liners, when calls to Galway are resumed.  With the improvements in conditions there should be a prospect that the amount of the subsidy will diminish progressively.  Whatever amount is considered necessary will be included in the Estimates submitted to the Dáil each year.  It is anticipated that for 1946 a subsidy of about £500 will be required.  The vessel involved in this service, the <i>Dun Aengus</i>, was acquired by the Galway Bay Steamship Company by means of a loan of £7,500 granted by the Congested Districts Board in 1912. A balance of £3,694 remained unpaid in 1935 and was remitted entirely in that year.  In consideration of that remission, the Minister for Industry and Commerce acquired the right to enforce the transfer to him of the vessel on the termination of the agreement, that is to say, in 1945.  It is proposed to defer the enforcement of that provision for the time being. Section 4 of the Bill and the new agreement which it is proposed to enter into with the Galway Bay Steamship Company will postpone the date of the transfer of the vessel while it continues to be used on the Aran service in accordance with the terms of the agreement.  As I mentioned, an overhaul of the vessel is now due.  It was last overhauled in 1941, and in the Estimates for this year will be included provision not merely for the annual subsidy to meet operating losses which it is assumed will arise, but also for an occassional subsidy to cover the cost of this overhaul less whatever sum may be recoverable from insurance.</P>

Ar chuma ar bith, ní ceart aon dream a cháineadh mar gheall ar ar thárla le linn an chogaidh.  Tá a fhios ag gach duine gur ganntanas guail ba chionntach leis an tseirbhís sin a bheith go hole agus chruthaigh an tAire agus an Roinn go rí-mhaith agus an oiread sin ghuail a chur ar fáil agus a thug deis don ghaltán seoladh uair amháin sa tseachtain agus bhí muintir na nOileán an-bhuíoch dá bharr san.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill also, and I think it was not quite fair of the last speaker to refer to the inadequacy of the service during recent years.  That was not due to any fault either of the Galway Bay Steamship Company or of any other authority in the country.  The service was reduced to one sailing a week, but at the beginning of the emergency when coal first became very scarce, I think the people did not expect that the coal situation would permit of even one sailing per week. However, co-operation between the company and the Department resulted in sufficient coal being available to guarantee one sailing per week, and the people have been, on the whole, in view of all the circumstances, very appreciative of the joint efforts in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note, however, that the Minister proposes to authorise his Department to waive their right to take over possession of the boat.  They have, as he pointed out, a mortgage on the vessel, and in the ordinary course it was expected that the vessel would come into full possession of the Department, because I do not think there is any prospect that the company will be able to redeem this mortgage.  If the service were to come completely and fully under the Department or, say, under Córas Iompair Éireann, such an <Col N="1564" /> arrangement would be welcomed by the people, because in their opinion there would be a better guarantee of a regular service and certain disabilities from which they suffer at present would be removed; for instance, charges in respect of goods coming from other parts of the country to Aran.  At present, there is an extra charge from the local station to the boat, and that adds to the cost of goods going to the island.  I am sure the Minister knows that in respect of two of the islands there are additional charges because there is no quarterage or any place in which the boat can berth.</P>
    <P>I do not like to offer any extra suggestions in regard to this service.  I appreciate the fact that the Minister is doing all that can reasonably be expected in present circumstances but it seems to me, in view of the fact that people sometimes have to spend a fortnight, and very often have to spend a week, when they come to Galway to do business, particularly at fairs, that an arrangement should be made either with the Galway Bay Steamship Company or with other owners of boats, either in Galway, along the coast, or in Aran, to provide some sort of subsidiary service to what is proposed in the Bill whereby people returning to Aran could go out on the ordinary bus service along the Galway-Carraroe Road and by arrangement with a boat owner, be able to get back home and not have to spend a whole week waiting for the boat.  Having to spend a week in Galway is very costly on them and it is a cost which they can ill-afford. This Bill, of course, makes provision for a shipping service between the City of Galway and the Aran Islands and such an arrangement as I suggest might not be possible within the terms of the Bill. However, I make the suggestion to the Minister and I ask him to consider it in conjunction with the Galway Bay Steamship Company, because I presume the contract will be made with that company.  Of course the <i>Dun Aengus</i> is quite obviously the best boat available for the service.</P>
    <P>I also think that the Bill is an improvement in respect of the change <Col N="1565" /> with regard to the subsidy.  I think it was better to leave the Department free in that matter to decide from year to year as to what the amount of the subsidy should be.  With closer co-operation between the company and the Minister's officials and a tightening up of the control of the service.  I believe that the loss can be very considerably reduced.  I know the Minister's difficulty in dealing with the payment of a subsidy to private companies.  I know it is not a satisfactory arrangement, but in this case I think it is inevitable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The curtailment of the service during the war was not due to any cause other than the insufficient supply of coal, and it would not be possible yet to restore the full pre-war service.  The intention, however, is that the bi-weekly service will be operated again when the fuel difficulties have ended.  I could not at present attempt to forecast when that will be.  All transport services depending upon supplies of coal are curtailed at the present time and are likely to be curtailed for some time yet.  The Bill does not provide that the agreement for the continuation of the service will be made with the Galway Bay Steamship Company, but it is intended that the agreement will be with that company.  It is, I think, clear that a better agreement, either in respect of the transport facilities to be provided or the amount of subsidy required, could not be made with anybody else. In that situation, it seemed to me desirable that the agreement should be with the old company which has been for so long associated with this particular service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of a system of through rates in respect of merchandise shipped to the island would not require that this service should be operated by Córas Iompair Eireann.  I think such an arrangement could be made by agreement between the Galway Bay Steamship Company and Córas Iompair Éireann.  There is the physical difficulty to which Deputy Bartley referred, that there is no connection between the railway station and the quay.  But, no doubt, the shipping company or the railway company could <Col N="1566" /> themselves provide, or could arrange with other contractors to provide, transport facilities over that distance. It may be that the total volume of traffic involved would not be sufficient to justify a system of through rates but so far as I know, there is no practical reason why it should not be possible and, no doubt, the board of the company could be inspired to investigate the matter further.</P>
    <P>The boat is at present awaiting overhaul in Dublin and the speedy passage of this Bill will result in the speedy restoration of the service because, until the Bill is passed, the dockyard company can have no certainty that the overhaul and repairs which it effects can be paid for.  Therefore, I ask the co-operation of Deputies from Galway on both sides of the House in getting the Bill speedily through the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £3,050 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1946, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Marine Service (Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1939, and the Foreshore Act, 1933 (No. 12 of 1933)); for certain payments in respect of compensation, including extra wages of seamen and the cost of medical treatment; and for payments in respect of the provision of certain protective equipment for ships.</P>
      <P>The additional sum required in respect of this service arises under two sub-heads.  As to sub-head F, which is connected with services provided in connection with wreck and salvage, there has been an exceptional increase in the quantity of wreck dealt with during the current financial year which has resulted in an excess in the sub-head. Deputies will note that the Appropriations-in-Aid are increased by a sum exceeding that amount.  That increase in respect of Appropriations-in-Aid arises almost entirely from the increase in the quantity of wreck brought ashore, resulting in greater receipts from sales and by way of commission paid on wreck.  It is expected that, despite the end of belligerent action, the quantity of wreck which will come ashore will continue to be above the normal for some time. It is not possible to estimate in advance the charges that may arise in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head J is concerned with grants for the equipment for protecting ships against magnetic mines.  The House will remember that the Government undertook to recoup Irish shipping <Col N="1568" /> owners the full cost of equipping their ships with protection against magnetic mines.  It was difficult to estimate the expenditure closely but it can be said that £4,000 of the deficit is due to the fact that the amount of the claim in respect of two vessels has been substantially greater than was estimated. A further portion of the deficit is due to the unexpected receipt of a claim in respect of work done in 1942 and the balance to the fact that certain sums which were expected to be payable last year were not so paid and eventually had to be charged against this year's provision.  It will still be necessary to make some provision under this sub-head in the Estimate for next year because not all the claims from shipping owners have yet been fully discharged.</P>

      <P>Deputy Broderick made some very pertinent observations on Section 36 and then moved to report progress.  Since he is not here now I assume that he has terminated his remarks.  I should like, therefore, to reply to certain observations he made.  He said first of all that there was no room in the Bill for free association between county authorities in respect of plans as they developed. He also spoke of there being nothing in the Bill to assist county authorities to co-operate where they could agree in advance.  He further spoke of the difficulties arising from one authority <Col N="1569" /> carrying out work on a bridge in which another authority was vitally interested.  In regard to these three different factors, so far as association between county authorities is concerned, during the preparation of plans there is nothing to prevent two county authorities from forming a joint committee under the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1898.  They can form it informally or they can form it under that Act for the purpose of discussing matters and if possible of co-operating in regard to plans for the bridge.  They can consider the cost to each authority and the distribution of the cost as between the two authorities.  In regard to their agreeing in advance of the Minister making a bridge Order, I think I already said that before the Report Stage we shall consider some amendment to facilitate such agreement in advance and to enable some of the provisions of the bridge legislation to be dispensed with by allowing these local authorities at some point to decide that they are going to share the expenses in an agreed ratio.  That will be considered on the Report Stage.</P>

    <P>In regard to executing the work on the bridge, it is our opinion that one authority, and one authority only, must carry out the engineering work on the bridge and that the engineering administration should be related to one authority.  We feel that the alternative of creating a separate engineering organisation by two authorities would be unwieldy and cumbersome and that any watching brief, so to speak, held by one authority on a work being executed by another authority must be in the nature of an informal arrangement. So far as I know there is nothing in the Bill which would prevent, shall we say, the Cork County Council from appointing an engineer with a watching brief to consult with the Waterford County Council from time to time in regard to the carrying out of the work.  It should be clearly stated that if the Waterford County Council or if, alternatively, the Cork County Council, carry out the work, to them would be left full responsibility. I need hardly add that in view of the very heavy financial commitments <Col N="1570" /> involved in the construction of such a large bridge, it or any large bridge, would be under the constant supervision of the engineering staff of the Department of Local Government. It is estimated that bridges on national highways across considerable stretches of water will cost anything from £140,000 to £250,000.  It would, therefore, be the duty of the Minister to see that the work is carried out competently and expeditiously at every stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broderick also referred to one county authority having a particular preference for a particular engineer.  In regard to that matter the Minister must decide, in the first instance, who is to be the executing authority, and, in connection with any grant from the Road Fund made for the bridge, he must be satisfied that the special engineer appointed to work with the existing engineering staff, is a person of high qualifications.  He must be satisfied that the work will be carried out under the authority of that person but I think the Deputy will realise that it would be quite impossible to deal with the preferences of any particular locality for a particular engineer within the terms of this Bill.  I think that disposes of the points which the Deputy made.  Before the Report Stage we shall see whether we can short-circuit the operations under certain provisions of the Bill by making arrangements to assist and encourage local authorities to co-operate and present an agreed report in advance.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 67:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (3), page 16, to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  Where plans are submitted to the Minister under sub-section (1) of this section and the bridge Order contains a requirement under Section 39 of this Act of a contribution by any road authority&mdash;</P>

    <P>(a)  the Minister shall cause a copy of such plans to be given by post to that authority and shall <Col N="1571" /> request them to consider such plans and, if they so desire, to send to him within a specified time their observations thereon,</P>
    <P>(b)  the Minister shall not exercise the powers conferred on him by sub-section (2) of this section until he has considered any observations on such plans which that authority may send to him within the time so specified.</P>
    <P>This amendment follows the ideas underlining Deputy Hughes' amendment, which was not considered sufficiently specific.  It is an extremely important amendment and affects the whole character of Part IV of the Bill.  It is one of the sections in which it is quite clear that the Minister desires that all the authorities concerned should have full cognisance of the plan that is being prepared and of the way the work should be done.  Before he finally makes a bridge Order, he must consider observations made to him by every authority.  I think that is fairly clear and there is no need to give further information.</P>

      <P>Before Section 42, page 18, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Where a person other than a road authority is required by or under any Act to construct or maintain the bridge or a part of the bridge or to pay or contribute to the expenses of such construction or maintenance, the following portions of this Part of this Act shall have effect as if such person were a road authority, that is to say, sub-section (3) of Section 31, paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) of Section 33, Section 39 and Section 41.</P>

    <P>This amendment has been inserted in order to apply certain portions of Part IV of the Bill to railway companies and persons other than road authorities who are required under any Act to construct or maintain a bridge or part of a bridge in respect of which a bridge Order is made or to contribute to the expenses of such construction or maintenance.  A number of railway bridges has been built under the legislation governing the formation of railways in this country and, under the Railways Act, the railway was supposed to maintain the bridge in a certain condition.  There has been a certain amount of litigation over this matter and, in order to make sure that the railway company continues to discharge adequate responsibility, we <Col N="1574" /> have inserted this amendment.  A railway company will invariably be named in the application for a bridge Order where it has some responsibility in connection with the reconstruction of a bridge.</P>

      <P>This amendment is inserted in order to clarify the position in regard to the classification of expenses incurred by a county borough council.  When we deal with the question of allocating expenses, in the case of main roads the expenses are raised equally over the whole of the county area; in the case of a county area road the expenses are raised over the county-ex-urban area; in the case of an urban area road they the case of a county borough, all the expenses are raised over the whole area and it is in order to define properly the words &ldquo;road authority&rdquo; that we have inserted this amendment and also the amendment further on in regard to county boroughs.  It should be quite clear, that in regard to chargeability of expenses, the regulations governing main roads apply to county areas.  Unless we inserted this amendment there would be a lack of clarity in regard to the chargeability of county boroughs.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 58 and 60, page 18, to delete the word &ldquo;main&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;trunk&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maybe I should have moved to add the word &ldquo;trunk&rdquo; and leave the word &ldquo;main&rdquo; in.  However, the intention is to enable the corporation to get any benefit that may accrue from this section in respect of the repair, replacement, reconstruction or reconditioning of any bridge within the jurisdiction of the County Borough of Dublin.  The words &ldquo;trunk road&rdquo; are <Col N="1575" /> defined in various Acts of Parliament, as are also the words &ldquo;main road&rdquo;. What I have in mind is to ask the Minister's assurance that, by leaving out the word &ldquo;trunk&rdquo; in this Bill, there is nothing that will deprive the corporation of any benefits if they have to maintain or repair a trunk road.  If it is not clear, maybe the Minister would accept the word &ldquo;trunk&rdquo;, so as to ensure that the corporation will get any benefit they think they are entitled to or that they have been entitled to up to now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could explain the matter to Deputy Byrne by indicating that the word &ldquo;trunk&rdquo; has no relation to the classification of roads in regard to their chargeability. In the case of a county borough, a trunk or a link road is regarded as one suited for a road grant from the Road Fund.  Therefore, the use of the word &ldquo;trunk&rdquo; would not be of any assistance in clarifying the section.  In the case of all bridges in county borough areas, so far as the local contribution is concerned, their expenses will be charged over the whole area of the county borough.  If the bridge joins a road which has been declared a trunk or a link road, and has been accepted by the Minister as such, the construction of the bridge would be subject to a grant from the Road Fund; but there is nothing in Part IV of the Bill covering the question of the Road Fund&mdash;it is entirely a separate matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has not satisfied me.  I think there is something in the leaving out of the word &ldquo;trunk&rdquo; that will deprive the County Borough of Dublin of the benefits they have already been getting from the Road Fund through other Acts of Parliament.  If the Parliamentary Secretary will give us an assurance that the dropping of the word &ldquo;trunk&rdquo; and the putting in of the words &ldquo;main road&rdquo; in this section will not interfere with the municipality of Dublin in the sense I have referred to, I will be satisfied. The municipality of Dublin may be called upon to improve, repair, rebuild or recondition in any way certain <Col N="1576" /> bridges and roads.  Heretofore they have been getting grants under other Acts of Parliament and these Acts have the words &ldquo;main and trunk roads&rdquo; included in their sections.  I should like to feel sure that there is nothing special in this section which will deprive them of any benefit because the words &ldquo;main roads&rdquo; only are mentioned and the word &ldquo;trunk&rdquo; is left out.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will look into this matter and tell us later that no imposition will be placed on the municipality of Dublin when they undertake repairs or improvements of any sort.  I hope that such undertakings will not involve the rate-paying public in the whole cost and that we will get the share that we have been getting up to now.  If I can get that assurance, I will be satisfied and I will not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;work&rdquo; in line 20 to the end of the section.</P>
      <P>This amendment is submitted purely for the purpose of clarification.  It is difficult to understand why the words at the end of Section 43 have been inserted. The section sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The work may be described in the application for the bridge Order or the bridge Order by means of a general statement of the character and purpose of the work and without specifying the exact situation of the place where it is to be executed or the manner in which it is to be executed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment suggests the deletion of the words after &ldquo;work&rdquo;.  I would like to know what is the purpose of inserting in the section words which make it so vague.  It does not appear to have any particular meaning.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will explain what is the object of putting in a vague sentence which appears to deprive the section of meaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of making Section 43 as broad as possible is in order to assist local authorities to propose the reconstruction or the building of a bridge in a manner which will not commit any other local authority in advance to a proposition with which they might not concur.  For example, I can think of at least one important urban area where a bridge might be <Col N="1578" /> erected at a certain part of a river very expensively, whereas if it was erected higher up it might enable certain parts of the urban area to be used for port or harbour purposes.  If it was erected in one place it might alter certain internal communications, such as railway termini.  It might increase the distance between the bridge and the railway terminus.  The whole purpose of the words at the end of the section is to enable any proposition for a bridge to be regarded in the broadest light possible.  If a local authority had to commit itself to the exact position of a bridge and the manner in which it was to be executed, when the Minister begins to order the survey to be undertaken the persons undertaking it will be definitely limited.  These words increase the scope of the Bill and enable authorities to make application for bridge Orders under the most favourable circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Right through the Bill steps are being taken to prevent chaos developing between conflicting or rival authorities.  All steps possible have been taken to see that there will be one co-ordinating authority.  I suggest that this will lead to considerable chaos&mdash; the idea that a bridge is to be built on some unspecified site.  Is that considered good legislation&mdash;that you can give the general description or character of the work without specifying the place where the bridge is to be built? The site is the most important function, in my opinion.  The Department inscribes here, voluntarily and gratuitously, something that I consider meaningless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the position has been satisfactorily explained by the Parliamentary Secretary.  The specification of the site is a thing that should be first determined.  If it is to be a general thing, we will have nothing but conflicts between one authority and another, and we will have difficulty as to the eventual cost of the bridge unless you can specify a particular point across the river and that the length and width of the bridge will be so-and-so.  I suggest it is not right to leave the matter in this vague state. If the words are deleted as suggested in the amendment, it will mean that <Col N="1579" /> the work may be described in the application for the bridge by means of a general statement as to its character and purpose.  Even that is vague enough, but without specifying the exact situation where the work is to be executed and the manner in which it is to be executed, you will be asking for a good deal of trouble.</P>
    <P>I have had some slight experience of dealing with contracts under the Local Government Department in connection with the erection of a bridge.  Various parties were concerned, from the board of works down to the road section of the Local Government Department and the local authorities.  I speak with some little knowledge when I say that if we had not a decision on the actual site, the whole thing would have ended in chaos.  This matter should receive serious consideration from the Parliamentary Secretary.  The site should be agreed upon beforehand&mdash;there should be general agreement on that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The last few words of the Deputy gave me a clue as to what is underlying his thoughts.  I said that we are to consider, before the Report Stage, how to stimulate co-operation between the two authorities, so that Part IV of the Bill, dealing with the erection of bridges, may be conducted in the most amicable manner possible &mdash;that is, the consideration of it by the local authorities.  I still say that when a local authority applies for a bridge Order it should be given the greatest possible scope to suggest that any examination may, in consequence of the application, be conducted in the broadest manner, without the Minister having to commit himself with regard to where the bridge is to be built and without committing any other authority as to where the bridge is to be built.  I think they are abusing the section by making purely fantastic proposals that somewhere a river bridge should be built but without actually underlining where by an exact description of the site.  There will be more than one local authority concerned, and a number of interests, as well as the whole question of the navigability of the river, and the comparative commercial value of various <Col N="1580" /> sites.  There is the fact that the bridge, if at one place may be very much less costly, or that it may cause a dislocation of trade in certain areas or that if built in another place it may assist a town.  In order to have the greatest measure of co-operation from all authorities going to be consulted, when the Minister has planned, the section is put in this manner, so that no local authority may commit itself too far in advance.  In the long run I think we shall encourage co-operation and that there is less likely to be friction. If a local authority states too exactly in advance its purpose in relation to an application for a bridge, this section gives latitude to consider the whole matter.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's remarks so far as they refer to the application are easily understandable, but the work may be called the bridge Order by remarks of a general kind.  I cannot see why the Minister should seek a safeguard of this nature in describing the work of the bridge Order.  From a reading of the section the Order may be so vague as to leave the exact location a matter of doubt.  I can understand that when applied to the application but when we come to the bridge Order the Minister has full power under the section to make an Order in what terms he thinks fit.  Why seek a further loophole and avail of the possibility of misdescription? I cannot see why the Minister should provide that the bridge Order should not indicate the exact location.  Its terms should be such that there would be no doubt where the bridge should be built.  They should be such as to fix the location.</P>

The object of the two amendments is to ensure that at the first meeting of a county council or local authority after an election there shall be an impartial chairman.  That is desirable.  Frequently after an election campaign there is a tense atmosphere, and the fact that the person presiding belongs to one of the parties who had been contesting the election often gives the impression that he is not impartial. There may be an opportunity for a chairman to display some partiality, even with regard to the election of a chairman, and for that reason it is desirable that we should follow the precedent established in this House. The same procedure should be adopted by local authorities.  I should like to know if the Minister has any objection.</P>

I do not think we have had many exhibitions of partisanship, at least to such an extent that we should accentuate a tendency which some Deputies, who are generally opposed to the managerial system, allege exists, whereby we are erecting the principal executive officer of a local authority like a manager into a position of superiority and control over elected members.  I can scarcely conceive that it is possible to carry that tendency, if it exists, to any greater extreme than is proposed in the amendment, where the secretary&mdash;not even the principal officer of a local authority&mdash;is for the time being to be put in actual control over an assembly of elected members. Of course that is what a chairman's function would be.  We have heard many complaints, particularly from the benches occupied by Deputy Keyes and Deputy M. O'Sullivan about the way in which managers are supposed to control elected members of local authorities.  Here is a proposal to put one definitely by statute in a position of control.  That has never been done. It has not been done, at any rate, in the County Management Acts and I do not think that we ought to accept it, even for a brief and passing period such as is here contemplated.  Apart altogether from that, the amendment is based upon a misapprehension as to what the position is.  It has been assumed, I think, that the chairman of a county council or of a local authority ceases to hold office during the interim period of election or ceases to hold office if he is not re-elected.  He holds that office until the new chairman is elected and it is true that some difficulties have arisen, not by reason of the fact that he acts as chairman, but there has been some uncertainty as to the voting powers of a chairman of the first meeting of the county council who while remaining chairman of the county council <i>pro tem</i> has not been <Col N="1583" /> re-elected to that body.  The section as it stands in the Bill&mdash;Section 45&mdash;is designed to deal with that case and to make it quite clear that his function at the meeting will be merely to conduct the meeting and not to participate by voting in the election of a chairman.  I think many difficulties which have arisen in connection with any of the meetings of county councils will be obviated in future by the section which we propose where, as I say, the chairman of the old council will preside at the first meeting of the new council but will not be entitled to vote unless he has been actually re-elected a member of the council.  That is briefly the case against the two amendments, Nos. 83 and 84.</P>

      <P>No, I did not say that.  May I correct the Deputy?  What I did say was this, that never before has it been suggested that an officer of the local authority&mdash;the secretary or manager&mdash;should be placed in a position of authority over meetings of a county council or other local body, actually to preside at and control their meetings.</P>

      <P>The section is obviously designed to meet a situation following an election.  There was such an occasion under the Dublin Act of 1930 where actually the city manager of the time, the late Gerald Sherlock, was nominated in the Act to preside and did in fact preside on the occasion until the Lord Mayor was elected.  The objectionable feature of this section, in the manner in which it has been drawn, is that an individual who was, say, chairman of the county council or of any borough authority and who had submitted himself to election and was defeated is, under this section, apparently, eligible to come back to <Col N="1584" /> preside at the opening meeting until his successor is appointed.</P>

      <P>Frankly, as far as I can see, objections could be levelled against that.  First and foremost, what right has that individual, if he has been rejected at the polls?  He has no longer the confidence of the people and therefore he has no right to be present there at all.  Incidentally, there is a personal side to it.  Such an individual, having received a rebuff at the polls, may not feel disposed, very obviously would not feel disposed, to attend such a meeting, to preside there and carry out the function which Section 45 assigns to him.  He would have personal objections, I am sure, to doing it.</P>

      <P>The machinery regulating the first meeting is not laid down in this section; it is laid down in the Principal Act.  What we are proposing to do here is to make it quite clear that unless the chairman of the old council has been re-elected a member of the new body, if he attends, the chairman of the first meeting of the new council will not have a vote at all.  On the other hand, it may happen&mdash;and I suppose in general it might happen&mdash;that the chairman of the outgoing council would not attend. In that event, as I pointed out, the vice-chairman of the old council takes the chair automatically and if he should not be present or should not have been re-elected then the members of the local authority themselves have the right to choose, on this occasion, their own chairman who will preside over that meeting <i>pro tem.</i></P>

      <P>I still think, with Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Cogan, that, as the section is one you want to alter and improve and as you are taking out that rather impossible portion of that section whereby the man coming back can exercise functions that are not his right, you should go further and make it impossible for the man to come back. It is really an obnoxious position for any man to have to come back after being defeated.  The Minister should devise a means by which the newly-elected council could do their work without the defeated chairman having to come back for that particular occasion to the scene of his defeat and eat humble pie by presiding at the meeting and having no power to vote.  I think that is very objectionable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it is not quite so simple as that.  A local authority is a continuing corporation and a continuing body with assets and responsibilities.  In these circumstances it must have continuing officers.  Therefore, you cannot get rid of the old chairman until you have elected a new one.  You cannot have the elected authority without a head.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is desired to apply the same sort of principles that operate in relation to the Government of the country to the functions and procedure of local authorities.  That is precisely what happens here.  The head of the former Government continues in office until the Dáil meets again and then it is determined.  That is, in fact, the closest analogy you can have to the procedure which is now prescribed by the 1941 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister apparently objects to any comparison being drawn between local authorities and this Assembly.  In so doing, of course, he has to a great extent repudiated a great deal of the policy and propaganda of his Party, particularly when extending the universal franchise to the election of local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>At that time the argument was used: why should such-and-such a citizen have a right to vote for representatives to this House but have no right to vote for representatives to a local authority?  We had that analogy drawn frequently.  I think there is a very close analogy between this democratic Assembly and the smaller and subordinate democratic assemblies in the counties and urban areas.  I feel that the secretary of a county council would be impartial as between one Party and another.  I do not think that the leading member of any Party would be as impartial between the various Parties in the event of a very close tie between the various Parties for the election of a chairman.  We have provision made here for an election by lot, and we have a position in which one of the leading combatants in that contest is to have control and supervision over the carrying out of this lot, which is, I think, objectionable.</P>
      <P>The Minister introduced the question of the county manager.  I think that was more or less to draw a red herring across the trail.  We know that there are cases in which there is a county manager exclusively for one county; in other cases, there is a manager for two counties.  I think that the secretary, as the official directly concerned with the functions of the particular county council, is the person who should be naturally selected to hold the balance fairly until the chairman is elected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot follow the argument of Deputy Cogan in this matter, because I have actual experience of a case where a former chairman was defeated in an election and expressed the wish to preside at the meeting to elect a new chairman, even though he was not a member of the council.  The new council facilitated him and invited him to come there and take the chair.  The former chairman, if you like, came to say adieu to the old timers and to welcome the new.  If you adopt this proposal, you exclude altogether a case of that kind and prevent a former member from presiding.  I do not see any great objection to such a man presiding at a meeting.  He has no power, no vote, <Col N="1588" /> and no interest in the matter.  I think it would be preferable to putting an official in the chair.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (1) of Section 44 of the Act of 1941 is hereby amended by the insertion before sub-section (2) of the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The members of a local authority shall not be removed from office under the foregoing sub-section of this section until the Minister has furnished a statement of his charges to the local authority; a public inquiry, consisting of a person or persons appointed by the chief justice has been held and its report furnished to the Minister and the said report has been published by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I think that is quite a reasonable section to put into this Bill.  It is only fair to members of local authorities that at least this amount of justice should be done to them if, following any action or alleged action of theirs, a local inquiry has to be held that might subsequently result in some form of prejudice arising which would mean that the board would be abolished and the powers delegated to a commissioner or a manager or some appointee of the Minister.

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>My last words give that summary.  The conclusion they come to is that the publication of the inspector's report is right.  On that I am basing my case that if an inquiry is to be held before the Minister abolishes a county council, the county council is entitled to have a copy of the inspector's report to see on what the Minister bases his decision.  I think my suggested amendment is quite reasonable. I believe that it would make things easy for the Government.  If a county council is to be abolished the members should be told where they have gone wrong and then the public would be satisfied that the Minister did right, and that those who had lost their powers must take their medicine without making any complaint or without there being any outcry in the newspapers that they have been unjustly treated.  This commission stated that publication is right.  I want to add that there is a feeling of hostility against this legislation by the Local Government Board and against the action of the Custom House in issuing orders taking powers away from local authorities.  If a local authority does not do what they are told by the Custom House, the authorities in the Custom House have power to abolish that local authority.  Under the Managerial Act, the only power which was left to us was the right to fix our local rates.  The Minister has now taken that power from us and it is because I see the danger of further intrusion by the Minister for Local Government that I am moving this amendment.  I ask not alone for the support of the Opposition, but for the support of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party who are members of local authorities, to see that the local authorities of which they are members in their own towns are not unjustly treated because of a desire to shake them off.  I ask the House to <Col N="1594" /> accept my amendment, which is a reasonable one, merely asking that the report supplied to the Minister be supplied also to those who are under the test and who want to see whether the report was fair and if the Minister was justified on the report in giving a decision that might abolish the authority. I move to report progress.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Forestry Bill, 1945&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan) Seán Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of the Bill as set out in its Long Title, is &ldquo;to make further and better provision for forestry&rdquo;.  With this end in view, it repeals the Forestry Acts, 1919 and 1928, the two statutes under which the powers of the Minister for Lands in relation to forestry derive, and provides instead a new and clear-cut code to govern those powers.  Forestry, as a public service in Ireland, dates from 1904, when the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction commenced, in a very small way, a State-sponsored effort to counteract the rapid clearance of Irish woodlands which had proceeded almost without let or hindrance for the best part of a century.  The efforts of the Department were directed towards the establishment of State forest areas and the promotion of education and training in forestry matters.  Useful work was accomplished in the decade ended in 1914.  Wartime considerations then precluded the further expansion of activities.  The present forestry service, however, may be said to have commenced with the foundation in 1919 of the Forestry Commission in Great Britain.  The Forestry Commission took over, <i>inter alia</i>, the functions of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction in regard to forestry in Ireland.  The commission was established by the Forestry Act, 1919, which set forth, in broad terms, the functions which it was to discharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The later course of events brought the Irish Forestry Service once again under the control of the Department of Agriculture before it finally became the <Col N="1595" /> responsibility of the Minister for Lands, but the framework within which State forest policy developed continued to be, and still is, provided by the Act of 1919.  Shortly after the change of Government, it was realised that the more rapid denudation of Irish woodlands during the 1914-1918 period had reduced the native timber stocks of the country to a very low level.  A situation had arisen which could not be met solely by accelerating the programme of State forestry. Something would have to be done also to put a brake on the clearance of trees from private woodlands or at least to ensure that the trees felled in the remaining woods would be replaced by fresh plantations.  It was this consideration which led to the passage of the Forestry Act, 1928, which was primarily intended to restrict the felling of trees on lands in private ownership.</P>
    <P>Since 1928, the forestry service has expanded its activities in extent and were it not for the recent war the service would by now probably have come close to attaining the rate of annual growth which is believed by the experts to be the desirable aim for this country's needs.  The war has limited activities in some respects but, with the restoration of normal conditions for which we may now hope, it is probable that, with the next few years, the service will realise its aim.</P>
    <P>It is not the object of this Bill to provide for any radical changes in policy and plans in relation to the furtherance of forest needs, but rather to improve in divers minor respects the statutory machinery under which the business of forestry is carried on. The needs of Irish forestry are keenly appreciated in all quarters; indeed, the forestry service is frequently the butt of criticism by enthusiasts whose zeal for a more rapid restoration of Irish woodlands refuses to be trammelled by practical considerations.  Ireland is, as Deputies will probably stress in the course of this debate, comparatively the worst situated of all European countries in its home-grown timber supplies and Deputies will probably be disappointed that the measure now before the House does not contain <Col N="1596" /> more virile provisions aimed at remedying that state of affairs.  I wish, therefore, to make it quite clear that it is my view, and the view of the experts who are responsible for the technical control of forestry work, that the present scheme of expansion is adequate, and is best suited to meet the country's needs.  The present Bill is not intended to confer new powers in any major respect nor to sponsor new forestry schemes.  Its purposes are to elaborate the existing powers of the Minister in certain matters of detail and to amend, improve, and modernise the previous legislation, particularly in relation to the compulsory acquisition of land for forestry purposes and the control of tree-felling on privately-owned lands.  The amendments are not radical and it is proposed to repeal the existing Acts <i>in toto</i>, only because that is the clean and the simple way of providing for the changes necessary. Deputies will, I think, welcome this proposal, which will embody all legislation bearing directly on the service of forestry in one statute.</P>
    <P>There are no new principles enunciated in the Bill and I think its provisions may properly be described as non-controversial.  There is, therefore, little scope for the kind of debate usual on Second Reading and I propose to confine myself to a brief explanation of the Bill's provisions and of their relationship to the existing law, in order to facilitate Deputies in the detailed consideration of the Bill on the Committee Stage.  Deputies received with the Bill an explanatory memorandum which will have helped towards a clear understanding of the general scheme of the Bill and it will suffice if I add a little further detail to the picture given in that memorandum.</P>
    <P>The Bill is divided into five Parts. Sections 1 to 8, which constitute Part I, comprise only technical and routine provisions relating to the commencement of the Bill, definitions, etc.  The only provision in this Part on which comment may be desirable is Section 4. This section relates to the prosecution of offences and sub-section (3) of the section provides that the normal statutory limit of six months for the prosecution <Col N="1597" /> of offences of the type which may arise under this Bill will be increased for the purposes of the Bill to 12 months.  Offences in relation to unauthorised tree-felling, etc., frequently do not come to the Department's notice for some time and it has been found that the normal six months' limit is too short to permit of the institution of proceedings in some instances.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with the general powers of the Minister in relation to the promotion and development of forestry. Section 9 is important, in so far as it sets out the things which the Minister may do within the ambit of his responsibility for the promotion of forestry and allied matters.  A detailed statement, in non-legal terms, of the provisions of this section is given in the memorandum to which I have already referred.  The section does not depart in any major respect from the corresponding provision in the Forestry Act, 1919.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with the compulsory acquisition of land and like matters. It is divided into three chapters.  The first chapter contains definitions and incidental provisions requiring no comment or explanation.  The second chapter deals with rights over or appurtenant to forestry land.  Section 19 establishes machinery for the extinguishment of rights in or over State forest lands.  Its object is to provide an avenue for the extinguishment of any rights to which land was subject at the time of acquisition and which prove a hindrance to the utilisation of land for forestry purposes.  The provisions of the section will also obviate in some instances recourse to the more complicated provisions included in the Bill in relation to the compulsory acquisition of land.  The powers given by the section will, for example, be used where the acquisition of a particular piece of land is desirable and the Minister is in a position to reach agreement with all interested parties apart from one person who is entitled to a right-of-way over the land which would interfere seriously with its value for forestry.  In such a case the Minister may acquire the land by agreement and proceed under this section to have the right extinguished instead <Col N="1598" /> of initiating compulsory acquisition proceedings.  That is the sensible course.  The Minister is not given an absolute power to extinguish any rights which he may desire to terminate; he is only empowered to apply to the Land Commission to have a right extinguished and the Land Commission will have full discretion to extinguish the right or refuse his application as they think fit.  Extinguishment of a right under the section will impose on the Minister the obligation of paying compensation.</P>
    <P>Section 20 continues a power, already possessed by the Minister under a provision of the Forestry Act, 1919, to make a haulage facilities Order requiring an owner of land to afford facilities for the haulage of timber from a neighbouring wood to a road, railway, or waterway.  The details of the provision have been modernised and elaborated but its principle remains unaltered.  This power might in certain circumstances be very necessary.  It is of interest, however, that in the quarter of a century since the Forestry Act, 1919, was placed on the Statute Book, no instance has arisen in which the making of a haulage facilities Order was necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 21 is merely a further elaboration of the principle on which Section 20 is based.  It provides machinery under which, on application of the Minister, the Land Commission will have a discretionary power to create, subject to the payment of compensation, a right-of-way appurtenant to State forest land over adjoining land.  The distinction between this section and Section 20 is that Section 20 applies to woods and forests in private ownership as well as to State forests and provides only for the grant of haulage facilities for a limited period (not to exceed one year under any particular Order) while Section 21 has reference only to State forests, but provides for instances in which a permanent right-of-way is necessary. Deputies will, I am sure, appreciate the need for this further provision. Instances have arisen in which considerable difficulty was experienced in extracting from State forests mature timber which had been planted by <Col N="1599" /> former owners without any attention to problems of extraction.</P>
    <P>The third chapter in Part III deals exclusively with the machinery to govern the compulsory acquisition of land for forestry purposes.  In the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill, attention was directed to one novel feature of the machinery contemplated, namely, that it will enable the Minister to ascertain how much he will have to pay in compensation before he commits himself irrevocably to the compulsory acquisition of any particular estate or holding. This is important, as the capital cost of acquiring land for forestry purposes is a big factor which has to be considered in watching the economics of forestry.  Generally speaking, the maximum value of land for forestry purposes is about £4 an acre, which, as Deputies will realise, might well be considerably below the market value of any particular piece of land useful for purposes other than forestry. The market value will be the guiding factor in the assessment of compensation and the Minister must, therefore, have a loophole to withdraw from proceedings if he finds that the compensation payable would render the economic use of the land for forestry purposes impossible.</P>
    <P>The memorandum circulated to Deputies gave a concise summary of the provisions which are proposed to govern the compulsory acquisition of land and the consequential assessment and payment of compensation.  There are just three points on which further comment is desirable.  First, as to the limitation of the Minister's power to acquire compulsorily, the present law is that the Minister, if he considers it necessary to acquire any particular land and is unable to acquire it by agreement, may apply to the Land Commission for an order authorising him to acquire the land compulsorily. The Land Commission may not refuse to make the order unless the land&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;forms part of any park, demesne, garden or pleasure ground, or forms part of the home farm attached to and usually occupied with a mansion house or is otherwise required for 5<Col N="1600" /> the amenity or convenience of any dwelling house&rdquo; or</P>
    <P>&ldquo;is required for the purpose of relieving congestion under the Land Purchase Acts&rdquo; or</P>
    <P>&ldquo;is the property of any local authority&rdquo; or</P>
    <P>belongs to one of several similar other types of land the devotion of which to forestry purposes would be contrary to national interest, such as land required for a public undertaking.</P>
    <P>In Section 23 of the Bill, which deals with this matter of authorisation to acquire, the system of authorisation by the Land Commission is retained but the Land Commission is given discretionary power to decide each aplication on its merits.  The absolute exclusion of land required for the purpose of relieving congestion is consequently no longer necessary and is being dropped, and the absolute exclusion of park-land and similar land is restricted to an exclusion of land which in the opinion of the Land Commission &ldquo;is required for the amenity or convenience of a dwelling house&rdquo;. The other exclusions, land the property of a local authority, etc., will remain. The net effect of these changes is to allow the Land Commission greater elasticity of decision in regard to the making or refusal of an order.  That is a definite improvement.</P>
    <P>The next point which Deputies should note is that the terms of Section 23 will specifically permit of the institution of compulsory proceedings in cases where land is subject to interests of so complicated or extensive a nature that purchase by agreement is not practicable.  There is quite a lot of mountain land in this country which might be suitable for forestry purposes and is at the moment devoted to rough grazing.  Much of this land is held in commonage by local smallholders and its acquisition by the ordinary method of negotiation and agreement would in practice be a hopeless proposition.  Under the Forestry Act, 1919, the first condition for the institution of compulsory proceedings is that the Minister must be &ldquo;unable to acquire by agreement&rdquo;.  There is doubt as to how far the Minister would be justified under the present law in <Col N="1601" /> maintaining that he is unable to acquire land of the type I have mentioned unless he first wasted much time and public money in the pursuit of efforts to acquire by negotiation foredoomed to failure.  The new provision proposed removes this doubt.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I wish to refer specifically is the fact that, under Section 31, compensation will be assessed by the Land Commission. This is a departure from the present law which provides for the assessment of compensation under the machinery of the Lands Clauses Acts.  The change in procedure is necessary, mainly because the provisions of the Lands Clauses Acts could not be applied in such manner as to permit of the assessment of compensation in advance of the act of compulsory acquisition.  I think Deputies will agree, however, that, apart altogether from reasons of expediency, the change is an improvement.  The Land Commission is the most competent and most independent body in this country to assess the value of land of the type with which we are concerned in this Bill.  The standards of value obtaining under the machinery of the Lands Clauses Acts, that is, the directions as to valuations contained in Section 2 of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, are being retained.</P>
    <P>In regard to this whole question of compulsory acquisition, it must be borne in mind that, while compulsory powers are desirable and necessary, the Department is loath, for a variety of reasons, to institute compulsory proceedings except in rare cases.  It may come as a surprise to Deputies to learn that the compulsory powers provided under the Act of 1919 have only been used in this country in two instances, the aggregate area so acquired being 529 acres.  It is probable that compulsory powers will, in the future, be used more widely, but it should be understood that compulsory acquisition of land on a large scale is not contemplated and is not practicable. The word &ldquo;compulsory&rdquo;, applied to the acquisition of land for forestry purposes, has an entirely different meaning from that generally associated <Col N="1602" /> with it in other respects.  Compulsory acquisition of land for forestry is resorted to only where there is general agreement that the land should be devoted to forestry, but the Minister and the parties who own, or have interests in, the land, fail to reach agreement about price, the allocation of the purchase money or some other such matter.</P>
    <P>Compulsory proceedings will never be instituted where it is reasonably contended that the land is more suitable for, and should in the interests of the community be devoted to, sheep-grazing or some other purpose.  It has always been held, and must always be held, that afforestation cannot be conducted in this country on the basis of compelling the owners of land to hand it over to the forestry service against their wishes.  If the owners of land, or persons entitled to grazing rights on land, strenously object to parting with their land or rights, there is an end to the matter.  The Department would not proceed to take any land compulsorily in the face of determined local opposition.  To do so would be to court lasting trouble and loss against which there could be no possible safeguards.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with restrictions on the felling of trees and allied matters.  The provisions of the Forestry Act, 1928, have been found from practical experience to be easily workable and there is, I think, general agreement that the form of control devised by that Act is sufficient and satisfactory.  It is not proposed to depart from that system or to alter its form in any radical manner.  The provisions incorporated in the Bill repeat those already in force, with amendments in detail found desirable or necessary in the light of administrative experience, with explicit reference to certain points in regard to which the 1928 Act was vague and with additional clauses necessary to meet situations for which that Act did not legislate.  A general summary of the provisions proposed is already in the hands of Deputies but, in view of the complicated terms of this part of the Bill, it may be helpful to supplement that summary with a brief additional <Col N="1603" /> comment on the particular significance and application of each section.</P>
    <P>Section 35 comprises definitions for the purposes of Part IV including a definition of exempted trees to which I will have occasion to refer later.</P>
    <P>Section 36 enables the Minister by Order to exclude any particular species of trees from the provisions of Part IV or any of those provisions.  This is a repetition of a similar clause in the Act of 1928.</P>
    <P>Section 37 requires that a felling notice be given in relation to trees over ten years old which it is proposed to uproot, or trees of any age which it is proposed to cut down, except in the case of certain trees set out in sub-section (4) of the section.  The limitation of the requirement, so far as the uprooting of trees is concerned, to trees over ten years old is designed to prevent the hindrance of nursery work. The requirement that a felling notice be given is similar in its terms to that embodied in the 1928 Act, except that a notice remains effective only for a period of two years whereas no limit existed under the previous Act, and the notice must be given by the owner of the land on which the tree stands instead of the owner of the tree.  The reasons for inserting a time limit on the effectiveness of a felling notice are obvious.  Otherwise the Department must keep perpetual records of all notices lodged and might perhaps be powerless to restrain the undesirable felling of a tree in respect of which a notice had been given, perhaps in totally different circumstances, many years earlier.</P>
    <P>The provision that the notice must be given by the owner of the land is complementary to a provision in Section 40 providing that licences granted in consequence of the giving of felling notices will also be granted to the owner of the land.  The reason for the change can best be explained in relation to Section 40.  Special provision is made in sub-section (2) of this section to enable the owner of the tree to give a felling notice where he has sold land but reserved to himself the ownership of trees thereon before 1st February, 1946.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1604" /> The exceptions which I have mentioned and which are set out in sub-section (4) include those categories of trees excepted from the analogous provision of the 1928 Act.  Further exceptions are, however, provided in the case of trees standing in a county borough, etc., or standing within 100 feet of a building, in respect of which a felling notice must be given under the present law but the felling of which may not be prohibited.  The following categories of trees for which no special provision was made in the 1928 Act:&mdash;First: trees uprooted or cut down by local authorities in connection with road construction, building work, etc.; Second: trees certified by local authorities to be dangerous to road traffic on account of age or condition; and Third: trees uprooted or cut down by direction of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on the grounds of danger or obstruction to telegraph or telephone wires.</P>
    <P>These three additional classes of excluded trees need no comment.  As to the trees situated in built-up areas or within 100 feet of a building, no reason is seen for continuance of the present requirement that a felling notice be given.  The question as to whether a tree is or is not so situated is a pure matter of fact which does not need the decision of a forestry expert.</P>
    <P>Sections 38 and 39 are complementary. Under Section 38 it is provided that a tree uprooted for the purpose of transplantation may not be used for any other purpose, and under Section 39 it is provided that where a felling notice is given in relation to a tree not intended for transplantation, the Minister may within 21 days make a prohibition Order, prohibiting the felling of the tree.  In addition to trees which it is intended to transplant, there are certain other categories of trees the felling of which the Minister may not prohibit under the present law.  Two of these categories I have already mentioned.  They will in future be excluded from the requirement that a felling notice be given.</P>
    <P>The remaining categories are all subject to considerations in respect of which the Minister should have an <Col N="1605" /> opportunity to satisfy himself by inspection or inquiry, as, for example, trees which are claimed to be decayed and useless for commercial purposes. It is, therefore, proposed to permit of the prohibition of felling in these cases and to provide that a limited felling licence must subsequently be granted if the Minister has satisfied himself that the facts are as claimed by the person who gave the felling notice. The classes of tree concerned are defined as &ldquo;exempted trees&rdquo; in Section 35.</P>
    <P>Section 40 empowers the Minister to authorise by the grant of a limited felling licence the felling, during a period of 12 months, of any tree in respect of which he has made a prohibition Order.  The power is discretionary, except in the case of exempted trees an application for a limited felling licence in respect of which he may not refuse.  The limitation of the authority conferred by a licence to a period of 12 months is a departure from the present provision proposed in the light of considerations already mentioned in relation to the same point as regards felling notices. The licence will be granted to the owner of the land on which the tree stands instead of the owner of the tree as heretofore.</P>
    <P>This point is important.  It is intended to restrain landowners from escaping replanting obligations by selling trees before obtaining a licence, thus placing the Department in the position that the licence had to be granted to the purchaser, say, a saw-miller, who could not be required to replant.  Special provision is made in sub-section (3) for the grant of licences to the owners of the trees in any cases in which the land was sold before the 1st February, 1946, with a reservation of the ownership of the trees to the vendor.</P>
    <P>Section 41 empowers the Minister to attach to a limited felling licence, not relating exclusively to exempted trees, either replanting conditions or a preservation condition or conditions or both.  The terms of such conditions and the obligations which they will impose have already been summarised for Deputies in the explanatory memorandum. <Col N="1606" /> The replanting conditions do not differ in any essential from those already in existence under the 1928 Act, but they will be expressed in more definite form so as to ensure that no loophole will be left for a nominal compliance therewith without any real effort to create and develop a fresh plantation in lieu of the trees felled. Preservation conditions will only be attached in occasional instances in substitution or part substitution for replanting conditions where the interests of forestry are likely to be best served by requiring the licensee to preserve properly an existing plantation.</P>
    <P>Section 42 empowers the Minister to attach a contributing condition to any limited felling licence to which he has not attached either replanting conditions or a preservation condition or conditions and which does not relate exclusively to exempted trees.  A full summary of the provisions of the section has already been made available in the explanatory memorandum. It has been inserted in the Bill to meet rare instances where there are practical difficulties in the way of the attachment of replanting conditions or preservation conditions to licences.</P>
    <P>Section 43 provides for the suspension or termination of a limited felling licence where the Minister is satisfied that its terms are being abused.  It is reasonable and proper that the Minister should have such power but the point was not covered by the 1928 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 44 deals with the special circumstances in which the felling of a tree should be prohibited for the purpose of preserving amenities.  Here again I think I may reasonably refer Deputies to the explanatory memorandum for details of the provision and an indication of its significance.  The machinery proposed is not likely to come into operation frequently but it is necessary that the machinery exist in case of need.</P>
    <P>Sections 45, 46, 47 are complementary. Section 45 provides that any tree, claimed in a felling notice to be an exempted tree, may not, when felled, be used for any purpose contrary to that claim unless the Minister has authorised its use for a specified other <Col N="1607" /> purpose by the grant, under Section 46, of a Utilisation (Exempted Trees) Order.  Section 47 provides that a tree, the use of which for a specified purpose has been authorised by a Utilisation (Exempted Trees) Order, may not be used for any other purpose. These provisions are not important but are necessary to ensure that no ill-disposed person will escape replanting or preservation conditions by claiming in a felling notice that he proposes to use trees for a purpose which would exempt them from the Minister's power to attach either replanting or preservation conditions to a limited felling licence, although in fact he intended to use them for commercial purposes.  Provision is made in Section 46 for the attachment of replanting or preservation conditions to Utilisation (Exempted Trees) Orders in like manner and in like circumstances as will obtain in the case of limited felling licences.</P>
    <P>Section 48 is more important but calls for little comment.  It is concerned solely with ensuring that where replanting conditions have been attached to licences under the Act of 1928, the licensees will fulfil the obligations of replanting in the spirit as well as in the letter.  It does this by replacing the existing conditions attached to 1928 Act licences by new conditions of like extent but expressed in the more detailed terms which will be used in future replanting conditions. The new conditions will not be more onerous than the existing conditions were intended to be and they will not impose any fresh obligations upon the licensees, apart from obligations in regard to the proper planting of trees and their preservation and protection, implied in the existing conditions but not expressly stated therein.</P>
    <P>Section 49 provides for the grant of general felling licences, authorising an owner of land to fell trees in a specified wood on a land in the course of thinning operations or to fell trees on a specified part of the land in the course of clearing that part with a view to replanting or authorising both the thinning of a wood and the clearance of trees from other land.  The authority <Col N="1608" /> conferred by the licence will be limited to a definite period and the licence may be revoked at any time. When a licence authorises the clearance of land with a view to replanting, there will be attached to it afforestation conditions imposing a statutory obligation on the licensee to replant. This section is intended to provide for the more facile and expeditions management of lands in private ownership which are devoted to forestry and conducted in accordance with the principles of forestry.  The powers of authorisation proposed are based on analogous provisions in the 1928 Act but are expressed in greater detail. The statutory obligation to replant land, where its clearance with a view to replanting is authorised by a general felling licence, is new but needs no defence.</P>
    <P>Section 50 is unimportant.  It is concerned with the statement in licences of conditions attached thereto.</P>
    <P>Section 51 is the only section which might be held to constitute a real extension of the restrictive provisions of the 1928 Act.  It proposes to prevent the removal of timber from trees otherwise than in accordance with the practice of good forestry or for the purpose of preventing grave damage to crops, or the damaging of trees in a manner likely to result in their death or decay.  That seems to be a drastic provision and Deputies will want to know the why and the wherefore of it. What it means is this: You may not escape the restrictions imposed on the actual felling of trees or obligations to replant by damaging trees in such fashion as to make them exempt or by cutting away all the branches and most of the trunks leaving in each case a butt of six feet so that technically the tree has not been &ldquo;cut down&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is a reasonable and necessary provision and it will be applied in a reasonable manner by the Department. If you want to cut a stray branch off a tree to make a handle for a shovel or because it is obstructing a pathway, you will not be removing timber otherwise than in accordance with the practice of good forestry&mdash;good forestry does not debar common sense.  But if you cut away all the timber in a <Col N="1609" /> plantation except for butts of six feet in length you will be acting contrary to the practice of good forestry and you will be open to prosecution.</P>
    <P>Section 52 is a further elaboration of the restrictions already in existence. It proposes that where a person is convicted of an offence which precluded the Minister from imposing on him replanting or preservation conditions with which he would have been obliged to comply had he acted lawfully, then the Minister will have power to make an Order&mdash;a replanting Order &mdash;imposing a replanting obligation on that person.  It may appear drastic to prosecute for an offence and then, notwithstanding the imposition by the court of a penalty by way of fine, to impose a further penalty by obliging the offender to comply with replanting conditions, but I think that, if Deputies consider the matter carefully, they will agree that it is reasonable and just.  It may even in some cases be imperative that the Minister should have power to require a person who deliberately tries to escape his responsibilities to the community to honour them.  I can visualise instances in which an owner of woodland who wants to use the land for some other purpose, gainful to himself but of no benefit to the community, will flagrantly break the law by felling the trees without authority and cheerfully pay a fine when convicted of an offence.  What is proposed in this section is that the Minister shall have power to say to that person: &ldquo;You cannot ignore your responsibilities just because you have broken the law.&rdquo;  If further justification for the provision be necessary, it is afforded by the fact that a person who complies with the law by giving a felling notice and, in the event of a prohibition Order being served on him, does not cut down his trees until he receives a licence, if he fails to comply with replanting conditions attached to the licence, is liable to a fine on conviction but is still bound to replant and cannot escape that obligation no matter how often or how heavily he is fined for non-compliance with it.  It would be inequitable that the more serious offender who drives a coach-and-four through the whole restrictive system of the Act <Col N="1610" /> would be liable for a single fine and be free of any obligation to replant.  The replanting Order proposed will equalise matters by putting that person under the same obligations as his more law-abiding neighbours.</P>
    <P>Sections 53 and 54 need no comment or explanation.  They deal only with the limitation of certain penalties in relation to offences affecting large numbers of trees, where the offences were committed in error, and the registration in the Land Registry of burdens on land arising from the attachment of replanting or other conditions to licences, etc.</P>
    <P>Sections 55 and 56 also require little reference.  Under the 1928 Act a panel of referees was established to which objections arising from refusal by the Minister to grant a felling licence might be referred.  The Minister was empowered to take, in his absolute discretion, whatever action appeared desirable to him on the receipt of the referee's report. Section 55 continues the panel of referees and Section 56 provides for the reference to a referee not only of objections to the Minister's refusal to grant a limited felling licence, but also of practically every conceivable form of objection which an affected party might have in regard to the Minister's actions in the matter of limited felling licences, Utilisation (Exempted Trees) Orders or replanting Orders.  The provisions as to the manner of reference, etc., are on similar lines to those contained in the 1928 Act.  Section 57 needs no comment.  Its purpose is solely to bridge the gap between proceedings initiated under the 1928 Act and their continuance under the new Act.</P>
    <P>Before passing from this Part of the Bill, I would like to give Deputies some figures which will indicate the way in which the corresponding provisions of the 1928 Act have been administered.  Since that Act came into operation 79,500 felling-notices have been received in the forestry division. Prohibition Orders were made only in relation to 15,349 of these notices, and in 11,353 of these cases felling licences were subsequently granted.  Replanting <Col N="1611" /> conditions were attached to 9,046 of the licences, about threequarters of the total number.  There are at present no general permits (corresponding to general felling licences in the new Bill) in operation, all permits having been withdrawn at the beginning of the war, but at the 1st September, 1939, there were 202 permits in existence; that is, there were 202 estates the owners of which were given freedom, more or less on parole, to conduct forestry operations without being hampered by the necessity of giving felling notices. These figures give a complete answer to those who maintained in 1928 that Departmental administration of the measure then enacted would paralyse private forestry.  They are a good omen for the manner in which the provisions of the Bill now before the House will be administered if those provisions become law.</P>
    <P>There remains only Part V of the Bill which deals with miscellaneous matters, the substance and significance of which have, I think, been set down in sufficient detail in the explanatory memorandum circulated to Deputies to render further detailed comment superfluous.</P>
    <P>Sections 58, 59 and 61 are concerned with the prevention of damage to woods due to the depredations of rabbits and other vermin, and of hares, or due to the existence on adjoining uncultivated land of vegetation liable to take fire.  The provision in relation to rabbits and other vermin exists already in the Forestry Act, 1919.  That in relation to hares restores the position which the 1919 Act brought into being but which was negatived by the enactment of a conflicting provision in the Game Preservation Act, 1930.  The provisions as to the prevention of damage due to fire originating on uncultivated land is new but needs no justification.  Section 60 continues provisions in the 1928 Act requiring that notice be given before burning vegetation growing on any land within a mile of a wood.  Section 62 repeats a provision in the 1928 Act empowering the Minister to obtain statistics from saw millers, exporters of timber, etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister's statement has been so lacking in imagination on a subject so useful and inspiring as forestry.  The Minister was quite right to appreciate that, in the matter of the establishment of State forest areas and the continuance and development of that work, there is no division of opinion in the House.  The Minister's statement and the statement in the White Paper simply show the steps which he intends to take to make the work of the State in developing State forests more easy and to overcome some of the difficulties which have been met with and, at the same time, in conserving what remains of privately-owned timber in the country, to tighten still more the grip on the private property represented by trees.  Following six years of depending to a large extent on our own timber, I think the Minister was in an ideal position to give us some idea as to what we really want, for urgent practical purposes, trees in the country for.  He had an opportunity of expanding on what it would mean for a rural community if they had more wood to use freely for their own purposes and the uses to which it could be put both for domestic and general rural purposes.  While it is interesting to hear the steps which are being taken to strengthen the Government's hands and to tighten up the Government's machinery, what we really want at present is an inspiring picture which would urge our people to take a greater interest in trees and to do greater things in thier own way to provide more wood in the country. The Minister has given us no information even as to what has been done by this State in comparatively recent years, nor has he presented any picture of who provided the trees, or in what way the trees were provided, on which we were actually depending during the recent emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all subscribe to the fact that it is necessary to develop State forest areas.  If we had not people in the past with large estates and an interest in trees who were ready to spend a considerable amount of money in afforestation from which they could not hope to get any immediate return, but which would bring a return to <Col N="1613" /> their families or heirs and to the country generally, we would have no woods to-day.  With the passing of the large and wealthy landowner, we are not likely in future to have any people carrying out afforestation schemes in a very large way. Therefore, the necessity for State work in connection with afforestation is very obvious.  Towards the end of his statement the Minister spoke of the whole restrictive system of the Act.  Outside the provisions to make it easier for the State to overcome its difficulties in carrying out afforestation, this Bill is wholly restrictive in its machinery and in its effects.</P>
    <P>Looking back over the last six years, we may perhaps consider that the people who framed the 1928 Act had a certain amount of justification.  The Minister said it was realised then that something would have to be done to put an end to the clearance of trees from private woodlands and to see that at least trees that were removed would be replaced by fresh plantings. It was all right to say that up to 1946, but instead of inviting the ordinary people now to take an interest in afforestation, the Minister is damning the issue by not only continuing the 1928 Act from 1946 onwards, but by making it more restrictive.  Who is going to put money into any serious attempt at planting if after he has spent his money a policeman stands over him and says: &ldquo;You cannot cut a single tree until you get permission from me or from authorities with whom I have to communicate&rdquo;?  Surely there are sufficient measures restricting people from constructive activity without at this hour of the day imposing fresh restrictions in respect of work we want done in the future?</P>
    <P>I take it that the Minister wants the assistance of the people generally in this effort of the State to provide timber for the country.  Would it not be much more important, then, that in 1946, there would be training in forestry matters, as the Minister says, that would educate the rural population and get them to take an interest in planting trees that they would know they could regard as their own property?  I think that whatever restrictions may appertain at the <Col N="1614" /> moment, in view of the stringency with regard to timber, when you take into consideration the fact that trees that are planted now are not going to yield any big commercial return for 40 years, and may not bring very much of a return to a farmer for his own purposes on his own farm inside 20 years, this Bill should contain a provision that those who plant under certain conditions now should be allowed to regard these trees as their private property and that they will be free from any restrictions in future, because, bad as are the restrictions which exist to-day over a man's private timber, the restrictions that may exist 40 years hence, if we travel the kind of road we have been travelling, will be infinitely worse, and a man will not be allowed to get any profits out of his trees at all at that time.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider whether he wants to restrict completely and absolutely tree planting to planting by the State in State forests.  If he does not, would he say what he wants the ordinary people to do as well?  If he wants the ordinary people to plant timber for the public good generally or for their own use, I think he should aim at educating the rural population into recognising the great asset it would mean to them to have timber on their own lands that they could use freely and with a certain amount of liberality.  If he agrees with that, then I suggest to him that he cannot let the Bill stand as it is, that he must do something through educational machinery of one kind or another to bring home to the people of rural areas that they can use timber grown on their own land liberally for their own purposes.  If he wants to achieve that he must say that timber that is planted now will be made available for use by the people who are prepared to plant that timber now.  If the Minister insists on tying up every private person who wants to plant trees under the 1928 Act and under this Bill he makes it almost impossible for private persons to carry on forestry operations and we are going to be left in the miserable position that tree planting and forestry generally is to be left entirely a matter for the State. I think that is the question that stands <Col N="1615" /> out for consideration in this Bill.  The Minister need have no doubt that we all want to assist the development of afforestation in the quickest possible way.  The fact that private people are not given an incentive is a great flaw in the Bill and I think that is a problem to which the Minister will have to address himself specially.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel myself in agreement with Deputy Mulcahy, at least in regard to the matter of restriction on private owners of timber.  I should like to see the Government embarking upon a scheme of planting the waste lands, which are absolutely useless for ordinary agricultural purposes, on a fairly large scale.  There are patches of wood here and there throughout the country upon which it is absolutely necessary to keep a check, but take the small farmer or medium landowner who has scattered trees here and there on his land.  Of course, it can be argued that he can get a permit to cut trees, but as far as the development of forestry on a large scale is concerned, I think we shall never get the small landowner to engage on it and it would not be fair to ask him.  At the present time there is a tendency on every small or medium-sized holding to utilise every possible perch of arable land because conditions are such that we cannot afford to allow any land to go waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of living, rates, etc., are rising every day and it is becoming harder for the ordinary smallholder or medium-sized farmer to live.  We could never ask people in that position to plant on a large scale.  Certain people were given woodland by the Land Commission or the Congested Districts Board 15 or 20 years ago. Trees were then growing on perfectly good land but that land has since been cleared and it is now first-class arable land.  I would ask the Minister to consider an amendment to relieve these people of the necessity to replant in cases where they have cleared trees for the purpose of increasing the size of their holdings.  I am alluding now to the 20 or 30-acre man who gets bits of woodland in and has to clear it out and is required now to replant.  Where <Col N="1616" /> there are 25 acres of arable land and no suitable land for replanting, the Minister should free those people from the necessity to use up the arable land in planting a crop which will not yield a profit for 30 or 40 years or more.</P>
    <P>If the Government would start forestry on a large scale, by taking over the waste lands, they would get assistance from every Deputy.  There was a survey some time ago and a report to the effect that most of the country, and particularly the West of Ireland, was not suitable for commercial timber on a big scale.  I have seen excellent timber planted in Connemara 50 years ago which produced the finest of trunks and came in useful during the emergency.  That timber was planted in clefts in the mountainside, where the soil had to be lowered down by ropes before the trees could be planted.  Apart from putting down something that would be a national asset in years to come, when the timber comes to maturity, we would be giving employment on a large scale, which is needed just now when the employment problem is becoming acute.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the amendment in the name of Deputy Byrne.  In principle, there is a good deal to be said for it.  It suggests that, before a local authority is abolished, a public inquiry should be held, to be conducted by persons appointed by the Chief Justice.  I would go further and suggest that the chairman of such a tribunal should be a qualified barrister or solicitor with a certain number of years' standing.  In order to preserve the Minister's rights, I would be prepared to give such a chairman the benefit of expert assessors from his own Department. There is a good deal to be said for the point of view that, where a public <Col N="1617" /> inquiry is held which may have very dire consequences for particular officials or may involve the abolition of a local authority, the personnel of that inquiry should not suffer from the suspicion that they are the servants of a particular Department or Minister, and are thereby likely to be influenced by that Minister.  The more open and independent inquiries of that kind are, the better it is both from the Ministerial point of view and from the public point of view.</P>
      <P>I believe that the powers now sought by the Minister are unnecessary.  After the holding of a local inquiry, if the Minister is satisfied that the duties are not being duly and effectually performed or that the local authority neglects or refuses to comply with any judgment, order or decree of a court, or refuses to allow its accounts to be submitted to audit, or that the members are not attending to their business, he may by order abolish that local authority.  One would think that Section 44 of the Act of 1941 gave the Minister ample powers.  In Section 47 of this Bill, the Minister is seeking to add to those powers, by the addition of a paragraph to the effect that, if a local authority refuses or wilfully neglects to comply with an express requirement imposed on it by or under any statutory enactment, the Minister may remove the members of that local authority.  I suggest that where the members of a local authority refuse or wilfully neglect to perform their statutory duties, the Minister can compel them, by taking <i>mandamus</i> proceedings, to perform their functions. It would be better, to my mind, to have resort to the ordinary courts of the land to enforce the Minister's authority, rather than set up a tribunal of the kind envisaged by the Act of 1941 or this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These inquiries are subject to a certain amount of suspicion that the official holding the inquiry is a subordinate of the Minister, that he must have regard to his position in the Minister's Department and that, in case of a conflict of opinion between himself and the Minister, he has to be very wary as to what advice he may tender to the Minister or even as to <Col N="1618" /> what finding he may make as a result of a particular inquiry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne quoted, quite properly, from the Sankey Report on Ministerial powers as exercised in Great Britain. That commission went very fully into the whole question of inquiries and found that, where the inquiry involves a judicial or quasi-judicial decision, that decision should normally be entrusted to the ordinary courts of the land and, further, that their assignment by Parliament to a Minister or to a Ministerial tribunal should be regarded as an exceptional thing and should require justification in every case.  They went on to say that, where Parliament found it necessary to depart from the normal course, it should entrust the judicial functions involved in the legislation to a Ministerial tribunal rather than to the Minister personally. Whilst they envisaged that the appointment of the personnel of the tribunal might be left to the Minister, they held that the tribunal should be independent of him in the exercise of its functions. They said, further, that in regard to the more important jurisdiction so set up, they thought the Lord Chancellor should be consulted before any appointments were made.  So far as I understand it, Deputy Byrne's amendment appears to be on all fours with the recommendations of that very responsible body, which sat in England in 1932 to review the tendency to delegate legislation and Ministerial powers.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, in all these matters where the Minister and the local authority are in conflict, it is idle to argue that the Minister has not some interest, that he is not impartial, and for that very reason natural justice would demand that the position as between the parties in such an inquiry should be at least equal, that every party before the tribunal should appear there on an equal footing, with equal rights.  Now, rightly or wrongly, the impression is abroad, by reason of recent happenings at inquiries, that before an inquiry is even held under the auspices of the Department of Local Government, the dice is already loaded against the particular party before that tribunal.  That may be an ill-founded impression, but it is nevertheless there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1619" /> I do not want to go into the duties of the inspector or the publication of his report&mdash;I have an amendment on that which I will raise at a later stage &mdash;but I say in all seriousness to the Minister, that it is high time we realised where we are drifting in these matters.  The tendency of all legislation, as I have pointed out here before, is to get outside the courts, to get outside the law, as it were, to vest in the Minister such extraordinary powers as will make his decision in any particular matter final and conclusive, and to deny to any party the right to resort to the courts.  I think that, from any point of view, and particularly from a legal point of view, is an intolerable position, a position this House should deprecate on every possible occasion.  I think that where, as often may happen, matters of law are involved in these investigations, there should always be a right of appeal to the courts of the land and, furthermore, that this tendency to make Ministerial decisions final, to set up the Minister as the final arbiter in these matters, is to be deplored.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say any more on the issue at this stage, but I think there is a good deal of merit in the amendment suggested by Deputy Byrne.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is not accepting it, he is being rather foolish.  He indicates in the next section, which we cannot discuss at the moment, that he is inclined to run completely amuck, but before he runs amuck he might consider having some sort of curb or restriction placed upon his assumption of dictatorial powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is a reasonable one. The section which it seeks to amend is Section 44 of the Local Government Act of 1941.  That section provides that if the Minister, after holding a local <Col N="1620" /> inquiry into the performance by a local authority of its duties, is satisfied that such duties are not being duly or effectively performed, he shall adopt a certain course.  This amendment endeavours to ensure that the inquiry envisaged in that section of the 1941 Act shall be an impartial inquiry, not a prejudiced or biased inquiry, not an inquiry dominated, controlled and directed by the Minister. It sets out not only to ensure that the inquiry will be impartial, but that its findings will be published; that the report and the decision will not be shrouded in a cloak of secrecy.</P>
    <P>When we consider the important position which the members of a local authority hold, the important functions which they have to perform, their standing in society, and the responsibility placed upon them, we must admit that it is wrong, criminally wrong, to have a local authority, its actions or inactions, inquired into by an unfair and biased tribunal, and to have that local authority abolished without proper investigation.  If a county council, an urban council or any other local authority fails to discharge its duties, it should have no reason to fear a public inquiry.  If the Minister believes a local authority is failing in its duties, he should have no reason to fear an impartial tribunal and he should have no reason to fear the decision of that tribunal being made public.</P>
    <P>The type of tribunal envisaged in this Bill is one which will be selected by the Chief Justice, an absolutely impartial person, far removed from the administration, and approaching the problem with a judicial and impartial mind.  The Chief Justice would select a tribunal which he would consider competent to try the issues involved. Why should the Minister refuse to accept this amendment?  Why should he refuse to allow the highest judicial authority in the land to select a tribunal to decide an issue between himself and democratically elected local bodies?  The Minister is not dealing now with subordinate officials; he is dealing with the elected representatives of the people, with persons who have a sense of dignity and self-respect, just as the people who elected <Col N="1621" /> them have a sense of dignity and self-respect.</P>
    <P>If we allow a prejudiced and partial tribunal to try a local authority and, without justification, decide against that local authority, are we not establishing a position in which men anxious to do justice to those who elected them, to do justice to the views which they hold, may be discredited for all time in the eyes of the community&mdash;discredited by this partial and biased tribunal? The Minister has nothing to fear from this amendment or from the type of tribunal which it seeks to set up and he has nothing to fear from the full publication of the report and decision of the tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this amendment, I would like to direct attention to the Minister's amendment of Section 44 of the Act of 1941, where it is set out that where a local authority neglects to comply with an expressed requirement, he shall impose upon them under any statutory or other enactment certain penalties.  I do not support this amendment of Deputy Byrne's, nor do I oppose the Minister's amendment, simply for the sake, as the saying goes, of being against the Government and the Department.  I feel that there is too great a tendency lately on the part of the Department to be suspicious of public bodies.  I do not think that is good for the country. As a member of a public body for a great number of years, I feel that there seems to be a very good spirit prevailing throughout the country.  There were periods during the past few years, due to acute political differences, when possibly members of public bodies forgot that they were the elected representatives of the people, and thought it a good thing and a brave thing to go against the central authority.  Happily, that time has disappeared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret very much that the Minister should introduce this amending section, because I think there is no necessity for it.  I believe that when councils have to meet expenditure, they will carry out their duties and endeavour, as far as is humanly possible, to meet the wishes of those who elected them. It is because I feel that elected representatives <Col N="1622" /> are disposed to do their duty that I believe it to be very unwise on the part of the Minister always to have the big stick hanging over them.  There is no necessity for that. Is it that the Minister is really so suspicious that public bodies will not do their duty that he finds it necessary even to implement the powers he already has?</P>
    <P>I am quite aware of the fact&mdash;and it is only right to say it&mdash;that before a council is dissolved the Minister generally gives notice, setting out certain facts and stating that there will be a local inquiry held.  Judging by recent correspondence in the Press, that has not been satisfactory in connection with the dissolution of a certain body in the City of Dublin.  The public were more or less in the dark as to who was right or who was wrong.  If the findings of the inquiry were published immediately after the inspector came to a decision, possibly there would not be so much confusion or such difference of opinion expressed, both in public or in private, as on that occasion.  I suppose it is with a view to preventing a repetition of that occurrence that Deputy Byrne introduced his amendment.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the amendment is necessary, or that the Minister considers an amendment of the Principal Act necessary, particularly in view of the fact that a majority of the elected representatives of the people are followers of the Government. One could read into the section that the Minister seems to have a certain lack of confidence even in his own supporters&mdash;that they will not do their duty.  On the whole, if these powers are to be given to the Minister, and if an inquiry is to be held, I think that it should be as public as possible, and that the person who holds it should have the same powers as those exercised by a judge on the bench.  As was pointed out, the Chief Justice is above all reproach or suspicion in regard to the appointment of a person to hold an inquiry.  The public would have confidence in the findings of such inquiry.  Above all, I regret that we should be discussing these things in 1946.  I am not one who indulges in discussions about democracy, bureaucracy <Col N="1623" /> or &ldquo;isms&rdquo;.  I am speaking from practical experience of the manner in which members of public bodies in County Louth, who have acute political sympathies, have acted during the past few years.  From what I know, all the members are anxious to carry out their duties conscientiously. As far as is humanly possible, they are carrying out the wishes of the central authorities.  When that happy state of affairs exists it is unfortunate that the Minister should think it right and proper to increase the powers he already possesses by his proposal to insert an amended section in the Principal Act, and that Deputy Byrne should think it necessary, in the interests of justice and impartiality, to put down an amendment.  If an inquiry is held the public at large will have full confidence in it, and when the result is published everybody will be satisfied that the public authority got a fair hearing and that the Minister was impartial in the manner in which it was set up.</P>

      <P>I have, I suppose. Perhaps it might be as well if I expressed them.  It might shorten the debate.  I am sorry that some responsible members of the House have been induced to support this amendment, at least verbally, because I can only think they have done so far want of due consideration as to what it implies.  The Deputy responsible justified it by long quotations from a committee which was set up by a British Lord Chancellor 12 years after the British writ was supposed to have ceased to run in Ireland. Perhaps, still with tender memories of the Crown, the colonies, and air-minded duchesses filling his mind, he urged on this House that what a member of the House of Lords thought good enough for Great Britain ought to be good enough for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Deputy, if he had done any more than try to extemporise a case by reference to a report of Lord Donaghmore's Commission, might have told the House whether in fact the <Col N="1624" /> British themselves had seen fit to adopt these recommendations, whether they had proposed to bind their executive power with the shackles which the Deputy proposes to put on the Government of Irish people.  We might then have had a case for this presented to us on a more factual basis.  He could at least have satisfied us that what was proposed by Lord Donaghmore had been tried and had not been found detrimental to the efficacious exercise of the executive power.  The Deputy and, I am sorry to say, Deputy Coogan, who followed and supported him, did not seem to think it was a matter of some moment that these proposals had not been adopted in Great Britain where the need of them might have been thought to be much greater than it is here because there is this distinction between our State and the British State, that our powers and our functions as a Parliament and as a Government derive from a more or less formal compact entered into with the people, that we exercise our functions as Ministers by virtue of the fundamental law of this State, a law which cannot be changed without reference to the people, a law which clearly defines the duties and powers and responsibilities of the Government, a law which, in Article 28, prescribes that the executive power of the State shall subject to the provisions of this Constitution, be exercised by or on the authority of the Government, a law which, in Section 4 of that Article, provides that the Government shall be responsible to Dáil Eireann.  In Great Britain there is no such fundamental law that cannot be changed without the direct approval of the people.  Any passing majority in the British House of Commons to-day can change the Constitution of Great Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes&mdash;Article 28 of the Constitution.  Therefore that is why I said that I was sorry to see a Deputy who does show in this House a knowledge of law for which people might have a respect, committing himself to supporting this amendment because, as I said, I think he could only have done so from lack of consideration of what it implies.  I was saying&mdash;and I hope, Sir, that Deputy Morrissey's itch to occupy your Chair will not compel him to rise again to points of order&mdash;that in Great Britain a passing majority in the House of Commons, provided that it follows the procedure laid down in a certain historic Act of Parliament, can change the whole Constitution of Great Britain, can give to the Executive of the day wide and far-reaching powers, which cannot be done in this State unless first of all the Oireachtas has passed a Constitution Amendment Bill and a referendum has been taken upon the proposals in that Bill and that, therefore, there was in Great Britain very much greater need to have an investigation of this sort and, perhaps, a very much greater need to tie the hands of the Executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had that investigation.  An investigation took place 13 or 14 years ago, as Deputy Alfred Byrne perhaps gathered on that historic occasion when he was in Westminster and as he told the House here this evening.  But let me remind the House again of what I said at the beginning: The recommendations of the Donaghmore Commission have not been adopted by the British Government, to whom they were addressed and for whom they were intended, or by the British people. Why should Deputy Byrne try to enforce upon the Government of this <Col N="1626" /> State recommendations of a British commission?  Surely to goodness, we are able to conduct our own affairs here as an independent people in the light of what seems good to us.  We do not want to be trapesing over to Great Britain to learn from them what they think is good enough for them and, because they like it, compel ourselves to swallow it.  That is the sole justification which the proposer of this amendment submitted to the House in his speech.</P>
    <P>I think the amendment is fantastic. I think it is grotesque.  What is the present position?  The Minister for Local Government, whoever he may be, is responsible to this House for the proper functioning of the local authorities in this State.  It is his duty to ensure that these local authorities discharge the duties and fulfil the functions for which they were constituted. It is his duty to ensure that if Parliament prescribes that they shall do certain things that those things shall be done.  That is his duty.  It is not the duty of the local electors, though it is, of course, the duty of the local representatives, but if the local representatives fail in their duty, then he has the responsibility of dealing with the situation which is thereby created.  That responsibility has been imposed on him by the statutes of this House.  It is not something which he has arrogated to himself.  It is a responsibility which he has carried for very many years since the establishment of this State and which was formerly the responsibility of the organisation which was then responsible for the proper administration of local affairs in this country.  That is the position.  In fulfilling his functions and discharging this primary responsibility, the one which justifies the very existence of this Ministry of State, the Minister is, of course, responsible to Parliament. The local authorities are responsible to him in the first instance for the discharge of their duty and he, in turn, is responsible to Parliament for seeing that the local authorities function as they were intended to function when they were constituted and carry out all those obligations and all those duties which have been imposed on them by Parliament.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1627" /> I have pointed out that the Constitution places the executive power in the hands of the Government and that it does not place the executive power in the hands of the judiciary.  Our Constitution is based upon the principle of the division of functions.  We have in the State three principal categories of power: the law-making power which resides in this Assembly; the judicial power which resides in the Bench; and the executive power which resides in the Government.  In the exercise of that executive power, the Government is responsible, under Article 28 of the Constitution, to Parliament. I do wish some Deputies would study their own Constitution instead of studying the reports of foreign commissions.  They would be much better legislators if they did.  I was saying that Article 28 of the Constitution says that the Government should be responsible to Dáil Eireann.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out that the Minister has certain responsibilities and, subject to the doctrine of collective responsibility, has full and undivided responsibility, in the first instance, for ensuring that the work of the local authorities and the whole system of local government in this country will be properly carried on.  He is the person who, under the Constitution, has to be satisfied as to whether the local authorities are operating with economy and efficiency.  It is he who, if any local authority failed to operate in that way, would be accountable to this House if he failed to take steps to deal with that situation.  That is the responsibility which every Deputy at one time or another has emphasised reposes on the Minister for Local Government.  Take the Order Paper in any one week and you will see questions there addressed to the Minister for Local Government asking him if such-and-such a sewerage scheme has been provided, if such-and-such a housing scheme is being undertaken, and if there has been any failure to maintain the roads on the part of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The other night we had an attempt to force the hand of the Minister in relation to a matter of this sort by two <Col N="1628" /> Deputies.  With all due respect to the Chair, I think it was a disgraceful attempt, because the Minister, naturally, would have to consider and always has to consider his actions in these matters very carefully.  At any rate, there was one thing that the action of Deputies Davin and Flanagan ought to bring home to every member of the House and that is that, ultimately, before Parliament and the people the Minister for Local Government is responsible for the general administration of local affairs in this country.  I know this is boring to Deputy Morrissey.  I am very sorry that he is unable to follow it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy perhaps lacks that apprehensive power which would enable him to apprehend what is likely to be involved in an amendment of this sort.  I was saying that there is one thing that the action of certain Deputies in this House has made clear, and that is that, since the Minister has to carry public responsibility for the conduct of local authorities in relation to these matters which affect the inhabitants of the areas which they administer, it is the Minister who must be satisfied that, in fact, the local authorities are fulfilling those functions for which they were originally established and constituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does this amendment propose? The amendment proposes a number of things, but I will get to what I think is the fundamental of it.  This amendment proposes that the members of a local authority shall not be removed from office: (1) until the Minister has furnished a statement of his charges to the local authority; (2) until a public inquiry by a person or persons appointed by the Chief Justice has been held and its report furnished to the Minister, and the said report has been published by the Minister. Take the kernel of this whole business.  The amendment proposes to give to the Chief Justice power to appoint a tribunal to decide and to <Col N="1629" /> determine matters at issue between the Minister and these organisations and bodies for which the Minister, under the Constitution, is responsible to Parliament.</P>

      <P>There can be only one judge in this matter, so long as our Constitution remains unchanged, and that is the Minister in whom responsibility has been reposed by the Constitution.  There cannot be any other.  How would it be possible to reconcile a proposal that three outsiders, two outsiders or one outsider should be appointed by the Chief Justice&mdash;who has quite a different function under the Constitution from the Government&mdash;with the provisions of Article 28 of the Constitution?  If you were to accept this amendment, and if, having accepted it, it could ever become valid law, you would take away at once the final responsibility of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could no longer be responsible to Parliament because what would happen would be that the Minister would be, I assume, bound by the findings of these two or three outside persons, and he would have no responsibility whatever for the general administration of local government in this country.  Yet the Minister, apparently, could not dissolve a defaulting local authority, no matter how criminally neglectful it might have been of its responsibility, unless he had the concurrence of some persons outside. In short, in relation to these matters the power of the Minister would be put into commission and the Minister who, under the Constitution is responsible to this House, would be responsible to this House, not for his own determination as to whether the administration of the local authority concerned was satisfactory or not but for the determination of three people <Col N="1630" /> who, as I have said before, would have no responsibility to Parliament.  That position, I think, would be quite inconsistent with the provisions of our Constitution.</P>
      <P>Apart altogether from that, the amendment is, in fact&mdash;let us face it&mdash; a vote of no confidence in the Minister for Local Government, a vote of no confidence in the Minister and in the Government, because the power which the Minister has exercised is not a new power.  It is a power which was conferred, I think in 1923, confirmed in 1925, confirmed again by the Oireachtas in 1941.  Since 1941 there have been at least two general elections.  Prior to these general elections the present Minister for Local Government dissolved a number of local authorities in this country and we did not hear any outcry in the elections against him. On the contrary, I am proud to say he received the endorsement of his constituents at these two elections in a much greater measure than ever before, and the Party administration of which he is a member received a greater vote of confidence from the people than ever before.  I think the House would be stultifying itself if, at the instance of the Member for Westminster&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, it is.  At the last two general elections the people had before them several instances, fresh in their minds, of the manner in which this power had been exercised by the Minister for Local Government and I am glad to say that, with the facts before them, the Government was returned in 1943 and again in 1944.  The powers of the Minister under the existing legislation have therefore stood the test of time and have received the endorsement of the people.  I suggest to the House that haying, so recently as 1941, reaffirmed the provisions of the preceding Acts, and having entrusted this power to the Minister, the House should, as I have suggested, not stultify itself by accepting the amendment proposed by Deputy Byrne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There were two sentences which the Minister uttered in the course of that long and very irrelevant speech with which I find myself in entire agreement.  The Minister, invited by Deputy Coogan to address himself to the amendment, said: &ldquo;Perhaps it is better I should not.&rdquo;  Then he said: &ldquo;Perhaps it would shorten the debate if I did not.&rdquo; The Minister has the consolation of knowing that he was right on both counts.  I think Deputy Byrne is entitled to our thanks for moving this amendment, if it were only to give the Minister an opportunity of disclosing a little more publicly and a little more clearly, the mentality which some of us knew, and many people suspected, lies behind the whole administration of the Department of Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, as usual when he is given time enough, blurted it out: &ldquo;I am the Minister for Local Government; I am local government.  Nobody in this country, from the Chief Justice down, dare question anything I say or anything I do and if they do dare to <Col N="1632" /> question it, I shall shake the Constitution at them&rdquo;.  Then of course when some of us had to smile, he tried a little heel-tapping.  He tried to mend his hand immediately.  The Minister went on to say: &ldquo;In the ultimate, I am the person responsible for local government in this country.  I am local government&rdquo;.  That is what we were trying to show in the earlier part of the debate on this Bill.  Certain sections are giving the Minister powers of life and death over local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister thought it desirable to make some cheap jibes about the mover of the amendment.  He thought it fit to tell the House the reason why his vote was increased at the recent General Election and he said he gloried in the fact that his vote was increased because he had abolished local authorities. I wonder if the loud speakers which were used in the Minister's constituency and in others, threatening blood and fire and bombs and thunder on the people of Dublin if they did not return a Fianna Fáil Government, had more to do with his getting extra votes and the Government getting extra votes.</P>

I was proceeding to contest that and give what I consider to be the reasons, when the Leas-Cheann Comhairle told me he was afraid I was out of order.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if it were desirable, it would be utterly impossible to follow the Minister into all the byways he travelled, from the Irish Constitution to the British Constitution, from Westminster to Leinster House. The Minister had a glorious time of it, having taken up all that time and having told us about his constitutional rights, his constitutional powers and his constitutional privileges and, incidentally, Sir, having told us that if we read more carefully our own Constitution we would be better legislators. On that point, I would suggest that the Minister should practise what be preaches, since if anybody is more in <Col N="1634" /> need of reading and understanding the Constitution, if it has that effect, than the Minister, I would like to know who he is in this House.</P>
      <P>The Minister ignored the whole point.  He talked all round it, he talked on everything under the sun, including the elections and the reasons why he was returned, and gloried in his abolition of local authorities.  He told us nothing about the amendment or about the present position.  The present position is that the Minister orders an inquiry and sends down his inspector, evidence is given and the inspector reports, but nobody but the Minister is allowed to see or to know what is contained in that report. Nobody but the Minister knows whether the report of the person who presided over the inquiry is favourable or unfavourable to the local authority. If his interpretation of inspectors' reports is as good as his interpretation of the Constitution in relation to this amendment&mdash;which, incidentally, he told us was repugnant to the Constitution&mdash;then I think that, in itself, makes a good case for Deputy Byrne's amendment.</P>
      <P>If the Minister has no better case against the amendment than he sought to make here in the last 40 minutes, then he has no case at all.  He certainly disclosed to the House that he considers himself a full-blooded dictator, so far as local government is concerned, that no person or body, from the Chief Justice down to the town commissioner, can have any view on local administration or on the interpretation of any Acts or Orders made by this House, that comes into conflict with the Minister's personal view on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked about local authorities carrying out their functions. As I said on a previous section, I know of few local authorities which have refused to carry out the ordinary normal functions for which they were elected.  It is only when an attempt is made to shove on to them some abnormal load never intended for them, it is only when an attempt is made&mdash;as has been made and as will be made to an increasing degree in the future&mdash;to make them shoulder financial responsibility which should and <Col N="1635" /> hitherto was borne by the central authority, that there is a dispute with local authorities.  We see such attempts being made every day and, of course, by virtue of the Minister's power, they are made successfully, to put upon local authorities burdens they were never meant to carry.  If only for that reason, it is necessary to see that local inquiries are held in the open, that everything transpiring at or arising out of an inquiry shall be clear and above board and that the findings, or charges, so to speak, of the inspector to the Minister will be open to those who are charged as well as to the Minister himself.  That is really what the amendment is seeking, and that is the aspect of the situation to which the Minister did not address himself.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the House again that this cannot be taken by itself, but must be taken in conjunction with all the other sections and amendments we have been discussing in the five or six days' debate we have had on this Bill. So long as the Minister chooses to ignore the sections and amendments put before the House, and talks about things which have no relation in the world to them, so long will this be not only a long discussion but an unsatisfactory discussion, from the point of view of the future of local government, as well as being a waste of the time of this House.</P>

      <P>What the Minister's speech has clearly revealed is that he completely misunderstands his functions as a Minister, and the functions of local authorities.  Local authorities are elected by the people of their counties or urban areas.  They have certain statutory powers, and those powers are defined.  If a local authority fails deliberately to carry out its statutory obligations, there is another way of dealing with it besides giving the Minister absolute power to dissolve that local authority.  Surely, a local authority, being a democratically elected body, should have the right of an impartial trial as to whether it has or has not failed to carry out its statutory functions?  But there is no impartial trial at the moment.  The late Mr. E.T. Keane, of Kilkenny, once <Col N="1636" /> gave a local authority, addressing the Minister, as using the words of one of the gladiators of ancient Rome: &ldquo;We, who are about to die, salute you.&rdquo; That represents the minds of the members of any local authority when this Minister proposes to have a sworn inquiry into its activities: &ldquo;We, who are about to die, salute you.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to ensure that the local authorities will get justice and fair play.  But the Minister says they are not entitled to justice or fair play; they are responsible to the Minister and to the Minister alone.  He seems to forget that local authorities are elected by the people and have some responsibility to the people who elected them.  If local authorities are responsible to the Minister alone, surely there is no need for local elections? Surely, the Minister should appoint the representatives on the local authorities and then regard them as appointees, just as he did with the Most Rev. Dr. Dignan, formerly chairman of the National Health Insurance Society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am arguing a point which follows logically upon the philosophy expounded by the Minister, that local authorities elected by the people are responsible to the Minister alone.  I am a member of a local authority and I hold I have a definite responsibility to the people who elected me.  Again, the Minister says that there is only one judge as to whether local authorities are discharging their functions or not, and that judge is the Minister.  I consider that a local authority has a right to appeal to the judgment of the people who elected it.  If the Minister feels that a local authority is exceeding its statutory duties or is not carrying out its duties properly, he should not have the same power over that locally elected body as he has over the officials of his Department.  No one will dispute the Minister's right to dispense with the services of one of the officers of his Department or to direct him to do whatever he thinks fit.  No one will dispute that responsibility and that <Col N="1637" /> power, but I think this House must dispute the right of the Minister to deal with locally elected bodies as he deals with ordinary officials of his Department.  He is seeking deliberately, not only in this Bill but in other legislation, to relegate locally-elected representatives to the position of junior officials of his Department, and that cannot be tolerated.</P>
      <P>To show how illogical the position is, the Minister mentioned that he is frequently questioned here in regard to the functions of local authorities, whether or not they have carried out their duties; but the Minister should not only have referred to the questions but to the answers, and he should bear in mind that he, as Minister, has frequently stated in this House that the questions which have been raised should be directed to the local authorities and not to him.  The local authorities should have certain discretionary powers.  I believe they have certain powers of discretion which are outside the control of the Minister.  It is only when they violate their statutory duties and obligations that action should be taken and I hold, and I think the majority of Deputies will hold, that when the Minister has reason to believe that a local authority is failing to carry out its statutory duties, he should refer the matter to some tribunal outside his control.</P>
      <P>We have to consider in this amendment whether we will regard locally elected representatives as people with some sense of responsibility and dignity. If we are to accept the view that, because the Minister is responsible for local government, county councils and county councillors have no responsibility whatever except to obey the Minister, to carry out his instructions in all things, then we ought to dispense with local elections; we ought not to proceed further with the farce of electing representatives on our local authorities.  I believe the mentality of the Minister and the power which he is seeking under this and other legislation are having a very bad and injurious effect on local government.</P>

      <P>This amendment sets out to project, to some extent, local authorities from the Minister, from this tyrannical dictator who regards local councils as junior servants of his Department.  I hold that the amendment is necessary because some protection for local authorities is overdue. Eventually, if this protection is not afforded, we shall have on local authorities not independent men, not men of dignity and self-respect, but men who will simply crawl on to local authorities to be the slaves and servants of the local officials, men who will cringe and fawn at the feet of the local officials to get favours from them in order, by getting these favours, that they may secure election. That is the effect of the Minister's administration and it is the thing we are seeking to remove by this amendment. I think the House ought to have some regard for the rights, the authority as well as the dignity of local bodies and local administration. In seeking to divert attention from this amendment the Minister referred to the election successes of his Party. We are entitled to ask if these election successes were an endorsement of his policy of abolition in regard to local government?  Were they not achieved by threatening the electors with the American Army, and holding out the plea that the Minister and his Government had saved this country from an invasion by the American Army when the American Note was presented to our Government?</P>

A few days ago I put a question to the Minister during the debate on this Bill and he replied that I was the first Deputy who stated that the Minister already had the power that he wanted, but in order to remove all doubts he was now taking the last <Col N="1639" /> item of authority from local authorities.

      <P>No, I am on a different question.  I am trying to argue on the lines on which the Minister argued before you, Sir, were in the Chair, about the fundamental rights of local bodies.  I do not intend to argue what the fundamental rights of Ministers in Great Britain are.  I wish to say a few words about the fundamental rights of Ministers in this country.  I stated that all rights of local bodies had passed away, but that there was a misconceived idea in the minds of some people that they still had certain rights, to one of which the Minister had alluded&mdash; financial rights.  I said that impression had been removed beyond any doubt before the Minister's amendment was introduced and that this Bill did not need such an amendment. The Minister agreed that he had the right already.  In his own words, he has eliminated every possible power in local government.  I pay Deputy Corry the compliment of saying that he was the only Deputy who pointed that out.  I think that Deputy Corry agreed with me that the term &ldquo;local government&rdquo; was non-existent.  I was glad to see that one Deputy agreed with me that the term is a misnomer, and that it was ridiculous to refer to it as &ldquo;local government&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The arguments generally were that local bodies, to put it mildly&mdash;perhaps this would appeal more to the chair&mdash;have very little power.  To my mind, none is left them. Even if there is a shadow of doubt we ought to preserve it.  Deputy Byrne is trying to preserve the rights local <Col N="1641" /> government bodies still have.  I do not think they have any.  Nevertheless, I am prepared to add my voice to that of Deputy Byrne's in order to preserve such powers.  The Minister stated that local bodies have in the last resort an inquiry before being dissolved.  I believe he can dissolve them.  The belief is there that they have some little chance of existing under some formal name, and that the Minister in certain circumstances, if they do not do what he wants, is to hold an inquiry.  The Minister went to great lengths to convince the House that he was primarily and solely responsible for the carrying on of local government, and that he was going to see that they performed the functions for which they were appointed. If they did not do so he would see that they did so, and that one of the ways was to hold a local inquiry.  It would be held by his own nominee and, as Deputy Morrissey stated, without publication of the findings. The Minister stated that that was the proper form of inquiry.  He repeated again that he was absolutely responsible and that he was going to see that his responsibility was upheld. In other words, that he would see, whatever inquiry was held, that it gave a decision with which he agreed. Deputy Byrne tried to retain some right of appeal by local bodies, in which they would have some confidence, such as an inquiry held by a person appointed perhaps by the Chief Justice.  The Minister argued that the Chief Justice was not a fit person to nominate anybody for such an inquiry, and that a nominee appointed by him should appeal to the House.  I suggest that the appointment of a nominee by the Chief Justice would have the confidence of most Deputies.  I cannot see what objection the Minister has to the amendment except the argument that, whatever anybody says, the Minister is convinced that he is going to be the sole arbiter when it comes to making a final decision.  To my mind, the amendment is useless because I am quite convinced that local government, as we know it, is ended.  It is only a farce to be arguing about the terms &ldquo;local government&rdquo; or &ldquo;local authority&rdquo;, because there are no such things.</P>

      <P>I had no idea when I <Col N="1642" /> rose to support Deputy Byrne's amendment that we were going to have such a long discussion about it but I am afraid that is inevitable now.  To my mind, the Minister's reply to the arguments put forward in favour of the amendment is no answer at all.  He treated us first to a dissertation on constitutional law and he emphasised the separation of powers under our Constitution.  He forgot to inform the House that the object of separating the judicial, legislative and executive power under our Constitution was to preserve a system of checks and balances as between these powers, to prevent the Executive encroaching upon either the legislative or judicial power and, of course, to put the judicial power in its proper place. Nobody is questioning that.  Nobody is questioning the right of the Minister to decide issues of this kind.  Nobody is questioning the right of the Minister to come to a decision, even a decision that is not in accordance with the findings of the tribunal.  I do not question that.  I do not question the Minister's ultimate responsibility in all these matters.  All I am challenging&mdash; and I am sure all Deputy Byrne seeks to challenge&mdash;in this amendment is the manner in which the Minister seeks to inform himself of the facts&mdash;an entirely different proposition from challenging the right of the Minister as the Executive Minister responsible to this House for any decision he may reach on these facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position I take up is this: Because of recent legislation in local government, particularly the 1941 Act, we are getting to a position in which local authorities have no functions whatever.  Boiled down, in law, as Deputy Bennett sought to find out a moment ago, a local authority to-day has 22 functions left to it.  Eight of these are under town planning, the rest are trivial functions such as conferring the freedom of the borough on some distinguished stranger, and a few unimportant things like that.  The most important, the sole function to my mind, that a local authority has to-day is to strike the rate and once it strikes the rate the local authority is functus officio.  The detailed administration and expenditure of that money <Col N="1643" /> is handed over to the manager and his staff and you get the position, therefore, that all executive functions are vested in the manager and a few trivial reserved functions are vested in the local authority.  Why, therefore, seeing that the powers of the local authority are trimmed to such an extent, does the Minister seek further powers?  I fail to see a case for the Minister's amendment of Section 44 of the 1941 Act.</P>

He set out by telling us that this amendment of Deputy Byrne's was to his mind unconstitutional and he proceeded there and then to set himself up as the Supreme Court of this country and told us how it was unconstitutional but, to my mind, in the course of his entire speech, he never related his argument to the amendment. The amendment simply asks that, before the Minister comes to a decision as to the removal of a local authority, certain things shall be done &mdash;(1), that a statement of the charges shall be made to the local authority, (2), that a public inquiry shall be set up and that inquiry should be conducted by a person or persons appointed by the Chief Justice&mdash;there is nothing novel in that; that is the normal procedure in other Departments&mdash;and the third is that the report furnished to the Minister should be published.</P>

      <P>I do not want to put the Minister in the position that he should be bound by the findings of any tribunal, whether it is held by an outsider or by an insider.  The final decision is his and it is conceivable that there could be cases where even the Minister could not accept the findings, even on the evidence, of the inspector or any tribunal for reasons of public policy or for any other reasons.  There could conceivably be cases where that could happen.  I do not want to bind the Minister to that extent at all.  All I want to get is this, that the Minister would, in satisfying himself as to the facts, adopt a procedure which is from a legal point of view fairest to all parties, and I think that procedure is one which would ensure that any investigation would be conducted entirely by an independent investigator. But, I will qualify it, as I have said already, that in certain cases it would be essential that that independent investigator should have the assistance of officials or assessors&mdash;&mdash;shall we call them&mdash;from the Minister's Department.  I do not see that there is anything contrary to principle or public policy in that, and if a system of that kind were evolved it would be the fairest system of all.  The Minister's decision is his decision.  He has the personal responsibility to the House, and the Government have the collective responsibility for his decision. We are not questioning that. All we are challenging in this is the method by which the Minister enables himself to come to that decision, and we are suggesting to him that the fairest way is some form of public inquiry which would be conducted by impartial investigators, fully qualified in law or in technical matters, if it is a technical inquiry, and, then, that <Col N="1646" /> when that inspector makes his report, the report will be published.</P>
      <P>I am not asking the Minister to accept the report.  But I would go so far as to suggest that, when he gives his decision, whether it is in accordance with the findings of the tribunal or the inspector, or whether it is not in accordance with the findings, his decision on the report should be published. In a case where his decision is not in accordance with the findings of the tribunal or the inspector, he will, I am sure, be able to give very solid reasons why he saw fit to depart from those findings.  In other words, I am advocating that the most open methods should be adopted in investigating matters of this kind.  After all, the duties of a public body do not involve any great matters of confidence. As I have said, they have certain limited statutory functions to perform to-day.  Very few of them amount to anything, except the one they exercise annually of striking the rate.  What is there to be afraid of in a matter of that kind in making the matter as public and as open as possible?  On the other hand, it may be a matter affecting a responsible official or a subordinate official.  Again, I see no reason, unless matters of public policy dictate otherwise, why all matters connected with that investigation should not be as open as possible, as open as the hearings and the findings of a court of justice are to-day.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that the inspector's report is a confidential document, and that, to a certain extent, he would be exposing the particular inspector who conducted the investigation if he were to publish his report.  That cuts both ways.  There are cases where it might be hard on the particular individual if his report were published.  There are other cases where it would be entirely in favour of the particular inspector if his report were published.  In the case where it might be undesirable to publish the report, where he might leave himself open, perhaps, to an action at law, the Minister should have sufficient power in his Department to protect that individual against the consequences of any legal action which might arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go much further on <Col N="1647" /> the matter except to say that the whole tendency is to treat local authorities as if they were recalcitrant and, if not recalcitrant, as if they were criminally inclined or evilly disposed towards the Minister, or people not fully conscious of their public duties.  I think it would be a far better system if the public authorities were left to the electorate. There is an election every three years and, if public authorities are failing in their functions, the electors will quickly deal with that matter.</P>

      <P>No, Sir.  I must protest. There is some limit to the extent to which misrepresentation can go in this Dáil.  I said that a Local Government Act was passed in 1941 and that the action of the Government and the Oireachtas in passing that Act had been endorsed at two general elections. That is the extent to which I went.</P>

      <P>The 1944 election certainly was not fought on the Local Government Act of 1941.  I do not think the 1943 election was fought on it either.  I do not want to go into these extraneous matters.  I want to get back to the Minister's argument. His argument is that this amendment is unconstitutional.  I am trying to explain that it is not unconstitutional, that all it seeks to do is to give the Minister an independent way of ascertaining the facts in any given case he may wish inquired into.  The Minister says that he cannot accept that, because that would be handing himself over to outsiders.  I say that it is far worse if he places himself in the hands of insiders, because the local authority and the public are in the position that they feel the matter has been prejudged, that a subordinate of the Minister's is specially selected for the job, that perhaps the man most likely to coincide with the Minister's views on a particular problem will be selected.  There is that suspicion abroad and it would remove all that atmosphere of doubt and suspicion if <Col N="1648" /> the Minister would take upon himself to appoint properly qualified people to conduct inquiries.</P>
      <P>As I have said, I would condition that by allowing, say, the chairman of the tribunal to have officials of the Minister's Department to act as assessors.  But I cannot see where the unconstitutionality lies in seeking to do that.  We are not challenging the Minister's right to give his decision. I am not challenging his right to give a decision in conflict with the findings of the tribunal.  I think he is perfectly entitled to do that, if he so thinks fit.</P>

      <P>This amendment is a very fair one.  Does the Minister want to scrap and take away any power left to local authorities?  The majority of Deputies are members of a county council or urban council.  The Minister told us here when the local elections were coming on that local authorities had certain powers.  He went to the country on that, and the people elected the local authorities.  As Deputy Coogan has said, the only power a local authority has is in connection with the striking of the rate.  After that, they have no power.  The county manager exercises executive functions.  If the Minister wants to take away all the powers of local authorities, would it not be better and be a saving to the ratepayers for him to dissolve every county council and every urban council?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion standing in my name and that of Deputy Alfred Byrne:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a Select Committee of the Dáil be appointed to consider and report upon the extent to which the growing practice of legislation by Order, without the prior approval of the Oireachtas, is inconsistent with the powers which the Oireachtas should exercise under the principle of democratic government as enshrined in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Now that the major problems arising out of the war have eased considerably, it is about time the situation should be reviewed and examined, with a view to ending a form of bureaucracy which, if allowed to continue, will negative any rights this Assembly can claim under the Constitution.  Not only that, but it will negative many Acts passed by Dáil Eireann itself.  I have a feeling that the Taoiseach should be the last person in this community or in this House to resist a motion which is put down in good faith to implement all that is enshrined in our Constitution.</P>
      <P>We have the position created now that Orders are issued from time to time tending to negative Acts passed by this Dáil.  The casual reader of the newspapers, not to mention the student of politics or of political economy, must have observed this growing practice, which began here at the time of the emergency and has been continued ever since.  If legislation by Order continues at its present rate, I envisage that there would be no necessity for this Dáil to meet at all.  I had a good deal of data to submit to the House, but I was called on quite unawares this morning and told this motion was to be moved to-night.  I take that as part of the fortunes of war and am quite satisfied that everything is in order, but I was taken off my guard to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a story which will illustrate <Col N="1652" /> my point, the story of a very high Treasury official and a Chancellor of the Exchequer in a neighbouring Parliament. After a very busy session, this high official is reported to have said to his Minister: &ldquo;Why all this palaver?  What is the good of the House of Commons and how perfectly useless is the House of Lords?  Why should the work of the expert be always at the mercy of the ignorant amateur?  Why should people be allowed to govern themselves, when it is manifestly so much better for them to be governed by those who know how to govern?&rdquo; Those who know how to govern, in the case mentioned, were the civil servants, similar to the bureaucracy that has grown up in our own country.</P>
    <P>This story is told, by the way, by a former Chancellor, a man very high in the State in Great Britain, in one of his books.  To continue it, the official asks: &ldquo;Could not this country be governed by the Civil Service?&rdquo;&ldquo;Undoubtedly it could,&rdquo; replied the Chancellor of the Exchequer, &ldquo;and I am quite sure that you and your colleagues would govern the country very well; but let me tell you this, my young friend, at the end of six months of it there would not be enough lamp-posts in Whitehall to go round&rdquo;.  I am sure none of us would like to see the Taoiseach or any of his Ministers hanging from lamp-posts. Much as we may differ with them on many points, we would not like to see them meet that fate.  That little story illustrates what is happening in this country&mdash;Government by Order, Orders A.B., Orders C.D., and so on.  In my view, it is the negation of democratic government and I am hopeful that the Government may find some way out of the difficulty.  Without doubt, this has been the cause of a good deal of uneasiness in all enlightened communities that I know of in our own country. The story I have told has its humorous side, but I have the feeling that, unless steps are taken, and taken very soon, to end this undesirable and undemocratic development, people will begin to lose confidence, not alone in the institutions of the State but in themselves.</P>
    <P>I have heard members in this <Col N="1653" /> Assembly say they were proud of being politicians.  In this country, because of the attitude of certain people the politician was looked upon with suspicion, as if he should be in the dock instead of in the Dáil.  Now, I am proud of being a politician, very proud of it, and I think that if one of the steps I am suggesting were taken, it would tend to revive a decent spirit in the country.  People are beginning to say, just as I quoted a civil servant a moment ago, &ldquo;why all this palaver?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is sometimes asked &ldquo;What is the use of the Dáil, because the Fianna Fáil Party as a government will steam-roll anything through?&rdquo; I have always felt, and I think the Taoiseach will agree with me&mdash;I heard him say something similar himself&mdash;that he welcomed a decent and healthy Opposition. I am sure I translated him perfectly and I may say I admired his sentiments on those occasions&mdash;at least half a dozen occasions.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach might well ask, how do I propose that this thing should be done?  I may say I have carefully avoided the use of the word &ldquo;emergency&rdquo;. I am talking of Orders in general.  I throw out a suggestion, which may be amplified by some other speakers, added to or amended, but so long as I keep along the line of the principle of democracy and democratic government, I will be quite satisfied. I have a feeling that it would be advisable if, before issuing these Orders, they were submitted to a body such as the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. If an objection can be made, or is made, to that body being consulted on the grounds that it is difficult to get the members together, that perhaps an Order would require to be issued instanter, then I would suggest as an alternative that you could have a local committee consisting of members of all Parties resident within a couple of miles radius of Dublin city.</P>
    <P>I am sure nobody in Cork would object to that and nobody in Tipperary or Donegal would object to it, because I believe there is a necessity for referring such matters to a committee.  No matter what confidence we might have in the probity of the Taoiseach or his Ministers, there is still, in my view, <Col N="1654" /> such a necessity, especially where Orders are issued with little or no notice to the community in general. There is an urgent necessity for having the views of other persons in the community besides the Taoiseach or his officials.</P>
    <P>There is a growing feeling that too much is done in this country by way of Orders A and B and Orders C and D, and so on.  I submit this motion in the hope that the Taoiseach or his Ministers may have some alternative proposals to put up, or they may want to amend or amplify anything I have said. When Deputy Byrne and I put down this motion, I had no other object in view beyond this: to preserve the inherent rights that we are supposed to possess under the Constitution and, if we flout or in any way ignore those rights, and are steam-rolled into a position where these rights are denied us, it would have a very bad effect up and down the country.</P>
    <P>I stand four-square for the maintenance of law and order, but you have people outside who have done their very best to undermine the institutions of this State and when these people tell you that most of your work is done in Dublin by Order this and Order that, I have at all times refuted that allegation, though sometimes, by the way, I felt that I was doing so with my tongue in my cheek, as it were. I had the feeling on these occasions that a time of emergency did exist, and there might be cogent reasons present to some extent now, but not to the same extent, surely.</P>
    <P>As to Orders generally&mdash;I am not talking of Emergency Orders in particular, but of any kind of Order issued in the way these Orders have been issued, issued overnight without any notice being given to the House which, after all, should have some say and some control over legislation&mdash;every Order issued has the power of an Act of Parliament.  Every Order has behind it the full force that can be given it by a Government and its instruments and, because of that, and because you are taking the power which we have enshrined in our Constitution out of the hands of the elected representatives of the people, <Col N="1655" /> I and Deputy Byrne have put down this motion in the hope that it will be accepted in the spirit in which it has been submitted; that is to say, in order to preserve the spirit and the words of the Constitution and in order to discourage many of those people who tend to lessen and to deprecate the efforts of a constitutional Government.</P>
    <P>We have a free Government here, elected by a free people with, in so far as it relates to the electorate, undoubtedly one of the freest electorates in the world.  Because of all that, I take a certain pride in the institutions of the State.  Whether people be in the Government or are budding successors, it is immaterial to me.  All are elected by the people of the country and I owe them the allegiance that is due to them.  For reasons which, I think, should appeal to the Taoiseach, as they should appeal to any Ministers with a sense of responsibility to the nation, I suggest that he and his Ministers should carefully examine the position, which I and others want to see rectified and which, in very few words, is outlined in the motion.  I confidently put the motion before the House for adoption.</P>

      <P>I find myself pretty well in complete agreement, not merely with the terms of this motion, or rather with the principle which is the foundation of the motion, but also with the reasons advanced by Deputy Anthony in support of his motion.  I thought I detected a note of apology in Deputy Anthony's speech when he was moving this motion.  He stated that he was putting it down in the belief that his action in so doing was intended to ensure and maintain the rights of Parliamentary institutions and the principle of responsible government, and he hoped that the motion would be accepted in the spirit in which he moved it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No apology is needed for a motion of this kind.  This motion embodies one of the most fundamental principles that <Col N="1656" /> any parliament in present conditions could debate and consider.  There has been an undoubted tendency, not merely in this Parliament, but in other parliaments where responsible government obtains, to derogate from the powers of the representatives of the people and shift the centre of gravity of the constitutional structure away from parliamentary institutions to that of the executive.  We have more or less adopted in the Constitutions that we have had in this country, both the Constitution of 1922 and the subsequent Constitution under which this State now functions, the principle of responsible government and democratic institutions.  That principle means that the Government of the day is responsible to the legislature nominated by the people, but in practice nothing but lip-service is given to the principles of democratic government which are, to use the words in this motion, enshrined in the Constitution. For one day every four or five years, the people of this country who have votes are supposed to be endowed with all political wisdom.  On the day when a general election is held the people make their choice.  It is stated that the people are the masters and that whatever they do must be right. Once the close of the poll comes, and Deputies are elected to this House, the people as masters of this House or as masters of administrative legislation, cease to be a reality.</P>
    <P>During the first 12 years in the history of this State, according to a book compiled by two very learned authors, about 3,000 Orders such as are referred to in the motion were made by the Government or by Ministers, in accordance with provisions contained in statutes of the Oireachtas. From 1922 to 1933 over 3,000 statutory Orders were made.  That number did not include a vast number of other Orders of an administrative character, which, possibly, would not come within the definition or description of statutory rules or statutory Orders.  It would be no exaggeration to say that, from the beginning of 1934 until the end of 1945, leaving aside the multiplicity of Orders passed under the Emergency Powers Acts, at least double the number passed between 1922 <Col N="1657" /> and December, 1933, were enacted in accordance with statutory provisions of this House.  This problem has faced the British Legislature.  It is a problem that has been commented upon and a practice that has been adversely criticised by some of the highest judicial personages in the courts in England&mdash;in the Court of Appeal in the House of Lords.</P>
    <P>I want it to be quite clear that there must be some statutory rules or some provisions by which details of legislation must be worked out by Departments. The question is where is the line to be drawn and what is the control to be?  That problem faces us here in an increasing and very urgent form.  I am glad to say that its urgency has been recognised, at last, by people outside.  We have been drawing attention to this tendency for years and were regarded as speaking merely as politicians.  The Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Mulcahy, drew attention to it in his speech at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis a short time ago.  It is noteworthy that, following upon that speech, the President of the Federation of Irish Industries stated in, perhaps, more picturesque language, the very same thing as Deputy Mulcahy stated at the Ard Fheis, and to-day, I noticed by the evening papers, the President of the Chamber of Commerce has again drawn attention to the situation. One of the methods by which democratic rule can be overthrown is the method by which a system is brought into operation without the people being aware of it.  It is, I am glad to say, abundantly apparent now that the people are beginning to be aware of the methods of the last few years by which their rights and liberties are being threatened by a system of rules and Orders.  At present, a man's property may be taken away lawfully under Orders made under statutes of this House without any appeal to the courts.  A man's liberty may be taken away from him by Ministerial Order without any appeal to the courts.</P>
    <P>Side by side with this tendency to encroach upon the functions of the Legislature is the tendency to encroach upon, and to take away, the functions of the judiciary.  In legislation of this <Col N="1658" /> House provision has been made again and again&mdash;repeated to an increasing degree&mdash;whereby Ministers and the Government may make Orders dealing with a vast variety of matters which may affect the liberty, the rights and the property of individuals, while no appeal to the courts is permitted from any such Orders.</P>
    <P>We must have regard, in considering a motion of this kind, not merely to what Deputy Anthony mentioned, the encroachment upon legislative authority and the functions of this House, but, as a necessary corollary, encroachment on the functions of the judiciary.  Both these encroachments are symptomatic of the tendency towards despotism and despotic control. They are the usual methods by which the Legislature is deprived of its power.  The balance of power between the Executive and the judiciary is taken away and vested in the Executive. These are the usual methods adopted.  Deputy Anthony, in his speech, referred to bureaucracy.  I think it necessary to issue a note of warning on the use of the word &ldquo;bureaucracy&rdquo;.  The tendency is to blame civil servants.  The tendency is to say that civil servants, for motives of their own, are persuading the Government and Ministers to sponsor legislation in this House which would vest in Government Departments and, in particular, in civil servants unrestricted and unfettered powers; that that is done by civil servants or by particular individuals, in order that power which should be vested either in the Legislature, in the Executive or in the judiciary should in reality be vested in them.  It is a mistake to say that the tendency which I speak against is a tendency which has been fathered by civil servants.  It is Government policy, and the Government must take responsibility for that policy.  It is Government policy that brings about legislation which vests in civil servants the dictatorial powers of which we complain and to which the public are, at last, beginning to awake. I protest against the effort to blame civil servants.  I want to put the responsibility where it belongs.  It belongs to the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is not a tendency <Col N="1659" /> limited to the present Government, or the Party from which it is formed.  It is the usual method of despotism to control power, to filch it from the people and the judiciary, and to put it in possession of the Executive.  With the permission of the Chair, I shall refer to a passage on page 298 of a recent book which meets my point.  It is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not, as some suppose, an overweening Executive which establishes despotism; it is the philosophy of despotism which forges executive power into a weapon for the attainment of its ends.  &lsquo;And such an instrument I was to use,&rsquo; quoth the tyrant.  It is not exactly the kind of philosophy which, aided by the temporary exigencies of war, to-day defends and encourages wholesale extensions of executive might, at whatever cost to the authority of the executive and the judiciary, on the pretext that this is the only way to that &lsquo;efficient government&rsquo; which, we are told, is the highest social good.  It is a philosophy which is not peculiar to any political party.  It comes both from the Right and the Left.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I repeat:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is not, as some suppose, an overweening Executive which establishes despotism; it is the philosophy of despotism which forges executive power into a weapon for the attainment of its ends.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The philosophy of despotism&mdash;the policy of despotism&mdash;the policy which brings about the situation in which we find ourselves to-day where this country is governed, not by the laws passed by this House, but really by the Orders made by Government Departments and Ministers.  It will, of course, be stated that the source and authority of those Orders are the Acts of the Oireachtas.  Of course, they are.  It is that which gives them the façade of democratic appearance, <Col N="1660" /> and in these Acts of the Oireachtas authorising Ministers or the Government to make these statutory Orders there is that provision with which we are all familiar, that the Regulation shall be laid upon the Table of the House and, if within 21 days from the making of the Orders the Dáil or the Seanad, or both, pass a resolution annulling those Orders or Regulations, they have no effect.  Again, that is merely a facade, a pretence &mdash; a pretence that democracy and the rights of the Legislature are being preserved. Such a provision is purely illusory.  In the first place, that provision which has now become standard makes no provision for amendment of those Regulations.  They must be taken as a whole or not at all.  There is a very limited period of time within which those regulations can be examined by this House and annulled.  There is no provision that Government time is to be given for any such Orders.</P>

The Taoiseach asks: Has it ever been denied? I do not know whether it has or not, but I do know this: that the time has expired for the hearing of such a motion in reference to such an Order. Within the last two years a motion was down on the Paper annulling a certain Order and the time expired before that motion was heard.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach can take it that what I state is accurate. What I want to point out is that under the present system it would not be possible for any ordinary Deputy, it would not be possible even for a Party, with the usual Party organisation that is at the disposal of a Party in opposition, to have all these Orders properly examined with a view to seeing whether they encroach upon the rights or liberty of the people or their property.  It would not be possible to have these Orders examined in the 21 days and it would not be possible to have them properly debated in this House, even if the Government did, out of their bounty, give time from Government business to discuss these measures.  It is merely because there are so few of these Orders brought before this House, for the reasons I have stated, that it is possible from time to time for the Government, out of their bounty&mdash;again I emphasise&mdash;to give such Government time as will enable those Orders to be considered.  It is only practicable for any ordinary Deputy to take some of the more fundamental principles embodied in an Order which he happens to see and bring it to the attention of the House and through the House to the country. There are thousands of Orders that have been made.  Many of them are impossible to get; some of them are not even printed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Private Members' time is restricted on a motion of this kind to a very short space.  Private Deputies have only a very restricted time to speak.  This is a very important motion.  It is a motion of fundamental importance to the people of this country because we do assert&mdash;and we will prove it to the people, and we hope to get a mandate from them very soon to alter the Government policy on this&mdash;that they have shifted the balance of power from the Legislature to the Executive, and that is the way of despotism the world over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It requires no examples from me to bring that to the recognition of the House or of the people.  It is not what I say.  It will be stated, as it was stated some few years ago, when we were pointing out the road on which the Government was going, that we were speaking merely as politicians in opposition and that we were not being constructive.  Our efforts have at last been rewarded.  It cannot be said that the President of the Federation of Irish Industries is a supporter of the Fine Gael Party.  Anything I have said here to-night is mild compared with what that gentleman said&mdash;his comments upon the methods of Government in connection with Orders.  The mild speech made by Mr. Brock, the <Col N="1664" /> President of the Chamber of Commerce, to-day protesting against this thing is even stronger than what I have endeavoured to say to-night.</P>
    <P>I was, when I was interrupted, pointing out that the provision in the statutes purporting to give control to this Legislature of the Government's actions in reference to Ministerial Orders is merely illusory.  It is no safeguard at all and, in any event, under what the Taoiseach himself asked the people for at the last election and what he got from them&mdash;a strong Government, an over-all majority&mdash;what good is it?  The Government Party majority is used on every occasion when an effort has been made to protest against the infringements in the spirit, if not the letter, of the Constitution and principles which we are supposed to enjoy, by some of these statutory rules and Orders.  Party majority has been used to crush any such opposition and to stifle effective criticism.  That is the way of despots.  It is always done in that way, for the very good reason that was given at the last general election by the Taoiseach when he asked the people to give him an over-all majority so that he might have a strong Government.  &ldquo;Government must be strong or it is naught! &rdquo; Again I quote from that learned author. &ldquo;Government must be efficient or it is a sham! Government must get things done or it is dead!&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of the least violent and the most intelligent of European dictators declares: &ldquo;No good seems to me to be as important for a nation as the stability of an efficient Government.&rdquo; The basis of all despotic government is that demand made by the Taoiseach at the last election for an over-all majority and a strong Government in order that that over-all majority and strong Government might stifle opposition in the deliberative Assembly of the nation.</P>
    <P>So far as I can recollect, there has been only one instance in which any constructive proposal was put up by me, certainly&mdash;and I am perhaps under the illusion that I put up many&mdash;which has been even considered by the <Col N="1665" /> Government, and that was within the last few weeks, when the Minister for Lands did what should be done in a deliberative assembly, recognised that the Opposition had adopted a proper rôle, that they were performing the functions which they were sent by the people whom they represented to fulfil, namely, to oppose where opposition is necessary in principle, and to support anything the Government bring forward which they believe to be good. We believe that the Land Bill recently introduced had embodied in it a proper principle, and we supported it.  But we strongly objected to the machinery embodied in that Bill to give practical effect to the principle we supported. The Minister for Lands recognised that situation and called an all-Party conference to consider the matter.  That was so exceptional as to call for editorial comment.  It is exceptional in this House.  It underlines and emphasises the point which I wish to make.</P>
    <P>We are fast becoming in this Dáil, not a deliberative Assembly, but a machine merely for registering Government decisions.  These decisions are registered in several ways.  They are registered in the Bills which we are asked to pass in this House.  They are registered, and they become law through the machinery of the over-all Party majority and of the strong Government that the Taoiseach asked for and got at the last election.  They are registered by means of these Government Orders and decrees, which find their source and authority in the legislation passed through this House by the strong Government and the over-all majority.  They are registered by means of the policy of the Government which requires a strong Government and an over-all majority, not merely in this House, but in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The principle on which the Seanad was reconstructed was that it should be a reflex of whatever Party happens to have for the time being a majority in this House.  So that you have the whole thing coming full circle.  Government policy requires a strong Government, requires an over-all majority, so that the decrees of the Government may be given effect to irrespective of <Col N="1666" /> the Opposition, and may be given effect to in the Seanad also by means of a majority in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>We may be told that the source of these Orders is the will of the people as expressed in this Assembly.  The will of the people has to be considered not merely in relation to that section of the people which is represented by the over-all majority in this House, but also by the views put forward by the Opposition Deputies who represent a substantial section of the community. If we are to be a deliberative Assembly, there should be less talk of a strong Government and an over-all majority.</P>
    <P>During the last election I endeavoured, in the speeches I made in the course of the campaign, to bring home to the people that this demand for a strong Government was, in effect, a demand for a strong dictatorship. Of course, I was talking as a politician. It is becoming apparent now that I was talking the truth, and the truth can be found by a perusal&mdash;if you can find them&mdash;of the thousands of Orders issued in the last few years.  I am talking as a politician to-night, it will be said.  But I am talking, whether I am telling the truth or not, in the words of the Taoiseach, from what is my fundamental political faith for which I stand, whether I am in Opposition or not.  Principles, whether enshrined in the Constitution or legislation, so that they will not be mere pretence or pious aspirations, such as we find in one part of the Constitution, should find their way into practical effect and be the guiding force of Government policy.</P>
    <P>As the culmination of this policy, we have been considering two Bills in the last few months&mdash;the Local Government Bill, which is still going through Committee in this House, and the Public Health Bill, which has passed Second Reading and is going into Committee Stage.  Literally, it would be no exaggeration to say that, if both these Bills become law, this country will be inundated with Statutory Rules, Orders, Regulations, and by-laws affecting the life, liberties and property of the people.  Rules and Orders of the Minister under the Local Government Bill, which is going through <Col N="1667" /> the Dáil at present, if it is passed into law, will affect the rights of the people to exercise their liberties in local affairs through their local councils.</P>
    <P>That Bill will take away from the representatives in the local authorities the last vestige of power left to them. One of the Ministers in a recent speech adumbrated a managerial system for the State.  What is that but a dictatorship? The Public Health Bill, if it becomes law in the form in which it came before the House on Second Reading, will give rise to thousands of Orders which will affect the liberties and the personal rights and the dignity of the human person.</P>
    <P>Deputy Anthony said he had prepared a vast quantity of material and I regret he was unable from his point of view, which is one of sanity and sincerity, to bring these matters before the House.  I am accustomed to be told when I speak in this House that I speak in an exaggerated form and as a politician and, perhaps, as a lawyer.  Deputy Anthony speaks here in accents of sincerity as a plain man. He recommended the motion for the acceptance of the Taoiseach.  Nothing would surprise me more than for the Taoiseach to accept the motion in the spirit in which it was made by Deputy Anthony.  It would be a fundamental reversal of Government policy for this Government to say to Deputy Anthony: &ldquo;We have these Acts which are carried into effect, not by what appears on the statute book itself, but by what may appear in the flood of orders, regulations and rules emanating from Government Departments, but we will let the people henceforth see what is going to be done and the policy will be clear on the face of the Bills.  The fundamental principles will be debated in this House and there will be an opportunity for the people's representatives to express their views on these matters.&rdquo;  It would certainly be a surprise to me if the Taoiseach did accept this motion and did show a reversal of Government policy in this matter, but it would at least be some consolation to know that the Taoiseach had at last seen the writing on the wall.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that to-day democracy is in greater danger from its friends or alleged friends than from its open enemies.  We have, during recent years, seen the growth of a strange type of democracy in many countries, the growth of a type of government which claims to be democratic in every sense and meaning of the word, but which in actual effect is contrary to every established principle of democracy, for what is democracy but government of the people by the people?  The only effective means by which people can govern themselves is through democratically elected representatives. It is quite possible for a Minister, in assuming totalitarian powers, to say that he is elected by the people under the Constitution as was stated here in this House to-day.  I might have misunderstood what the Minister said but at least the Minister quoted the Article of the Constitution which makes the Minister responsible for his Department and, basing his case upon that responsibility, the Minister asserted that he has a right to do anything in order to fulfil that responsibility.  There are definite limits beyond which an Executive should not be allowed to go and the question is where is the line to be drawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will acknowledge that, in modern government, administration is becoming much more complex than it was 20, 30 or 40 years ago.  Governments all over the world are assuming wider powers in industry, in commerce, and in practically every human activity than was deemed necessary or desirable prior to the first Great World War, but that in itself is not a justification for ousting completely the power of Parliament.  It is possible for an Executive Government to say that it is democratic simply because it is elected by the people.  It would be possible for a dictator, if he secured a majority vote of the people at an election, to say: &ldquo;I have been elected by the majority of the people so I can do anything I think fit; therefore I am governing democratically,&rdquo; but the essence of democracy is that the various conflicting or different policies, interests and Parties should obtain representation in one Parliament and, having <Col N="1669" /> secured that representation, each group or individual Deputy should be free to take a full share in moulding the laws of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

      <P>Are they not free here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The essence of this motion is to assert that that power of individual Deputies and independent Deputies is being restricted by reason of the fact that it is now the established custom to delegate to Ministers or to the Government the power of legislating by Order.  When this Parliament by a majority delegates to an executive Government the power of legislating by Order, it deprives the independent Deputy and independent Parties of the right that they ought to have in moulding the laws of the State.  Statutory Rules and Orders are laid on the Table of the House and can be annulled within a certain period but, as Deputy Costello pointed out, they cannot be amended and that is a very grave and important consideration, because while a Statutory Order might be perhaps good and desirable, it might have one objectionable feature, and the only power left to this House in regard to that Order would be to wipe it out completely whereas, in regard to ordinary legislation, we have the power to deal with any Bill introduced section by section and word by word, and amend it wherever we think fit. Some Bills introduced may have quite a number of very good features and, on the other hand, a number of very objectionable features, but it is in the power and the right of this House to seek to mould that Bill in the right way.  It is in the power of each Deputy to put down an amendment in regard to any section or phrase in the Bill.  No such power exists in regard to Statutory Rules and Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another very important consideration, and it is this: it is no defence for a citizen to go into court and claim ignorance of the law.  I ask the Taoiseach how could any citizen of the State know all the laws that have been passed through this House?  That would be difficult enough but, in addition <Col N="1670" /> to knowing every law passed through the House, he is expected to know every emergency Order that has been made by Ministers.  As Deputy Costello pointed out, even the highest legal authorities are unable to keep track of the Orders and amending Orders that are made.</P>
    <P>I quite readily concede that there is a difficult problem to be faced here. Government is more complex than it was in the past.  There is more interference rightly or wrongly with all aspects of life than there was years ago.  It is necessary for all Parties  the House to face up to that and to try to evolve some means by which  will be possible to ensure that every piece of legislation required can be dealt with in this House because I believe it is impossible to find an alternative for a democratic assembly such as this.  There is no alternative to democracy.  Alternatives have been tried in other countries and we know, and I think we all recognise, the evils of them.  We have got to strengthen democracy in this country.  We have got to make a legislative assembly such as this more efficient in grappling with the conditions of modern administration and legislation.  If the Taoiseach would say &ldquo;I am prepared to set up a commission of inquiry to deal with this problem&rdquo;, he would be making a reasonable approach to the question, but if he is going to turn down this motion directly and say &ldquo;I consider that Ministers, in present day circumstances, should have the right to legislate when they think fit&rdquo;, he is doing a fundamental injury to democratic government in this State.</P>
    <P>By way of suggestion, though I do not think he considered it very carefully, Deputy Anthony said that a committee of this House could be set up, consisting of Deputies residing within a short distance of the city, to deal with matters requiring speedy attention. I do not think that would be a feasible or a desirable proposition.</P>

      <P>It would, perhaps, be better than having power delegated to <Col N="1671" /> Ministers and their Departments, but it would have very many undesirable aspects.  I have never accepted the view that this city or its immediate vicinity is in any way typical or representative of the Irish nation.  As a matter of fact, it is very unrepresentative of the Irish nation.  The Deputies who put down this motion have done a very useful service and the Taoiseach would be well advised to meet the motion in a reasonable way.</P>

      <P>I was disappointed when I heard Deputy Costello's approach to this motion.  Seeing that it touches an aspect of government in modern times, I thought that from him we should have heard something to give us food for thought.  I regret he has given us an exposition of the tactics one might adopt with a more or less illiterate jury, instead of presenting the case as if it were sought to convince a judge.  It is regrettable that the Deputy who, perhaps, of all the people amongst the Opposition, should be most qualified to address himself to this subject, should have given forth such vague charges without specific references, without chapter or verse, except to quote a commonly published book, for which no particular authority, beyond the fact that it was written by a barister or a university professor, could be claimed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say it is regrettable, because at the root of this motion there is a problem of government not only for the moment, but from the time man first organised himself into anything more than a family.  It is the problem of keeping a democratic form of government and, at the same time, having effective and ordered government.  At the outset, then, in addressing ourselves to this motion, we have to consider certain facts of existence, affecting human society.  One of them is the fact that you cannot deal with human society, the State and the social conditions therein, as a static thing, as a thing set for all time, as something you can dissect and then, taking a section, deal with it analytically, as you might in a laboratory. You are dealing here with the progress of human life, with things that are <Col N="1672" /> changing from day to day, evolving with the development of society.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in treating this problem, we must realise that human society does change, that the complexities of modern life are greater than those of life 50 years ago, which in its turn was more complex than life 100 years before that.  In other words, as we progress with what is called civilisation, we come to a higher degree of organisation of the community in which there are so many varied factors and varied groups, with changing conditions and communications, that the problem of governing that group changes as the group develops.</P>
    <P>Now, if we regard this problem specifically, we find that where you have, say, a primitive agricultural community, it is an easy thing to legislate, practically in detail, for all the necessities of that group.  A primitive agricultural tribe can legislate, in the tribal assembly, almost in detail for the group.  Nearly every question affecting that community can be decided by the community in a common parliament, because there are no very differing interests.  Take, however, a modern city: there you have very many complex modern elements, and you cannot call them all in to legislate. If you go beyond a city and take any country as a whole, the problem confronting the body which has to make laws to govern that community are so numerous and so varied, and it is so necessary to provide for the details, that you cannot possibly deal with them through one body in committee. In general, that is the problem with which we are faced.</P>
    <P>The question, therefore, arises as to whether you should attempt to deal with them at all, or whether you should deal only with the principles.  If you do not deal with the problems effectively, things will get into a chaotic state.  On that account, we have to decide that these problems must be dealt with specifically by providing legislation.  We could have another simile to guide us by taking the example of a business firm.  In the case of a big, complex business, with branches in various towns and counties, no one would suggest that one manager, with his assistants, in <Col N="1673" /> one central place, could deal with all the ramifications of that business in every detail.  He must have branch offices, and has to delegate some of his powers, duties and responsibilities, to those branch offices, so that he may have effective control.  If he tries to do everything himself, he will wind up by doing nothing and losing control.</P>
    <P>In the same way, in regard to this House and the Government of this State&mdash;and the same applies to any democratic Parliament &mdash; we cannot possibly deal in detail with all the problems and all the administrative odds and ends.  We cannot legislate for every possibility; we have not the time to do so, nor could we get through it in the time.  Even if we could, it would be impossible to change from one facet of the case to another, and we would end up by failing to deal with the problems at all. For that reason, I submit that it is absolutely essential, in the first instance, to have delegated legislation. Now, I am stating nothing new in that. It is a conclusion which all the authorities who have studied the matter have been forced to&mdash;that delegated legislation is a necessity. The question is as to the way it is to be applied.  However, before I come to that, another thought strikes me in connection with the question of parliamentary control.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello has been at some trouble to point out the dangers under this system to what he calls democratic institutions.  He has spoken about the effectiveness of Parliament, but Parliament can be effective only if it addresses itself to reality.  It can be effective only if it keeps the real control and delegates the details in such a way that it can, at all times, control the principle.  That, in fact, is the basic idea underlying the system which has grown up here, in England and elsewhere over a number of years. You must try to secure that Parliament decide the main principles of all legislation and leave the details to be worked out elsewhere.  In that way, there is a chance of keeping control. As I said, this system is not new.  The roots of delegated authority of this sort go very far back.  They had their <Col N="1674" /> origin in the necessity for dealing with problems of government, and they are quite a common feature of our law.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, the subject was examined by a committee known as the Donoughmore Committee.  It furnished a report on the subject, which was presented to Parliament in 1932. The copy I have is dated 1936.  That report dealt exhaustively with the question of delegating power for legislating by Order to Ministers and with similar subjects.  It stated, at the outset, that there were definite advantages in the system of legislation by Order, when certain safeguards were provided, but it went further and stated that this system was absolutely inevitable.  The members of the committee pointed out that the complexities of modern life were such that you could not deal with the problems of government effectively unless you delegated powers to the Executive. They summarised their reasons in favour of delegating those powers under two heads.  In the first place, they pointed out that the pressure on Parliamentary time would be so great that to attempt to deal with all the problems which required legislation for their solution would mean that many of these problems would have to remain unsolved.  In the second place, they pointed out that, owing to the multifarious matters involved and their technicality, it would not be a practical proposition to deal with them in Parliament.  The word &ldquo;technicality&rdquo; is not used exclusively in the engineering or scientific sense.  It includes technicalities of administration, law and similar subjects and it would not be feasible to consider these matters in the ordinary parliamentary way.</P>
    <P>Another very cogent reason was concerned with unforeseen contingencies &mdash;the impossibility of legislating in a Bill for all contingencies likely to arise.  For the sake of effective implementation, it might be necessary to delegate powers to Ministers under a particular Act.  In other words, in order to ensure that the law passed by Parliament, embodying the intention of Parliament, be made effective, it was necessary to delegate powers to Ministers.  Let me stress that point <Col N="1675" /> because, to those who speak of parliamentary democracy and the necessity for parliamentary control, it is important. In order that the will of Parliament may be effective and that democracy, as given effect by representative government, be a reality&mdash;in order to secure that, it is necessary to delegate powers to the executive to provide the required details of the law.  That is necessary if the intention of Parliament is not to be reduced to a nullity. That is very important&mdash;that it is actually necessary for the support of our democratic institutions to delegate powers to the executive, with the usual safeguards, as has been customary.</P>
    <P>To continue with the report of the Donoughmore Committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government said that that was not a reliable document when I quoted it a moment ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's remarks are quite irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely telling you what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the results of an investigation elsewhere and my own comments upon them.  The Deputy's remarks are completely irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the report was completely unreliable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's remarks are completely irrelevant to the motion.  Flexibility is necessary for effective government and that largely depends on some such system as this.  I invite Deputies to look back at Acts of Parliament in which attempts were made to legislate in detail for specific contingencies.  At the moment, I can think of just one example.  A famous Act of the British Parliament, applicable to this country, is known as the Judgment Mortgage Act.  There are a number of amending Acts relating to that Act.  That series of Acts purports to deal in great detail with matters of procedure as regards registration of judgment mortgages. What is the result?  The law is so <Col N="1676" /> complex on the subject that nobody cares to register a judgment mortgage if he can avoid it.  These Acts have given rise to more litigation and there have been more decided cases negativing the original intentions of the legislature in respect of them than has been the case in respect of most Acts to which Deputies in Opposition would refer in support of their contention.</P>
      <P>Those two points are important.  The fact that they are referred to in the Donoughmore Report is neither here nor there.  Inherently, and in themselves, they are important, and I urge them upon the House.  If this body try to prescribe every little tittle of legislation, it will cease to have any effective control of legislation as a whole.  We shall literally lose ourselves in a mass of wordy technicalities.  In a short time, we shall not see the wood because of seeing so many trees.  These reasons, I think, in themselves, are sufficient to justify the passing of legislation which embodies provisions for Rules and Orders.</P>
      <P>But, to continue the enumeration taken from the particular report, there comes another reason, and that reason is the opportunity for experiment.  Of course, from a purely academic point of view that could cut both ways, but it is necessary very often to save public time, to save litigation and futility on the part of the legislating power&mdash;to give a discretion to the executive to find what is the most expeditious, effective and fair way of dealing with certain detailed aspects of a problem.  I think that that is about all that need be said upon the report there.</P>
      <P>Now, these matters have been recommended by the Donoughmore report and they commend themselves, particularly the ones I have mentioned, to anybody who studies the problem, and I think whatever conclusion one comes to upon the report itself, we have the following incontrovertible conclusions. You cannot get away from the fact that subordinate legislation by order is a practical necessity.  Not only that, but it is an inevitability.  So now, with these premises, I think we can proceed with the remaining matters which arise on this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the remarks of the <Col N="1677" /> proposer of the motion, if I understood him correctly, I think he was addressing himself rather to the question of Emergency Powers Orders than to the question of Orders in the completely broad sense with which I was dealing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, if the question of Emergency Powers Orders is involved, the following remarks appear to me to be relevant.  An Emergency Powers Order is something which arises under emergency conditions, and here, under the Emergency Powers Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to interrupt the Deputy, but I specifically mentioned that I wanted to omit the word &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; during my speech. If the Deputy looks up the Official Report later he will find that that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy says, but I understood him to use a phrase beginning with the word &ldquo;emergency,&rdquo; and that may have misled me.  In any event, the emergency legislation is something to one side and I think I can dismiss it with the following remarks.  Firstly, it was an absolute necessity while the war was on.  I think Deputies on the far side of the House will agree it was an absolute necessity for the safeguarding of the State and of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>And for keeping down wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That being so, with the passing of the emergency&mdash;let us say, rather, the position as soon as the emergency eased, because nobody can say the emergency is over; there is a world emergency, and, in fact, an emergency that in some respects is growing more acute instead of conditions being made more easy&mdash;you had the amending Act of 1945.  That Act proceeds to abolish certain emergency provisions which are no longer necessary.  I think that in itself is a sufficient answer to people who make the charge that there is an effort to continue emergency powers Orders.  In so far as it is prudent or reasonable at the present moment, <Col N="1678" /> these Orders have been revoked, and to those who talk about the liberty of the subject and the particular sanction of the liberty of the subject, namely, publicity, I will say let them look at the Act, read it, and they will honestly admit that a straightforward, rapid effort was made in regard to deleting provisions which, though necessary in the emergency, are undesirable in a time of peace.  I think any fair-minded man will agree that these deletions are more than an evidence of goodwill towards the democratic institutions so lauded by the Opposition.</P>
      <P>The House has only a few more minutes to consider this motion for to-night, and I would just like to refer to the necessity for this delegated legislation, and then to proceed further and to say that, of course, some safeguards are needed, and, of course, some control is needed; but it remains to be seen how far, in fact, those safeguards have been applied.  I submit that these safeguards have been provided, and, lastly, that the terms of this motion appear to want nothing more than the continuance of the situation as it is at present.  I move the adjournment of this debate.</P>

      <P>We have just one minute to go.  I have referred to safeguards. The next thing is to see whether this problem has been studied. I feel I may have digressed a little into the details.  The essential part of my <Col N="1679" /> remarks as regards this motion is that the problem has been studied in detail and the lines for its solution are known and accepted.  Therefore, there does not appear to be any particular reason for establishing a committee such as is proposed in this motion.  The Donoughmore Committee considered the problem as far back as 1932.  In the years before the war there was sporadic advertence to it.  During the war, naturally, in England particularly, there was a great growth of Orders and emergency legislation, I should say considerably more than here, and the <Col N="1680" /> result has been to draw forth a number of publications on the subject.  The subject has been discussed here at home.</P>
