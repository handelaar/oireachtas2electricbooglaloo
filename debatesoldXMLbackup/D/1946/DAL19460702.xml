      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the amount of customs duty applicable to electrolytic condensers, the date from which the present duty was imposed, the purpose of the duty, and if he will state when previously a customs duty was imposed on these articles and the amount of that duty.</P>

      <P>I propose to take the Deputy's two questions about electrolytic condensers together.  These goods became liable to duty at the rate of 75 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> (50 per cent. preferential rate) on 18th May, 1946, when new duties were imposed on wireless apparatus with the object of encouraging the development of the wireless industry; previously electrolytic condensers were liable to 25 per cent. <i>ad valorem.</i>  Electrolytic condensers are not being made here and, until such time as they are, duty free licences will be recommended for the importation of electrolytic condensers by firms engaged in the wireless industry for incorporation in the sets which they produce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;  The new scale of duties relating to wireless sets and wireless sets parts was brought into operation early this year so that firms proposing to engage in their manufacture would know precisely the conditions with which they would have to comply and the degree of manufacture they would have to undertake in order to secure exemption from duty.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if it is now possible for him to arrange for a supply of fish barrels to be made available, from home or imported sources, so that buyers in the West Cork fishing centres may formulate their plans for the curing and export of autumn mackerel; and if he will indicate how soon such barrels will be available and their approximate price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present time I do not see any prospect of securing a supply of fish barrels from outside sources.  The home supply position is also difficult, mainly on account of the shortage of suitable timber and hooping-iron. Consequently I am not in a position to indicate how soon fish barrels will be available to meet requirements, or the approximate price of such barrels, if available.</P>

      <P>The Clonmel Corporation propose to accept the lowest tender for 18 houses to be erected in Delaney's field, the houses containing five rooms and bathroom. The amount of the tender is £17,564 8s. 3d.  The building cost per house is <Col N="5" /> £976, and the all-in cost is estimated at £1,008 per house.  The loan for the carrying out of the scheme will be made available from the Local Loans Fund at 2½ per cent repayable over a period of 35 years.  The floor area is 935 square feet and the cost per square foot is 21/-. I am in correspondence with the corporation as to the detailed cost per cubic foot of the houses and as to the rents proposed to be charged.  When this information has been received I will be in a position to determine the amount of the special grant to be made from the Transition Development Fund in addition to the usual subsidy under the 1932 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the number of unemployed persons in Balbriggan, County Dublin, at present, is considerable; and if he will state if there are any schemes for housing or sewerage or other works which might be undertaken to alleviate the distress of the district.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Department of Industry and Commerce that on the 25th May last 106 persons were registered as unemployed in Balbriggan town and 41 persons ill the Balbriggan rural area.</P>
      <P>The commissioner for Dublin County Council is considering increasing certain work in connection with roads restoration, which will give extra employment. In addition a special roads rural employment allocation of £1,569 was notified to the county council on the 28th ultimo.  The scheme under this allocation can take into consideration the unemployment position in the area.</P>
      <P>A compulsory purchase order made by the Dublin County Council some time ago for the purpose of the Labourers Acts and on which I hope to issue my decision very shortly, provides for the acquisition of a total of some 12 acres of land in or in the neighbourhood of Balbriggan, on which it is proposed to erect 92 labourers' cottages.  It is the intention of the Dublin County Commissioner to proceed with this housing scheme with all possible speed as far as the position with regard to supplies of building materials will permit and the scheme should yield a considerable amount of employment in Balbriggan and district.</P>
      <P>There is a modern sewerage scheme in operation at Balbriggan with intercepting tank and outfall at the harbour.  A new outfall is contemplated and investigations and tests in connection with it are in progress.  The matter is, however, in a preliminary stage.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware of any, and if so what, regulations are prescribed for the protection of personnel employed in sanatoria throughout the country with a view to preventing such personnel from contracting tuberculosis; and further, if he will state the names of sanatoria in which he is satisfied that these regulations are enforced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>A circular was issued on the 7th September, 1945, indicating the steps which should be taken by local authorities with a view to safeguarding the staffs of sanatoria under their control.  It was recommended that arrangements should be made for tuberculin tests to be carried out with their consent on members under 30 years of age of such medical, nursing and domestic staffs, and that negative reactors should be retested every three months until their conversion to positive reaction.  In the case of persons giving a positive reaction to the test, clinical and radiological examinations together with a blood sedimentation test were recommended, and it was emphasised that the health of all members on the staffs of hospitals whose duties are likely to bring them into contact with cases of tuberculosis known or suspected to be infective, should be under constant surveillance by the medical officers of the hospital.</P>
      <P>Members of the staffs of sanatoria were invited to avail of the various means of prophylaxis and to signify their consent in writing.</P>
      <P>The response to this invitation was disappointing in several sanatoria, as many members of the staffs refused to undergo the tests.  The medical officers continue to impress upon the staffs the advisability of taking the necessary precautions, and it is hoped that in due course all such staffs will realise that these precautions have been recommended in their own interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to apply these recommendations compulsorily as the <Col N="9" /> consent of each member of the staff is required before the tests can be carried out.  It is my intention to ascertain at the expiration of 12 months from the date of issue of the circular how far the recommendations have been implemented.  This period has not yet expired and it is not possible at present to state the names of the sanatoria in which they have been fully implemented.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Miss Mary Margaret O'Malley was employed in Creagh Sanatorium from the 17th September, 1942.  She reported ill on the 2nd December, 1945, was immediately X-rayed and was certified to be suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis on 5th December, 1945.  She was offered treatment in either Creagh <Col N="10" /> Sanatorium, Peamount Sanatorium or the district hospital, Castlebar, but she refused to accept any treatment in sanatoria or hospital and was treated in her private room in the sanatorium until the 15th December, 1945, when she left against the advice of the medical officer and the matron.  Miss O'Malley proceeded to visit an aunt who resided at a distance of 50 miles from her home.  On the 9th March, 1946, the dispensary medical officer of Louisburgh recommended her for treatment. She was admitted to the district hospital, Castlebar, on the 22nd March, 1946, and died there on 19th of May.</P>
    <P>The family contacts were X-rayed. Two of the children were found to be suffering from primary tuberculosis and are awaiting admission to Peamount Sanatorium.</P>
    <P>I may add that on the 10th January the matron of the sanatorium received a letter from Miss O'Malley thanking her for her kindness and expressing the wish that should she recover her health she would be permitted to return to her employment under the matron.</P>

      <P>An officer of a local authority who contracts tuberculosis may, however, be granted specially advantageous sick leave pay as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Six months on full pay followed by <Col N="11" /> six months on three-quarters pay and by six months on half pay.  These sick leave payments are more beneficial than those payable under the Workmen's Compensation Act.</P>

      <P>The figures mentioned by the Deputy were given by me on the 4th June last in a reply to a question and are in respect of the position on the 31st March, 1946.  As regards the 309 pensioners who are in receipt of annual pensions not exceeding £52, I should like to point out that that group consists of (a) persons who retired owing to disablement at a comparatively early age and with short service and who were granted disablement pensions, (b) junior assistant mistresses who, by reason of the fact that they were not eligible for pension prior to 1934 and did not therefore make any contributions to the pension fund in respect of service before that date, are entitled to reckon only two-thirds of such service for pension purposes and (c) pensioners including cases of disablement who retired before 1920 and whose pensions therefore were based on the scales in operation before the revised salary scales of 1920 came into effect.</P>
      <P>With regard to the latter part of the Deputy's question, careful consideration has been given to the general problem of pension increases but I regret that, owing to the very large number of persons receiving pensions from State sources and the impossibility of selecting a particular class for special treatment, I can hold out no hope of any concession in the direction of an increase.</P>

      <P>The strike of national teachers in the Dublin area has resulted in a reduction of approximately £99,000 in the amount which would normally be payable under the heading of teachers' salaries (including bonus for special qualifications and emergency bonus) in respect of the period from the 20th March to the 30th June, inclusive; in addition, the total sum payable to principal and vice-principal teachers, who are on strike, by way of annual capitation grant for the year ended 31st March, 1946, was reduced by about £365, owing to their absence from duty from the 20th to the 31st March, inclusive.  I am naturally unable to give figures as to the effect which the strike will have on the payment of annual capitation grant in respect of the period from the 1st April, onwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not quite understand the point in the second part of the Deputy's question. <Col N="16" /> I may say, however, that my Department will pay teachers for services duly rendered but it cannot issue payment to teachers who refuse their services.  If such refusal on the part of teachers leads to a reduction in expenditure I cannot agree that the question arises of utilising the sums thus unexpended for any other purpose.</P>

      <P>Again, I want to say, as I said last year, that at this stage of our history, I am disappointed that the Taoiseach, in his opening on the Estimate, had not some review to give us of the present internal situation. Last year, just as the war had ended, we expected that he would have something to say, but in spite of the fact that there was very considerable discussion on the internal economic situation here in relation to our general trade position, the Taoiseach, even at the end of the discussion last year, had very little information to give us except to say that we were in a very difficult situation: that the difficulties were of a nature that the immediate future could not easily be foreseen, and that they were not such as planning would cure.  He did attempt to say that the power to develop our industries would depend on the possibility of importing the necessary raw materials, and, at column 2084 of the Dáil Debates for the 6th July, 1945, he continued to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We cannot go on and force countries to give us those materials. Those materials will come to us when the various countries will find it to their advantage to exchange them for whatever assets we may be able to give them in return.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have on several occasions throughout the year insisted that the securing of an export trade in those goods which we are particularly suited to export was essential both to our agricultural and industrial development. However we proceed with the development of our agricultural or industrial production or in the development of our trade, our circumstances will demand a very considerable amount of faith, courage and knowledge, not only on the part of our Parliamentary representatives but on the part of every man and woman engaged on production. The most glaring fact in the present situation is that the men and women engaged in agricultural or industrial <Col N="25" /> production have no information or guidance from the Government as to what to expect in the future in regard to the use of their energies and resources to increase production.  Not only have they little information as to what opportunities will lie ahead and little guidance as to how they should plan, but one of their biggest difficulties is that, even if they knew where they could get the materials necessary to increase production, they are not sure that they will be allowed freely to use their initiative in respect of their own industries.  In every direction they turn, they find themselves confronted not only by direct Government interference but by a sort of planned mentality on the part of the Government to persuade everybody that the Government alone can help the country through its difficulties and that it should be left to act for them.  At the same time, they do not see the Government taking any action at all.  The conclusion to which we are driven is that we have a Government which does not know what is happening around it, has no outlook on the situation and is fearful of disclosing that fact.  Therefore, the members keep up the pretence that they are watching the situation carefully, that they have a considerable amount of information and that, when the time comes, everything will be all right and the proper signal will be given.</P>
    <P>When we look at other countries, we find them planning and setting up targets at which they expect their producers to aim.  Where exports are concerned, we find those countries engaged in discussion with the Governments of countries in which there are available markets with a view to seeing that the best possible conditions are created for their producers. In some of the principal countries, we find that substantial long-term agreements have been made with Britain to get into the British market.  We have not done anything in that direction, although the greater part of our exports in the past went to the British market.  We feel that it is imperative that, if the Government have views as to the target at which producers <Col N="26" /> should aim, that information should be disclosed now, so that those people who have the responsibility of producing and on whom we will be depending for production will be encouraged, by the outlook of the Government and by whatever assistance the Government may give, to go ahead with that task which is peculiarly theirs.  In no country, no matter how totalitarian or dictatorial, can the Government do the work of the people.  Here, the Government reiterate from time to time that they cling to the principle of private enterprise.  There is no questioning that, in the economy of the day, private enterprise, on the one hand, and a certain amount of direction in production by the State, on the other hand, should be linked together in the proper development of a country's resources.  Here, we cling to the theory that the greatest possible development of the productive resources of the country can come only from the freest possible exercise of private enterprise.  While that is so and while the Government protest from time to time that that is so, the whole tendency of the Government is to exaggerate the importance of Governmental direction and increase in every possible way Government interference.</P>
    <P>We had an instance of that to-day when I put a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce regarding the imposition of a tariff of 25 per cent. on electrolytic condensers for radio purposes.  People had been planning to get these for the past six months or so. On the day on which a fairly large consignment for a Cork firm is about to arrive in Dublin, on the way to Cork by sea, a tariff of 25 per cent is clapped on and the Minister indicates that that tariff is for the purpose of assisting a particular class of persons.  It is no encouragement to persons who are scouring the world for raw materials, or parts of machines, if, as soon as an inkling of the matter reaches a Government Department, somebody scratches his head and says: &ldquo;We may as well clap a tariff on this&rdquo;.  The person who has been exercising his wits to get materials which the country wants and which, without his ingenuity, the country might not get, finds, when he is <Col N="27" /> successful, that he has to pay a substantial customs duty.  In the circumstances of to-day, we want it made perfectly clear by the Government that the farmers will be allowed to run their industry according to their own traditions, outlook and experience.  We want industrialists to be given to understand that they will be encouraged to use their initiative to develop industry and that they will be freed as much as possible from interference by the Government and from Government dictation in the development of industry on which the residents of our towns and cities must depend.  At present, those engaged in commercial and industrial enterprise are waiting anxiously for some recognition on the part of the Government that they have anything to do with either commerce or industry. I have been pointing out recently that the British Government has been circularising every trade and branch of commerce and every branch of labour asking them, in relation to foreign trade, what assistance and protection each branch of home industry would be likely to require, and what precautions have to be taken in relation to each branch of industry in the various international discussions that are going on at present or that will be held during the present year or at the beginning of the next. Here none of our industrialists or people engaged in commerce has been approached in any way to suggest what precautions should be taken by our Government or what assistance they can give the Government in these discussions.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we see that in matters of great public interest the Government is interfering to prevent people who are really skilled in the various professions and industries from taking any part in discussions that ought to be going on in relation to policies pursued here.  The attitude of the Government seems to be entirely in accord with the attitude of the Minister for Agriculture when, in November last, he discussed his particular outlook on vocational organisation.  In the Mansion House, Dublin, on the 20th November last, the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="28" /> gave what was described as a lecture on vocational organisation to the National Executive of Fianna Fáil. Dealing with the Vocational Commission's Report he said that &ldquo;as a source of information on vocationalism there was no question of its value but he must reserve the right to question some of its deductions and conclusions.&rdquo;  As he developed his lecture he declared that: &ldquo;In other countries as the movement of State ownership went on, the possibility and the necessity of vocational organisation would appear to become less.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He would up his address with these words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The State appointed manager or the managerial system is coming&mdash; the popular demand will enforce it. As services and industries come under this system the necessity for, and the urge towards, vocationalism will become less.  Vocational organisation was desirable in so far as it was useful.  It had been found useful for workers to combine and for employers and professional men to combine. Hence they had trade unions, employers' associations and professional societies&mdash;the first stage of vocationalism.  Employers and workers would find sometimes that their meeting together might serve a useful purpose: then they had a vocational group&mdash;the second stage. If groups came together in a cooperative capacity the final stage was reached.  It should be concluded that there was no need for this step except in the case of agriculture where it was considered advisable to form the Agricultural Production Consultative Council.  Reason forced them to predict that the growth of vocationalism would be measured by necessity.  He was compelled to the conclusion that as time went on the necessity for vocational organisation would become less.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, it has been stated that there is enough in that declaration to warrant great consideration and to serve as a warning that without vocational organisation the modern State tends to become entirely bureaucratic.  When, <Col N="29" /> a couple of years ago, the Government set up a commission consisting of approximately 20 very representative people from various walks of life in this country to examine the position of vocational organisation in the country and to make suggestions with regard to vocational organisation here, we understood that the Government was subscribing to the fact that the maintenance of the country economically was work that could be done only by persons, trained in various vocations, pooling their knowledge and energy, organising themselves round their vocations to see that the lives of their families were made secure, that the trades and occupations they represented were made secure and a permanent part of the country's life and that, through the perfection of their professional work, they would give the greatest possible contribution to the economic building up and the orderly institutional development of the country.  We understood that the Government was subscribing to that.  Now, we find both in the declaration made by the Minister for Agriculture and from our experience in certain matters that the Government practically declines to recognise vocations as such in the general life of the country, at any rate as bodies whose experience might be transmitted in an orderly way to Parliament so that the decisions of Parliament here may be guided by their organised experience and their organised outlook and relationship through the various avocations in the national life here.</P>
    <P>In two particular directions we have had occasion to challenge the Government's attitude to the recommendations of the Vocational Commission. One was when we asked that a council of education be set up and the other was when we discussed on the Public Health Bill, not only the absence of any provision in the measure for the setting up of a council of health but the fact that the organised medical fraternity in the country were not consulted in any way in the framing of a very elaborate measure intended to deal in a very broad way with the general question of public health.  The report of the Vocational Organisation <Col N="30" /> Commission states in paragraph 540:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We recommend, therefore, the establishment of a council of education as a permanent institution to act as the accredited advisory body to the Minister for Education.  It should be a vocational non-political body without any executive or administrative powers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In paragraph 543 the report states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We recommend therefore, that a council of health be established and constituted more or less as follows:&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then it gives the constitution and goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The function of the council should be to advise, to co-ordinate and to plan.  It should serve first of all, as a consultative body, possessed of specialised knowledge, information and experience to which the Minister could look for technical advice on public health problems.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In both these matters, not only by failure to make any proposals to set up a council of education on the one-hand, or a council of health on the other, but in the actual failure in the case of the Public Health Bill to consult the authorised medical authorities in the country, and, in the general sphere of education, the insistence on the part of the Minister and the Department to pursue policies without discussion with organised bodies of teachers or the teaching profession, the Government have shown themselves entirely adverse to the proposals contained in the Report of the Vocational Commission and to be somewhat hostile to the principles upon which that report is based.</P>
    <P>The report dealt with certain types of industrial organisations set up here, some of an emergency kind, and took exception to the Government control of certain aspects of our industrial life. I think we have a sample to-day in the difficulty we are experiencing in the City of Dublin, in connection with the transport of turf, of how wrong the <Col N="31" /> approach of the Government to some of these types of commercial organisation is.  Fuel Importers Ltd., is a body set up by the Government and given complete and monopolistic control over fuel, both native and imported, and any examination of the manner in which Fuel Importers Ltd., select their contractors for turf haulage and the way in which the work of those contractors is carried out will show how objectionable a system of the kind is, where political considerations of one sort or another, or personal considerations, are allowed to introduce practices which are entirely contrary to any reasonable carrying out of a commercial system.</P>
    <P>Contractors are appointed by Fuel Importers Ltd., apparently without any consideration as to their experience or their suitability for dealing with the work entrusted to them.  A contractor is appointed and he then looks for lorry owners, but there is no supervision of any kind as to the conditions he imposes on the men who do the actual work of carrying the turf by lorry.  We have a system by which a number of persons, without any experience as contractors&mdash;very often, the only connection they have with transport is that they own a few petrol pumps&mdash;are given a contract to get lorry owners to haul turf.  When they get these lorry owners, they impose conditions on them by which they have to take all their petrol and oil from the contractor, with the result that enormous profits are secured.  There was one case in the courts about two years ago where one person who had been a contractor showed that he had made £12,000 in one year.</P>
    <P>An examination of the figures of profits in oil and petrol and in the carrying of turf will show that the contractor system adopted by Fuel Importers Ltd., and, to my mind, adopted in a purely political spirit, has brought enormous profits into the hands of a few political followers of the Government and has substantially raised the price of turf, through transport <Col N="32" /> charges, to the shocking price at which turf is sold at present.  I ask the Government for a declaration of their attitude towards the principles enshrined in the Report of the Vocational Organisation Commission, not only because of the importance of education and the importance of public health, but because of the importance of those engaged in the commercial, industrial and agricultural life of the country, so that the people may understand what their relations with the Government as free and responsible men and women, carrying on productive work which is vital to the maintenance of the economic life of the nation, are to be in the carrying out of that work.</P>
    <P>Are they to be recognised as the vital and necessary people they are and are they to be left free to use their energies and their resources to help to sustain the nation, or are they to be faced by a bureaucratic and interfering control in the same way as the Government apparently insist on showing that they intend to direct the medical services and educational services of the country?  If the Government intends to stand over its professions that it stands for free enterprise and will only engage in the control or direction of any aspects of the economic life of the country in so far as the Government can best do it, it is imperative that the dividing line should be marked as clearly as possible and that the ordinary people, on whose energy and enterprise our economic well-being depends, should be allowed to see clearly that they will be allowed to work as free people carrying on very important enterprise in a country in which the general spirit of the people demands that we shall have a free society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had, particularly during the emergency, a very considerable drift of our people to Britain, and recently we saw in the Press that we are likely to have a further drift of our people to France. The <i>Irish Press</i> announced in rather heavy type that, during a discussion which one of their correspondents had with the assistant director for foreign manpower in France, he had learned <Col N="33" /> of the desire of the French Government to import skilled Irish workers for employment in France and went on to indicate that there was every likelihood that the Wild Geese were on the move again.  I subsequently addressed a question to the Taoiseach, asking him whether any arrangements had been entered into with the French Government concerning the employment of Irish workers in France and whether he would make a statement on the matter.  The reply I got from the Taoiseach was that &ldquo;the French authorities have informed us that there are openings for employment for certain classes of workers in France,&rdquo; but that no arrangements in the matter had been entered into.</P>
      <P>That reply was given to me about three weeks ago and I take it that, in view of the fact that the French authorities have intimated that employment openings are available in France, the natural corollary is that some discussions will take place between representatives of the French departments concerned and some of our departments in connection with the immigration of Irish workers into France.  I cannot, of course, say whether these discussions have taken place, nor can I say whether the Government look with favour upon the export of Irish workers to France.  I think it is nationally regrettable, although perhaps, in present circumstances, inevitable, because of the way in which we organise our resources at home, that our workers leave this country.  I should prefer to see a planned economy here, based on the principle of full employment, which would utilise the capacity of our people to develop our resources to the utmost limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A nation can live only on what it produces and if we are ever to provide here a decent standard of life for our people, if we are to improve the lot of the people now living within the State and help them to attain a decent competence, we will have to make a greater pool of wealth available for all the people.  We can only do that by encouraging them to remain at home producing wealth for distribution amongst the population that is left at home and not by encouraging them to <Col N="34" /> create wealth in other countries.  Irish men producing wealth in other countries never made this country prosperous. Not even the re-export to this country of finance acquired abroad can make this country wealthy.  If we are to have real wealth here, it can only be got by utilising to the fullest the creative abilities of all our people. That can be done by putting them to work in every industry which we are capable of maintaining, by putting them to work in developing our resources and in providing new industries and services, by operating on every type of raw material possible, so that the finished articles may be produced for our own use or for trade in barter relations with other countries.</P>
    <P>Recently, we had an intimation that Irish workers could find openings in France.  I would like to ascertain from the Taoiseach if the Government have entered into any negotiations with the French Government for the drafting of Irish workers to France.  If they have, what are those arrangements?  I know, from first-hand reports which have reached me from French citizens and from Frenchmen with whom I have discussed the position, that the general food situation in France is particularly bad.  Even those privileged to have a recent trial air trip to France although they merely got a cameo picture of Paris, will have no hesitation in confirming the general food position there. Irish workers would probably have to save up for a week before they could eat dinner on Sunday, so high are prices and so scarce the commodities, if Irish workers are paid at the same rate as French workers&mdash;and I think you may take it that the French Government is not going to pay Irish workers a substantially higher rate than French workers.  If arrangements have been made by the Government and if they have settled down to view our unemployment problem from the standpoint that the best way to get rid of the problem is to send the Irish workers away and just leave a small residue of our Irish at home and if they say that export to France is another way of keeping up with the employment exchanges, we ought at least make sure&mdash;and urge the Government to make sure&mdash;that Irish workers who <Col N="35" /> may accept such employment as is available in France will know the conditions under which they are to be employed there.  It may be a very easy thing for Irish workers to get into France but not such an easy thing to get out of France if they do not like the conditions.  I am not sure that it will be a very easy matter to attune Irish workers to the French concept of life, to French methods, to the habits and customs of the French people.  Nor, frankly, do I see any great vista of prosperity being opened before the eyes of Irish workers who happen to land on the soil of France.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this whole proposal should be examined by the Taoiseach, if it has been put formally to the Government, with very considerable care and caution.  The Government ought to make sure that for Irish workers who may be going to France provisions will be made to ensure that they will not arrive there as a kind of industrial flotsam and jetsam, that they will not be sent from pillar to post, unable to get adequate supplies of food and not getting a return in wages capable of sustaining them there and providing for the dependents they leave at home.  I would like, therefore, that the Taoiseach, when replying on this matter, might tell us whether any direct negotiations have been entered into with any representatives of France on this matter and at what stage those negotiations now are.  In present circumstances, nothing but bitterness and disillusionment could possibly follow the sending of Irish workers to France in the conditions that obtain there. That would do irreparable harm to the good relations between the two nations and I have such an abiding affection for France and its people and such an admiration for the contribution which French democracy has made to human freedom and human thought throughout the world that I should be long sorry to see a situation arise in which, by lack of foresight on our part and excess of enthusiasm on the part of the French Departments concerned, many of our workers would arrive there only to experience bitterness and disillusionment.</P>
    <P>I think it was at the end of last year <Col N="36" /> that the Taoiseach told us, in reply to a debate in this House, that he proposed to establish two new Ministries to look after the activities at present combined within the ambit of the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  I understood then that those two Ministries were to deal, one with public health services and the other with social services which would include the entire income maintenance services of the Department plus, perhaps, the income maintenance services at present administered by other Departments.  A decision of that character was inevitable, as the far-flund and dissimilar character of the present functions of the Department of Local Government and Public Health make a segregation of its functions highly desirable, if we are to get that close contact, that intimate direction and that continuous control which is inseparable from Ministerial direction of a Department.</P>
    <P>I do not think that a Department administered in part by Parliamentary Secretaries has ever been a success and, if you do get occasionally a successful Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;and I do not say this in any spirit of derogation&mdash;then you probably would get in that person a much better Minister. If you are to have effective direction in a Department, with effective authority and effective control, the sooner the Parliamentary Secretary is equipped for that control and direction with the authority going with Ministerial rank, the better for the Department and the more efficiently its work will be done.  I think it is essential that these two Ministries be created with the utmost expedition.  If we are to keep abreast of modern thought and avoid being left behind in the race for efficiency in public health matters, then it is desirable that we should have a Department dealing exclusively with public health, one which will be charged solely with the responsibility for bringing our public health legislation and practice up to a very high standard.  We can get that only by the creation of a separate Department of Public Health and the appointment to it of a person with the requisite ability and talents to ensure its effective administration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="37" /> I do not think anybody here will attempt to underestimate the urgency of a separate Department to deal with our social services.  The more one examines our social services, the more one discovers how unco-ordinated and, indeed, in many respects how inadequate is their administration.  You have two or three Departments to-day administering somewhat similar types of maintenance services, with the result that you lose that efficiency which goes hand in hand with co-ordinated and comprehensively administered social services.  At present the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the Department of Local Government administer services which ought properly be combined under one Ministry.</P>
    <P>Other types of social services which are independent are the National Health Insurance Society and Workmen's Compensation.  They are entirely outside the control of any departmental administration, and are administered, in fact, by private insurance companies.  I want to see&mdash; and I understand that the Taoiseach had a somewhat similar viewpoint&mdash;all these services brought together under one Ministry, so that there will be a comprehensive Ministry of social services, charged with the responsibility of surveying social services, co-ordinating those services as much as possible, avoiding the overlapping and inefficiency which goes hand in hand with separately administered Departments and, generally, building up a code of social legislation which is at present unfortunately far behind the standard which we require in our economic and social services.  When one examines the whole code of national health insurance one sees at a glance, before the examination has proceeded very far, how utterly inadequate that social service is.</P>
    <P>What we do is we provide a very small pittance for a sick man or woman, and say to them: &ldquo;There is your national health insurance benefit.  Get well as best you can. We will try to help you if we can in various ways medically.&rdquo;  Only a fraction of the people get that help.  In any case, we offer to a sick person in many cases approximately 25 per cent. <Col N="38" /> of the wage which he found it hard enough to live on when in good health. How could you have a satisfactory national health insurance scheme if it is related to giving a sick workman, who has a wife and children, approximately 25 per cent. of the income that that person had when fully employed and in good health?  That is what we have to-day under our national health insurance scheme, and so long as we continue it, we will have to pay the penalty of having a low standard of public health on the one hand, and a loss of potential wealth on the other hand, because people are not encouraged to recover from bad health by pauperising them with small payments while they are ill.  Any examination of our national health insurance code ought to take cognisance of the utter inadequacy of the payments made under it.  Those concerned should recognise the necessity of comprehensive national health insurance legislation, so as to provide a better scale of benefits for those stricken with illness, and to adjust the scheme to the circumstances of this country to-day.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in relation to contributory and non-contributory widows and orphans' pensions, we find that the allowances made available to widows, particularly to persons dependent on non-contributory payments, represent hopelessly inadequate payments as far as those responsible are concerned. The amounts payable in the non-contributory section are grossly inadequage. Pensions as low as 1/- or 2/- weekly are commonplace in the administration of the non-contributory section. Quite clearly to apply the description &ldquo;social service&rdquo; to a scheme which provides payments of 1/- or 2/- weekly is to do violence to all intelligence.  Services of that kind are not social services in the generally accepted meaning of that term.  If you survey the field of unemployment assistance and unemployment insurance you find the same inadequate payments. Inadequate provision is made for those who are unfortunate enough to be unemployed. I think payment of unemployment assistance or unemployment insurance benefit is necessary where persons are unable to be provided with employment, or where the State is <Col N="39" /> unable to provide employment for them.  I would prefer to see these people fully employed, and to see each man and woman guaranteed a livelihood.</P>
    <P>This State should organise itself in the same way as other countries during the recent war, so as to ensure that nobody was idle, that anybody declaring himself idle could be satisfied that the Department concerned would provide employment for him, or ensure that it was provided, failing which, that person would be guaranteed, at least, a decent means of livelihood during the period that he was unable to provide for himself.  Our unemployment assistance and our unemployment insurance benefit is related altogether to too low a standard of living.  Unless we are going deliberately to inflict very considerable hardship on those who, unfortunately, are idle, we have to step up our social services in respect to unemployment benefit, in the same way as the British Government have been compelled to recognise the necessity for stepping up their services under separate administrations.</P>
    <P>In this House on a previous occasion we endeavoured by means of a motion to induce the Government to abolish the means test for old age pensions.  I think on that occasion sympathy with the object of the motion was expressed from the Government Benches, but notwithstanding our efforts to have the means test as applied to old age pensioners abolished or modified, the Government still persists in saying that, as far as old age pensioners are concerned, they will apply a rigorous means test. We give old age pensioners to-day a sum of 10/- a week.  We used to give them 10/- a week in 1916.  It takes 25/6 to-day to buy what 10/- bought in 1916. We are giving the old age pensioners no increase whatever in the 10/- that they were awarded 30 years ago, and not only that, but we are still imposing a rigorous means test before they get the 10/-, which in order to equal present buying value ought to be increased to 25/6.  I have never been able to understand the attitude of the Government in that matter.  If we are to be fair and honest with old age pensioners, they should be given an <Col N="40" /> increase appropriate to the increase in the cost of living.  If we were to be fair and honest to old age pensioners we would to-day be paying them, not 7/6 or 10/- a week, but 25/6 per week.  Not only can we not get another penny for old age pensioners, but the Government still insists that the present means test must be continued. I think the Taoiseach will recognise&mdash;certainly the members of his Party could tell him if they were so disposed&mdash;that there is an increasing detestation of the means test imposed under our present system of social legislation. They could also tell him that an ever-growing circle of people and an increasing volume of public opinion have come to align themselves on the side of abolishing the means test and discontinuing this iniquitous inquisition into the most intimate details of family life.</P>
    <P>Members of the Government Party have from time to time given utterance to views condemnatory of the means test.  We, on these benches, have from time to time over a long period of years sought to have these tests discontinued.  The sooner we get away from these tests the better. By getting away from that type of social legislation we shall import into our legislation some of the finer attributes of care and attention for our unfortunately afflicted citizens.  The present system of means test is not only detestable in its general conception but is particularly reprehensible in its operation.  The sooner we get away from it the better it will be for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>We hope, therefore, that through the establishment of a Ministry of social services, with at the head of it a person of high integrity, competent to administer these services, we will eventually reach the stage of evolving a code of social security proposals such as has been adopted in New Zealand and Australia, and such as is now well under way in Great Britain. A hotch-potch social legislation introduced now, and amended again, covering one social abscess one day and another social abscess another day, will not in the long run provide a satisfactory code of social legislation; that <Col N="41" /> fact has been recognised by these countries that I have mentioned and they are now evolving comprehensive codes of social security which are calculated to protect their citizens from that adversity which goes hand in hand with the adventure of life.  I would hope that, with the establishment of a Ministry of social services here, much would be done to bring such services into line with the best thought in the world on that particular subject.  I hope that the Taoiseach, when he is replying to this debate, will give us some indication as to when we may hope to see these two Ministries formally established.  I hope that, not merely will he indicate an approximate date for their establishment but that he will, at the same time, indicate the desire of the Government to see our social code at last divorced from the position of being sporadic and unco-ordinated and insist that the Government's desire is to get the greatest measure of social security adequately to cover all citizens against whatever adversity may come upon them from time to time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Party gave notice of its intention to raise the question, in the course of this debate, of full employment and of the conditions which prevail amongst the small holders in the congested areas.  To a large extent the two questions are, of course, co-related because unemployment has always been and will always remain a chronic condition of living where you have people congregated in large numbers on poor land, with very little opportunity of employment.  On the broad question of solving the problem of providing full employment for our people, it is essential to remember what the objective is.  If the objective is a socialised State&mdash;a State in which private ownership is to a large extent, or almost completely, abolished&mdash;in such a State the solution of the problem of providing full employment is a comparatively easy one.  I have a feeling, however, that if the problem were solved in such a State the general condition of the community might be worse that it was before.  We know that the problem of providing full employment for all the people was solved in Germany <Col N="42" /> prior to the war, and I suppose during the war also; but I do not think that anyone will admit that that experiment was an unqualified success. We here in this country still feel that the private ownership of land and productive property is in the best interests not only of the community but of the nation.  If as many as possible of the citizens of this State own their own property they can enjoy a fuller life; they can enjoy a greater measure of freedom and they are less likely to be regimented into a condition of complete enslavement and serfdom such as would obtain if all were officials of the State under one guise or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we accept the ideal of private ownership of property and private enterprise generally, then we have got to try to find a solution of the unemployment problem which will fit in with that type of economy.  We cannot, therefore, go out and completely regiment industry or direct workers into any particular industry in which the State thinks they ought to be employed. We must allow the largest possible measure of liberty to the industrial and agricultural employers and to the workers themselves.  Our problem then is to preserve human liberty and to establish within this State such a system as will obviate the necessity for having a large section of our people degraded and destroyed by being in a chronic condition of unemployment.  I think that it will be acknowledged, even by the Taoiseach, that up to the present we have failed to solve the vital problem of substantially increasing the volume of employment for our people here.  The Minister for Finance has admitted that 78,000 of our people have gone to Great Britain during the last five or six years, found employment there, and are still living there.  He did not, of course, make any reference to the large numbers of people who have crossed to Great Britain during the last five or six years and obtained employment there for long or short periods, returning to this country again; these people are now perhaps looking forward to crossing over to Great Britain once more.  The Minister for Finance did not refer to the <Col N="43" /> large numbers of seasonal migrants who go over every year.  Their numbers are substantial and they represent, not perhaps a drain on the population of this country but rather a condition of instability.  Such a condition is most undesirable both from the economic and the national point of view.</P>
    <P>Some years ago a number of Irish workers were burned to death in some sort of a shack in which they were lodging in Scotland.  Most people who read of that catastrophe at that time must have felt a sense of shame that our people should have to go across to another country to find employment and to live under humiliating and degrading conditions in order to save up a certain amount of money to enable them and their families to live for the winter months in this country.  That national degradation ought to be ended and we ought to face the problem with realism and energy.  In the congested areas of the West we know that it has been the established custom for years to migrate to Great Britain and it will require a tremendous effort on our part to bring that custom to an end.  It can only be brought to an end by offering those people better conditions of employment here or, alternatively, by providing them with increased agricultural holdings.  I think it will be admitted that it is humanly impossible to solve the problem of this exportable human surplus by land division alone. There is not and there never will be sufficient land to supply the needs of all who have not sufficient at present. But whatever can be done in this direction should be done speedily.  The Land Commission, as we know, hold considerable areas of land which they have had in their hands for years.  These are a source of grave discontent and ought to be dealt with speedily and efficiently.</P>
    <P>Then, as I say, in a democratically-governed State in which the people enjoy freedom, it is not the function of the State to establish factories or other productive industries of that kind.  It is the function of the State to encourage, as far as possible, the establishment of industries and, where it is found possible to give some form or other of State assistance to get new <Col N="44" /> industries established, an effort should be made to see that such industries are established where the need is greatest, where there is grave congestion of the human population.  That, again, must be done by inducement and encouragement to people engaged in the development of industries to decentralise these industries as far as possible and thus ensure that, where the population is, they will find employment.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged that there is not unlimited scope for increased employment in the agricultural industry.  In most of the progressive agricultural countries we find that the ratio of men employed per 1,000 acres has not been increasing.  It will be acknowledged, however, that the number of workers employed in agriculture in Denmark is very substantially higher than the number employed here.  I think that is true, notwithstanding the fact that the agricultural population in Denmark is more equitably distributed over the entire State than it is here. Here we have a congested agricultural population in certain areas and, though they may be described in statistical tables as persons engaged in agriculture, they may to a large extent be unemployed.  When these are averaged up with the thinly populated areas, I think that an untrue picture, at any rate, of the number employed in agriculture is presented.  There is need and there is scope for a very large increase in the number of workers employed in agriculture.  I think that an increase in the number of workers could be brought about by a condition of stability in agriculture.  There has been no stability in agriculture over the last 40 or 50 years.  The Great War brought about a short period of prosperity, but it was an unstable and insecure prosperity.  Practically everyone in the agricultural industry realised that it would not last and it did not last.  It was followed by a period of depression which was just partially relieved by the recent war. That condition of violent fluctuation, uncertainty and insecurity in the agricultural industry does not make for increased employment.</P>
    <P>I have said that the State cannot take over either the agricultural industry or <Col N="45" /> manufacturing industry and it ought not to take them over.  In so far as it was sought to regiment industry and agriculture extensively during the war years it was to a large extent a failure. What is the alternative to drastic interference and control over industry and agriculture?  I think that the only real alternative is intensive development of co-operative effort, particularly in the agricultural industry.  We know that in the closing years of the last century there was an enthusiastic drive towards co-operation in the agricultural industry here.  But in recent years co-operation has tended to decline rapidly.  The number of co-operative societies has fallen very considerably during the last ten years. There is less enthusiasm for co-operative effort than there was prior to the establishment of this State.  Instead of co-operative effort we have a tendency to look for complete regulation and control by the Government. I am not as enthusiastic as Deputy Norton for the establishment of new Ministries and the co-ordination of the various State services.  I would be inclined to look towards devolution and unloading by the State of certain activities upon private individuals and local organisations.  I think it is along those lines we will have to direct our energies in the future.  There is now in this State less national idealism or economic idealism than there ever was within the past 50 years.  We know that during the movement for the establishment of this State the enthusiasm and the spirit of the people were roused to the highest possible pitch.  That enthusiasm and that spirit of national endeavour have to a considerable extent died.  They must be revived if this nation is to progress. It is the duty of the Government to help in every possible way to revive local initiative, enterprise and co-operation. That is why we should direct our attention towards seeing how far it is possible to assist local co-operative organisations to promote increased production and increased employment.</P>
    <P>Shortly after I was elected to this House I drew the attention of the House, during, I think, the debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate, to the fact <Col N="46" /> that there were considerable areas of land deteriorating, being allowed to go to waste.  I pointed out that much land was overgrown with weeds and I suggested something should be done to assist in the reclamation of that land. The Taoiseach appeared to take considerable interest in the suggestion. He asked why could not the owners of the land do this work themselves, and was it not obviously the type of work which it would pay the owners of land to embark upon, inasmuch as it would improve their holdings and increase the productive capacity of those holdings, thus increasing the owners' wealth.  I pointed out at that time that while work of that kind might be of great national benefit, it might not return any dividend to the owner, and that is a fundamental fact that has to be faced if we are to combine the full development of our resources and the full employment of our workers with private ownership of property.</P>
    <P>The interests of the private individual do not always coincide with the interests of the State.  A farmer might make a bigger margin of profit by refraining from capital expenditure in development and improvement work, but he would not be working his land in the best interests of the community. The question arises whether we should adopt compulsion on the private individual or resort to inducement. That is a problem which does not arise in regard to land only; it arises in regard to all property.</P>
    <P>The problem which I set five or six years ago has been met to a very considerable extent by the Government in the provision of grants for farm improvements.  There you have the State recognising that it is not always possible for or beneficial to the owner to embark upon improvement work on his land, but it is in the interests of the State and increased employment and, therefore, the State contributes portion of the cost.  That principle has been accepted and the question is how far it may be desired to extend it. There may be areas of land which are poor and inferior; the land may require extensive drainage and reclamation. The owner may be unable to undertake that work; he may be unable to <Col N="47" /> contribute even half or one-fourth of the cost.  I do not suggest the State should reclaim that land for the owner. I suggest there are vast areas in this country which require to be reclaimed, but it is reclamation work which private enterprise cannot undertake and which private enterprise, even helped by the State, cannot undertake. The question arises whether such land should be purchased by the State and reclaimed, or whether it might be purchased by some local development organisation and improved, with State assistance.  I suggest the latter is the more desirable course, because the more you can encourage people in each district to work co-operatively for the development of the district the better the foundation for a secure economic and national system.</P>
    <P>What applies to reclamation and drainage can also be applied to afforestation.  It is better that the local body should be co-operatively worked and that the local people should have some financial interest in it.  If that body is assisted by the State&mdash;and in this matter it would require to be very substantially assisted&mdash;it could purchase waste land and plant in that land for future woods and groves, or have whatever type of plantation might be desirable.  This would add to the wealth of the community and would add also to the beauty of the area.  I think a sense of pride and enthusiasm for local amenities of that type could be encouraged.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach had the pleasure last Sunday of visiting my constituency and he saw there some well-developed big estates.  These big estates contribute considerably to the scenic beauty of the area.  It is not possible, or desirable, that such large estates can be re-established or that their number can be increased but something should be substituted for local land-owners who sought to develop their immediate districts. The only substitute that I can suggest is the formation of local co-operative organisations in which all the local public-spirited people could combine to develop and improve their localities.  Such local development <Col N="48" /> should receive adequate State assistance. The Taoiseach may ask what would be regarded as adequate assistance. In regard to farm improvements, a 50 per cent. grant has been found to work miracles, so to speak, and has enabled work to be carried out on a very considerable scale.  The co-operative organisations which I suggest would be dealing with areas more difficult of development and improvement than an ordinary farm would be. Therefore, it would be necessary in that case to give a much higher grant than 50 per cent.  The money would be well spent and the contribution made by such local effort to the general wellbeing of the community, to national productive capacity and to the maintenance of employment would be enormous. In addition, it might inspire a new effort towards building up the country.</P>
    <P>The quotation given by Deputy Mulcahy from a statement of the Minister for Agriculture is somewhat alarming.  That was an honest statement on the Minister's part of his opinion that we are drifting towards a managerial State, a State in which everything is managed and controlled by the central Government, and that there is nothing that can be done or that ought to be done about it.  That is a very serious situation, if we have to face it.  Before it is too late, we should seek to avoid it.  If we allow human liberty and private enterprise to be completely superseded by State control and State management, it will be impossible ever to restore them.  It is easier to destroy the rights of private ownership and the rights of private property and individual liberty than it is to restore them.  We ought to take alarm at the steady growth of State control in human activities.</P>
    <P>There are many things, covering a very wide range of human activities, which only the State can do.  But whatever can be done by the individual should be done by the individual.  Those things that cannot be done by the individual but that can be done by local organisation should be done by local organisation and those things that can be done by a municipality or locally elected county authority ought to be done by that authority.  That is the <Col N="49" /> line along which we ought to approach these problems.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach ought not to have any hesitation or difficulty in accepting the viewpoint which I have outlined but I can see a difficulty being created by the Party which he controls.  The Taoiseach has been in office longer than the heads of many Governments in Europe have been and longer than is usual for a Government to be in office.  I think there is a feeling in the country that the present Government has been too long in office and that if there is to be a general clean-up and a general improvement, there ought to be a change of Government as soon as possible.  It may not be possible to effect that for a year or two but it ought to be accepted that the prolongation of control over Government Departments by one particular set of Ministers is bad from every point of view and does not make for efficiency or for improvement in the general standard of administration.  I do not feel enthusiastic about the creation of new Ministers but there is one thing that the Taoiseach ought to do, and that he ought to do immediately, that is, to ensure that where Parliamentary Secretaries control Departments, they should be subject to the same restrictions as Government Ministers, that is, that a Parliamentary Secretary should not have the right to engage in ordinary commercial enterprises.  Parliamentary Secretaries at present perform very much the same functions as Ministers and, in my opinion, should be subject to the same restrictions.  It is inconsistent that the practice should have prevailed for so long that Parliamentary Secretaries enjoy much wider privileges in regard to private enterprise than belong to Ministers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Ceann Comhairle was outlining the lines the debate was to take he mentioned a number of headings under which the Opposition wished to speak and to take the Taoiseach to task.  One of these headings was national production.  Deputy Mulcahy said that the Government was lax in its duty because it did not give any direction to the agricultural community, in particular, as to what line <Col N="50" /> or lines of activity they should engage in in order to get a place on the export market.  One would imagine, listening to Deputy Mulcahy, that the whole world position had been settled, and that we could really know what we would require and where we could get our requirements.  Judging from the newspaper reports that we read, we seem to be very far away from that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Government have done the best thing that they could possibly have done in the circumstances.  This matter was gone over in the recent debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture.  The Government set up a commission to advise on the agricultural policy that should be pursued in the post-war period.  A White Paper was issued on that to members of all Parties in the House, so that it can be said that an opportunity was afforded to them to criticise the proposals put forward in the White Paper and to make useful suggestions, if they had any to make.  One of the outstanding points in that White Paper&mdash; indeed it has been the policy of the Government since it came into office&mdash; was that, in the first place, the home market should be catered for.  Both the majority report and the two minority reports indicated to the people what they should do in order to step up production, to carry it on in an efficient way so that we might be able to cater for the needs of our own people.  The only market which the Government, or people of this country, have any real control over is the home market.  The policy of catering for that market has been pursued by the Government ever since they came into office.  Everything possible has been done to make it a profitable market for our people.  I believe that if it were not for the outbreak of war in 1939, as a result of that policy, all the essential commodities and all the essential requirements of our people would be produced and manufactured here at home.  But, unfortunately, the war did intervene, and that has put us back a long way. I think that Deputies, when speaking, should give that matter consideration and should give credit for what has been done.  The Government planned <Col N="51" /> to provide our people with their requirements in flour, sugar, clothes, boots, fuel and housing.  The fact that the war intervened retarded progress in certain directions, particularly in the case of housing and in the provision of adequate supplies of boots.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton mentioned the question of full employment for everybody, and said that he did not like to see our people drifting out of this country and going to England to create wealth there.  I am well aware that nobody deplores that more than the Taoiseach and the members of the Government. I doubt if the drift would have been so great if the Party which Deputy Norton leads had taken up a different attitude: that if, instead of all the time adoring, if you like, cash, they would concentrate on what comforts mean.  I fear there is too much of a tendency in that direction, and that too great a value altogether is being placed on money.  There is not so much thought placed on value and on what we can get out of our endeavours here at home by way of bodily comforts.  I think that if we gave the other side of that question more thought and less to the question of bank balances and deposits and all the rest of it, it would be much better for our people.  It was sad, of course, that so many had to go to England, particularly those who were engaged in industries.  The reason for that was the lack of raw materials and the fact that many industries had to close down or go on half time.  A number of people did go to England, and undoubtedly they earned big money there, but I doubt if it was as big as it was represented to be when income-tax deductions and other charges were taken out of it.  I believe that the people who had the common sense to stay at home, to work in their own country, are in a much more comfortable position to-day than those who left the country during the war years to take up what may be described as unskilled employment.  It was quite possible for employers in England to give them big money during a war emergency.  It was not possible for us to do that here.  At the same time, of course, we felt the blow <Col N="52" /> of the war just as they did in Britain though not perhaps to the same extent.</P>
    <P>I think myself that present indications in this country and in Britain point to this, that this question of full employment is something that should be considered in a matter of fact way. I wonder if it is possible in any country in the world, where the democratic system of government is in operation, to provide full employment for all the people.  I believe that before the war they succeeded in doing that in certain countries where they had a particular form of government.  My opinion is that the unemployment problem in this country is, to some extent, overrated or over-estimated.  It would appear to me that we have three types of unemployed here.  You have first of all the unemployed man.  He is unemployed, not through any fault of his own or, in my opinion, through any fault of Government policy, but for the reason that there has been a revolution in the world since the 1914 war, a very great revolution which hit this country just as it hit every other country.  Since that time we have had the machine age. There has been a big development in the way of machinery and mechanisation. I remember that, before the 1914 war, you had in the various towns throughout this country coachbuilders, saddlers, and boot makers, all of whom employed a considerable number of men.  It was all manual labour that you had at that time.  Since then that manual labour has, to a large extent, been replaced by machinery, controlled by big concerns.  The fact is that you have those men who were trained for manual labour, as well as the sons of some of them, and it is very hard to fit them at the present time into a different kind of employment.  They represent one section.  You also have the small farmer who is not able to find sufficient work on his own holding.  At the same time, he cannot be reckoned as being fully unemployed.  He is partly employed on his own holding.  I do not see that more can be done for him than what is being aimed at, and that is to give him employment in his spare time at road making, drainage and afforestation.  In the third category you have the physically fit person <Col N="53" /> who is unemployed.  I believe it is to this type that most attention should be paid.  I do not think that anybody can deny that, within our circumstances, an attempt has been made by the Government to provide for that class.  From time to time plans have been unfolded to the House by Ministers in their statements as to what is being done to provide employment for this class in the way of house building, road making and bog development.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan spoke of rural improvement schemes and of farm improvement schemes.  Both schemes give a considerable amount of employment in the rural areas.  Then we have rural electrification which provides more openings for employment.  It has also to be noted that great relief has been given in the recent Budget to the agricultural rate-paying community, relief which is almost tantamount to derating.  The larger farmers ought to be in a position to give a considerable share of the benefit of that derating to their agricultural labourers.  As I said, we are in a machine age.  I believe that machinery is doing what its inventors never intended it to do.  The more machinery we have, the more unemployment we shall have unless some means is found of adjusting the matter, so that machinery, instead of being the monopoly of individuals and sections and being operated for their benefit, will be used for the giving of universal comfort.  I think that that is one of the big problems in the world to-day.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan was critical of the Land Commission and told us what the Land Commission should do.  I have criticised the Land Commission in this House on occasions, too.  I have been dissatisfied with what I thought was their slowness but, recently, I took stock of what the Land Commission did in what I might term a &ldquo;shoulder&rdquo; of my own constituency in East Galway from 1932 to the emergency. I cannot find any great fault with that work.  It was only then that I began to realise what the activities of the Land Commission were during that period; they were colossal.  If the Land Commission had been able to proceed at the same pace from 1939 to 1944 as they did from 1933 to 1938, I believe that all the land available for <Col N="54" /> division in that part of East Galway constituency would have been taken over and divided.  I have here a list of 47 estates&mdash;and those were not all which were dealt with&mdash;with the names of the owners and the amount of land taken and divided during that period. The division of the land may, perhaps, be criticised but it was divided, in any event.  Hundreds of new houses were built, relief given to numerous local congests and many new farms established. Certain landless men, of course, got holdings there and, even after all that, there is still congestion there.  A number of congests have not, so far, been provided for.</P>
    <P>The congestion problem in the west is a very acute one and it is not as easy of solution, I am sorry to say, as I or others thought at first glance.  A number of congests were taken from the west to the midlands during the term of office of Fianna Fáil.  Yet, I am told, that, in County Mayo, there are still about 4,000 families with holdings under £10 valuation.  I suppose there are about 2,500 such families in my own county.  That would be 6,500.  Taking into consideration what I have seen in East Galway, where a considerable amount of congestion prevails although a great deal of land was divided there not merely during our time but after the passing of the 1903 Act, I believe land division will never solve to the full extent the congestion problem in the west of Ireland.  I agree with Deputy Cogan that it should be the aim of the Government to establish industries as near as possible to the congested districts.  That was about the best point he made.  There, again, we know that there are difficulties in getting people with capital to invest their money in industries in places where they do not desire to place them. That is a big difficulty.  Deputy Cogan spoke of the co-operative movement and the help it could be to farming. He may have an idea of the success of the co-operative movement in his own county or in Leinster but Deputies from Connacht will agree with me that it would be very difficult to establish a co-operative movement there in view of what happened in 1918 and 1919, to which I referred on the Vote for the <Col N="55" /> Department of Agriculture.  I shall not go into that now.</P>
    <P>The criticism I heard to-day on this Vote was not serious criticism.  Deputy Cogan said that the vast majority of the people believed the Government was too long in office.  The recent result of an election in a typical constituency &mdash;Cork&mdash;did not reveal that state of mind.  That was a sample of the general criticism we have heard to-day.  I hold that the policy being pursued by the Government, with the Taoiseach at its head, is the only sound and sane policy.  It does not matter what Party occupied the Government Benches, if progress under a democratic system was to be achieved, the policy of Fianna Fáil would have to be pursued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to speak on a few aspects of national production.  If we take national production in relation to agriculture, I think we ought to ask ourselves: are we getting value from our agricultural land and from the agricultural community? If we ask ourselves that, the answer, inevitably, must be that we are not working the soil of our farms to the extent to which it ought to be worked or that, if it is being so worked, it is not being as efficiently managed as, perhaps, modern scientific methods would warrant. That is where we must blame the Government.  The necessary effort has not been made to teach the children.  I know that we have our agricultural colleges and other methods for raising the level of agricultural education, but the matter has never been taken up with the force with which it should have been taken up by the Government.  Granted, we had a general tillage policy pushed very energetically by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A tillage policy may be very admirable in certain circumstances, but I think everyone will admit that in other circumstances there is not the same argument for it.  I am not going to enter into a discussion of tillage policy generally.  I think that a tillage policy has been very necessary certainly during the war years.  We would all <Col N="56" /> like to see tillage carried on at all times in this country but, nevertheless, we have never seen a general agricultural policy pushed with the same fervour as the tillage policy.  I should like to see the Government displaying the same energy in relation to agriculture generally.  We are an agricultural country; practically every bit of wealth we possess springs from our agriculture.  If our agriculture is in a prosperous condition, then the cities and the working people in them are prosperous also.  If agriculture is not in a prosperous condition the urban population suffers equally with the agriculturists.  In connection with that aspect of national production I am glad to see that during the last few years various cheeses have come on the market and that, at last, we are getting Irish cheese.</P>
    <P>In former years it was a matter of regret that in this, one of the richest agricultural countries in the world&mdash;I do not mean rich in the sense of money but rich in the real sense of fertility of the soil and the possession of a climate that was eminently suitable for agriculture&mdash;if one wanted to buy cheese, one would have to buy French, Italian or English cheese.  The situation, I am glad to say, has improved during the last few years but still it has not improved to anything like the extent we should like to see it improve.  That is a field into which I think the Government should enter much more energetically than in the past.</P>
    <P>There are other by-products of agriculture which should be pushed forward with all the force the Government has at its disposal.  We have seen campaigns in relation to public health and I personally am very glad that we have had these campaigns.  We have seen campaigns in connection with the Irish language and various other aspects of national life.  In all seriousness, I would put it to the Taoiseach that there is an enormous field for Government encouragement and guidance of our people in relation to agriculture.  I am not an agriculturist myself, as the House well knows, but there are many well-established principles of agriculture which have been put forward by scientists in the last few years, and I should like to see <Col N="57" /> the Government giving more help to the Department of Agriculture in that respect and using the full force of, what I might call, the weight of the Government towards that end.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of national production is industry and I think it is well that we should ask ourselves what position industry occupies at the present moment.  It is in this position: it is short of materials; it is short of skilled labour, short of up-to-date machinery and short of money.  That may seem a rather gloomy picture and I do not entirely blame the Government for some aspects of that situation but there is a point I should like to put to the Taoiseach.  If it appears to be a matter that is more connected with taxation, I would say to the Taoiseach that in its wider implications it is important.  Take the case of taxation of industry in this country.  The war broke out in 1939 and, very rightly, from the commencement of the war, industries and firms were prevented by taxation from making profits which would have amounted to profiteering. I think that was perfectly correct and we in this Party never attempted to put forward any objection to that policy.  It was right that when certain sections of the community had to suffer and run risks, the industrial community should have to bear their share of the suffering but I would like to express this viewpoint.  The high taxation which was originally imposed to prevent profiteering has now had two rather different results, results which are not, in their widest sense, of any value to the community and in fact are harmful to it.</P>
    <P>In consequence of the taking away of profits over a certain amount from industry generally, industry has not been able to put aside reserves to meet the increased cost of goods or to replace its machinery.  Firms are either taxed on pre-war profits over a series of years or on a percentage basis according to the capital&mdash;I think it is 6 per cent. profit on the capital.  Certain things are taken in and certain other things are excluded for the purposes of assessing the capital.  Supposing a firm was selling 1,000 tons of some commodity at a cost of £1 per ton in 1938 <Col N="58" /> and 1939, it needed £1,000 to finance that production.  Now, when the purchase price of the raw materials of that commodity has gone up, we shall say, to £2 per ton, that firm would find itself in the position that it needs £2,000 of what I might call floating capital to produce the same volume of goods.  Owing to high taxation they have not been able to put to reserve moneys which would enable them to produce the same quantity of goods at the enhanced price of to-day.</P>
    <P>Somewhat the same situation arises in connection with the replacement of obsolete and worn-out machinery. Apart from the very great difficulty of getting any machinery whatever at present, there is the difficulty of financing the enormously increased new prices of machinery.  That is an aspect of industry which I put forward in its relation to national production, because if certain firms and industries cannot work at full pressure, owing to the fact that they have not got the necessary capital to finance the new and very increased prices, they cannot give the employment they ought to give and cannot give the service to the community they ought to give.  The same applies to the replacement of worn-out machinery, and, as I have said, it is my reason for putting this to the Taoiseach.  I think that none of us realised, in the early days of the war, that a taxation policy might have such a profound effect on the productive capacity of the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to our people leaving the country in order to get employment elsewhere, nobody likes that situation. The Government do not like it any more than we like it, but what are the Government doing?  More men and women left this country during the past few years than left during any comparable period for a very long time and it is a situation which no Irishman likes to see.  We all of us look to the Government to do something to help to alleviate that position.  It is not very simple, but still there are many types of public works which could and ought to be carried out in order to give employment to our people and to keep them here.  There is no good in our rearing and educating young people, <Col N="59" /> and then sending them out of this country.  Apart from the sentimental aspect and the hardship it causes to parents and relations generally, it is a position which, in the long run, will perhaps have a very dangerous effect on the country.  It is in relation to it that eventually the Government will be judged and there is more unemployment to-day than there was when the Government came into power.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to refer to the teachers' strike.  I do not wish to go into any long discussion of the matter, but I would ask the Taoiseach to consider it as if it concerned a Department of which he and he alone were head. It reflects no credit on the Government and no credit on the wisdom of the people in it that a long strike, which so vitally affects the citizens of Dublin, should have been allowed to continue. I, as a Deputy, have kept out of the technicalities of this dispute because I and many others hoped that good sense would prevail, that meetings would be held and so on, but I ask the Taoiseach to approach the matter with goodwill towards these men and women and let us see the poor children in Dublin once more attending school and getting the education which so many of them need so badly&mdash;indeed, the education which they do not get for long enough in any case.  They can ill afford to lose one term out of the short period they spend at school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Taoiseach will get off very lightly on this Estimate, judging by the attendance in the House.  A colleague of mine, Deputy Beegan, made a statement which has had the effect of bringing me to my feet.  He said that land division will never solve the problem with which we are confronted.  That is an alarming statement, especially coming from a Deputy representing an area portion of which comprises North Galway.  In my opinion, land division is the one thing which has been neglected in relation to Government policy and the manner in which the Government have dealt with land since they came into power is responsible for the unemployment and for the emigration we see to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> Deputy Beegan said that it looks as if Government policy is right, in view of the by-election result in Cork, but surely there is no county in Ireland in which the land problem is more pressing than South Mayo, and if the Deputy looks at the result of the election in South Mayo, he will see a vote of no confidence in the Government.  I want to make it plain to the Taoiseach that the policy adopted with regard to settling our people on the land was responsible for that vote in opposition to the Government.  Surely the Taoiseach must realise that, when war was all around us and when we could not import food, the Government were compelled to bring into force compulsory tillage regulations so that food would be produced for our people, and rightly so, but it is my view, and I believe I am correct in this view, that had the Government dealt with the land question as it should have been dealt with in the preceding ten years, there would have been no need for any compulsory tillage regulations.</P>
    <P>Had the land been given to the people, to the people who were subsequently exported from this country to produce food for the people of other nations, there never would have been any need for such regulations.  Where is the tenant farmer who had to be compelled to till his land?  I have not met any such farmer because the tenant farmer is a man who always had to till 50 per cent. of his land in order to make ends meet and eke out an existence for himself and his family. If there is one appeal I would make to the Taoiseach on his Estimate in 1946, it is to get back to the land question. For years the Land Commission have land on their hands, not alone in Galway but in every other county and it is not being given out to the people. It is promised this year, next year and the following year, but still remains undivided.  That land is set by the Land Commission in tillage, and rightly so, to produce food, but it is now worn out&mdash;and I hope the Taoiseach knows what I mean by that agricultural term&mdash;it has lost heart and has not now the value it had. Something should be done to help the uneconomic holder who may be given an addition of this worn out land. <Col N="61" /> That is only putting him in a worse position than before.</P>
    <P>I would go back to 1927&mdash;of course, I am not entitled to do so&mdash;when I remember the Taoiseach, before he became Taoiseach, making a statement down in my own town, Dunmore, that when he was coming along from Dublin on the way down he saw nothing but an odd gentleman's residence and an odd herd's house, until he came into the west of Ireland, and once he came into Galway, &ldquo;if you threw your hat out of the door,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it would hang on a chimney stack.&rdquo;&ldquo;Surely something must be done to remedy all this,&rdquo; he said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach surely did&mdash;and he got away with it.  The position to-day is the same as it was that day and we have had a good many years of his Government since.  The very people who were behind him that day&mdash;such as myself&mdash;have lost confidence, as we believe that the present Government is not sincere and has not the slightest intention of placing the people on the land.  In what other way can one cure unemployment?  There is absolutely no other way.  Our industries are regarded by some people, I regret to say, with grave suspicion. That is not my view, as I believe the agricultural community must co-operate very much more with industries built up in this country, before those industries will be the success we would wish them to be.  I am one of those who realise that any industry started here will provide work for more and more of our people and keep them at home, and that that is very necessary.  However, it is very often pointed out to certain sections of our people that, because a certain article is manufactured here, it is costing a little more than if it were taken across the water and the minds of a lot of our people are poisoned by propaganda of that type.  Our people have got to realise that, though the manufactured article may cost a little more, the industry is providing work for people who would have to leave otherwise and is also <Col N="62" /> building up a home market for agricultural produce.  That is an important point, as the last ten years have taught us that the home market is the principal one and is very often a better market than can be found outside.  You can fix the price for the article at home, but it is outsiders who fix it on markets outside.</P>
      <P>The statement which brought me to my feet was that by Deputy Beegan on land division, that land division would never solve the problem.  I would love to debate that in any part of East Galway.</P>

We were told that it was Fianna Fáil policy to prevent that and were given the example of Bobbie Burns.  Land in the hands of the Land Commission is not being given out to the people.  The result of the Cork by-election is not the result for the Taoiseach to look at.  He should look at the result in South Mayo, where, I regret to say, nearly 40 per cent. of the people have had to leave the country.  That is a vote of censure on Government policy and, as the Taoiseach is the man responsible for Government policy, I ask him to see that, for the future&mdash;while there could be excuses during the war&mdash;the land will not be held any longer. I ask him to see that the land held by the Land Commission will be handed over immediately to uneconomic holders and thus be responsible for producing more food and preventing emigration.</P>

There is not enough land to satisfy the need of one-quarter of the small holders in the west, in West Kerry or West Cork. The land is not there.  It cannot be done unless you create a whole lot of uneconomic holders.  It is all very well for Clann na Talmhan to speak with two voices.  You have Deputy Donnellan advocating more land division, more land for the people and you have his comrade, Deputy Cogan, talking about taking over big tracts of land and handing them over to co-operative societies.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>As will be seen from the brief text of this Bill, it proposes merely to extend for another two years, as from 31st March last, the operation of the Local Government (Remission of Rates) Act, 1940.  It contains no new principle. Beyond the extension of the time, to which I have referred, it does not amend the Principal Act in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Local Government (Remission of Rates) Bill, 1940, applied to residences which were not (a) cottages erected under the Labourers Acts; (b) houses under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, as amended by the Housing Act, 1932, or (c) houses in respect of which a grant was made under the Housing Acts, 1924 and 1925, or (d) under the Housing Acts, 1925 to 1931, or (e) houses in respect of which a grant was made under the Housing Acts, 1932 to 1942, or (f) houses not relieved of rates under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts.  That is to say, it applies to houses which had not obtained any grant or any relief under any other Act.  In respect of <Col N="64" /> these houses excluded from the operation of other Acts, it provides that a remission of two-thirds of the rates for five years may be given in respect of them, although they have either been erected, enlarged or improved during the period commencing 1st October, 1939 and ending 31st March of this year.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill, as I have explained, is to grant a further extension of this concession up to the 31st March, 1948, so that new dwelling-houses, enlargements and improvements of existing houses completed in the current and next financial year may rank for remission of rates.  I should, perhaps, make it quite clear, in case something that I have said may be ambiguous, that the total period for which this concession shall be secured in respect of any particular residence is five years.  The Bill does not propose, in the case of residences which may have been erected in 1939, to extend the period during which a remission of rates would be obtainable from the year 1945 until 1948.  It does not, in short, extend the period of the remission.  It merely extends the period within which houses may be built, enlarged or improved in order to qualify for the remission.  That is the general purpose of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputies will recollect that the Taoiseach undertook in relation to the emergency powers legislation, that Orders or instruments made thereunder would as far as practicable be provided for in special legislation if the continuance of the powers conferred <Col N="66" /> under these Orders or instruments was found to be necessary.  On the basis of that undertaking, I propose to provide in this Bill for the continuance of the following compensation schemes which were found to be necessary during the emergency: (a) The scheme providing for payments of compensation to civilians who were injured by bombs, etc; (b) the L.D.F. Compensation Scheme; (c) the L.S.F. Compensation Scheme, and (d) the Compensation Scheme for Seamen.</P>
      <P>The A.R.P. Compensation Scheme is being dealt with in a separate measure amending the Air Raid Precautions Act, 1939.  In the case of civilians and seamen the provisions of the Bill will apply to claims in respect of injuries received prior to the 2nd September, 1946.  It is unlikely that any injury arising out of the circumstances in respect of which those schemes were necessary will arise after that date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The final date so far as the L.D.F. are concerned is 31st March, 1946, the date on which the force was disbanded and, in the case of the L.S.F., the governing date is the 30th September, 1945.  The schemes, as Deputies are aware, provide power to pay compensation in respect of injuries and to vary such claims according to the percentage degree of disability found by the Army Pensions Board to exist from time to time.  It is necessary that these powers should be retained after the expiry of the Emergency Powers Acts, from which the powers originally derived, and this Bill is designed to meet that end.  The Bill also continues the power taken by the Emergency Powers (No. 269) Order, 1943, to exempt payments of compensation from the suspensory or abatement provisions applied by the Military Service Pensions Acts, 1924 to 1945.  That Order did not apply to seamen's compensation and while, so far as my information goes, we have not had a case of an injured seaman who was also a recipient of a military service pension, I thought it well to place this scheme on all-fours with the others in regard to the application of the Military Service Pensions Acts.</P>

      <Col N="67" /> The total number of awards made under the civilian scheme as on 31st May last was 176 and the amount disbursed to that date came to £17,240. Fifty-two claimants are still in receipt of weekly compensation.  Two hundred and thirty awards were made under the L.D.F. scheme, 32 of which are still continuing.  The total amount disbursed to date in respect of the L.D.F. scheme is £7,349.  In the case of the L.S.F., the number of awards was 46 and the number of cases in which payments are still being made is 13.  The total amount of payments to date is £2,900. Two hundred and nineteen awards were made to or in respect of seamen who were injured or killed by belligerent action, and of these 157 persons are still in receipt of compensation. Payments in respect of seamen's effects were made in 378 cases.  The total payments to date under the seamen's scheme amounts to £65,300.  The total sum of all compensation, etc., paid to date under the four schemes amounts to £92,789.  The amount of the awards now current may be put at £17,860.</P>

      <P>The point to remember is that they are covered up to the 2nd of September of this year&mdash;that is, if the injury took place before the 2nd September of this year.

      <P>There are a few questions I would like to ask.  The first one is whether any moneys have been recovered from any of the belligerents in respect of damage caused by bombing or other military action.  In connection with the North Strand, for instance, have any moneys been recovered in the way of credits, which were in existence, to cover the cost of damage done there.  The second question is whether, in respect of injuries that may arise as a result of floating mines to either civilians or seamen, after the 2nd September, 1946, any provision will be made for compensation. There is a continuing possibility of such injury occurring.  I want to know what the position is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the particulars of the amounts recovered in respect of injuries inflicted on our people by belligerent action.  A number of people were injured by bombs and by mines exploding on the coast. I could not state definitely what the position is.  I would prefer that the Deputy should put down a Parliamentary Question and, in reply, I shall give him all the information I have. I know that a certain sum of money was collected here which was due to German nationals; portion of it was used for the payment of compensation in respect of the Campile bombing.  I do not think the residue went very far towards meeting the compensation <Col N="69" /> granted in the case of the North Strand.  If the Deputy puts down a Parliamentary Question I shall give him all the particulars, or it may be possible that at some future stage of the Bill I shall have the particulars available.</P>
      <P>The second question is as to what would be the position after the 2nd September if a person is injured by a floating mine.  This Bill limits our powers to grant compensation to persons who were injured before the 2nd September.  After that date, should such injury take place; we would have to do one of several things; we would have to get compensation from the country owning the mine, or other instrument of war, which so injures our people; or we would have to come to the Dáil for permission to make an <i>ex gratia</i> payment; or we would have to amend this particular Bill or introduce another Act of Parliament to provide for them in the same way as we provided for the people injured prior to 2nd September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Estimate.  It is an Estimate on which one likes to speak, because one can speak to the head of the Government. It is a very useful thing to be able to speak to him, because he is more or less a man concerned with all the Departments and to get his ear is certainly something worth while.  I am satisfied that for the last ten years or more the Taoiseach must have been a very sick and tired man, because some years ago he aimed at big and noble things and I believe he meant well.  I believe that if he could put them into effect, as he <Col N="70" /> really thought he could, this country would be a place worth living in.  But, definitely, something has happened. After 25 years of a native Government we find that things are not at all happy or well in this country; things are very sickly in this country at present.  The Taoiseach will have to tell us whether something has gone wrong.  What has become of all the plans he put before the people and the House?  Why can he not put them into operation? Is it lack of finance or lack of national spirit, or what is the matter?  At present we have a country with practically undeveloped national resources, a country which has gone lopsided, where the agricultural economy has practically &ldquo;gone burst,&rdquo; as the saying is, and where industrial development has gone out of bounds and got into an uncontrolled position. That industrial development has taken the whole attention and finances of this State away from the land which is the primary industry of the country and taken away the people to the cities and big towns where the whole rush of money is.  If we had a balanced economy we would have a tendency to go from the city industries back to the land.</P>
      <P>No matter what industries we start here, agriculture should be given premier place.  Until that stage is reached I do not believe we will have any normal development of the agricultural areas.  Emigration we will always have.  Every nation which is progressive must increase in population and must spread out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore I am not against a normal flow of emigration.  It is good for the world that people should flow here and there like the tide and get new ideas.  But I am not satisfied with emigration on the vast scale which we have at present.  We should have curbed emigration from this country to a bigger extent.  Emigration at present is too vast.  It has become a national canker or sore which will have to be eradicated from the life of the nation.  We will have to keep emigration within normal bounds and keep more of our people at home.  I do not see why we should not be able to do it. It should be possible to do it with healthy industries and our people <Col N="71" /> working as they used to work in the past.  I believe they are not working like that to-day.  Our people have become more or less soft and sloppy. They want to get things more easily. In the past they had to work for a living and they were better off.  We had a bigger population and we were able to give more facilities to that population.  They went along in a more easy and peaceful way and money did not really count with them.  In fact a man could live in the country with very little money.</P>
    <P>At present money seems to be the dominating factor.  While money holds that position I do not think we will see much development.  Everybody's idea is to get money and, when they have money, it is of very little use to them. I know people with vast amounts of money and they are the most unhappy people in the country.  Other families are living in a small meagre way, barely able to pay their way, but they are really happy people.  They may not have £5 on a Saturday night to spend but they certainly are happy.  I should like to be shown the rich man who is happy.  You will always find that he is grabbing for more and more. He generally dies more or less in misery in the midst of plenty.  He is loaded down with money and it is no use to him.  This country should be built up in a small, normal way by getting away from money and by getting back to the plain, happy family life.  If we could do more for the ordinary family man we could put this country on its feet.  We have started from the top, which is the wrong way. We are told that you must creep before you walk.  We jumped to our feet far too soon.</P>
    <P>This country is at least 100 years behind other countries.  That is not our fault, but we should realise that we have 100 years of leeway to make up because of 700 years of domination by a foreign Power.  We were kept down by every means in their power.  Now we have got our freedom.  We have jumped to our feet too quickly and gone too far ahead.  If we went at a slower and more normal pace this country could give a better living to its people.  Indeed, we should be able <Col N="72" /> to provide for 5,000,000 more people in this country.  If we thought more of the smaller things and less of the bigger things we would make some headway.</P>
    <P>I do not want to criticise the Taoiseach because I think he means well, but I believe our whole national policy is wrong.  That applies to every side of the House.  As I said, we are aiming too high.  We have reached a stage where the agricultural industry which should be in the premier position and paying the best wages is in the worst position and paying the worst wages.  There is something wrong there which will have to be put right, whether by this Government or some other Government.  We have a false wage policy.  We have new industrial development at a rapid rate. I am glad to see that happening, but not in the way it is happening.  In the towns and cities we have gossoons of 18 years of age going into factories and earning £3, £4 or £5 a week and going as far as £8 a week, while the agricultural workers, the most important of all, are getting less than £2 a week when living in the farmers' houses.  That is certainly wrong. There will have to be a revolutionary change in this country.  We will have to see that agriculture takes its rightful place, because if you have men in the cities and towns earning from £4 to £10 per week you will not be able to keep people in the country districts working twice as hard for £2 per week. That is one of the biggest snags we have to contend with.  We will have to tackle it and I think this House as a body should tackle it, irrespective of politics.</P>
    <P>We will have to thrash out a decent national policy which we can all stand over.  There is no reason why we should not.  We have been wrangling for 25 years and it has brought us nowhere.  The day has now come to consider things more calmly and to have more love for each other.  Let us admit that we have failed.  Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Labour have all failed in giving the people the right to live on the right lines.  We should have a decent national policy which we could all stand over.  Unfortunately politics takes too big a place in <Col N="73" /> this country.  Everybody has a better plan than the others, and when the plans are tried out they are found to be all wrong.  No Party should go before the electorate with a policy unless they are able to implement it when they get into power.  That is where I believe Fianna Fáil failed.</P>
    <P>They may have meant well in 1932. They had theorists who told them that this and that could be done and that not alone could we provide a living for the people in the country, but we would have to bring our people back from America, the Argentine and other places.  They were not able to do it. The plan has flopped and our people have become disheartened and dis-spirited. They say: &ldquo;Why did we ever fight for freedom?  Since we got our freedom we are worse off than before.  We are hedged around by regulations and red tape.  When the British were here we had more freedom.&rdquo; I believe that that is a fact. We have not given our people what we promised to give them.  We should give up these high-falutin campaigns all over the country telling the people that this could be done and that could be done.  Very few of these things can be done.</P>
    <P>Take the position of our national finances and the strength of the country. At best we can do very little. The resurrection of this country will take a long time to accomplish.  The industrial development we have had has done an immense amount of harm. I would like to see industrial development carried out on orderly and progressive lines.  I would not allow one foreigner to come in unless he is a technician.  I would not allow foreigners to control the destinies of this country. We should have Irishmen and Irish money purely.  If we observed that rule in the past we would have very little trouble to-day.  The City of Dublin is practically controlled by foreigners.  We have nothing but foreign money and foreign investors. If it was sold out in the morning 90 per cent. of the wealth of Dublin would be brought to Palestine.  We have let the Jewish grip get hold on us.  I have nothing against them, but they have got a hold and some Government in the future will have to smash it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="74" /> I am not out to attack anybody, but what I say is quite true.  There is not a decent shop in Dublin that is not owned by a foreigner.  That system is wrong.  I am not saying that out of spite; I am merely stating the facts. The ordinary man who endeavours to do something in this country cannot get an opportunity.  Big money, chain-store money, is used to oust the Irishman. Industrial development is carried on here, not under the name of the man with the money, but under some Irishman's name.  The business will be run by Paddy So-and-so, but right behind him is the foreign monopolist pumping in the money.  The Irishman's name is over the door and he gets a living out of it, but it is a mean, skulky living.  Any man who is not able to stand over his own name should not get any privileges.</P>
    <P>One of the principal things that has gone wrong in our country is our educational system.  I am sorry the Taoiseach is not here to speak on that subject.  I want to draw attention to it, not so much from my own point of view as from that of a pioneer in the County Meath, one of the most able men in this country.  He is a pioneer in the same sense as Father Hayes, who started Muintir na Tíre, and Father O'Flanagan, who established Boys' Town.  I refer to Father Clavin, Parish Priest of Longwood, County Meath.  He has ideas which, if put into operation, would resurrect this country almost in a year or two.  He started in a small way and he has already brought great benefits to the people.  He has established among them a sense of self-respect.  He has certain ideas with regard to the vocational system of education and he suggests the dove-tailing of vocational education with the national school system.  He intends to urge that that should be done and, if it is possible, he is anxious to see the Taoiseach on the subject.  He knows it can be done but he realises that he will have to cut a lot of red tape in order to get it done.</P>
    <P>He wants to have a new class-room built in every national school so that the system of education there can be dove-tailed into the vocational system. <Col N="75" /> He does not want big vocational buildings unless, perhaps, in the larger towns and cities where they may be needed.  He wants the national school to be the pivot of our educational system and he wants the new system worked in such a way that school managers will not have to face a crux every now and then.  He believes that if his system is adopted we could resurrect this country overnight.  We have spent vast sums on vocational education for the last quarter of a century and we have got a very poor return.  We are really working on wrong lines.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach will consider some of the things I am saying, it is my belief that he can do a good deal, even at this late hour, to get back to the ordinary Irish life.  We have failed because we have not looked after the family man.  The family man is neglected.  At the present time we find in many places very unhappy families. Eighty per cent. of our small cottiers and small farmers are living in a miserable condition.  You will find in the case of cottiers that they are living on bread and tea.  That is a miserable condition of things.  In their garden plots you will not find a dozen heads of cabbage and you will not see any pigs or poultry around the cottage.</P>
    <P>The little cottage industries which flourished in past years are all dead. The priest whom I mentioned wants us to forget all our big ideas about buildings. If you have money to spend, give the little cottage industries a chance.  At present we are building vast sanatoria.  We are told that tuberculosis is increasing.  I admit it is. Why is the disease increasing?  I suggest it is because we are not looking after the plain man.  If you attend to the health of the plain man and woman and their little families, you will need very few sanatoria. Establish health in the home unit and try to make their system of living such that they will not look to Dublin, Cork or Limerick but will prefer the home life.</P>
    <P>Nearly all our young country girls and boys&mdash;a good deal of them have brains and a good deal of them have not&mdash;go in for a clerical education and <Col N="76" /> learn typewriting and shorthand and book-keeping.  Some of them get jobs in Dublin at a few pounds a week.  If you meet them on a Saturday or a Sunday they have hardly a bob in their pockets.  Very often the people at home have to pay for their &ldquo;digs.&rdquo;  If you re-establish cottage industries these people would make far better money and they would live a cleaner, healthier and happier life.  They would have parental control and the parish priest would look after their welfare and in that way we could revolutionise our whole system.</P>
    <P>You can see Dublin spreading like an eagle spreads her wings.  Foreign money is coming in and taking over the city.  The poor Irish people are hewers of wood and drawers of water for the big monopolists.  We shall have to stop that type of development. Many people suffered severely to achieve the resurrection of this country, but we have not got that resurrection. Our experiments have resulted only in failures.  We should not be failures.  We have one of the most fertile lands in the world.  I agree it is partitioned and we have to keep costly administrations in two parts of the country.  I agree that we will never get the ideal State until Partition is removed.  At the same time, we in the Twenty-Six Counties should be able to have a better State than we have.  We should be able to hold up our heads and, after 25 years of freedom, show progress.  We should be able to stand on our own feet and be in a position to say that we care for nobody, outside or inside, that we can pay our way and live happy lives and rear a bigger and better population. Can we say that to-day?  We certainly cannot.  Therefore I maintain that there is something wrong nationally. Financial considerations have to a great extent held us back.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that it is Fianna Fáil that holds us back.  If Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour were to evolve a policy, at the end of the period of trial of that policy, we would arrive at the same stage.  Fianna Fáil have tried a policy for a long time and the stage we have reached now is practically the stage where Cumann na <Col N="77" /> nGaedheal left off.  I am not saying that Cumann na nGaedheal had a great policy.  It was only a middling policy.  They did not put into effect all that they could have.  It all boils down to the fact that it is from the land the people will be resurrected, through the ordinary people living on the land. Therefore, the Taoiseach, who has been the responsible head of the Government for the last 15 years, has a good deal to answer for if he has to stand up here and admit failure.  I know that it is a thing he will not like to do but I would prefer that he would admit that there is something wrong. I agree that the war, for five or six years, upset the equilibrium but there is no use in sheltering behind the war. The fact remains that we had failed before ever the war started.</P>
    <P>I have put this idea before the Taoiseach, and I think he would be the first to adopt it if he thought it was a good thing.  As I have already said, this priest in County Meath has established a cookery class.  Before he started the cookery class in his area he lectured from the pulpit and in any other place he could, and asked the people to get their children to buy vegetable seeds and to sow them in their own plots.  He even bought the seeds for the children and they sowed them.  He procured an ordinary house beside the national school and he got one of the best vocational teachers in County Meath and one of the best national school teachers in County Meath and started classes in plain cookery.  About 25 or 30 pupils attended the classes.</P>
    <P>Deputies may have seen in the Press about a year ago that this priest wrote a strong letter to the vocational education committee stating that he wanted a cookery class in the area but did not want any high-falutin nonsense. He did not want fancy pots or pans or cookers.  All he wanted was a cookery class conducted on the exact lines of the kitchens in the homes of the cottier and small farmer, where there is a hearth fire made of sticks and turf, and ordinary pots and pans, even the skillet for cooking the porridge. He insisted on that and would not allow any class in his area to be <Col N="78" /> conducted in a high-falutin manner. Before he started the classes he called the people of the area together and instructed them that there was one teacher in the class and, no matter what anyone knew, they must keep quiet, that they were pupils there to learn, and nothing more, that there was to be no inferiority or superiority complex there.  He did that for a very good reason.  On previous occasions classes had been started in County Meath.  The class would start well with, perhaps, 40 pupils the first week and then those who had been at fancy classes, perhaps at a convent or some other school, would come in the first night and try to show the teacher what they knew about icing cakes and other fancy cookery, with the result that the poor, decent cottiers and the small farmers' children would feel in some way inferior and backward and would sneak out and go home.  This priest would allow no nonsense or snobbery, with the result that the ordinary poor person could come there and feel proud.</P>
    <P>I was at the closing of that class last night, and it was certainly a joy to see the co-operation between the priest, the two teachers and the pupils. If that is followed up and if a lot of nonsense is done away with, it will help to create the happiest homes in Europe.  I do not see any reason why that cannot be done.  There is no need to spend vast sums of money.  All that is required is a resurrection of the people.</P>
    <P>The people in this case are cooperating with the priest and giving every facility.  The priest goes around to the houses to see the children cooking in their own homes, in skillets and pots, on turf fires.  He will not allow high-falutin cookery classes in his area. He intends to re-open the class in October and to continue it.  He has asked me to mention it in the Dáil and anywhere I can and, if possible, to get the Taoiseach interested in it. He is going to re-open the class in the winter, and he wants the Taoiseach and the higher officials of the Department to come down, on some appointed day, and he will show them exactly what his ideas are and how they can be worked out.  I ask the <Col N="79" /> Taoiseach, would he come down to a class like that, where new ideas are being tried out, to see if it is a success? If it is a success, would the Taoiseach and his officials consider the question as to how national education and vocational education could be dove-tailed? This priest suggests the building of a large class-room attached to every national school and the discontinuance of the idea of building large vocational schools that cost £8,000 to £20,000 and which are definitely a failure.  They may be doing a little good, but they are not doing enough for the vast amount of money spent on them.</P>
    <P>I believe it is along these lines that our people can be resurrected.  To carry out this idea, large sums of money are not needed.  The majority of our small farmers and cottiers do not want money in the sense that the world to-day seeks money.  They can live in a decent, frugal way on the proceeds of their poultry and garden stock.  They can have a peaceful, happy and contented life.  In that way, we will not have the huge taxation that is crushing every one of us and we would end the idea of our young people going off to schools and getting a smattering of education and then giving the advantage of it to London, Birmingham or Dublin.  We want to avoid that.  We want to develop a love of the country.  That can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Taoiseach to consider the idea of linking up the national education system with the vocational education system and to evolve some means by which these can be dove-tailed.  That is the principal idea.  If that can be done, it is the opinion of the priest I have referred to, and my opinion, that it will revolutionise the entire education system in this country.  At the present moment we are up in the clouds, spending money at the top that would be much more usefully spent at the foundation.  Now that the attention of the country is focused on the teachers and the strike it is time for the Taoiseach to consider what is wrong with the whole system.  I will not say that the teachers are 100 per <Col N="80" /> cent. right or that the Minister is 100 per cent. right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time, now that the attention of the Minister for Education and the Taoiseach has been focused on it, to consider many of the problems, and to see how these problems can be solved and to bring out a new idea and a new system, that is, to dove-tail the vocational and national education systems.  They should consider the building of an extra class-room to each national school where there could be cookery, woodwork and engineering classes carried on under one school system. In County Meath there are four vocational schools, in Athboy, Trim, Navan and Kells.  They are certainly giving a good return because they are thickly populated areas, where these schools are needed.</P>
      <P>We have other areas in the country where we have built very big schools and where we have very few pupils in them because of the small population around.  Very large sums of money were spent on these vocational schools. I think that we should abolish this system of having these big vocational schools and have the children of a parish provided with a proper education in their own parish schools.  Let them get such an education there that they will be able to obtain certificates to enable them to get positions when they leave school.  If that were done I think we would get somewhere.  As it is we are going around in circles.  We are 100 years behind the times.  We had 700 years of serfdom and of slavery so that we have a lot of leeway to make up.  There is no use in trying to keep pace with people who had their full freedom for 200 or 300 years.  For that reason, as I say, we have a lot of leeway to make up and should learn to creep before we walk.  That would be a sounder foundation to build on, I think.  I hope it is commonsense.  It seems to me to be commonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these reasons I would ask the Taoiseach to pay more attention to small things.  Our whole national outlook <Col N="81" /> is warped, as it were.  We have too much politics.  We too often forget that we are all Irishmen, at least those of us who were in the national struggle. I have the same outlook as the Taoiseach has.  He may say that he wants a republic and I may say that I want a kingdom, but our policy should be to resurrect our people in the Thirty-Two Counties and try to give them all happy homes.  From this day forward I think we should resolve to give up all this talk about politics.  The acid test is whether or not we are a contented nation, a happy nation and a Christian nation, and if we are not, why not?  I believe there is a drift setting in here as it has set in among many nations.  We have tens of thousands of our boys going away out of the country, going into slums and losing the Faith.  When they come home from England, after earning big money there, they will not go to Mass. They will lie in bed.  That is because they have been living in big towns and cities, and because they had been jeered at or sneered at and were too cowardly to stand up for their Faith.</P>
    <P>It may be that where they lived they were too far away from a church, but at any rate the fact is that in this country we are losing the finest thing we have, our spiritual outlook which was responsible for spreading Christianity over the whole world.  It would be far better for this country if we could keep those people at home and give them employment here.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach to drop all this nonsense and get down to bedrock. That is what will give us a happier and a better system than the one we have, as well as happier and better homes for our people.  We should do everything in our power to develop agriculture. That would be better for the country than this policy of setting up mushroom-industries and enabling them to carry on under heavy tariffs. The development of agriculture would provide our people with a normal healthy life.  In my opinion, far too high tariffs have been fixed for some of our new industries.  There should be more competition so far as they are concerned, so that they would have to fight for their existence.  The people would be more contented if what I say <Col N="82" /> were done.  As it is, some of those people in industry have a monopoly in almost everything.  They are making huge profits and are able to pay huge dividends at the expense of the unfortunate devils living on the bogs and in the lanes.  I would ask the Taoiseach to remember the fine spirit we had in the country from 1916 to 1921, and to think of the people who marched with him, and with all of us who were in that movement.  Many of them were the sons of small farmers, decent men who had not a bob in their pockets.  Let us try to bring back that spirit at the present time.  If we are not able to do that, then I think it must be said that we are not worth our salt.</P>

      <P>Deputy Donnellan raised the question of land division.  I agree with what Deputy Beegan said, that the Land Commission will not solve the problem so far as agriculture is concerned, because if you were to divide all the available land in the country into 20-acre holdings you would not have sufficient land to supply the needs of the uneconomic holders, not to speak of the workers on estates that would be divided, or the landless men.  Therefore, so far as land division is concerned, that policy would not solve the problem.  When the Vote for the Department of Agriculture was before the House I put forward a suggestion for the serious consideration of the Deputies in all Parties who represent western constituencies, namely, that they should encourage the growing of intensive crops that have a very large labour content, such as the production of turnip seed, mangold seed and beet seed, and that schemes of this nature should be confined to the holders of land under a £10 valuation.  I am growing five acres of beet seed this year which has already cost me £30 an acre in labour.  I expect it will cost me about £40 per acre more before I am finished with it, but the return will be from £110 to £130 per acre.  That will leave me a good profit and will be the means of providing employment for a number of men.  In the case of a man who had not his own family labour, it would provide employment for small holders and their families.  I am surprised that the Deputies who represent <Col N="83" /> western constituencies did not undertake schemes of that sort during the past six or seven years.  Such a policy would help far more to solve this problem that we are discussing than merely standing on a platform and pointing to the green fields of Meath and telling the people: &ldquo;You will get all this land in the sweet by-and-by.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell spoke about industry. He said that it was short of skilled labour, of machinery and of money.  I claim to be a fairly keen student of Irish industry, and I have not seen any signs of that.  Any Irish industry that I know is able to pay 6 per cent. and over on the capital that has been invested in it during the past number of years.  I know of no industry, in the south, at any rate, that has not provided increased employment for workers.  In many cases, some of those in Irish industries are looking for fresh factories, so that when one thinks of Government policy Irish industry must be sound enough to enable those people to go ahead.  I see nothing wrong in that policy.  I am in agreement with Deputy Donnellan when he says that, the more industries we have, the better the conditions are going to be in the home market, which is the principal market that we have.  I have no fault to find with the Government so far as industry is concerned. I think they have made enormous progress during the past 14 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan was somewhat at variance with his colleague, Deputy Cogan, who is in favour of taking over big tracts of land and of working the land through co-operative organisations. Some Deputy here near me says that is the Russian plan.  Suppose we were to have co-operative farming, I wonder, for example, how Deputy Dillion and myself would get on.  If I wanted to put in a crop of wheat in a field, he certainly would not agree and the same would happen if I wanted to grow beet.  There would be nothing but rows, so that I do not think that plan would work.  I think that if this policy of co-operation were to be followed out to its logical conclusion the local towns would soon become derelict, because you would have just &ldquo;one big shop&rdquo; in which 15 <Col N="84" /> or 20 people would get employment.  I have seen that happen around Mitchelstown, as well as in the case of a few other towns in the County Cork. Those people in the co-operative movement are now going a step further, and are taking over big farms.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if Deputy Donnellan has any hope of seeing the land divided up among the people of the west I do not think it is likely to be realised, especially if, when some large farms are offered for sale, the Land Commission has to compete in the buying of land against the co-operative societies.  In fact, the carrying out of that policy would mean unfair competition even against farmers who wanted to buy land to provide for the members of their own families.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy is looking for a policy for agriculture and says that we have no policy.  Anybody who has been working land for a number of years and who takes into consideration our position in previous years must realise that the gradual raising of the standard of living of the agricultural community during the past 12 or 14 years has brought about an enormous change for the better&mdash;one which I am glad to see.  There is very little which the farmer wants to do by way of improving his land or his conditions in which he is not met more than half-way by the Government.  The farm improvements scheme covers practically everything the farmer may want to do in the way of improving his amenities.  If he wants to make a decent avenue up to his house or to erect a silo or to make a manure pit, he will get a 50 per cent. grant.  These things are of great help to the farmer. The same applies to the rural improvement scheme.</P>
    <P>So far as the export market is concerned, the first call on the land is to provide food for the people of the country.  Until the land has provided the full needs of the people in agricultural produce, there is no occasion to look for an export market.  We, certainly, want an export market for live stock, but we have a shortage of bread, sugar, butter, barley for brewing and a general shortage of feeding-stuffs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="85" /> I hold that the market for these is as much the property of the Irish farmer as is the production of artificial manures by Goulding's or the supply of farm machinery by Pierce or mills for the supply of flour.  I hold that this home market is the property of the Irish farmer and will have to be preserved for him, as has been done during the past 14 years.  Deputy Mulcahy says that we have no agricultural policy.  It was not a soft job to induce farmers to leave a certain line of policy and change over to a new policy. It took years of training and coaxing to do that.  The issue developed practically into a political fight in which Deputies in opposition to the Government went out with the cry: &ldquo;You cannot grow wheat in this country; you will get sugar so much cheaper from abroad.&rdquo;  To my mind, that is arrant nonsense.  The Irish farmer is entitled to the full home market.  In that market, he is entitled to the cost of production, plus profit.  If there is any quarrel between the Government and me on that, it is a straight quarrel in which I maintain that the agricultural industry should be treated the same as every other industry.  It is unfair to grind the farmer between the two wheels.  So far as beet is concerned, the farmer has been ground between the two wheels for the past four or five years.  Four or five years ago, the price of beet was fixed at a fair figure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is unthinkable, too, that butter should be rationed in an agricultural country.</P>

      <P>The trouble in connection with bacon during the past six years was that the farmer did not produce sufficient barley, oats and potatoes to feed the pigs in addition to the other things which he had to produce. That is the sole reason why you have a shortage of bacon.  In very few years, we may be driven back on our own resources again.  No Deputy can guarantee us ten years' peace under present conditions.  If we are driven back on our own resources, I hold that we shall require the full complement of the land of the country to feed the people, if some of them are not to be undernourished.  That, after all, is the main purpose.  There would be no use, so far as national policy is concerned, in our taking over the ports and putting ourselves in a position to declare our neutrality in 1939 if we were to be unable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was merely making a passing allusion to that matter while dealing with the question of producing our own requirements.  There are large gaps to be filled.  We have a steadily decreasing milk supply.  Why? Young men of the present day on the land&mdash;and I thank God for it&mdash;are not prepared to work as we worked.  They are not prepared to work from 6 o'clock in the morning until 9 o'clock at night.  Neither are they prepared to work five or six hours on Sunday without extra remuneration.  They see other workers walking around enjoying themselves on Sunday.  On my own farm during the winter, I can see agricultural <Col N="87" /> workers having to work five and six hours every Sunday between milking cows, feeding cattle, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>They get overtime for that now, but my point is that the farmer finds himself ground between two wheels.  He is not getting sufficient for what he produces to cover the cost of production and a fair profit. When he happens to get a copy of <i>Irish Industry</i> he reads that every other Irish industry is able to earn 6 per cent. over and above the cost of production and he wonders where he is going to get his profit of 6 per cent. He is surely entitled to look for it. There have been three increases granted in the wages of agricultural workers in the past few years since the price of beet was fixed at 80/- but the price of beet is still 80/-.  When the Act providing holidays for all industrial workers in this country was passed, every industrialist in this country was able to go immediately to the Department of Industry and Commerce and to put up a case showing what these holidays would cost him and he was allowed to add that to the cost of the article he was manufacturing and selling&mdash;to the farmer in most cases.  We, farmers, have no means of passing along increased costs of production to anyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a point I would ask the Taoiseach to consider very seriously, because I am more than anxious that we should have in this country plenty of butter and new milk for everybody. I want to see this country in the position that 100 per cent. of our sugar requirements will be produced here. After all, it is the one industry the raw material of which is supplied from the land and surely there is something wrong when we cannot produce 100 per cent. of our requirements in an industry of that kind.  There is something wrong when we can allow only so many ounces of sugar per head per week to our people.  These are matters into which the Taoiseach might go to see if some kind of tribunal could not be set up before which farmers could <Col N="88" /> go and establish their claim to get a price which would at least represent the cost of production and some percentage of profit.</P>
    <P>The day is gone when you had the situation that I saw in my young days where you had the farmer and his wife and five or six of their children working until they were 35 or 40 years of age and when the sons were satisfied if they got 6d. for a packet of cigarettes, a bit of tobacco or a pint of porter on a Sunday.  They worked until they were 45 or 50 years very often and all they had to show for it was the clothes on their back.  Those days are gone. Boys reared on the farm at present will not work for nothing.  They are not prepared to remain in the position that if one of them does not happen to please the father of the family when he falls in love at the age of 40 with a nice looking girl, the father can say: &ldquo;Get out; you have no claim here&rdquo;.  Those days are gone and I thank God for it. The agricultural community were long enough in the position in which they were worse than serfs or slaves.  They look forward to getting their share of what they are justly entitled to.</P>
    <P>I remember speaking here on the proposal to grant holidays to farm workers and saying that it would be better if every Party in this House came together and fixed a wage for the farm labourer that would be at least equal, considering the importance of his work, to the wages paid in any factory, and urging in addition that they should get special compensation for the fact that they must work on Sundays.  I suggested that the price of agricultural products should then be graded up accordingly. I see no hope in Deputy Mulcahy's export market for bringing about any improvement in the position. There is nothing an Irish farmer can produce to-day and sell in the export markets of the world at a price that will yield him the cost of production plus a profit.  In 1941 the price of butter on the English market would give us just 3½d. per gallon for milk.  To suggest to the Irish farmer that he should produce butter for Britain at a price that would give him 3½d. per gallon for milk is just the same as if I told Messrs. Goulding: &ldquo;You get all the <Col N="89" /> raw material you can; bear the cost of manufacturing it into fertilisers and I will pay you a price which is 10/- a ton under the cost of production.  Produce all you can and I will take it at that price.&rdquo;  That policy is no good to anybody; it is no good to the Irish farmer.</P>
    <P>All this talk about export markets is to my mind useless.  We have a market at home which, in my opinion at any rate, you cannot fill within the next five years even with hard work, unless you have a radical change in the condition of affairs, so far as agriculture is concerned.  You are not going to fill that market unless you place the agricultural industry in the same position as you placed every other Irish industry&mdash;namely, a position in which it would get its cost of production plus a profit.  That is your only hope.  I am far more concerned, in the present condition of the world, with our ability to feed the people of this country in another emergency than I am in looking for export markets.  I would be far more satisfied, if there was another European eruption within 12 months, if we had sufficient milk, bread and butter for our people, than if we were made a present of the whole British market.  If all they can offer us is paper money, their paper money is not of much use.</P>
    <P>I do not for one moment agree with Deputy Dockrell as far as industry is concerned.  Every industrialist that I know of in Cork County has improved his financial position, improved his factory and practically doubled the number of employees he had before the war with very little trouble, and he has a decent turnover.  Industry, to my mind, is going ahead by leaps and bounds.  I am glad to see it.  It is far better for me, as a farmer, to go into a town in which between £500 and £1,000 is paid in wages and sell my produce there than to have to say: &ldquo;Ship that produce over to England for whatever price you can get.&rdquo; There is some hope of getting a fair price in this country, but there is no such hope on the foreign market.  You must take whatever you can get there. That is my opinion of the export market and I give it for what it is worth. I give it also as one who has studied <Col N="90" /> the problems as closely as I could and as one who earns his livelihood by farming and who has no outlook on the matter other than the farming outlook.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan said that the Government were too long in office and that the people were anxious to get rid of us.  I invite Deputy Cogan to look at the Deputy who has come into this House as a result of the recent by-election. On that basis, it does not look as if the people were anxious to get rid of us.  The Deputy will be under no misapprehension as to the opinion held by the people of Cork City and it was only a couple of years ago that the matter was tested out all round.  To my mind, the Government have satisfied the people.  It is a Government to which the people look up and the Government which has their respect, and 50 per cent. of the Government's popularity is due to that fact.  The other 50 per cent is due to the fact that the Opposition in this House is useless and worthless.  I have not heard a decent case made on anything here by any Opposition Deputy, and, as a matter of fact, in 95 per cent. of cases, I have to be the Opposition myself because no one else is prepared to offer fair or decent criticism on any matter.</P>
    <P>The other 50 per cent. responsible for Deputy McGrath's coming in here is due to the fact that there was nothing else on offer, no other hope for the people.  We hear a few &ldquo;hems and haws&rdquo; from Deputies from time to time, but it is all on the lines of what we heard to-day from Clann na Talmhan&mdash;two Deputies speaking one after the other and contradicting each other in a matter of such high policy as the division of land.  We get the same thing from Fine Gael.  We have Deputy Mulcahy speaking with one voice and Deputy Hughes with another.  Deputy Dillon, if I may call him a Fine Gael Deputy&mdash;I do not know if he will take offence or not&mdash;is not any good either.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach to give careful consideration to the position of the agricultural industry as compared with that of other Irish industries.  We are now practically at the crossroads and it is a question of whether agriculture <Col N="91" /> is to hold its place as the premier industry or lose it.  It is a question of whether, in two or three years' time, we will have the agricultural community producing sufficient bread, butter, sugar and bacon to obviate the need for rationing, of any commodity, or whether we are to have still more rationing because the people will not work when they are not paid for that work.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry is <i>par excellence</i> the Fianna Fáil Deputy who cannot keep the cat in the bag.

If there were anybody in the field other than Deputy McGrath, we would vote for him, but Deputy McGrath is the only man who has a Party behind him and if we are to have any Government at all, we must vote for McGrath, God help us.&rdquo;  Of course, that is largely true, and I recommend it to the attention of the Parties on this side of the House.  That is the testimony of Deputy Corry, and he is no fool.  He has been engaged in the campaign in Cork and he knows the Cork people, and he tells us here, openly and frankly, that 50 per cent. of the people who voted for McGrath said: &ldquo;The only reason for which we are voting for McGrath is that there is nobody else to vote for.  If there was, we would not vote for McGrath,&rdquo; and, signs on it, we have been privileged to welcome Deputy McGrath into this House.</P>

      <P>He is 100 per cent. right when he says that if you increase costs on the agricultural industry, that industry <Col N="93" /> has nobody to whom it can pass that increased cost, and therefore if you allow the tariff racketeer in this country to pile costs on the backs of the farmers, you are crushing the farmer down to a position of slavery while the tariff racketeer grows fat on the farmer's labour.  Deputy Corry is 100 per cent. right, but his remedy for that is to turn the farmer into a tariff racketeer, to give him a victim on whom he can live.  The trouble, however, is that there is not any victim we can give the farmer.  The farmer is the only victim we have to dispose of and we have sold him to the tariff racketeer.  There is nobody left whom we can sell to the farmers.  They are the ones who have been sold into serfdom, and serfs do not have slaves.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Corry does not see is that he and his Party and their policy have made serfs of the farmers. Deputy Corry says you sold the farmers into the hands of the tariff racketeers and you will not let them pass on to anyone else the burden that is being put upon their backs by the tariff racketeers.  The only reason is that there is nobody else to whom they can pass it.  Why does not Deputy Corry wake up to that?  We cannot enable the farmers to pass on the costs. I have told them that a thousand times in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have 12,000,000 acres of arable land, of which 7,000,000 will provide all the foodstuffs which the stomachs of the Irish people would contain, if you fill each individual stomach with a ramrod.  That leaves the produce of 5,000,000 acres over.  You can burn it or dump it in the ocean, you can sell it on a foreign market or let the land lie fallow.  But remember that every acre of land we have is required to sustain families living upon it.  There are no vast estancias in Ireland, no wide ranches left.  Every acre we have is required&mdash;and far more if we could get it&mdash;to provide the minimum requirements of economic holdings for the people.  We cannot solve the problem of the congested areas, of the uneconomic holders, because we have not enough land.  If we divided every farm in Ireland over 40 acres, we would not have enough land to give every family at present living on the land a farm <Col N="94" /> of 25 acres.  Therefore, we cannot afford to leave a perch of Irish land uncultivated, we must extract from every rood of land the maximum we can get out of it, if our people are to enjoy a tolerable standard of living.</P>
    <P>If that is true, the produce of that 5,000,000 acres must be sold&mdash;and there is nowhere in Ireland to sell it.  The produce of 7,000,000 acres has filled the stomachs of every Irish man, woman and child as tightly, on 365 days of every year, as it is physically possible to fill them.  The produce of the remaining 5,000,000 acres must be sold. Here is where Deputy Corry was wrong.  He says the price on the foreign market is too low.  The price does not matter&mdash;and that is the blind alley at the end of which Deputy Corry has been battering his head for the last 15 years.  That is the obsession with the level of prices.  Prices do not matter.  What matters to the man who sells his commodity is profit and that is what Deputy Corry can never see. If I get £7 for a beast which has cost me £6 to put on the market, I have £1 profit; but if I get £40 for a beast and it cost me £40 10s. to produce it, I have lost half a sovereign.  The mistake Deputy Corry is making is that he would sooner get £40 for the beast and spend £40 10s. to produce it, than take the £10 for the beast and spend only £9 to produce it.  If he has got to sell in the foreign market&mdash;and there is no rational Deputy in this House who does not know that he must do so&mdash;let us face the fact that we cannot control the price on the foreign market and, if we cannot do that, then must not we, if we are to release our people from the serfdom which Deputy Corry describes, turn our minds to the problem of getting a profit for our farmers at the prices which are available on the foreign market?</P>
    <P>What is profit?  Profit is the difference between the cost of production and the price you get.  Profit is the gap between those two things.  It is the gap between the cost of production and the price you get that matters.  That is what people live on, that is what makes them rich or poor. If you could raise prices, you would widen that gap and increase the margin of profit.  If we cannot raise prices <Col N="95" />&mdash;and we cannot control them&mdash;if you bring down the cost of production, do you not produce the same result?  You will widen the gap, that gap is profit, it is out of that that the farmers live and it is the produce of that gap which will release them from the serfdom which Deputy Corry describes.  How, then, are we to achive that?  It can be done to-morrow if, by resolution of this House, we could increase the prices of every commodity we sold in the British market by 20 per cent. Can anyone doubt that we could pass the necessary resolution?  What would the effect of the increase be?  Simply to widen the gap between our cost of production and the price we get in Great Britain.  We cannot raise prices in Great Britain by a resolution of this House, but we can do something else. By a resolution of this House now, we can bring down the farmer's cost of production, thus widening the gap, thus getting for the farmer to-morrow all the benefit we would get him by increasing prices on the British market by 20 per cent.&mdash;and more, because if prices rose on the British market by 20 per cent to-morrow, there would be drawn into that market thousands of competitors to meet us there, who do not meet us there at present levels. That is all I have asked the Government to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry said that, if the manure ring in this country is entitled to manufacture the manures and produce their costings to the Department of Supplies and say to them: &ldquo;We want our cost of production, including depreciation, and a fair margin of profit, in the price fixed by you for artificial manure,&rdquo; why is not the farmer entitled to get the same concession? The answer is that the Department cannot give that concession to the Irish farmer, because the Irish farmer has to sell his surplus on the foreign market.  But it could and does give it to the manure ring and the manure ring collect out of the farmer. Take the Indian-meal ring.  When they got a monopoly in this country, they clapped 2/6 a cwt. on to Indian meal.  If it takes 7 cwts. of meal, which is a rough and ready reckoning, to fatten a pig, that meant that every <Col N="96" /> Irish farmer who fattened a pig had to pay 17/6 more for the meal a pig consumed than he would have had to pay if the Indian meal had not been given a monopoly.  The Irish farmer had to sell that pig in the British market and, when he went to the British market, he met the Danish farmer who was not paying that 2/6 extra for a cwt. of meal.  The Danish farmer was prepared to produce and sell the pig for a profit of 10/-.  The Irish farmer had to compete with that farmer's pig and, because it cost him 17/6 more than the Danish farmer to produce the pig, the Irish farmer lost 7/6 on the pig.  The Dane who sold 100 pigs in England went home with a profit of £50 in his pocket.  The Irish farmer who sold 100 pigs from the next stall went home a loser of £37 10s 0d.  Is it any wonder that the farmers of this country have been reduced to the condition of serfs?</P>
    <P>The remedy, according to Deputy Corry, is to set them growing beet for the production of sugar at a price higher than the 80/- at present being paid.  Sugar costs the consumer 5d. per lb. to manufacture at the present time.  The world price of sugar is likely to settle down after the present crisis has passed, at, approximately, 2¼d. per lb.  That is about 100 per cent. higher than it was pre-war.  That means that, in order to grow beet in this country, our people have to pay 3d. per lb. more for sugar than they should pay.  Threepence per lb. on sugar represents 28/- per cwt. or £28 per ton.  There are 100,000 tons of sugar consumed here annually and, therefore, Deputy Corry's suggestion means servitude for the farmers who have been sold to tariff racketeers. The mass of our people, over 70 per cent. of whom are farmers, are to pay £3,000,000 per annum towards the cost of sugar.  If, instead of growing beet, we imported the sugar we required and the money were appropriated not to the beet factory but to the Exchequer, with the £3,000,000 we could increase the family allowance going into every house from 2/6 to 7/-.</P>

      <P>Is there a Deputy who will argue with me that to increase <Col N="97" /> children's allowances going into every home to 7/- per child after the second child would be less of a social advantage than the payment of 80/- per cwt. to farmers to grow beet?  That dilemma has been forced upon us because this House has been deluded into selling the farmer into that slavery so effectively defended by Deputy Corry, not slavery to foreigners, not slavery imposed from outside, but slavery imposed by his own representatives in his own Parliament, sold by his own people into servitude to tariff racketeers who have come to this country from the four corners of the earth to live out of the sweat and blood of our people.</P>
      <P>How long is this Parliament, elected by the Irish people, going to suffer our people to be serfs in their own country for tariff racketeers whom we, representatives of the people, have placed in a privileged position and who wax fat at the expense of the ten-acre farmers of the west of Ireland?  The Irish people commemorate Davitt, Parnell and others who fought to make our people strong and independent and helped to establish them, immovable, in their own homes.  I wonder what they would think now of those people they so firmly established and were able to rescue from the servitude of Balfour and &ldquo;Buckshot&rdquo; Foster. Are they to be returned to far more detestable slavery by their own people, sold by their own representatives to slave drivers who count their gain in pounds, shillings and pence?</P>
      <P>The position of the Taoiseach is one of the most honourable, if not the most honourable to which any citizen of this country could aspire, not only because he is head of the Irish Government but because he is leader of Dáil Éireann, the custodian and defender of all our rights, privileges and duties.  I want to ask the Taoiseach a very explicit question, not in his capacity as head of the Government but in his capacity as leader of the House.

I want to ask him categorically a simple question, and I demand on behalf of Dáil Éireann a categorical answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But Deputy Corry said that he felt that the competition of large co-operative societies with shopkeepers seemed to him to be unfair. Now, I want to ask this question.  We have a co-operative society in Ballaghaderreen where I live.  I was one of the first shareholders in it.  I think it is a very valuable institution to have in any town where there is an adequate supply of milk.  Where the co-operative society enters into retail trade&mdash;selling to the agricultural community the goods they require&mdash;I <Col N="102" /> think they have a perfect right to do that if they want to, but I would ask this question: when they engage in trade of that character why do they not have to pay income-tax?  They pay none.  These co-operative societies become, in fact, joint stock companies and the shares are held by a number of neighbouring farmers.  Originally these farmers were the suppliers but in many cases some of the men, who became shareholders with the intention of being suppliers, have since ceased to be suppliers but have retained their shares.  When they embark on the business of selling sugar, tea, flour, manures, agricultural equipment, clothes and boots to the people of the neighbourhood what difference is there between the activities that they carry on and the business carried on by an ordinary shop owned by five or six people who have combined together to form a small joint stock committee?</P>
      <P>Now such a business in a town has to pay corporation profits tax and income-tax.  The co-operative society, which may be doing 10, 20 or 30 times as big a business and is annually distributing dividends among its shareholders and glorying in its ability to do so, pays no income-tax at all, and very frequently distributing, on the one hand, cash dividends and, on the other hand, dividends in the form of supplements to the price paid for milk to their suppliers.  Why are they free of income-tax, while the man who has built up his own little business without any assistance from Government funds, as all these co-operative societies have, without any of the publicity provided for the co-operative societies by the central organisation in Dublin, without any of the distinguished patronage which co-operative societies enjoy, has to pay income-tax?  That does not seem to me to be fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sometimes convenient to leave an unjust and inequitable law upon the Statute Book, but it is not a rôle that should be played by a Legislature such as this, which does represent all our people and which acknowledges the obligation to hold the scales evently between them&mdash;minority and majority <Col N="103" /> alike.  If we once consciously come to consent to the proposition that, where a vested interest in this country has grown strong enough, we, the Legislature, will forbear from facing that because the Government Party are afraid to tackle the vested interests, on that day we begin to slip into the morass of corruption which has brought older and more venerable Parliaments than this crashing to the ground.  Our people do know, I believe, that if freedom is to survive in this country they must for ever know that this Parliament can be neither bought nor intimidated by anyone.</P>
    <P>If it can be explained why co-operative societies should have this privilege while their neighbours are denied it, I will be glad to admit myself wrong. I have been watching it for 20 years and the more I watched it the more incomprehensible this discrimination has appeared to me to be.  Unless someone can clarify my mind and expose the error into which I have fallen, I maintain the position that I now occupy and I suggest to the Legislature that it is its duty to examine this question dispassionately and take such steps as may be necessary to require the co-operative societies to bear the same burdens as their direct competitors or to relieve their competitors of the burdens from which we delivered the co-operative societies.</P>
    <P>Now the last thing I want to mention is this.  Listening to Deputy Giles, it often strikes me that he talks more common sense in ten minutes than ten other Deputies talk in 12 months. Deputy Giles talked about education and making provision for the rural community and, particularly for the agricultural labourer.  Most of us Deputies have lived in the country and are familiar with the circumstances obtaining therein, and it must have struck every man and woman here who moved about amongst the people that there is one outstanding phenomenon to be observed in almost every townland, and that is, that you will find one farmer with a given acreage and income whose house is clean and neat and pleasant, whose table is well-furnished and whose children are a joy to look at.  You go down the road to a man who has the <Col N="104" /> same acreage and who you happen to know has the same income.  You go into his house and you find that it is dirty, that they are always pulling the devil by the tail, that the children are in rags, that the woman is an old streel with her blouse caught with a big pin across her front, her hair in wisps down over her forehead, and that there is neither comfort nor anything else to draw that man home when his day's work is done.</P>
    <P>I have been watching that for a long time and I have often wondered what was the real root of that trouble.  I have often been embarrassed when people have commented on the appalling poverty which must afflict agricultural labourers in such-and-such a district, I knowing well that at the time I could bring the critic to many houses of agricultural labourers which bore all the exterior signs of comfort and agreeable life, but the houses we happened to be looking at at the moment were houses where the woman of the house did not know how to use her husband's income, such as it was. A certain small percentage of these cases are due to the fact that the women or the men in the houses are either in delicate health and unable to do all that is necessary to be done to keep the house clean, or else they are of sub-normal intellect and, therefore, the kind of people it is virtually impossible to help in their home.  But a very, very large proportion are people who are working like niggers, eager and anxious to do the best they can. The women are up at the crack of dawn and will not go to bed until midnight. But the more they do the worse the house becomes.  They never catch up on their work; they are never able to reach it.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Taoiseach in that connection that that grave social problem in rural Ireland cannot be satisfactorily tackled until we can provide for the women of rural Ireland, rich and poor, at the end of the academic years they spend in the primary schools, a training in the elements of domestic economy and how to run a home.  Accordingly, I make this public suggestion for the solution of that grave and chronic problem: that we adopt one of two systems, <Col N="105" /> either the Swedish system or one of our own devising.  The Swedish system is that on to every national school there is built what you might call a hag, a lean-to, and to every one of these schools there is appointed a domestic economy instructress who goes around the schools in regular rotation, giving a day to each.  On the day she attends, the girls in the sixth standard and upwards are excused from their books and sent in to that teacher and they spend their day studying domestic economy of the kind they will be called upon to undertake in their own homes if they marry or remain spinsters in the locality where they were born.</P>
    <P>I think probably a better system would be to provide in the national schools that the girls who remain at school, instead of being allowed to stop schooling at 14, be required to continue until they are 15 years and in every parish we should establish a central parochial domestic economy school where there would be a bed in the hag like the feather bed they have in their homes, together with a kitchen and a hearth, representing the conditions that obtain in their own homes. Here the girls would be required to attend from 13 to 15 years of age. There should go around the schools that morning&mdash;that is, the national schools in the parish&mdash;a school bus and all the girls from 13 to 15 years of age who go into the national school will be collected in the bus and brought to the local parochial domestic economy schools.  There we would provide them with some academic learning, if it was required and it probably would, but at the same time as they were pursuing their academic studies, such as they were, they would be instructed in the elements of domestic economy, so that we could ensure that every girl leaving a national school could go home and help her mother for the years she remained at home and could keep a decent house for whatever man she married, when the time for marriage came, or keep her own room clean if it was God's will that she should remain a spinster for the rest of her days.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that would involve any material expense compared to the <Col N="106" /> advantage that would accrue to the community as a whole.  I believe it would dispose of a very serious social evil in our rural community.  I believe that if we had that problem disposed of, we would then see for the first time, in true perspective, the economic condition of our people.</P>
    <P>There are many people at this moment enduring all the pains and wretchedness of virtual destitution because the woman of the house is not making the best use of the exiguous income which is available to her.  I do not say this plan I adumbrate removes the necessity for pressing forward the task of raising the standard of living of our people, but it would ensure that whatever we were able to do along those lines could be turned to the best advantage by those into whose hands the incomes go.</P>
    <P>I like the idea of the central parochial school because I do not believe this job can be effectively done unless we can get the girls out of the school benches and into the kind of kitchen and bedroom and hen-house that they would be expected to look after if they became farmers' wives in later years.  I want them to be taught in those houses not in theory but in practice the every-day life which the wife of a small farmer in this country is expected to lead.</P>
    <P>When Deputies declare that there is no hope in the land in this country for a livelihood for the people who elect to live there, I beg of them to remember this, that there is not one amongst us, with very few exceptions, whose father or grandfather was not reared on a holding of land.  There is not a priest in the Church in this country who does not owe part at least of the means that enabled him to realise his vocation to such a holding.  There is not a country in the world that is not beholden, either for spiritual or medical care and solicitude, to men who were born, bred and reared on such holdings, and subsequently educated out of such holdings.</P>
    <P>I think most Deputies will agree with me that the fact that these holdings did educate those men, did provide for them in the way that we know they were provided for, was largely due to the women whom the farmers <Col N="107" /> married.  If they married good women who knew how to run the home to its best advantage, miracles could be performed, but no matter how good the women, if they did not know how to do the job&mdash;and a very difficult job it is to do&mdash;destitution and misery were their fate.</P>
    <P>The holdings presided over by mothers who were not equal to the task they were called upon to do have largely populated the slums of Liverpool and Glasgow and elsewhere. Young men and women fled from destitution and degradation at home to the greater destitution and degradation of industrial slums, choosing the devil they did not know in preference to the devil they knew.</P>
    <P>Those things, I suppose, Sir, are more vivid to people like yourself and myself who come from the province of Connaught and glory in that fact, but I direct the attention of Deputies from the less civilised parts of this country to the same problem and invite their co-operation in putting right something that I think calls for redress.</P>

      <P>The Estimate for the Taoiseach's Department is a most important one in view of the fact that the Taoiseach is head of the Government and the leader of Dáil Éireann.  The Taoiseach is responsible for the members of the Government, whom he nominates when the Government is being formed after each General Election.  He, as their leader and guardian, is responsible for their activities.  I believe that a word of advice and instruction and guidance should be delivered by the Taoiseach to those Ministers in charge of whom the people have placed him.</P>
      <P>If the Taoiseach was properly exercising his duty and properly realising his responsibility, he would not have in his Government one Minister who, I submit, is irresponsible in view of his conduct, and that is the present Minister for Local Government and Public Health.

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have no more to say on this point.  I thought I would have much wider scope to deal individually with these Ministers.  I am not concerned, like Deputy Dillon, with the things the present Government have done.  Every year, on the various Estimates, particularly the Taoiseach's Estimate, we hear praise from the Government side of this House bolstering up Government plans and schemes that have been adopted by the Government, and legislation introduced by the Government, to the fullest extent.  I am not concerned with what the present Government have done, and I think no Deputy on this side of the House should be concerned with what they have done. We should be concerned with what they did not do.  I say here now, in the presence of the Taoiseach, that the present Government have not taken any serious step to avoid the death of the Irish nation which is fast approaching day by day.  I say that nothing has been done by the present Government to end emigration, unemployment, poverty, debt, low wages, starvation, forced sales, evictions, high rates, high taxes.  The cost of living is going up by leaps and bounds while wages are going up with the speed of a snail. That is something that ought to concern <Col N="109" /> every Deputy of the Opposition and every Deputy of the Government Party who really has the interest of the Irish people at heart.  He should concern himself with those things which, I submit, the Government has not remedied.</P>
      <P>I say, as I have said on more than one occasion in this House, that if travel facilities were placed at the disposal of the vast majority of our young people in the morning, and if there were no restrictions on emigration, this country, within one and a half years, would be like the Sahara Desert, simply because there is not one able-bodied young man who would remain at home, in this country, to slave in poverty, under the conditions that are forced on him by the present Government if he could get a better and more decent standard of living by going across the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>We ought to be ashamed of ourselves that, after 20 years of our own Government, we have reached the stage when we have nothing to offer the young people.  Consider the sad state of young men, qualified Irish speakers, with the Fáinne, who have attended courses in the Fior-Ghaeltacht and who served in the forces of this country during the emergency and gave loyal service at the call of the Taoiseach when he told the Irish people that we were in grave danger of invasion.  When they were demobilised, they had to sign on at the various employment exchanges throughout the country.  There is the case of a young man in Lismore, a letter from whom I read in this House not very many months ago.  He was sent by the employment exchange to scrape the roads of County Waterford and to raise a heavy hammer in the stone quarries of Waterford, simply because there was no better employment to offer to him.  It is a lovely thing that we have men with spirit and with educational qualifications who are not ashamed to go out and toil in quarries or on the roadways, but I think the Taoiseach should feel small when he considers that the Government of which he is the leader has nothing better to offer such citizens than a heavy hammer to work eight hours a day in a stone quarry for 38/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> How many are there in a similar position?  How many young men are there to-day living under the most deplorable conditions that tongue could not express?  How many young men are there who on leaving school are looking to their parents for advice and guidance as to the steps they should take for their future careers?  How many are there who write to Deputies and Senators appealing and begging for influence with a view to securing jobs for them?  My experience as a member of this House for three years is that no week passes in which I do not obtain a bundle of correspondence from qualified persons seeking positions.</P>
    <P>There is one principal step which the Government should contemplate and which they should take quickly, that is, a step to end unemployment in this country.  We may be told that unemployment is not as great to-day as it was in years past.  That may be so, but it is simply because England was good enough and was in a position to employ 175,000 of the best, young able-bodied Irish men and women who were forcibly driven from their home and their land and their family.  They were driven to England to obtain work for wages that were denied them by the Government of this country.  I am sorry that such a state of affairs exists.  At the present time the workers, to the number of 175,000, are not sorry they have emigrated because they have certainly kept the life blood flowing in the veins of their fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters at home by the cheques and money orders that flow into this country from England every Saturday morning.  There is many a home that would have been in a state of chaos if it had not been for the money that was sent home by the sons and fathers and daughters working in England.</P>
    <P>They emigrated to secure employment so that they might fill the cupboards at home that would otherwise be empty, and could be empty for present Government policy.  The cupboards were kept supplied by the proceeds of the labour that these workers were forced to seek abroad.  As I have often said from the public platform, the saddest part of the whole thing is <Col N="111" /> that the vast majority of the people do not seem to realise the folly that while 175,000 of our people were working in England to send home funds to support their relatives, their relatives were lubricating their throats, with John Bull's money, to praise the Fianna Fáil policy.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that we had that experience in the past.  If the Irish people sow nettles they cannot expect roses to grow.  I submit that the nettles were sown in the past, and are beginning to sting sorely now.  The sooner the Irish people get a proper sting of the nettles they have sown the sooner they will realise that if they want to grow roses they must sow the proper seed.  I am of the opinion that, no matter what kind of a picture may be painted by the Taoiseach when he is replying to-night, as an honest man he must admit that he has failed to solve the great problem of unemployment. I can remember reading a speech in the newspapers that was made by the Taoiseach, I think, before he became Leader of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but I think the speech was made more recently.  I think he was Taoiseach at the time. His statement was to the effect&mdash;a hair shirt for one, a hair shirt for all.  I submit that he has changed very much from the policy he was preaching when he advocated a hair shirt for one, a hair shirt for all, because to-day I see that it is a silk shirt for the rich and no shirt at all for the poor.  I am sorry that he has stood for, and subscribes to, that policy.  Unemployment is a curse in any country.  It is the curse in this country. It has been encouraged by the fact that we have a Government which is paying doles and subsidies to unemployed persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say, as I have often said before and as I have preached in my constituency night after night, that no Government should pay any man a penny by way of dole.  I do not want to be misrepresented by speakers from Government platforms when they address a group of horrified unemployed <Col N="112" /> workers by saying that I am advocating that they should not secure some means of existence while they are unemployed.  I say there is no reason why any citizen should be unemployed. I would not pay any man for doing nothing.  This Government has certainly paid thousands of pounds to people for doing nothing.  It is a waste of money to pay any man for standing at a street corner.  Instead of doing that, I would give the money that is being paid out in doles by way of a subsidy to prospective employers or farmers to add to whatever wage they can afford to pay to their workers in order that workers may get a decent wage.</P>
    <P>Any man who is unemployed and is in receipt of financial assistance from the Government for doing nothing is not an asset but a liability to the State. The sooner the Government realises that a man's value is in the work that he can do, in the things that he can produce, the better.  If the Government is going to continue to pay doles to men for standing at street corners and keeping up lamp posts, there is a very serious responsibility on it, because it is encouraging laziness.  It is making it a criminal offence for that man to do a day's work or two or three days' work.  If a man can get 24/- a week for doing nothing, he is not going to work for 35/- a week. Pay no man for doing nothing.</P>
    <P>There is a huge amount of work to be done in this country on drainage schemes, if put into operation, on afforestation, on bog development schemes, on road making, on the development of our mineral resources, and on housing.  We all know it is essential that such work schemes should be carried out.  Yet we see the Government paying out huge sums of money by way of unemployment assistance.  The sooner the Government realise that it should pay no man for doing nothing the better it will be. Instead, it should pay men wages and put them into productive employment. I do not mean that a person who is incapable of doing work should not be given any assistance by the State.  If persons are disabled or medically unfit for work, then the appropriate Department should provide them with a sum <Col N="113" /> sufficient to give them a decent living&mdash;that is people who are prevented, through no fault of their own, from taking part in the nation's work.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Taoiseach did not see fit to accept completely the plan put forward by his Lordship the Bishop of Clonfert, the Most Reverend Dr. Dignan.  I believe that if he had done so it would have gone a long way towards relieving a number of our social evils.  Everybody knows that Dr. Dignan resides in rural Ireland, and that he is wide awake to the great evils of unemployment and to the circumstances of the poorer sections of the people.  He was the one big man, the one mighty mind, that spoke fearlessly, and suggested a remedy for the horrid state of affairs that exists to-day, despite the fact that the present Government gave his plan the blind eye and that the Taoiseach gave it the deaf ear.  I was quite pleased to read the statement that was made recently at a trade union congress by, I think, Deputy Everett, to the effect that he believes that legislation is going to be introduced at an early date whereby the Dr. Dignan plan will be implemented. If the Taoiseach does not wish to study Dr. Dignan's plan, I hope that he will spend some of his time studying some other plan that will help to relieve the horrid hardships that exist throughout the country to-day.</P>
    <P>I look upon the Estimates that are introduced for the Departments each year as an opportunity for stocktaking. To-day we are taking stock of the Taoiseach's Department.  Nothing has been done that we need be proud of since his Estimate was before us a year ago, two years ago or three years ago. We do not see that anything is going to be done to relieve the hardships that exist in the homes of the country.  We have the old age pensioners.  I am not going to make any long reference to them because their case was very ably discussed in the House in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>I believe that the standard of living that is being offered by the present Government to old people, to those whom we have been taught to love, honour and respect, is something that we cannot be proud of.  Those old people have completed <Col N="114" /> 70 years of labour and toil. At that age they should be able to take their rest in comfort for the remainder of their days.  I strongly urge on the Taoiseach that he should use his offices to see that steps are taken to increase the standard of living for them in their old age.  The Taoiseach studies international affairs and the conditions in other countries.  He knows very well that in the territory he refers to as the Black North&mdash;the Six Counties&mdash;there is an Ulster Government which offers the old people an allowance of 22/6 per week.  Here, in the Twenty-Six Counties, we have nothing to offer them but 10/-, plus 2/6 emergency cash allowance, which they have to beg from the relieving officer and thus bring themselves to the same level as paupers.  That is a bad position in which to have any section of our community.  I am sorry that the old age pensioners have been treated, in my opinion, with the height of disrespect. Every time an appeal was made on their behalf, it was without result.  In the Six Counties, 22/6 is payable to the old people, while here our allowance is 10/-, and then we hear appeals from all sides of the House for North and South to come together in national unity.  That is the desire of every true Irishman, whether he belongs to the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Farmer or Labour Party.  Surely, the people of Northern Ireland would not be so insane as to surrender that right to 22/6 a week and throw in their lot with the people of the Twenty-Six Counties who, in similar circumstances, are entitled to only 10/- a week.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not going to offer a solution for Partition.  I was merely making a comparison, if I might, with your permission.  That is the state of affairs which does not exist in any country outside the Twenty-Six Counties.  I ask the Taoiseach to apply some remedy whereby assistance will be given to those who are unable to work so that they may be able to live in decency.  As regards wages, I am surprised that some serious attempt has not been made to increase them all <Col N="115" /> round.  Wages are by no means in accordance with the cost of living.  I cannot see how any citizen can support a wife and family on £2 a week. In the country, the workman will have a family of six to ten and I cannot see how an agricultural labourer can support such a family on £2 2s. or £2 4s. a week, as the case may be.  The wages policy of the Government is a bad one.  The policy has been to keep wages down and keep the worker in slavery.  The workers are commencing to realise that no serious attempt is being made to put them in a decent way of living.  I am sure that the Taoiseach has read <i>Rerum Novarum.</i> Pope Leo held that the worker was entitled to a living wage in order to bring up his family in Christian decency.  The Taoiseach knows that rates of wages at present are not in accordance with Christian teachings, nor are they sufficient to enable the citizen to pay rent, purchase the necessaries of life and keep himself fit for the employment in which he is engaged. That matter needs serious consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I may make a short reference to the agricultural community. As Deputy Dillon has rightly pointed out, we have 12,500,000 acres of arable land.  The Deputy pointed out that 7,000,000 acres of that land would produce sufficient food to keep every man, woman and child in this State sufficiently fed for 12 months of the year.  There is something radically wrong when we have 12,500,000 acres of arable land and only 2,500,000 of a population and we have not sufficient for that population. Some economists tell us that an acre of land will produce enough food to keep the life in one citizen for a year.  I remember reading that on one occasion.  How are we to account for the fact that we have 12,500,000 acres of arable land and only 2,500,000 of a population and that the greater part of them are half starved?  That is a thing I cannot fathom.  No serious step has been taken to put the smallholders in the way of producing food. We have many smallholders and we have huge ranches.  No steps have been taken to see that those ranches <Col N="116" /> are properly acquired, divided and distributed amongst the small holders. In my constituency, as in many other rural constituencies, attention is being drawn month after month to the fact that there are there ranches of the best land while we have smallholders, agricultural workers, cottage tenants and landless men who are well equipped to work that land.  Cottage tenants have only a rood of ground, which would not be sufficient to supply their vegetable requirements for 12 months. Those cottage tenants who have to keep a cow for the supply of milk to their families have to graze the cow on the high road.  At the same time, we allow huge tracts of land to be undivided. Day after day, claims are coming to the responsible Government Department and even to the Taoiseach for action to relieve the congestion which exists.</P>
    <P>A serious attempt should be made to smash the ranches.  I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that the greatest enemies the Government had were the ranchers.  The greatest enemies the Irish people have are the ranchers. When we were discussing the question of the division of the ranches, a Minister made reference to the case of an alien or a citizen who bought up huge tracts of land, not for the purpose of producing food but for the purpose of gambling, turning over huge profits, dividing it up and selling it out to whatever big farmer in the district would give him the best price for it, making the big farmer a rancher and leaving the poor man and the small-land holder completely aside.</P>
    <P>I am sorry we were told that that was Government policy.  I can remember distinctly being told that it was Government policy that no landless man was to secure an allotment of land.  I say it is bad Government policy which allows any citizen, whether he may be Lord this, Earl that or the Duke of something else, to deal with land as he wishes.  Legislation should be introduced to ensure that the land of this country will not be used for the purposes of gambling, that it should be utilised only for the purposes of food production and should be distributed amongst the people likely to make the best use of it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="117" /> Great encouragement has been given to certain groups of capitalists to go round the Twenty-Six Counties in the very same manner as Cromwell went centuries ago, plundering and destroying. They purchase every huge mansion and estate that they possibly can and deprive the local people of any opportunity of having these lands divided amongst them.  They sell it out to their own friends or to whomever gives them the biggest price.  I know one case in my own constituency of a ranch purchased by a capitalist for £5,000.  Before he had finished he had made £17,000 out of it.</P>
    <P>Is it not a sad state of affairs that under Government policy these capitalists and financiers are allowed to grow fatter and richer at the expense of the poor small holder, the cottage tenant or the landless man who is allowed to grow thinner and poorer under that same Government policy?  I think that no sympathy should be shown to ranchers.  Their lands should be broken up into suitable allotments to be divided amongst the most deserving applicants.  I believe that if the ranches were dealt with in that way the unemployment question would be solved.  I think that the Government ought to give very serious consideration to these two problems.  When we are faced with a number of wrongs, we can only right them one by one, but if we take unemployment and try to solve it and then proceed to divide the ranches amongst the small holders and deserving applicants, we shall certainly have done a very good day's work.</P>
    <P>At the present time there is a certain amount of discontent in this country. I can recall a statement made quite recently by a prominent member of the Government in Athlone, that a certain section of the people were out to arouse suspicion amongst the whole Irish people.  That statement got great publicity in all the Irish newspapers.  The statement was quite correct.</P>
    <P>I can say there is a movement on foot and the Taoiseach knows it.  It is about time the people began to get suspicious, seeing the state of affairs that exists at present with wages as they are, unemployment unsolved, ranches left undivided, rates soaring to their present pitch and huge additions <Col N="118" /> to taxation being piled on every day.  It is about time people did become suspicious and ask themselves when all this squandermania is going to end.</P>
    <P>Something will have to be done in regard to financing the farmers of the country.  I have advocated that here on more than one occasion; for example, on the Taoiseach's Estimate this time last year.  Appeals may be made from this side of the House for better rates of wages for agricultural workers.  These appeals certainly are justified and there is no Irish farmer would stand in the way of the payment of a good decent wage for an honest week's work but, as I pointed out before, you cannot get money out of a farmer's pocket unless you put it into it.  If the Taoiseach goes over the records, he will find that the big majority of farmers are on the verge of bankruptcy. He will find that month after month farmers are appealing for time to pay their annuities or are appealing for financial assistance or for all sorts of grants and loans.  I think that all that indicates that farmers generally are in a bad way.  I think they should be placed in a position in which they would be more independent and be able to carry on all their all-important work free from the worry of financial embarrassment.  At present the vast majority of farmers are forced into a position of beggary.  They are begging from one end of the year to another.  How many farmers are constantly writing to Deputies and public representatives asking them to use their influence to get loans from the Agricultural Credit Corporation or asking them for recommendations to various financial institutions in order to secure a certain amount of capital?</P>
    <P>I think there should be some scheme&mdash;I am not capable of outlining what the scheme should be; I leave that to the Government or some higher authority&mdash;to finance farmers to their full requirements.  The Taoiseach knows that no man can work and be contented whilst a weight of debt is hanging over him.  He must know that the vast majority of our farmers are born in debt, live in debt, die in debt and leave a legacy of debt to their <Col N="119" /> sons and daughters.  Something will have to be done to remedy the position in which the agricultural community finds itself to-day.  The banks do not seem to be as ready to make advances to farmers as they are to make advances to other citizens.  I say, as I said before, that a burglar or a gangster with a six shooter is more welcome in the financial institutions of the State than an Irish farmer.  I think that should not be the position, that the Government should make our farmers independent.  The only way to do that is to see that money is made available for them to enable them to stock their land, to produce stock for sale and to pay decent wages.  You cannot get juice out of a stone.</P>

    <P>Deputy Mulcahy deplored the fact that I did not give a general review. I do not deny that there is something to be said for it.  I have often asked myself if it would be possible to give, at the beginning of a session of Parliament, a general indication of the legislative programme intended to be put before the Dáil by the Government and, at the end of the session, to take stock and to see how far we had been able to get with the work which was proposed.  The fact, of course, is <Col N="120" /> that each Department does that; at least when the Estimates come on, each Department gives&mdash;I do not say that it does so in advance&mdash;a general indication of policy.  As each year comes around and the Estimate for a Department comes to be considered, the Minister in charge does give a review of the work his Department has been doing and very often indicates what is intended for the year ahead.  If there was an attempt to review that whole situation on my Estimate, I am afraid it would be a complete repetition of the debate on the various Departments, so that, although I understand, from a certain angle, the desirability of what the Leader of the Opposition suggests, I am afraid it is not workable; at least, so far, I have not been able to work out any plan which would enable it to be done.</P>
    <P>I suppose the first thing which should be done is to give a general indication of what our policy is.  I have been doing that myself and other members of the Government have been doing it not merely during the years we have been in office but for years before that.  There was raised here, for instance, the question of our attitude towards private enterprise, and the suggestion was made that we were sapping initiative and, as some Deputy suggested, crushing private enterprise by regulation, etc.  Our position in that regard is that we believe in private enterprise, that we conceive that the part which the State ought to play is to encourage private enterprise and only to come in to assist private enterprise when either it is incapable of doing the work or has shown very clearly that it is not going to do the work necessary in the general interest.  Our policy has been based on that general idea.</P>
    <P>The line we have taken, therefore, is, so to speak, a half-way house.  It is not one of complete <i>laissez faire,</i> so far as private enterprise is concerned. We believe that private enterprise, apart from the part it plays in providing a livelihood for those engaged in it, has a part to play in regard to the general interest, and, whether we are dealing with industrialists or with the farming community, that is generally <Col N="121" /> our attitude.  The first duty of the farmer, as it is the first duty of the industrialist, is to secure a living for himself and his family, but he has also, in the way in which he uses private property, a social duty.  The duty of the State is to see that a proper balance is kept between the social duty which the farmer owes to the community and his right to the use of his property for his private interests.</P>
    <P>I do not think it can be shown that there has been any interference with private enterprise here, except where, as I have indicated, it was shown that the public interest demanded it, or that private enterprise in itself was not producing efficiently the goods needed or was not producing them at all.  There are Deputies who take the free trade point of view and argue here as economists have been arguing, or were arguing, for half a century or so.  By taking a partial account of economic life, they will try to prove that they are right, but the fact is that most nations in the world had to abandon it because the premises on which it was supposed to work most efficiently did not exist.</P>

      <P>I quite admit that we are not living in a perfect world by any means, and it is a question of on which side the balance of advantage lies.  A partial estimate, however, of the economic situation is not enough, and I suggest that some of the Deputies who talk altogether from the free trade point of view are taking only a partial view of the matter and not looking at it as a whole.  The members of the Opposition who have spoken have spoken from a variety of contradictory standpoints.  It was suggested by one Deputy&mdash;I think, Deputy Dillon&mdash;that they ought to get together and try to frame a common policy.</P>

      <P>I leave it to the Deputies.  Let them try.  Deputy Dillon is a very bad example himself of this getting together, seeing that he is in an independent position and does not get in with any of the other Parties.  During the general election, when a policy was suggested which I believed would be a bad policy and which I opposed, I made the suggestion, that the various Parties which were, as individual Parties, contesting the election should come together, try to frame a common policy and proceed on the basis of that common policy.  It is clear, however, listening to the arguments they put forward and the viewpoints they expressed, that they will find it very difficult to come together.  You have the two extremes&mdash;the extreme individualistic point of view represented in the Opposition and the extreme socialistic view on the other hand.  I hold that we are keeping to the middle of the road and that the policy which we have pursued is the middle policy, the one likely to get the best results.</P>

      <P>I do not understand what the Deputy wants to convey, but it does not matter what it is.  Ours is the policy of common sense, of saying that either of the extreme situations would be worse than the present one. Deputy Mulcahy suggested that we should draw the dividing line clearly. We cannot do that.  You cannot draw a dividing line and say in what circumstances the State will come in. That has to be judged according to the circumstances of a particular case.  It has to be argued out whether, in an individual case, private enterprise is managed so efficiently that it is meeting the general social requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be differences of opinion on that and as to when the State ought to come in and when it ought not.  If I am asked an opinion in general, I would say the State should be slow about jumping in.  I think we have been slow in jumping in in that way. Our hope was that private enterprise, if given a bit of time, might be able to find remedies, and it was only when we satisfied ourselves that there was <Col N="123" /> no likelihood of these remedies being found that the State took action.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton seemed to suggest that we were in favour of emigration. Of course we are not.  It has been the aim with us from the start to find a livelihood in this country for as many Irishmen and women as possible.  That was the foundation of much of our policy with regard to promoting industries. We believe that only a certain number could live on the land.  I have often given the example of a farmer's household with four or five children, where it is quite obvious that only one can remain behind and, if a boy or girl marries into some neighbouring family, there are only two, on an average, out of that family likely to remain on the land.  If you have settled upon the land already as many as the land can reasonably hold, then out of every farmer's household of five children three must find a livelihood somewhere else.</P>
    <P>Should we attempt to find the livelihood at home or should they have to emigrate?  The only way we could see of getting them a livelihood at home was to try to build up here industries in which they might find a livelihood, as only a certain limited number could be absorbed into the professions. We built up our industries to supply things which were needed by our community, in so far as it was reasonably possible to do so.  I say &ldquo;reasonably possible,&rdquo; because you can take any policy to such an extreme that it becomes almost absurd.  For example, I was asked many a time if we wanted to grow tea, bananas or oranges here.  I suppose you could grow oranges under glass, but it certainly would not be a very profitable sort of business, I imagine.</P>

      <P>I did not say one way or the other.  As a matter of fact, it was there&mdash;though I was not aware that it had become so light&mdash;over a period of years.  Deputy Norton spoke about emigration.  I cannot imagine any Irish Government which would welcome emigration, but if you cannot provide the industries to keep your people employed there is no way out of it.  During the war, I suppose that, by using whatever assets we had, we could keep our people here, if we were forced to do so, and we could have maintained them unemployed.  That would not be good for them and certainly would not be good for the country as a whole.  They went away, but the emigration during the war was an exceptional situation.  The marvel was that we were able to keep so many of our industries going during the war. There was a shortage of raw materials and a certain attraction in the lure of high wages, which took them away.  I feel pretty certain that a large number of those who emigrated during that period will come back again.  I hope so.</P>
      <P>The suggestion was made by Deputy Dockrell that we had not skilled tradesmen to help us to get on with some of the work for which we were preparing.  I do not think it can be said, at the moment, that it is a shortage of skilled tradesmen that is holding anything up.  At the moment, anyhow, I think it is shortage of certain materials.  The moment those raw materials become available, I think we will get ahead.  As regards those who were married and whose families are here, I feel certain they are likely to come back again.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure. The position may be that you have not at the moment such a volume of work that it will go out generally that there is work for those people at home. Skilled tradesmen are not likely to leave what they regard as steady employment, unless it is pretty certain that there will be a continuous flow of employment here at home.  In the past, the rates of wages paid here compared very favourably with the rates paid in London and elsewhere.  In some cases, they were higher here.  It would be very strange if a large number of our people do not come back, when it becomes widely known that there is a livelihood and a continuous flow of employment here in any particular business.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton spoke about France. I have replied to the Deputy already, that the position is that the French Government made known to us that they would like to have some of our people go over there, but we did not enter into any formal negotiations of any kind.  It is quite obvious that, if we were going to do that, a number of questions which Deputy Norton raised would very properly be raised. We are certainly not encouraging any people at all to go.  There was an interview given by some French Minister, or member of the administration, to an <i>Irish Press</i> reporter which was published in the Press here and which gave rise, unfortunately, to a good deal of misunderstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton also spoke on the question of new Ministries.  I expect that steps will be taken after the recess to deal with that matter.  There will be no question of dealing with it now.  I pointed out, I think, when the matter was raised before by the Deputy, that I did not see that a great deal was going to be gained on the lines he suggested, namely that there would be much saving on overlapping. That is not what we hope to gain by having new Ministries dealing with the income maintenance services.  I should like to say this about Ministries in general, that quite a number of Deputies want a new Ministry for this and a new Ministry <Col N="126" /> for that.  We could go on sub-dividing the work done by the various Departments of State in such a way that we would have three, four or five demands for Ministries.  We have a relatively small House and it is desirable that the strength of the Executive, in proportion to the strength of the House, should be kept as low as possible, consistent with doing the work efficiently. I may say that, as far as I am concerned, there are two or three other cases in which a good case could be made for independent Ministries, but we have to look at the matter very carefully before we go too far on that line.  Personally, I only agreed to these when I felt there was an almost unanswerable case for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite a different matter.  If my note is correct, he asked me about the British.  Some one raised a question with regard to New Zealand at some stage.  I do not think it was Deputy Norton.  I think it was Deputy Cogan, who went on the other foot.  It is all very well to compare our circumstances with New Zealand, but the fact is they are hardly comparable.  Although we are relatively a thinly populated country we have seven times the density of population of New Zealand.  We are an old country.  There has been organisation here for centuries.  New Zealand is a new country, with nearly four times our area, but its population is only half ours.  That gives eight times less density of population or, in rough <Col N="128" /> figures about seven times.  They have four times our area and half our population, and that gives a density of one-eighth. The Deputy is not going to suggest that with a country so favourably situated on the globe, with a good climate, fertile land, and a good deal of mineral resources, we could hope in our State to have anything like the comfort that could be got by that small population.  To attempt to do it in any way like that would mean that we would have to cut down our population seven-fold. I do not know whether you could argue logically that, if you had only one-seventh of the population with the present amount of land, by using machinery, we would be able to get a higher standard of material comfort.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan wanted increased holdings.  I do not know whether he meant an increase in the size of holdings or an increase in the number.  I do not exactly remember what he said.  My note merely says &ldquo;increased holdings&rdquo; and I am not quite sure now what he meant exactly.  Let us take it under either heading.  I suppose &ldquo;increased holdings&rdquo;, if it means anything, means that the uneconomic holders should be brought up to a reasonable standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That means bringing the holding up to a reasonable size. That is the actual policy of the Land Commission and that is its prime function. Its first duty is to use the available land, first of all, to increase the existing holdings which are uneconomic in size.  The moment we tried to fix the economic size of a holding we got into trouble.  I myself was inclined to accept the viewpoint of some of the western Deputies.  I wanted to keep the amount of land given to each particular holder as small as possible.  The fact is that it costs about £1,000 to establish a 25-acre <Col N="129" /> holding; of that £1,000 only one-third comes back and gives some return and, therefore, a present of £700 is given by the State with each parcel of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait a moment. Now, we have to be very careful in what we do.  We have to exercise the greatest care because this is done in the interests of the community rather than in the interests of the particular individual.  We must, therefore, protect the community interests in the matter and ensure, as far as we can, that the person who gets the land will utilise it in a manner which will be of value to the community as a whole. That is the only return the community asks in return for that £700.  That £700 is given to the holder to enable him to rear and maintain a family upon it and, in process of doing so, to give to the community the goods and services which it needs; in other words to produce for the community. We tried, therefore, to ensure that the people who got this land would use it properly.  The people most likely to prove efficient in using such land are those who are already holding a certain portion of it, and the idea is to add to what they already have an amount sufficient to make the holding reasonably economic.  I got into trouble in earlier days when I pressed for the lowest economic amount.  I was surprised when I was told that in rich land like Meath and Westmeath 30 acres was the economic size of a holding in order to provide a man with the means of rearing his family and making him independent of other factors.  I remember on one occasion, when I was pressing for a little over 20 acres, being told by people, who <Col N="130" /> had no wish to lead me astray, that 30 acres or 35 acres were essential in County Meath.  That rather amazed me, because I knew the size of holdings in other parts of the country&mdash; holdings which were much smaller&mdash; where industrious farmers raised families, educated their children properly and even gave them facilities for going in for professions and, on the whole, lived quite comfortably.  I found it difficult to understand why in an area of rich land, such as you have in County Meath, a larger holding was desirable or essential, while in other parts they did with very much less and were able to get on reasonably well on much smaller acreage.</P>

The amount of land, therefore, in the individual holding went up; I think it is an average of 25 acres of good land now.  Most of us will admit that we should not increase it unduly.  I agree with Deputy Giles's suggestion that if we settle people on the land they should live off the land and should be independent of work on roads or other work to supplement their incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan painted a very interesting picture of my visit to his home town of Dunmore and he attributed to me a statement which I think I would be quite incapable of making because it required so much imagination in order to express it in the way in which he expressed it.  I do not think I would have been capable of making that statement.  But he did remind me of something else; he reminded me of something which I have <Col N="131" /> often said.  Often in the past I have driven down to the West, down towards Frenchpark and in Deputy Dillon's direction.</P>
    <P>One of the things which struck me forcibly in the course of that drive was that in the greater part of it the homesteads were very spares.  Suddenly one would come to a point where, stretched in front of one, would be a large expanse of obviously poor land and all over that there would be clusters of little whitewashed cottages.  I was struck by the extraordinary situation of having such a large population in an area like that, existing somehow, while in the rich land behind there were so few.  I feel there was something in that situation and I think we should do everything in our power to remedy that.  We should put upon these large areas of Meath and Westmeath more homesteads.  I think that is the policy which has been pursued and it is quite wrong to say, as has been said, that we turned our backs on that policy. Even during the emergency that policy continued under many difficulties.  The only people who were competent to implement the tillage policy of the Government during the emergency were those who had some knowledge of the land.  We had, therefore, to take over a very substantial proportion of the staff of the Land Commission to do that particular work.  Despite that, we managed to get along.  During the period in which we have been in office we have distributed two-thirds of a million acres of land while our predecessors distributed something in the region of 450,000 acres.  It must be remembered too, that it is much easier to carry out a policy of land division in the early stages because there is more power of selectivity; and it is easier to distribute land in the initial stages because there is more and better land at one's disposal.  It is essentially more rapid in the beginning than in the end and it is only when one is approaching the end that one has to deal with problems like rundale, and so on, in the West.  I think one Deputy suggested that land division was a cure for unemployment; other Deputies blew that suggestion sky-high.  Very little calculation would show that that could not be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="132" /> Somebody stated that we have about 12,000,000 acres of arable land.  I have often tried to find some firm figure of the acreage of what you could really call arable land.  Although you find over 11,000,000 acres put down several times for it, I have been forced to come to the conclusion that we have really only roughly about 10,000,000 acres of land that you could call arable land, 25 acres of which, say, would constitute an economic farm.  If you take 10,000,000 acres and give 25 acres to each farm&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am telling the Deputy my experience.  I tried to find out and the 11,000,000 odd are not accepted.  I asked, I think it was the last time, would they give me some figure and I was told that I might take 10,000,000 as the figure.  Even if it is a little bit more, let us make a calculation on roughly 10,000,000.  With 25 acres for each farm, you will have only about 400,000 families on the land.  You will find that if you have farms of that size you will not have any labour except family labour.  A farm of that size has to depend on family labour. Therefore, you would have hardly any agricultural labourers as such.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>When you suggest 25 acres, do you mean 25 statute acres, or 25 Irish acres?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of statute acres.  The other would be very substantial.  The place where disagreement comes in, you might say, lies in the figure between 25 statute and 25 Irish.  When you do that you find that it would support only a relatively small population.  Then, again, the natural growth would mean that you would have another problem. If you settled it for one particular period of time, the moment the families developed you would have another problem.  We have been dealing with the problem of those who will have to live elsewhere than on the land.  I am not suggesting, of course, that if you have people living on the land you will not have distributors of various kinds, shopkeepers, etc.  But the position is that we are trying very <Col N="133" /> hard to finish land division.  I suppose there is hardly any other matter in reference to which I have been regarded by the Ministers in charge and by the Departments as such a nuisance as land division and trying to push it ahead.  At one time we increased the staff from about 700 to 1,100.  We increased it substantially.  As you can see, there was a 50 per cent. increase.</P>
      <P>There was a good deal of opposition to that on the ground that it was not the best way, that you cannot divide land like that, that you cannot divide it in a hurry and do good work; that if you want to do the thing with thoroughness you have to take your time about it, and that there is no magic want that you can just wave and say: &ldquo;Here is the land divided.&rdquo; There are a whole lot of processes to be gone through if you are to do the thing in the way that will work out best for the community.  You cannot start and deprive a person of property without some legal process.  You have to arrange to have an examination of these individual cases.  Then you have to select the applicants, go through the applicants to see that the person who is most likely to use the land properly is given the land and that, in regard to claims for enlarging holdings or giving economic holdings, cases that are worthy of consideration will be considered and the other cases turned down.  Where there is land going, everybody wants a bit of it and, if you are making a present of something like £700 to individuals, you know very well that you will have quite a number of applicants for it.  All that has to be gone through and takes a considerable amount of time.  Then, as was pointed out when we were increasing the staff, the fact that you are training them slows down the process for a period.  Later, you may get an increase in activity and in results; but at the beginning the work is actually slowed down because the new people who are brought in have to be trained. Anybody who has any experience knows that you will have to spend a considerable amount of time with people who are coming in for the first time to see that they do not make serious mistakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> There are various estimates as to the amount of land to be distributed. Under our present policy, unless we are to press that very far and go beyond it, we would not get much more than 500,000 acres more to be distributed. That is all the land that is available. A large proportion of that land has to be used in making uneconomic holdings economic.  Before we reduce the amount that is available we have to consider very carefully the problem of the West.  There you have a large number of people on very small holdings.  If you want to make economic holdings of these, you have to get the people to agree to leave these holdings.  You have to try to get land somewhere else on which to put them.  It will be a much slower process.  If we are to deal with the West, with our present staff at any rate&mdash;and as I pointed out, since we came in it was increased by about 50 per cent.&mdash;we will not be able to go faster because the problems we are dealing with to-day are more intricate. If we are to go the distance we can in regard to resettlement of the land and solve the problem of congestion, we cannot hope for a much more rapid rate of land division than in the past no matter how hard we press for it, because the problems to be solved are much more difficult.  I admit that some of the difficulties we had before are fading away.  It was very hard to get people accustomed to farming land in the West to leave it, but that is now gradually remedying itself and the Land Commission are not meeting the same difficulties they met before.</P>
    <P>Another point that was raised was co-operative effort.  We certainly have been encouraging co-operative effort so far as we can.  The worst thing that has happened in modern times is the effect upon us of what is done elsewhere. People are looking to the State to do things which they ought to do themselves. That is one of the most harmful things.  There are a number of things that can be done by local people to help themselves, if we encourage the local organisations to do them.  I am sorry that I only heard portion of Deputy Giles's speech.  He spoke about something being done with regard to the education of girls.  It is a matter <Col N="135" /> with which I and every member of the Government and every one interested in the country must be closely concerned. We had a picture of two families in relatively similar circumstances to start with and with at least the same possibilities available to them and the difference between the household that is well-managed, particularly by the housewife, and the other which is not well managed is apparent to everyone.  If we could make it possible that those who are managed badly would be managed as well as the best, we would have achieved a great deal, indeed, for the raising of the general standard of comfort of our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very glad to consider it.  It is a thing I like to do&mdash;read through these debates&mdash;and although it is not possible to answer all the points that are raised and deal with the various suggestions that are interlarded with a lot of useless matter, I try to cover most of them.  I like to consider them and examine the possibilities. At any rate, this is not a new thing, the putting of an extra room on to a local school.  That was one of the points suggested, and it is not quite new.  When I was in the Department of Education I know that suggestion was examined.  One of the troubles was that it involved more than merely the cost of erection.  To put this extra room on to the schools would cost about £2,000,000.  That expenditure would not stop me if that was all that had to be considered, but there was also the question of the teachers.  That would have added very considerably to the cost at that time.  At the same time, if it was clear that we would get good results, it is the type of expenditure that we would be prepared to face at any time.  Assuming we could afford it, if the capital invested was likely to produce good returns in the way of improving the standards of our people, we would have been prepared <Col N="136" /> to consider the idea favourably.  I quite agree with that and I am sure that the Minister for Finance and the Government would not have objected if a scheme of that sort could have been worked out.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned a parish school, which is somewhat different.  The argument the Deputy put forward was that the children need to be taken out of their immediate surroundings and put into some place which will approximate to their home kitchens and in which they will operate in a way similar to how they would work at home.  Most people who have a practical turn of mind will agree that that is the sort of education that is needed.  They do not need instruction in how to cook in an Aga cooker, which it would not be possible for the majority of our people to get.  They do not want to know how to cook in these circumstances, but rather in the way that will be possible in their own house.  I do not think there is any difference of opinion in that connection.</P>
      <P>One of the things that pleases me most about this debate is that it shows there is very largely a common outlook. We may not approach things in the same way, but we have the same objective and there is generally a common outlook about these things.  We have the difficulty, however, that when you come to implement it, you break up into parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy usually contends that a great number of things are not done.  Deputy Dockrell said that the land is not being efficiently worked and he spoke about the way they work it elsewhere.  It is possible, if we had a denser population, a bigger industrial population, that there might be more intensive working of the land. <Col N="137" /> Those who are near big towns go in for market gardening, but it cannot be suggested that, for a good while at any rate, we can get the land in the country as a whole as intensively worked as a market gardener would work it.  If you take Belgium, you have the position there that there is a very dense population and the land is very precious.  Therefore, there is a very great incentive to work it intensively. That does not mean, however, that it ought not to be our aim to try to get as much out of the land as possible.  But do not forget that the farmer wants to live reasonably well and that he has a right to get a fair amount of recreation.  We have those engaged in industries applying for holidays, and a farmer has as much right to them as they have.  Without much machinery he has to work harder than other sections of the community in order to get a certain production from the land and I do not think it is fair to him.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dockrell said the land was not efficiently worked. There has been an examination of farmers' problems in order to see how the land could be made more productive and in what directions the farmers could go.  In that connection, we may cross swords with the free trade outlook.  Deputy Dockrell also said that taxation in regard to industries was preventing development. <Col N="138" /> The trouble is to reconcile the views held by Deputy Dockrell with those held by Deputy Norton.  Deputy Norton wants social services of various kinds; he has not enough of them. How will we get the means by which these services can be provided?  The only source from which we can get money to meet social services is production and it is vain to hope that we will be able to improve our standards unless we are able to improve that production.</P>
      <P>If the farmers want to have life made a little easier, if the workers want the same thing, if they all want shorter hours and vacation and if they do not want to work as hard as they have been working, then we will not have adequate production.  We cannot have it in every direction and we have to get a reasonable mean in this case. The Minister for Finance, in his Budget speech, pointed out that the quickest way to bring about an improvement in conditions here is to get a bigger output from the industries already existing.  That is not excluding the development of new industries. The quickest way would be to get a greater output.  I would say to labourers and industrialists that they ought to remember that it is only by improving their methods and getting more efficient and greater production that we will get all these results, and in no other way.</P>

There again the Minister for Finance pointed out that we take 75 per cent. of the excess profits and the 25 per cent. was intended to enable them to build up a reserve so that they could start out at the present time.  Deputy Dockrell also pointed out that if the value of the unit of money had gone down to one-half what it was, you want in pounds twice as much capital to do the work you did before.</P>

      <P>Is it the idea to go to 10.30?  I do not think it would be necessary for me to keep the House until 10.30, but I will avail of the privilege to continue. I am thankful for it.  It is suggested that we have more unemployment to-day than we had before.  I suppose we have, with the war, but I think, whatever anybody might do in the way of talking, nobody is going to talk of the present situation as if it was a normal situation.  Everybody knows it is not <Col N="140" /> so.  Everybody knows there was a devastating war.  We are only a small part of the world, but there was a devastating war in the world all round us and with the conditions which that brought about, I think&mdash;and I think it is the opinion of our people&mdash;that, on the whole, we were very fortunate. That does not mean for a moment that there are not numbers of things that have to be remedied and numbers of things we would like to see otherwise. But, if anyone says that we have more emigration, that more people are leaving the country than there were before the war, my only answer is that we are still, as far as supplies are concerned, to a certain extent in the war situation and that we may expect some of that for a period until we are able to reverse engines, until, instead of having difficulty in getting raw materials, we will have raw materials which will be diminishing in price and becoming more readily available.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the categorical question.  I will deal with that later.  I see a figure here that I mentioned already.  The staff we had in the Land Commission before it was increased was 748.  It went up to 1,126. I was, roughly, right.  It is very easy to talk, provided one puts no limit to one's imagination and one is in no way bound by facts of any kind. Deputy Flanagan began talking about unemployment and said we had not adopted Dr. Dignan's scheme.  I have a pamphlet here, a copy of the scheme. I looked through it and I do not see any scheme for reducing unemployment. I see a number of suggestions dealing with sickness benefits, disability benefits, maternity benefits, marriage benefits, retiral pensions, mortality benefit, and so on, but I do not think there was any scheme for employment in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy is anxious that I should indicate what the Government's attitude is towards the Vocational Organisation Commission's Report.  I may say for myself that we established the commission in the hope that we might get a solution of some of the <Col N="141" /> difficulties that arise when the State has to take part, to the extent that we have to, in development of various kinds.  One of the principal difficulties we saw there was the question of organising the rural population&mdash;how were we going to get that done?  I do not think that anybody would hold that the scheme that has been suggested there is really a workable scheme.  I do not think so myself.  I do not think it would work out.  It is much too complicated and too cumbrous. I may be wrong about this.  When we were setting up the commission, I met the commission and I think I indicated that this was going to be one of the principal tests&mdash;how far a scheme applicable to our rural community could be devised.  In the foreword to the Report, I think, the chairman indicated quite clearly a fundamental thing, that is, that these things cannot be superimposed, that they have to be a natural growth.</P>
    <P>You can encourage them, and we are prepared to encourage them, so far as we can, but they must be a natural growth and not something that is imposed from on top.  If one was going to begin, the natural place to begin, although it would not be the way in which you would meet some of our fundamental problems, would be with the professions&mdash;the professions that want to get a statutory position.  That would not present any great difficulty.  But, when you come to the others, all you can do is to say: &ldquo;All right, if the workers come together in various occupations and, by their trade unions, organise themselves, and if the employers on the other hand do the same thing, and you get these into some sort of common organisation, well and good.&rdquo; But we are not doing anything that would stop that.  As a matter of fact, the whole trend has been to try to get the workers and the employers together. There are organisations of workers&mdash;it might be necessary to get a closer knitting together of them in various related occupations&mdash;and there are certain organisations of employers. We would be only too happy to do anything we can to bring these together, provided that we take care of the community interest, as we would have to. It would be our interest in Parliament, <Col N="142" /> as the supreme body looking after the interests of the people as a whole, to see that the two did not meet just to exploit the rest.  That, of course, could happen when both the employers and the employees in a particular type of industry&mdash;particularly if there was anything like protection of it&mdash;might combine to get for their own particular organisation a situation relative to the rest of the community which would not be justified.</P>
    <P>Our general position with regard to vocational organisation is that we believe that if it is going to be of real value to the community it will have to be a natural growth.  All we can indicate that we are not averse from that, that we would be very glad to see it, as we would, for instance, be glad to see co-operation.  The question of co-operation was raised here this afternoon. One of the Deputies spoke in favour of it; another Deputy seemed to think that the State was already favouring certain forms of co-operation and was giving it an unfair advantage.  We are anxious to see co-operation, but I admit that we would have to take care that it was not encouraged beyond a limit and at the expense of other sections of the community.  We are in favour of co-operation and of the development of a vocational organisation of the type that I have mentioned, but, again, we feel that we should not impose it.  We feel that if it is going to be something that is not artificial, that if it is going to have its foundations in the lives of our people, it should come from below and not be superimposed from the top. I do not know whether that satisfies the Deputy or not.</P>

      <P>It does not explain, say, whether the State would welcome the development of a council of education or a council of public health.  The attitude seems to be that the State does not wish a council like that to arise.</P>

      <P>Speaking for myself, and from my short experience as Minister for Education, on this matter of a council of education, I know perfectly well that it is a very easy thing and a very natural thing for a person to say that it would be of great advantage <Col N="143" /> to the Minister to have the assistance of a group of people who could be regarded as experts in the matter of general education, and that they should be available for consultation in regard to various aspects of education.  The trouble is that it is not so easy to get a single group.  The Minister at the moment has the assistance of a number of groups.  Our system of education is denominational. When, for example, the Minister is dealing with the secondary schools he meets the representatives of those who are in charge of secondary education, both Catholic and Protestant.  When it comes to the question of primary education, he has two or three groups that he meets, but if you have a single group and if you bring the members of it together it is a question whether you are going to get the same sort of frank criticism and frank advice that you would get by taking them separately.  Therefore, as far as helping the Minister is concerned, it may not be so satisfactory from the public point of view or from the point of view of the practical help which the Minister would get.  I doubt whether the present system is not really much better.</P>

      <P>The modern educational outlook is that the present segregation of primary education is no longer efficient.  The modern outlook is that everything surrounding secondary education and technical education wants to be more closely knitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, with the assistance that he gets from his staff, is supposed to do the co-ordinating part of the business, to see in the case, say, of primary education to what extent it meets the needs of our community. I remember that when I was at the Department of Education there was the question of having an education for girls which would be associated with the lives that they were going to lead afterwards.  From my experience there, there is this point that I would like to impress on the House&mdash;it is one which is very easily forgotten&mdash;and it is that you have only a few precious years to teach the children, and my <Col N="144" /> own belief is that you will not do any good by adding another year or two. I know all the difficulties, and I do not know whether we would be able to surmount the difficulties that are there by adding another year or two to the length of time that the children are at school.  It would be a tremendous advantage if it could be done, but at present there is only a very limited period within which to do that teaching. Roughly, the period would be between the ages of 7 and 14.  Within that time the children have to learn subjects that are very difficult to them. We grown-ups may not realise that. When I was about 14 years of age, and when I attempted to learn another alphabet for the first time, I soon discovered how difficult it was to do that.  I found that it was not such an easy thing at all.  Within this limited period of time I speak of, it is necessary to get the children to learn to read, to write, and to do simple calculations. Now, these are essential subjects for girls between the ages of 7 and 14 whether they are going to become farmers' wives or to follow some other occupation.</P>
      <P>At any rate, when they leave school they will be perpetually shut off from the world unless they master these subjects during the few years that are available to them.  During those years their minds are immature and they require that time to get knowledge of these subjects.  In this country we have the question of a second language which will be of tremendous value to the children personally as well as from the national point of view.  We have to remember that if this work is to be done there will be no time for a lot of the other things that are suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the programme is concerned, there are tremendous possibilities for the individual teacher.  A good teacher in, say, a country school can, in a thousand ways, illustrate things as he goes along from the lives of the people.  He can give great encouragement to the children in rural schools.  He can get them to appreciate their rural surroundings and get them to live in these surroundings, but I doubt if you can ever do that by means of a programme which is to be <Col N="145" /> universal, even in the rural areas. When people talk about teaching rural science and so on, in my opinion if you want to do that you can only do it at the expense of the other subjects which are often more fundamental. Children, as I have said, between the ages of seven and 14 years must be taught reading and writing.  They must be taught to do simple calculations, and I believe that within that period, which is so valuable to them, they should be taught these subjects without any trimmings.  If you want to bring in these other things the only way to do it is to extend the school age.  If it were simply a question of my will I would like to see the school age extended.  If we could afford to do that, then you could do two things: you could consolidate the knowledge that had been acquired and you could make it lasting.</P>
    <P>To-day people talk about the little that children know when they come out of school.  In an earlier day, as we are all perfectly well aware, they knew little when they left school.  Deputies who can look back on their own days in the national schools are perfectly well aware of that.  How many of those who were in the national school with them and who, for example, took up work afterwards as labourers, would be able to write a good letter?  As I say, all this talk that the children of the present day know little when they leave school is not a new thing at all. While on that subject, let me say this, that there is no one has a greater admiration for the work that was done in the old days by the national teachers than I have.  I think that there was tremendous work done by them everywhere. It was work that was invaluable to the country.  The position then is that to-day we expect miracles from children between the ages of 7 and 14. Deputies, I think, will have to make up their minds that they cannot have these miracles, If, as I say, you extend the school age you can do two things.  You can, first of all, consolidate the knowledge which the children have got so that it will remain with them permanently, and, secondly, you can, if they are living in a rural community, introduce them <Col N="146" /> to rural science and some of the other subjects that were mentioned so as to fit them for a life that is to be spent entirely in the country.</P>

We can speak of that of which we have most intimate knowledge.  We know, from the practical point of view, what is happening our children and what kind of education they are getting.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely taking up the Deputy on one point&mdash;that dealing with parents.  When I was in the Education Office as Minister, I had the association of headmasters of Catholic secondary schools, the association of headmasters of secondary Protestant schools, the headmasters of the primary schools, the association of teachers, and virtually every type of expert body, to which I could appeal when I desired to test out any particular programme.  I had the inspectors, who go through the various schools, from whom I could ascertain whether the view taken by the teachers was a peculiarly teachers' point of view or whether the view taken by the managers was a peculiarly managerial view.  From the other bodies I have mentioned, I could ascertain whether the view taken by the inspectors was a peculiarly inspectorial view.  I do not deny for a moment that, from the point of view of public appearance, if you had a single body, called a council of education, it would meet a certain amount of criticism which is at present levelled at the system.</P>
      <P>It could be urged that you had more of a unifying authority and were not dependent on the Minister and his staff as the co-ordinating authority.  In the long run, however, they will have to be the co-ordinating authority, because you cannot give to somebody else, unless you get rid of the present form of organisation, power to determine what salaries you will pay.  I should like to see the Minister for Finance handle the situation if an outside body were to have that power.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy had put that question three or four months ago, I would have no hesitation in answering it, because it would not have been related to any particular circumstance. If I am asked the question, completely separate from anything else, whether it is good practice for any individual Deputy to get a loan from some person for whom he seems to be at the moment seeking a favour, I do not think that it is right.  That is quite independent of anything else. The Deputy was terribly annoyed when I spoke to him last on this question.  I wanted to show that, if you deal with that as a general principle, it goes very far.  If I may remind him, he said: &ldquo;When I went into a Department to get something done, I told them, `It is not Deputy Dillon with whom you are dealing; it is Mr. Dillon, a trader from Ballaghaderreen'.&rdquo;  That sort of thing will not satisfy anybody.</P>
