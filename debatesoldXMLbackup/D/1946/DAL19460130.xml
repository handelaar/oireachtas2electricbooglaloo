      <P>I still think that the situation is not sufficiently clear or the time ripe to make a decision.  There is nothing to be gained by haste.  So far as I am aware, no neutral country has yet applied for membership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state whether it is the intention of the Government to open negotiations with the British Government with a view to finding a solution of the problem of Partition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know precisely what the Deputy means by opening negotiations with the British Government.  Negotiations are not necessary.  Partition was created by the British Parliament and can be ended by that Parliament.  The facts <Col N="2" /> are known.  During the period of the negotiations with the then British Government in 1938 the facts were repeatedly stated, and I made it clear again and again in public and in private at that time that, so long as Partition was maintained and the unity of Ireland prevented, there could be no real and final reconciliation between Ireland and Britain.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the present British Government understand the situation.  They must know that the occupation of the Six Counties by Britain is a flagrant violation of the fundamental national rights and sovereignty of the Irish people; they must know that they have no more right to occupy these six counties of our country than a foreign Power would have to occupy some area of England in which there happened to be a political minority opposed to the will of the majority, for example, the Conservative SouthEast of England, at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So long as a minority in any country is used, as our minority is used, to serve the interests of an external power, all attempts to find a just solution of the world's problems, <Col N="3" /> or to find a secure basis for world peace, are doomed to failure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that Mrs. Mary J. McGivney, Clooneen, Barracoola, County Leitrim, was in receipt of a blind pension of 10/- a week; that an appeal against the payment of this pension has been entered by the local investigation officer on the grounds that Mrs. McGivney is in receipt of part of the wages of her husband, who is employed as a road worker by the Longford County Council; whether he <Col N="19" /> is aware that Mrs. McGivney has a young family, and that, in view of her disability, her husband has to pay some person to look after the family; and what action, if any, he proposes to take in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. As regards the latter part I would point out that for the purpose of determining the rate of old age or blind pension the means of a olaimant, if married, are assessed at one half of the total means of the married couple. In this case the means of the pensioner's husband, who was employed by the Longford County Council and had casual earnings were such as would permit only of a pension at the rate of 5/- a week being paid to his wife in accordance with the statutory conditions.</P>

The means given by the investigation officer in this case are, I think, rather big.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to inquire into the case and see what he can do.  I know that nothing can be done until six months have elapsed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his attention has been called to the fact that, for three years, the Clare County Council were compelled to use, for their own county services, turf produced by themselves under the national scheme of turf production by county councils, whereas they could <Col N="20" /> have obtained turf, during that period, from private contractors in Clare at an average price of £1 per ton less than the price paid; whether he is aware that the Clare County Council thereby incurred an additional expenditure on turf amounting to at least £25,000; if he will state on what grounds the county council was debarred from purchasing turf from private contractors; by whom this ban on purchasing from private contractors was imposed, and by whom it was removed in 1945, and the reasons for its removal; further, if he will state what steps are being taken to recoup the ratepayers of County Clare for their losses in this matter, and to prevent a recurrence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the implications contained in the Deputy's question.  In view of the scarcity of fuel during the emergency it has been the duty of county councils, as of all those in a position to do so, to produce the maximum amount of turf within their competence.  The question of the disposal of turf so produced is one which must be decided upon in the light of the general interest.  At times the general interest has demanded that the Clare County Council should dispose of part of their production by meeting their own consumption requirements; at times it was desirable that the turf produced by the council should be wholly available to meet general needs leaving the council's requirements to be met by private producers.  If the turf which the Clare County Council produced was more expensive than that produced by private producers that surely is the responsibility of the county council itself.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the particular cases the Deputy may have in mind.  His statement would not apply in the case of a person in receipt of a contributory pension under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts. Contributory pensions are not subject to a means test and are payable irrespective of the means of the recipient. Non-contributory pensions under the Acts are subject to the test of necessity and accordingly all cash incomes from whatever source, subject to statutory exemptions, have to be taken into account.  It was never intended that non-contributory pensions should be given to persons who are in receipt of income from other sources except to such extent as would comply with the statutory test of necessity.  If voluntary or other allowances were to be excluded from the calculation of means in such cases the position would be entirely anomalous as the same rate of assistance would apply to many persons of varying degrees of necessity. It is not proposed to amend the Acts in this respect.</P>
      <P>As regards the latter part of the question, this relates to a matter which no doubt will arise when the general financial position will enable the necessary provision to be made. Perhaps the Deputy will forego an answer until then.</P>

    <P>While some societies are well managed and benefit a fairly large number of reliable and deserving borrowers, there are other societies whose usefulness is very limited.  Two are in process of voluntary liquidation. The question of the future of the societies and the disposal of their funds, if the system should be terminated, is under consideration in my Department.  Meantime, any society which has an appreciable number of borrowers and is paying its way is, in my view, serving a useful purpose and should not for the present be dissolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving effect to this recommendation but in a modified way. Instead of setting up an inquiry and advisory council, I have referred the investigation of certain of the outstanding matters to a Departmental committee.  The committee consists of two agricultural inspectors (one of whom is chairman) and an assistant principal officer, with such additional member or members as may be added from time to time having regard to the subject under investigation.  The three officers referred to will, while serving on the committee, each receive an allowance in addition to the salary of his grade.  The allowance to the chairman is at the rate of £200 a year, inclusive, and to each of the other two members at the rate of £150 a year, inclusive.  The terms of reference will, of course, vary with the subjects to be inquired into.  It is not intended that the committee will be permanent.</P>

      <P>Arrangements had been made in 1937 for the institution of an actuarial investigation into Civil Service superannuation by the British Government actuary, to whose office an officer of my Department was temporarily attached.  The preliminary work which, as will be appreciated, was of a complex nature, was proceeding until the advent of the emergency when the assembly on this side of the necessary data had to be suspended as a result of the demands of emergency work.</P>
      <P>As indicated in my reply to a question on the 18th October last, it has not yet been possible to resume work in connection with the investigation, but it is intended to proceed with it as early as possible.  I think it unlikely that the requirements of the work will necessitate further reference to an outside actuary, and that it will be found practicable to carry it to completion by an officer in our own service possessing actuarial qualifications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware (1) that many of those officers who retired on low rates of pension had their pensions calculated by reference to an index figure of 150; (2) that the cost-of-living index figure is now 298, showing an increase of 72 per cent. since those officers retired some years ago; and bearing in mind that substantial increase in the cost of living, does he not consider, especially in the case of lowly paid pensioners, that some effort should be made here, as is being made in Britain and Northern Ireland, to grant an increase to these people to endeavour to assist them in meeting the increased cost of living?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>As the reply contains a number of figures, I would ask the Deputy to allow me to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the reply:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The information asked for by the Deputy is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  2,903 ex-civil servants serving at the date of the Treaty are now in receipt either of normal superannuation or Article X compensation.</P>
      <P>(b)  and (c)  Of that number 1,164 are in receipt of compensation under Article X of the Treaty.  Separate figures are not given for categories (b) and (c) as all the individuals concerned in fact retired with Article X compensation and the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Compensation Act, 1929, merely provided machinery for the better operating of Article X of the Treaty.</P>
      <P>(d)  883 ex-civil servants who were serving at the date of the Treaty are in receipt of normal superannuation based on emoluments existing at and prior to the 31st December, 1939.</P>
      <P>(e)  748 ex-civil servants who were serving at the date of the Treaty are in receipt of normal superannuation based on emoluments and increased stabilised cost-of-living figure of 210.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards (f) of the Deputy's question the differentiation in treatment between officers in categories (d) and (e) is due to the following: officers <Col N="28" /> in category (d) received their full entitlement, viz., pensions based on salary and unstabilised bonus whereas those in (e) were affected in their pensions by the stabilisation of bonus. When the Government decided to raise the bonus point for serving officers they considered it would be inequitable that those officers whose pensions had been affected by stabilisation should in their pensions not receive the benefit of the adjusted bonus figure and they, therefore, decided that the pensions of these officers should as from the 1st January, 1945, be related to the actual cost-of-living figure obtaining at the date of retirement, 205 or 210 whichever was appropriate.  Of course any person retiring subsequent to the 31st December, 1944, was in receipt of bonus related to a cost-of-living figure of 210 and the bonus portion of his pension was automatically calculated on that figure.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the reasons underlying the regulation issued by him forbidding public officials or civil servants from approaching members of the Oireachtas in relation to the conditions of their employment; and whether, having regard to the fact that this constitutes a deprivation of freedom of action for such officials in the exercise of their ordinary civil rights, and also hinders the elected representatives of the people from discharging their public duties, he will withdraw the regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>On matters affecting groups or classes of civil servants ample facilities are provided through the various Civil Service organisations for making representations to the Ministers particularly concerned and, in appropriate cases, to the Minister for Finance.  A civil servant who desires to raise a question concerning his own position or conditions of employment has the right to make representations to the Civil Service head of his Department or, through that officer, to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulation made in 1922, and <Col N="29" /> confirmed ten years later, which prohibits civil servants from endeavouring to obtain personal concessions by applications submitted otherwise than through the Civil Service heads of Departments, was made in the interests of discipline and fair play.  I cannot agree that it unduly limits the freedom of action of civil servants or that it hinders the elected representatives of the people in discharging any of the duties they are elected to discharge. It is in my opinion a desirable and necessary regulation and I do not propose to withdraw it.  On the contrary, I take this opportunity to appeal to Deputies to co-operate with me in its enforcement.</P>

      <P>1,287 persons asked for forms of <Col N="31" /> application.  Forms were given to 642 &mdash;the remainder being ineligible on various grounds.  Of these 642, 367 were selected by the Commissioner for further testing and inquiries.  These were presented to the Civil Service Commissioners for examination.  The remainder were notified that they had not been selected.</P>
      <P>The qualifications required from candidates are set out in the Gárda Síochána (Appointments) Regulations, 1945.  The standard of the educational examination is about that of the primary school sixth standard.</P>
      <P>It should be understood that the selection of recruits lies with the Commissioner. The educational examination is designed only to ensure that no person shall be recruited who has not definitely proved that he has at least the minimum standard of education. It is not a competitive examination. Unless a candidate has first been selected by the Commissioner as likely to be accepted there is no object in putting him to the trouble and expense of sitting for the educational examination.</P>

      <P>I understand that, on the 8th February, 1945, Mr. Byrne was returned for trial by the Circuit Court. His trial was due to take place on the 12th June, 1945, but it was adjourned on a number of occasions owing to non-attendance of witnesses for the prosecution, including Mr. Housset, whose evidence was essential to a successful prosecution.  On the 24th October the judge peremptorily fixed the 14th November for the trial, and, as Mr. Housset failed to attend on that day, a <i>nolle prosequi</i> was entered. Every effort was made and sufficient notice was given to secure Mr. Housset's attendance.  His attendance could not be compelled, however, as he was absent from the State.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (1), page 7, to insert the following definition before <Col N="56" /> the definition of &ldquo;chamber of commerce member&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the expression &lsquo;annual meeting&rsquo; has the meaning assigned to it by sub-section (1) of Section 20 of this Act;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with this amendment, I think I should explain to the House that I caused this Bill to be circulated, after it had received a Second Reading here, to the harbour authorities and other interested parties in the country. I received from them many suggestions concerning its provisions.  Such of those suggestions as seemed to me to deserve adoption I have caused to be made the subjects of amendments.  A number of amendments appear on the amendment sheet which are intended to give effect to proposals received from harbour authorities.  The Bill as introduced provided for the election of a chairman of a harbour board once in three years.  Some of the harbour authorities suggested that the chairman should be elected annually.  I adopted that suggestion and an amendment to give effect to it will be moved later.  This amendment is consequential upon the change which will be effected by a later amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 7, to delete the words &ldquo;and secretary&rdquo; in line 34 and in line 35.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment also is consequential upon an amendment, which will be moved later, to Section 39.  The Ports and Harbours Tribunal recommended that the general manager to be appointed to the major ports would also act as secretary to the harbour board. The Dublin Harbour Board and other harbour authorities desired that that should not be made a statutory obligation. The Dublin Harbour Board, in particular, felt that the circumstances made it desirable for them to have both a general manager and a secretary.  I have adopted that suggestion and, consequently, I am proposing to delete from this Bill the Provisions which require that the general manager would also be secretary.  The effect of the change will be to remove <Col N="57" /> the statutory obligation imposing the duties of secretary on the general manager.  It will not be obligatory on any harbour authority to have a separate secretary and, in fact, the duties of secretary can be given to the harbour manager if that course is considered desirable by the harbour authority but there will no longer be a statutory bar to having a separate secretary where the harbour authority so desires.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 8, to insert the following definition before the definition of &ldquo;pilotage authority&rdquo;:&mdash;&ldquo;the word &lsquo;owner&rsquo; includes, in relation to goods, any consignor, consignee, shipper or agent for sale or custody of such goods;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 102 provides that goods rates will be payable by the owner of the goods.  The Cork Harbour Commissioners and the Waterford Harbour Commissioners pointed out that it was desirable that liability for payment of goods rates should also be imposed upon the consignor, the consignee, the shipper of the goods or the agent for the sale and custody of the goods.  The reasons they gave were two-fold&mdash;first, that the owner of the goods might reside in another country and, second, that difficulties have arisen frequently in the past and have led to legal actions in determining the owner of goods in the hands of a common carrier, where they were in transit from the seller to the buyer. Consequently, it was suggested&mdash;and I think it was a good suggestion&mdash;that the term &ldquo;owner&rdquo; should be extended to include the consignor, the consignee, the shipper of the goods or the agent for their sale and custody. In fact, there are numerous provisions in existing harbour legislation, requiring <Col N="58" /> the goods rates to be paid by the consignors and consignees.</P>

    <P>This amendment is designed to meet a point raised by the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  It appears that the expression the &ldquo;Port of Dublin&rdquo; in the Dublin Port and Docks Act, 1869, has a much wider meaning, geographically, than the expression the &ldquo;harbour of Dublin&rdquo;.  The Bill, as drafted, would apply only to the restricted area of the harbour of Dublin, and consequently, it is desired to remedy that defect. <Col N="59" /> This amendment does remedy it by making it clear that, in the case of Dublin harbour, the limits fixed by the Act of 1869 will still be the limits of the harbour.</P>

      <P>A lot of the matters to be prescribed are purely formal matters; they are matters relating to the form in which things will be done &mdash;the form in which an application for an Order may be made.  Certain of the things which may be done under this Bill cannot come into effect until approved by the Oireachtas.  As regards the ordinary matters in respect of which the Minister is empowered to prescribe by regulation, the items are of such minor importance that it is unnecessary to provide for their possible annulment by the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The items may be small, but the section reads:-</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may make regulations to any matter or thing referred to in this Act as prescribed or to be prescribed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The section then goes on to say&mdash;that is, if the amendment is adopted&mdash;that any regulations the Minister makes shall have the force of law.  If they are small matters, then there will be no occasion for anybody in either House of the Oireachtas to refer to them; but they may be serious matters, and these matters will likely be dealt with by the Minister in these regulations. For that reason, it should impose no unnecessary hardship or work on anybody if we make this section read in the standard way&mdash;that where it is provided that regulations made by the Minister shall have the force of law, there will be the safeguard that the matter can be raised here if it is so serious as to require the attention of either House of the Oireachtas.  I will oppose the section unless there is the usual safeguard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is an entirely unnecessary safeguard.  If the Deputy will examine the Bill, he will note that the circumstances in which the Minister is empowered to make regulations are not really of such a character as to require that the Oireachtas should enter into the machinery of administration at all.  Section 118 relates to the making of regulations in relation to mortgages; Section 119 relates to the making of regulations in relation to stock; Section 123 relates to the making of regulations in relation to accounts; Section 134 relates to the making of regulations in relation to contracts, and an earlier section deals with the election of elected members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the House will have to consider now whether the general scheme of this Bill has its approval.  The scheme is to give certain powers to harbour authorities to be exercised subject to the supervision of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He may interfere in the conduct of harbour authorities only to the extent laid down and he may make minor regulations.  That is the recommendation of the Port and Harbours Tribunal&mdash;that <Col N="62" /> these harbour authorities should function under the supervision of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in much the same manner as local authorities function under the supervision of the Minister for Local Government.  Heretofore, the Minister for Industry and Commerce had not that power of supervision, and the purpose of the Bill is to give it to him. That is the principle of the Bill which the Dáil is presumed to have accepted on the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am completely opposed to embodying in any Act a provision to the effect that the regulations of the Minister shall have the force of law without a safeguard that within a certain period the matter can be raised in either House of the Oireachtas and the regulation annulled if necessary.  It is not interfering with the power of the Minister quickly and adequately to deal with anything that may require to be dealt with by regulation, but it does provide, and it is a necessary provision, that nothing should be regarded as law that is included in a Ministerial regulation unless there is power given to either House of the Oireachtas to annual it, if that course is considered necessary.

      <P>The Minister has said that there is no such provision at present.  That is so, but the Minister is taking power to exercise a certain control over harbour boards and the moment he takes that power I suggest that a harbour authority ought to have some right of appeal to the House.  If they feel they have a grievance, if they feel that the Minister has acted in a dictatorial way in bringing in a provision which is objectionable from their point of view, they have no redress.  We suggest that they are entitled to some protection and we suggest the protection they ought to have is the right of appeal to the House which, by motion, can annul the regulation.

      <P>Up to the present, a harbour authority had to do these things in accordance with the special Acts applying to that authority which could not be amended or altered by any Ministerial Order.  In the past, when changes in procedure, practice or regulations were necessary, new legislation was required, and for a number of these harbour authorities the powers exercised by them were given by private Acts and not by public legislation at all.  In any event, I suggest that the matter is irrelevant to this amendment.  If the Minister is to have any power to make regulations, it is clear that the regulations must have the force of law.  Otherwise, it would be a waste of time to make them.  Section 4 provides that the Minister will have power to make regulations wherever it is stated in this Bill he shall make regulations or have that power, and these regulations will have the force of law.  If the Deputy wants to raise the issue in a specific way, in relation to the powers in <Col N="66" /> Section 119, he can do so, but clearly this section must stand and this amendment must be made to it.</P>

The Minister says that this deals with details, and that may be true in the majority of cases, but Section 119 deals with the issue of stock, and surely that it a very large detail.  While it is true that up to this these harbour boards operated under private Acts dealing with their particular harbours and the report of the commission recommends that the Minister should have a general guiding right concerning the harbours of the country, the report never intended, I think, that the Minister should have that right without having to submit it to the Dáil for approval or rejection. This amendment by the Minister is an extension, a considerable extension, of the original section, and if the protection we seek is not given in a sub-section to this particular section, there should be a provision in some part of the Bill whereby these regulations will be laid before the House.</P>

I do not intend to conceal what the Minister's powers are in relation to the financial transactions of harbour authorities.  Clearly, a harbour authority may not borrow money without the consent of the Minister.  That is specifically provided for in Section 113, but Section 119 refers only to the machinery, the details, the purely administrative matters set out there. It is not necessary for the Minister to abuse the powers given in Section 119 in order to control the borrowings of harbour authorities, because it is clearly intended in Section 113 that he should have power to control their borrowings.</P>

      <P>There are many amendments that arise from Section 7.  Amendment No. 8, if carried, will meet or delete several amendments&mdash;amendments Nos. 9 to 28, for instance, and there are others that are consequential&mdash;29, 32, 33, 35, 37, 39, 40, 43, 44, 46 to 48, 151, 153, 154 and 162.  Therefore, the whole question of the membership of harbour boards and authorities might be debated on amendment No. 8, and if there are amendments submitted which are not met by the Minister, they might be adapted and put in on Report Stage, because it is very difficult to change them and get them in as amendments to the Minister's now.</P>

    <P>(ii) in the case of any particular election in respect of which the Minister is of opinion that the application of sub-paragraph (i) of this paragraph would result in the number of electors being unduly small, such sum less than ten pounds as the Minister directs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> I may say that a very substantial number of suggestions was received from harbour boards and other bodies relating to the provisions of this section.  Many of the views expressed by harbour boards were diametrically opposed to views expressed by other harbour boards and frequently chambers of commerce and similar bodies had also independent views to express. It was not possible to reply at length to many of the communications received from harbour authorities, although protracted discussions took place in my Department with the representatives of some harbour authorities and particularly of the Dublin and Cork Boards.  I think I should at this stage thank the members of the various harbour boards, local government bodies, chambers of commerce and other organisations that went to much trouble to prepare and submit views and proposals relating to this section.</P>
    <P>The section as originally framed carried out <i>in toto</i> the recommendations of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal.  It was designed to give effect to the recommendations of the tribunal, and no departure, either by addition or subtraction, was made from these recommendations.  But, having regard to some of the views submitted from various quarters, I think there is some case for amending the section and making the constitution of the harbour authorities slightly different from that proposed by the tribunal.  The tribunal recommended that the harbour authorities for the four main harbours should be composed of five persons appointed by the local authorities concerned, four members chosen by the chambers of commerce in the port areas, two members elected to represent shipping interests, and four members nominated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The first point put forward by the Dublin, Cork and some other boards was that the total membership proposed, namely 15, was too small, particularly so in relation to the proposed quorum of seven.  It was recommended that the quorum should be reduced from seven to five&mdash;an amendment is tabled for that purpose <Col N="77" />&mdash;and that the membership of the body should be enlarged.  They argued that, having regard to the general experience as to the attendance of members at these boards, as well as the number of committees that have to be appointed from time to time to discharge the functions of the boards, some higher membership was desirable.  I think there is something to be said for that point of view and the new constitution which I am proposing for the boards of the major harbours will provide for a total membership of 19.  The additional four members, I propose, should be secured by providing for the direct representation on these harbour boards of an organisation representative of live-stock exporters and the Federation of Irish Manufacturers. Some Deputies have proposed to give representation on all these boards to the live-stock trade and have named a particular live-stock traders' organisation. I understand that that organisation ceased to exist at some stage of its career and was revived and the same thing might happen again. Therefore, I think it is wiser to adopt the device which I have adopted in my amendment of giving the Minister for Agriculture the responsibility of certifying which organisation is most representative of live-stock exporters and conferring on the organisation certified by him to be the most representative this power to nominate members on harbour boards.</P>
    <P>The Federation of Irish Manufacturers represented to me that they had both interests and viewpoints which would not be, or might not be, properly represented by members chosen by chambers of commerce and, while the device of giving direct representation to chambers of commerce was adopted by the tribunal and accepted by me primarily for the purpose of ensuring that local business interests would be represented on those harbour boards, I think there is something to be said for the contention of the Federation of Irish Manufacturers, certainly so far as the major harbours are concerned.</P>
    <P>In the course of discussions affecting the provisions of this section with bodies claiming representation on these <Col N="78" /> boards, I found it necessary to emphasise again and again that these harbour boards are local authorities, using the term &ldquo;local&rdquo; in its proper meaning.  The boards are intended represent local interests concerned with the development of each port.  As Deputies know, these ports are often in competition one with the other, and it is, I think, undesirable to give undue representation upon these local bodies to organisations constituted upon a national basis.  Such a national organisation might have a definite interest or a definite policy affecting the interests of one port or one class of port as distinct from others.  It is desirable that whatever constitution we adopt should ensure that the local interests in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and the smaller ports should have the predominant voice in the management of their ports, and, in particular, in the development of their ports where that development could only take place, as is frequently the case, by attracting trade from other ports which are less efficiently managed or less enterprising.  The particular changes which I am proposing, therefore, in so far as they affect the major harbours, are to provide for an increased membership of these boards by giving the right to nominate two members to the live-stock traders' association certified by the Minister for Agriculture to be the most representative, and two representatives of the Federation of Irish Manufacturers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another provision which requires that a member of a harbour authority must reside within 20 miles of the harbour.  That is a general provision affecting all members of a harbour authority except those nominated by a local authority.  A particular point arose in the case of Cork.  I received many representations that the Cork Harbour Board should include <i>ex officio</i> a representative of the Cobh urban area. <Col N="79" /> I found that the argument that such a representative might be included on the Cork Harbour Board through nomination by the Cork Corporation or one of the Cork chambers of commerce or the Minister for Industry and Commerce was not considered adequate and, consequently, I am proposing that of the five local authority representatives on the Cork Harbour Board one of them shall be chosen by the Cobh Urban Council.  It is, of course, conceivable, not to say probable, that the Cobh area will have other representatives on the Cork Harbour Board also because some of the nominated members or some of the elected members may have interests in that area.  But it is specifically provided that one of the local authority representatives must be a member appointed by the Cobh Urban District Council. In the case of the New Ross Harbour Board, the local authority representation did not include provision for members representative of the Kilkenny County Council.  The Kilkenny County Council is represented on the present harbour board and it is obviously desirable that Kilkenny, which has a very definite interest in New Ross harbour, should continue to have a voice in its management.  I will be proposing, therefore, that the local authority representation on the New Ross harbour should be increased so as to provide for two members nominated by the Kilkenny Country Council.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, both Kilkenny and New Ross asked for it.  Many of the harbour authorities and a number of commercial interests urged that the qualifications of elected members should be prescribed in the Bill and I agreed that it was desirable that they should.  It is proposed, therefore, to make it a provision of this section that the electors of the elected members will be qualified, first, if they are resident in the State and, second, if they own vessels which are registered in the State and in respect of which, of <Col N="80" /> course, the prescribed minimum tonnage rates have been paid in the preceding 12 months.  Only one vote will be given to each owner in any harbour, irrespective of the number of vessels he may own or the amount paid by him in tonnage rates.</P>
      <P>Provision is made that the responsible manager in the State of any of the owners will qualify as an elector, if the owners fail to qualify from the point of view of residence.  The suggestion that the qualifications of electors should be more clearly defined came from Dublin, Cork and some of the smaller harbour commissioners.</P>
      <P>These are the principal changes I propose.  I am aware that many Deputies have in mind that representation should be given directly to named persons or other interests.  I do not agree that there is a case for that.  It will be borne in mind that one of the principal purposes which the Port and Harbours Tribunal had in mind was to establish a uniform type of harbour authority, to provide that the enormous variety in the powers and constitution of harbour authorities should end and that each harbour authority should be composed in a similar way and possess and exercise similar powers.  Whatever circumstances in the past may have justified giving special representation to special interests or providing for membership <i>ex officio</i> of persons holding particular offices, I do not think it is necessary now.  We must regard these harbour boards as business organisations set up to do a specific job, the members of which are chosen for their competence in relation to the job.  While I quite well understand the Dublin Corporation nominating the Lord Mayor as a member of the harbour board, I do not think it is necessary to provide that the Lord Mayor should be a member <i>ex officio</i> of the harbour board.  Similarly, I think the proposals which have been put forward here to give special or additional representation to other interests leave out of account the particular functions which those boards have to discharge, and the nature of the qualifications which the members of those boards should possess before being put on them.</P>

      <Col N="81" /> Deputy M. O'Sullivan has proposed that representation should be given on these harbour authorities to persons representing the trades councils.  I have provided in the Bill&mdash;although with some hesitation&mdash;that one of the persons to be nominated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce should be a person representative of Labour interests.  It is hard to see why it is desired to give special representation to Labour interests.  It is conceivable, of course, that Labour interests will be represented through local authority members, and most of those local authorities have in the past nominated on harbour authorities persons who had special qualifications to speak for Labour.  The power of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to nominate members of these boards was proposed by the Harbours Tribunal, to ensure that any special interest which did not secure representation through the other nominating bodies would nevertheless be able to secure representation. The procedure laid down in the Bill is that all the other bodies must have made their nominations before the Minister makes his, the idea being that the Minister, having examined the list of those nominated by other bodies, will then see that any gaps are filled by persons who obviously should be on the harbour board, or that any interest which failed to secure representation otherwise will get it.</P>
    <P>I have had some experience of the exercise of these powers in relation to authorities constituted under special Acts passed in the last ten years, and the only doubt I have in relation to the provision has arisen out of my experience in the exercise of those powers.  I think the technique has developed, in some instances, of leaving off the harbour board the most obvious persons to be put on it, knowing that, if they are left out, the Minister will have very little choice but to put them on.  Any development of that technique could largely undermine the purposes of this legislation.  Obviously, it seems necessary that there should be some nominating authority which could wait until all other nominating authorities had fulfilled their functions and then ensure that the harbour <Col N="82" /> board is, in fact, representative of all the interests that should be represented on it, and that obvious persons have not, by omission or otherwise, been left out.  It would not be possible otherwise to ensure the type of body that would be best fitted to manage the trade and business of the port, which, of course, is the primary function of a harbour board.  Therefore, I have decided not to accept the suggestion concerning the nominations of members direct from trades councils.</P>
    <P>I do not want to argue the case against that on the ground of the existence of difficulties at present&mdash;which, I hope, are purely temporary difficulties and which would make the inclusion of these provisions a source of difficulty; but it seems to me that, in a matter of this kind, we must keep in mind clearly what these boards are going to do.  These boards are going to manage the harbour in each of these named centres as a business undertaking. In so far as political labour interests desire representation on it, they should get it, and certainly should seek to get it, through the local authority.  In so far as it is desired to give on a properly constituted authority membership to persons who are familiar with labour conditions, then it is difficult to see how such persons can be secured other than by some process of selection by a local authority or by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If Deputy O'Sullivan has in mind the idea of ensuring that persons who are familiar with the labour problems which inevitably arise in ports should have some voice in the management of the port, I suggest that he has not succeeded in doing that by his amendment.</P>
    <P>There are some proposals by Deputies relating to particular harbours, but I do not want to discuss them at this stage.  In connection with each of them, however, I would like to remind Deputies that one of the main aims of the tribunal in framing its recommendations, and one of the main purposes of the Government in framing this Bill, was to maintain, as well as can be maintained, the principle of uniformity of constitution&mdash;the making of special provisions to meet the circumstances <Col N="83" /> of individual ports would eventually lead to the restoration of the position which we are trying to remove and would mean that these harbour authorities would be constituted on different bases, with different legal powers, different methods of operation and different functions.  I think we should avoid that and, therefore, I should be very slow to consider any proposal to alter considerably the constitution of a harbour authority just because of some special local circumstance or some past precedent or practice which it was desired to maintain.</P>

      <P>On the Report Stage some details will arise for discussion, but there is one aspect of the representation, particularly in respect of the smaller harbours, which I would like to get further information or some more light about from the Minister. As the section will be amended now, take a harbour like Tralee or Ballina. In the case of Tralee, the harbour authority will consist of two members representing the Kerry County Council, two representing the Tralee Urban District Council, two representing two owners of vessels going there, and three appointed by the Minister.</P>

      <P>This point seems to be troubling the people interested <Col N="84" /> in the harbour there, because the people who have the most direct contact with the harbour are the people bringing cargoes there and paying the dues.  They are not the shipowners. The shipowners pay the harbour dues for the vessels, but the importers, and in the same way the exporters, pay the dues on the cargo.  If we take Ballina, the only company calling there was the Limerick Steamship Company.  All the other vessels were tramp steamers that might come once or twice in the year.  They have no very particular connection with the port, but when they came there they paid dues on the vessels.</P>
      <P>It would seem lopsided to give representation on the harbour board in the manner proposed by the Bill, unless it is amended in the way indicated by the Minister.  It does seem lopsided, in the case of the smaller harbours, to give representation on the board to people who have very little connection with it, and exclude from representation the vast bulk of the people who have a front bench interest in the harbour in that they pay the dues on the cargoes coming in. Has the Minister received representation on this point?  I should like to know whether, in the case of the people who cannot turn up at a moment's notice a chamber of commerce to figure in the Bill before it passes through the House, he has given any consideration to the importers or exporters of goods in these smaller harbours and proposes to give them representation on the harbour authorities in the same way as if they had formed themselves into a chamber of commerce.</P>

      <P>I am glad, in the main, to see these Ministerial amendments, but I am sorry that the Minister did not accept the amendment put forward by Deputy O'Sullivan and the amendment put forward by myself with reference to the Lord Mayor of Dublin being an <i>ex officio</i> member of the Port and Docks Board of Dublin. The Minister has said that in these days port boards are business boards and are, perhaps, more related to local authorities; but the connection <Col N="85" /> between the Port and Docks Board of Dublin and the Corporation of Dublin goes back until it is lost in the mists of time, and I think it is a pity that the <i>ex officio</i> membership of the Lord Mayor is not continued.</P>
      <P>I think that long-standing tradition should be maintained.  It is difficult to think of an occasion when the Lord Mayor on such a board would not be much more important than any ordinary corporation member.  Occasions do arise when the Lord Mayor of the City of Dublin, in his capacity as first citizen of the capital city of Ireland, can speak in a manner in which no other member of the corporation can speak, and I think it is a great pity that link should be lost.  I can conceive occasions when, by the Lord Mayor not being there, a situation might develop to the detriment of the port and docks board.  I am glad to see that there are two members of the Federation of Irish Manufacturers and two members of the cattle traders' organisation, whichever organisation is chosen.  I am glad to see that the Minister has recognised the interest which those two bodies have in Dublin Port.</P>
      <P>I come now to the two members referred to as elected members, elected by qualified electors.  Those are the shipping members.  I have had some slight experience of the Dublin Port and Docks Board and I would like to tell the House that the contribution made by the shipping members is very great.  Of necessity in any port a great amount of the work of the port board is concerned with shipping matters. Shipping is a highly technical business. The average man does not know the intricacies or the ramifications of it. In fact, he does not know the terminology or the phraseology of the shipping business.  In these circumstances, the contribution made by the shipping members is a contribution which can be made only by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that allowing only two members is cutting down the contribution which the Dublin Port and Docks Board has the right to expect.  I feel certain that the newly-constituted port board will feel the lack of the shipping members who will have left.  I do not mind how efficient the other members <Col N="86" /> are, and I speak as a person who is a corporation representative on that board.  Outside my corporation interests, I have commercial interests. I have no personal interest with the shipping business, but, over a number of years, I have watched the contribution that these men have made and also the highly intricate and technical nature of the shipping business which, of necessity, deals with a great many matters.  The port board here is always dealing with shipping matters generally, and the ordinary members of the board find great difficulty in understanding them.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to increase the qualified electors to four.  He will then have much more efficient port boards.  It may be said that the chamber of commerce may elect shipping members. That may be so, but we in this House cannot rely on that being done.  Out of a membership of 27 on the Dublin Port Board at present, nine are elected to represent shipping interests; that is to say, one-third of the board is composed of shipping people.  But under this new proposal, that representation will go down to two out of 19.  I think that will inevitably damage the efficiency of that body, and I ask the Minister very strongly to reconsider it and bring the number of shipping members up to at least four.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment and this new section which is being incorporated represent a substantial improvement on the old section, but one point in connection with it strikes me as being altogether wrong, that is, the Minister's refusal to permit the national executive of the live-stock trade to nominate two representatives.  The Minister has instead delegated to the Minister for Agriculture the function of deciding what organisation is to represent the live-stock trade.  That is a very undesirable feature to incorporate in this or any other measure because it provides an opportunity for a Minister for Agriculture in the future to discriminate between one organisation and another.  If there are two organisations which claim to represent a certain interest&mdash;in this case if there are two organisations which claim to <Col N="87" /> represent the live-stock interest&mdash;it will enable the Minister to favour one as against the other.</P>
      <P>I think we should state definitely in the section the organisation which we intend should have representation. There is a precedent for it in this new section in that the Minister has provided that the Federation of Irish Manufacturers shall appoint two representatives. I ask why there should be this discrimination as between the Federation of Irish Manufacturers and the live-stock trade organisation? Why should one organisation be given definite recognition in the Bill while the other has to go to the Minister for Agriculture for recognition and the Minister at any time in future may withdraw that recognition?  There seems to be definite discrimination there.  I am in entire agreement with the proviso that the Federation of Irish Manufacturers should have representation. I think it a very desirable provision because manufacturers will be extensively engaged in the future as in the past in the export and import of goods; but it seems to me that there is no answer to the charge of discrimination as between one of these organisations and the other.</P>
      <P>The national executive of the live-stock trade has, I think, been in existence even longer than the Federation of Irish Manufacturers.  It is a well established organisation and well recognised in all branches of trade and there is no reason whatever why it should be refused representation.  I am sorry I was not in the House when this amendment was being introduced.  Am I to understand that we are dealing only with this amendment or with all the other amendments as well?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other interests which have not been provided for in this section.  I have an amendment down to provide that in addition to direct representation for the live-stock trade there should be representation for other agricultural interests.  It was <Col N="88" /> an amendment in regard to the putting down of which I had a considerable amount of misgiving.  In the first place, it might seem rather strange for an Opposition Deputy to suggest that the Minister for Agriculture should have the right to nominate representatives instead of giving that right to some particular organisation.   My reason for suggesting that the function should be given to the Minister for Agriculture was that it is not too easy to forecast what agricultural commodities may be exported extensively in the future, and it would not be easy at present to state definitely what particular agricultural organisation should have the right to nominate representatives in addition to the live-stock trade.</P>
      <P>It might be suggested that the cooperative creamery industry should have direct representation, but we have no certain guarantee as to what extent the creamery industry may be engaged in export in future.  At present the creamery industries generally are not engaged in export to any extent. I considered the question from every angle and decided that discretion should be left to the Minister for Agriculture to select those people who he considered had a specialised knowledge of some particular branch of agriculture, or some particular agricultural export.  This would mean that the Minister for Agriculture in regard to a particular harbour would have the right to appoint two agricultural representatives. He might, in regard to one harbour, appoint representatives with a specialised knowledge of a particular commodity, and, in regard to another, representatives with a specialised knowledge of the export of a particular commodity; but I consider that he would be a suitable person in future to make these nominations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has brought the Minister for Agriculture into his amendment merely to make what is, in my opinion, a very undesirable choice as between two organisations.  We have at the moment a recognised organisation dealing with the export of live stock which certainly could nominate suitable persons to represent the interests of the industry.  I think that that particular portion of the section <Col N="89" /> is very bad.  I can see no reason why the live-stock trade organisation should not have definitely received the same recognition in this Bill as the manufacturers' organisation has received, and I think that, on reconsideration, the Minister will see that he has put forward a proposition which cannot be sustained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I happen to be interested in two aspects of this question of representation on harbour authorities, one of which was referred to at length by the Minister in his speech, namely, that of trades councils. The other is one on which I know members of the House who happen to be members of the Dublin Corporation will do their best to induce the Minister to alter his decision.  That is the position of the Lord Mayor as an <i>ex officio</i> member of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  That is a question in which the Lord Mayor and the corporation are deeply concerned, due to the fact that since 1867 the Lord Mayor was the first individual who was named as a member of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  Since then, he has continued, by virtue of his office, to be a member of the board.  I think it is correct for me to say that, on this matter, representations have been made to the Minister by the corporation. May I add that it is one of the functions of the Lord Mayor, not necessarily a very important function, to preside at the annual meetings of the board, and to invest the incoming chairman with the chain of office?  I know quite well that the Minister can make the point that, if the corporation are interested in the question, they can make one of their five representatives the Lord Mayor.  I suggest, however, that even by adopting that line you would be taking away from what is intended, and that is the dignity of the position which the first citizen of Dublin holds.  Therefore, Deputy Dockrell and myself and other representatives of Dublin are merely voicing the unanimous view of the corporation when we say that we hope the Minister will see his way to continue the representation extended to that particular office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point is that I should like <Col N="90" /> to remove any doubts which the Minister may have regarding the question of trades councils.  In regard to these amendments may I say that, as regards the position that obtains in Dublin at the present time, I have no intention or desire to obtrude the viewpoint of political labour so far as the trades council is concerned.  I would say, however, that since the Minister is expressly reserving nominations for labour on these boards, thereby admitting the necessity of having labour interests represented, no more ideal unit of the labour movement could be selected for that purpose than the trades council. I have a pretty long experience of them in Dublin extending over about 25 years.  I know the type of work they do, their constitution, organisation and the experience that they bring to bear on their work throughout the country, particularly in those towns which can be described as port towns.</P>
    <P>The trades councils are, generally speaking, a federation of the trade unions in the areas.  Their main object is to promote the general welfare of their members according to trade union standards.  They are not in any way a compulsory body.  They cannot force the decisions of one union on another.  They are older than the Trade Union Congress, and much older than what may be described as the political Labour Party.  For instance, the trades council in Drogheda has been operating for 67 years, while it may be said that the trades councils in Limerick and other places have been in operation for very long periods.  They have not by any means what might be described as a definite labour political outlook. Their members are equipped by special knowledge appertaining to the local boards which eminently qualifies them for representation on an authority of this character.  Now that the Minister has extended representation to the cattle traders' association and to the federated industries, I would suggest to him that the trades councils, by reason of their constitution and the people they represent, are certainly not less important than any of the other interests named.  I suggest <Col N="91" /> to him that the trades council is the ideal nominating unit so far as labour interests are concerned.</P>
    <P>It may be, as the Minister pointed out, that these men would have the opportunity of getting nomination through their local authority.  I can assure him that that does not always happen.  Nomination for outside bodies take peculiar turns now and again within the political Parties and very often the qualifications of individuals for particular boards are not taken into consideration in perhaps the way they should be.  Therefore, it would not be meeting the position if you were to rely on something that might or might not occur.  May I add that the trades councils have a tradition behind them?  As organisations, they have rendered valuable services nationally, socially and economically. May I say that there will be keen disappointment throughout the country if, on the one hand, representation is given to bodies like the chambers of commerce and the federated industries, while the claims of the trades councils are not recognised?  May I say that the trades councils, apart from any political question, are given representation by local authorities on subsidiary bodies such as vocational education committees, hospital committees and so on, simply for the reason that the trades councils have been recognised in the way I speak of? If the Minister desires to continue his nomination of labour, then by all means let him do so.  Obviously, he will be able to place it to good advantage and to the advantage of the local ports.  I do, however, appeal to him, since I feel that he desires labour interests to be represented, that the most ideal form of selection would, in my opinion, be through these old trades councils.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that, out of the 19 members that are to be allowed to represent Cobh harbour under this Bill, one at least is going to be from Cobh, and the 18 from Cork.  I regret that the Minister, when dealing with the recommendations that were sent forward to him by the Cork Harbour <Col N="92" /> Board, did not give way to its request in regard to the representatives of the county council.  I notice that he has given two extra seats&mdash; at least one may say that&mdash;to the chambers of commerce by nominating two members of the Federation of Irish Manufacturers.  What I query is whether the Federation of Irish Manufacturers in Cork will have more interest in, and will have more to send out of, the port of Cobh than the producers of cattle, sheep, poultry and eggs in the county.  If the Minister was good enough to give representation to the Kilkenny County Council on the New Ross Harbour Board, surely he cannot deny the right of the Cork County Council to representation on the Cobh Harbour Board, which has been misnamed the Cork Harbour. When one reviews the members that are appointed, one finds that there are four members from two chambers of commerce in Cork City.  I do not know what they represent.  All I have ever seen or heard of them is as being a kind of society full of pious resolutions, doing nothing.  I have never seen any effective work done by the chambers of commerce in Cork City. I do not know why they have two rooms there.  There are two members of the Federation of Irish Manufacturers. If the Irish manufacturers in Cork City are any use, they should be members of the chambers of commerce. I see no reason for having chambers of commerce on the one hand and a federation of manufacturers on the other.  Should they not be one body, instead of three separate bodies?  Then there are two members elected on a tonnage basis.  That makes eight members out of a total of 19.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no representation of the people who will be producing the bulk of the material that will be exported, namely, the rural community, and no representation of the people who will be consuming the goods that will be brought in, namely, the ratepayers of the county.  I suggest to the Minister that that is a grievance that should be remedied.  I suggest that the representatives of the county council have a far greater right to representation on <Col N="93" /> the harbour authority than either the chambers of commerce, who represent nobody, or the Federation of Irish Manufacturers who should be one with the chambers of commerce if they were any good.</P>
    <P>This thing of opening four or five different doors to certain members is rather a joke.  That is what is being done under this Bill.  If you cannot get in through the federation of manufacturers, then you can take your chance on the tonnage basis; if you cannot get in on the tonnage basis, the chambers of commerce will be there all the time.  If there was any basis on which the chambers of commerce should exist in Cork it should be as representative of Irish manufacturers and the representative body of the people to be represented by members elected on a tonnage basis should be the chambers of commerce.  Why, therefore, have representation on a tonnage basis, representation on a manufacturers' basis and representation of chambers of commerce?  I cannot understand it nor can I see any justice in it.</P>
    <P>I can see no justification whatever for cutting out all representatives of the producers, who will have to see that their stuff is sent out in a marketable condition and that the port will be efficient in doing that.  Nor can I see any justification for cutting out representatives of the consumers, and I do not mean consumers in the city, but consumers in the county, by whom whatever dues are payable, as a result of inefficiency on the part of the harbour authorities, or otherwise, will be borne.  Any neglect or inefficiency on the part of the harbour authorities in sending out perishable goods, such as poultry and eggs, will react ultimately on the producer.  Yet, neither the producer nor the consumer is getting representation under this Bill unless we take the four members of the corporation as representing the consumers. They represent the consumers in the city, perhaps, but they do not represent the consumers in the county and the county is served by Cobh Harbour.  As I have said, I see no justification for representation of two chambers of commerce, a federation of manufacturers and of people elected on a <Col N="94" /> tonnage basis, all of whom, if they are any use in Cork City, should be members of one body.  I would ask the Minister, on Report Stage, to see that representation is given to the rural community under this Bill in respect of Cobh Harbour, which is situated in the rural portion of Cork County.  To confine representation to the tail-end, known as Cork City, is wrong.  I would suggest that on Report Stage the Minister should consider amendments to rectify that mistake.</P>

      <P>I am very interested in the new amendments giving extra membership to live-stock exporters and the Federation of Irish Manufacturers but I am chiefly interested in seeing that membership is given to the fishermen of Dingle Harbour.  On the old board, they had four members.  Under this Bill they will get no membership. I think it is very unfair to deprive fishermen of representation on this board because all during the emergency whatever revenue was received by the Dingle harbour authorities was received through the fishermen.  I would ask the Minister to consider giving the fishermen some representation on the Dingle Harbour Board because, as he is aware, there is no urban district council existing in Dingle; there is no chamber of commerce existing there. I am chiefly interested in getting some representation for the fishermen and I would ask the Minister to give that matter consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is an evident desire on the part of the Minister in framing this Bill to try to give adequate representation to those very important boards, the arteries of our country, representing the shipping, commercial and industrial interests. All these should be represented but I think there is a notable weakness in the lack of representation for labour interests, and I should like to support the amendment of Deputy Alderman O'Sullivan.  It cannot be denied that Labour forms a necessary element in the control of ports and harbours and the harmonious working of the interested elements is one of the first essentials for the successful operation of a harbour.  I know no better means <Col N="95" /> of securing cohesion between the port authorities and the port workers than by having direct representation of official labour representatives, such as the local trades council, where ports are situated.  Various speakers referred to the antiquity of various institutions which are seeking representation, such as the shipping federation, the employers' federation and so on.  Deputy O'Sullivan adverted to the long period during which trades councils have been in existence.  In Limerick, I think, we have one of the oldest of them.  The one in Drogheda is also a fairly ancient one.  As well as these, the Dublin, Cork and other trades councils have filled a very useful rôle in trying to maintain industrial peace in their respective centres.  While, as mentioned by the Minister, they may still secure representation by being nominated by some public authority, that is a fortuitous hope.  The Minister might offer that facility to the chambers of commerce.  We claim that the element represented by the trades councils is no less important from the point of view of direct representation on these boards than the element represented by the chambers of commerce. I suggest that the Minister should consider seriously giving the representation which is asked for in the amendment, namely, that trades councils should have the right to nominate two members to these harbour boards.  By having that representation they will be brought into contact with the actual working of the board's affairs and they can act as an intermediary between the port workers and the board itself.  In that way they can fill a very useful rôle and contribute to harmonious working and the avoidance of friction, strike action, etc., which may develop if they have not such representation.  I ask the Minister to consider favourably that particular point.  He would not be overloading the membership of the various boards by putting on two representatives and, as I say, they can fill a useful rôle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that he was not prepared to give special representation to special interests.  I <Col N="96" /> suppose he is sound in that.  It would be impossible to give representation to all the special interests that might be seeking representation.  But it appears to me that the representation set out in the amendment is loaded in favour of particular interests and I do not think that is sound.  I think Deputy Dockrell made a good case for an increase in the representation of shipping members.  Surely it is sound to suggest that the authorities controlling the harbour and the shipping in the harbour should have a technical knowledge of shipping.  If the representation of those with technical knowledge is reduced to two in 18, it is scarcely an equitable representation.  I think the Minister should consider increasing that particular representation.  In doing so, he might reduce the representation under (b) and (d) and possibly (e).</P>
      <P>So far as the live-stock representation is concerned, I am pleased that the Minister has given way to the representations made in regard to that. I also think that the point made by the Minister, that the Minister for Agriculture should be empowered to nominate the body, is sound enough. The Minister told the House that the national executive of the live-stock traders disappeared for a time and was then revived again.  No organisation has a lease of life.  I know that the national executive of live-stock traders is consulted on every matter pertaining to live stock by the Minister for Agriculture, and I have not the slightest doubt but that he will nominate the national executive of the live-stock trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are legislating for the future. We do not know but that body may be superseded by some more representative body, but, in taking that line of argument, I think it should apply also to paragraph (d).  I do not know why the Minister did not take power to nominate the bodies under paragraph (d).  The Federation of Irish Manufacturers may or may not exist for a long time.  It may be superseded by a more powerful body.  In any case, I have no doubt that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would nominate that body under that particular sub-head. <Col N="97" /> But, having proceeded, as he has done in the amendment when dealing with the live-stock interests, I do not see why he should depart from that principle so far as the other interests are concerned.  I think the Minister should consider applying the same principle to paragraph (d).</P>
    <P>Some other Deputies made representation that other interests should be considered; that, so far as the interests of the rural community are concerned, other commodities are exported and that representatives should be there to look after the particular interests.  I think that would be almost impossible to do.  But I think the Minister is wise in putting in the live-stock interest, because, after all, the live-stock interest is a special interest and requires particular accommodation and particular care in connection with handling and loading.  I have no doubt that the live-stock interest's representatives will look after other agricultural interests as well.  In dealing with this, the Minister referred to the live-stock trade.  Actually, in the amendment the cattle trade is referred to.  I do not know why he has put in &ldquo;cattle trade members&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;live-stock trade members&rdquo;, because we export other live stock besides cattle.  We export sheep and horses and, in the past, we exported live pigs.  I think it is more desirable to use the words &ldquo;live-stock trade&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;cattle trade&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In Part II of the Schedule the Minister has made no provision at all for such representation.  I suggest that provision ought to be made for this in Part II also.  While, at the moment, there may not be any great volume of traffic of live stock from ports other than the ports in Part I of the Schedule, there is a certain amount of such traffic in some of the ports, such as the ports of Drogheda and Dundalk, and perhaps other ports as well. As years go by that traffic may increase.  I think the Minister ought to make provision that, in the event of any substantial volume of traffic passing through any of the ports included in Part II, the Minister for Agriculture would have power to nominate a live-stock representative.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister in dealing with this amendment referred to the fact that Ballina Chamber of Commerce would be incorporated in this Bill.  Looking over Part II, I find that Dundalk Chamber of Commerce is not mentioned.  I do not know whether the Minister received any communication from that body.  I believe they had a meeting.  It was a live organisation, but during the war, of course, they had not very many meetings.  So far as I know, they were not affiliated with the central organisation in Dublin.</P>

      <P>Now, as regards all these amendments, my opinion is that it is characteristic of the Irish people that they should always want representation. A new football club will have great support for a while, but after a month or two, the officials find great difficulty in getting a quorum to attend the meetings.  I happen to be a member of the Dundalk Harbour Board, by virtue of the fact that I was chairman of the urban council.  Notwithstanding all that has been said regarding democratic representation, I find that the members who comprised that body did their business in an efficient manner, they lost no time in talking about other things, but simply stuck to the agenda and most of the meetings finished in half an hour's time.  We might as well face the facts. Everyone knows the Minister cannot give representation to every interest in this country.  Everyone knows that the large committee is about the most inefficient body one could have in any organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only thing I see arising from this Bill&mdash;bearing in mind the position of all the harbours on the eastern seaboard&mdash;is that there is a lot of representation of the British collieries. That gives some hope that, if and when this Bill is passed, we may have coal boats coming into Drogheda, Dundalk and Wexford ports, which at present are practically idle.  We speak about representation, but that is really the type of representation we want and that is what the harbours here <Col N="99" /> want as well.  I agree that the Minister is prepared to do his best in providing the machinery, if and when the time comes when that machinery will be wanted; but as far as I am concerned personally, I have not a great deal of confidence, of faith or hope, in all the suggestions put forward here by the Minister and by Deputies, though they have been put forward honestly.  I know the position of the harbours referred to.  What we want is the coal boats and until we get them, all these grand amendments and grand representations are of very little good.</P>
    <P>We heard Deputy Corry bemoaning the fact that representatives of the Irish manufacturers should have representation on the harbour authorities. He seems to be displeased at that, forgetting the fact that the Irish manufacturers are the very embodiment of the Fianna Fáil policy for the past 12 years, building up our industries. He seems to be displeased and he talks about giving representation to the people exporting through the port of Cork&mdash;exporting to Great Britain, of course&mdash;although he says we are able to consume in this country all that we produce.  That is foolish. I believe it will be impossible for the Minister to give representation to all the interests seeking it.</P>
    <P>Although I come from the working class myself, with all due respect to Labour, I would not go out of my way to have a representative of labour on any public authority.  If they got elected to the county council or the urban council, well and good, and, after that, if they are chosen on harbour bodies or other bodies, well and good; but I do not think it is good policy to differentiate between different sections of the people.  This being a small country, I firmly believe that we must all work together, that it is only by co-operation, by goodwill and by supporting one another, that we can succeed.  I would not lose a night's sleep, as a worker myself, about having a working-class representative on the authority.  If there is a good man there, who is intelligent and who is fit, he should be elected and he will be <Col N="100" /> elected, but there is no reason to kick up a row.  Naturally, by their intensive organisation, they will acquire that representation, not alone on harbour authorities but also on other public bodies, including the Dáil. Therefore, there is not a lot to be said in favour of having a labour representative, or, for that matter, any other representative.</P>
    <P>I quite agree that there is a grievance as regards organised labour, in giving special representation to such bodies as the chamber of commerce.  It could be called differentiation or class distinction, but I would not lose a night's sleep over it.  The principal thing we want is trade for our ports and that is what I am thinking of at the moment. Whilst I agree that the Minister is wise to consolidate most of these amendments, and try to have a general discussion on the amendments proposed by the Minister, yet beyond and above all that, I hope the Minister will lose no time in bringing about what is most important of all, a little trade to our ports.</P>
    <P>I was interested in one amendment, which is down in my name, regarding the election of nine representatives to the Drogheda Harbour Commissioners, in addition to those representatives who will be selected from the local authority, and the people who paid tonnage rates, plus the three who will be nominated&mdash;one of whom will be a labour representative&mdash;by the Minister himself.  The existing franchise, I understand, is of a very restricted nature.  In view of the discussion which has taken place here to-day, I do not propose to move that amendment. However, I would like to ask the Minister if he could give any indication as to the type of representative&mdash;other than the labour representative, which is guaranteed&mdash;he would nominate to the harbour authorities, in the case of Dundalk and Drogheda.  In the case of the Dublin Corporation and the Cork Corporation, the numbers are increased.  Would the Minister give some slight indication, though it may be too soon to ask for it now, as to the type of qualifications he would deem necessary that those representatives should have whom he intends to <Col N="101" /> nominate?  That information might be of assistance to the members of the House and might ward off a certain amount of criticism.  It would not be much use if the Minister were going to nominate representatives who would act as &ldquo;nosy-parkers&rdquo; on the different harbour authorities, carrying information to the Minister which it would not be correct or wise that they should carry.  I would like to know if the Minister would say something about that, as to what he has in his mind at the moment in regard to such nominations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last sub-section in the Minister's amendment, sub-section 6 (b), provision is made for the representation of elected members by the shipping interest who pay a sum of £10 or, in any particular election where the Minister is of opinion that the application of the £10 limit would result in the number of electors being too small, who pay a lesser sum.  I am interested in a particular small harbour, Balbriggan, which comes under the control of the Dublin Harbour and which will have no representation from the point of view of the £10 limit, though it normally might get representation on the lower figure.  It could happen that, unless the Minister makes special provision, the smaller shipping interests there will not get any representation. In most other harbours, particularly the smaller ones, there naturally will be representation, but in Dublin a place like Balbriggan, which has room only for smaller ships and which would not come under the £10 qualification, there possibly will never be representation.  I wonder if the Minister is satisfied that an adequate safeguard is given there to the smaller shipping interests.  As Deputy Dockrell pointed out, the shipping interests are possibly the most vital on the port board.  In this particular case, there is no representation from the local authority, since the local authority is the Dublin Corporation.  I think the Minister should give some better safeguard to the smaller ports, particularly ports like Howth, Balbriggan and Skerries.  Skerries I know has been under the control of the Dublin port as the law stands at the moment.  These <Col N="102" /> small ports do serve the particular towns and possibly serve even a larger area and I suggest to the Minister that he should give them adequate representation.</P>

      <P>I want to join in the objection raised to the manner in which the Cork County Council has been treated in the proposed constitution of the new harbour authority for Cork.  I certainly cannot conceive how it was proposed to give certain representation and completely ignore the county council in this matter.  Some consideration should be given to a local authority in charge of the largest county in the State and consisting of representatives intimately and closely concerned with the trade of the county and with a particular knowledge of the problems that arise at meetings of the harbour authority. I hope that the Minister will, even at this stage, be in a position to give some indication that that is not his final intention and that before the Bill leaves the House some provision will be made in that respect.</P>
      <P>There are two other matters that I want to mention.  I want to voice the complaint of the people of Berehaven and Bantry as to the failure of the Minister to take cognisance of their position in relation to a measure of this kind.  No provision has been made in regard to either place and there is a feeling in Berehaven and Bantry that they have been completely forgotten.  The Minister's proposals will have the force of authority and any other proposals submitted from other quarters in this House will have a slender chance of succeeding, so I suggest that the Minister should take into account the position of the harbours in Bantry and Berehaven and the constitution of some authority, consisting partly of county council representatives, and the need for providing in some way for local representatives to act in conjunction with them to voice their claims and look after their interests in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very big Bill, involving large and varied interests.  The claims of those places I have mentioned are no less important because the statement <Col N="103" /> made in regard to them is a short one.  I hope that the Minister will do something to meet the undoubted and very well defined claims that the people of these two districts have.  I ask him to review his decision in regard to the Cork Harbour Authority for the purpose of allowing the premier local authority in the country, the Cork County Council, to have some place in the management of the affairs of the harbour.</P>

      <P>In my opinion there is ample provision for the representation of every sectional interest in so far as the administration of harbour boards, and particularly of provincial harbour boards, is concerned. If I understood the Minister rightly, he stated that the area from which members can be elected is 20 miles.  That may be all right in so far as Part I of the First Schedule is concerned, but I think he will find, from a little experience, that 20 miles will be a rather wide area from which to select representatives of harbour boards, particularly provincial harbour boards.</P>
      <P>A good deal has been said about the representation of cattle trade organisations, live-stock interests and agricultural producers.  Surely it is evident that ample provision is made so that each county council can have representation on harbour boards.  If those people do not get representation it will be their own fault.  Speaking from experience, I think the harbour boards will find it very difficult to get attendance, support and service from the cattle trade interests, even when they do elect them.  That has been my experience over a period of 11 years. We elected people on our board to represent the cattle interests, but we could not get them to attend.  That is not much to the credit of the people who clamour here and say that the cattle interests should get representation. I hope when they do get representation that they will utilise it in the future and not neglect things as in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When these harbour boards are being constituted under this legislation I am satisfied it will mean a great <Col N="104" /> improvement, particularly for the Port of Drogheda, which I represent.  In Drogheda we have one of the outstanding harbours in this State.  I can stand up here and claim that we do not owe one bob to any authority.  Even the City of Dublin cannot claim that. I hold that that is due to efficient administration by the people who man that harbour board.  A good deal of the chaos in many of the harbours in this State would never have occurred if the elected representatives discharged their duties in those harbours.</P>
    <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with the claim made by Deputy O'Sullivan on behalf of the trades council.  I know the personnel of the Drogheda Trades Council.  There are on that body some very able men who earn their bread by their hands.  I would like to see provision made so that men who are on the Drogheda Trades Council will get representation on bodies like the harbour board.  We have representatives on the Drogheda Corporation, elected by the people, and they are men of intelligence and culture, competent to take their stand on any public body with representatives of any chamber of commerce in this State.  I want to pay that tribute to the members of the Drogheda Trades Council.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister would be well advised to give further consideration to those matters.  I am quite satisfied every section can get representation, on the harbour boards, from our public boards, through this Bill.  As far as we are concerned, at all events, in selecting representatives for the Drogheda Harbour Board, it can be accepted that every section there will get representation, whether it is Fianna Fáil, the now defunct Fine na Gael Party or the Labour Party.  All sections will get representation&mdash;I am quite satisfied about that.  I hope the Minister will make this Harbour Bill as successful as he has made so many other Bills, in the interests of trade and industry in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Coburn stated that Deputy Corry had deplored the representation given to the Federation of Manufacturers on the new harbour authorities.  That was not Deputy <Col N="105" /> Corry's contention.  His contention was very clearly that because certain members could represent the tonnage electors, the Federation of Manufacturers and either one or the other of the chambers of commerce, there might be voting on three different bodies for a representative on the harbour authority and consequently the representation would be overloaded by these interests.  He contended, and I agree with him entirely, that those who produce the cattle, the sheep, the poultry and the eggs and butter, which are very important factors in our trade and commerce, would not, under the present system, get anything like the representation that was previously given under the old system that prevailed in Cork.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Murphy and Deputy O'Sullivan as regards the representation of labour interests.  The Cork County Council, no matter what views they may have politically, when they came to electing members on these bodies, elected them in proportion to their membership.  Where there was an opportunity of doing that by a fair number of members, we acted on that principle, but now the county council is cut out entirely, and, so far as the corporation is concerned, the representation is so small that small interests will have a very poor chance of getting any member in at all.  In consequence, I suggest that the Minister should increase the membership to at least 21, which corresponds with the present membership of the Cork Corporation.  I think it would be very wise because there would be a chance of getting representatives from the county council who represent the rural community.  While I subscribe to Deputy Corry's contentions in other respects, I may say that, while I would enthusiastically support a change of street names in both Cork and Cobh, I am not advocating a change of name in respect of Cork Harbour.</P>

      <P>We have more than a passing interest in Waterford Harbour.  On the old harbour board, there were 12 members elected by the Waterford Chamber of Commerce, seven by the Waterford Corporation <Col N="106" /> and four representing Clonmel&mdash;a total of 23.  Under the Bill, the board will consist of five members appointed by Waterford Corporation, four elected by Waterford Chamber of Commerce, two elected by the payers of shipping tonnage dues and four appointed by the Minister&mdash;a total of 15.  I should like to suggest a few additions to that. The greater part of the cargoes of shipping out of Waterford harbour is supplied by the North and South Ridings of Tipperary.  The length of the county which the harbour serves is 60 or 70 miles.  Waterford County would be about 15 miles from where it leaves the Carrick border and I suggest that it would be very fair if we had a representative of the Carrick Urban Council on the board.  Clonmel Corporation would be entitled to two and the north and south ridings of the county to two each.  I think that would be a fair representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sixty per cent. of the traffic out of Waterford comes from County Tipperary. The river perhaps 60 years ago was navigable as far as the village of Ardfinnan and was navigable to Clonmel up to 23 years ago.  There was a grant being made by the British Government about the time of the Treaty towards the canalising of the river four miles from Clonmel in the southern direction.  I am sure that Clonmel Corporation or Waterford Harbour Board would have a record of it.  What became of it, I have not been informed.  When four members were appointed originally from Clonmel, boats were doing practically the bulk of the transport and the Clonmel members must have done very useful work.  The boats which carried that traffic from Waterford to Clonmel were horse-drawn and they ceased 20 years ago as a result of a labour strike, but the time may come when, by the use of petrol or steam-propelled boats, the road traffic from Waterford City could be relieved.  Possibly much of the cattle traffic from Clonmel to Waterford, as well as up traffic from Waterford to Clonmel could be carried on these boats.  As Deputy Coburn said, if coal comes again, which is a very remote possibility, it may be possible to use it for drawing coal or turf and the <Col N="107" /> canalising of the river where it has become rather shallow would be well worth consideration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" />&ldquo;It also transpired in evidence that the Clonmel members seldom attended a meeting of the harbour board.

      <P>They never had representation on Waterford Harbour Board.  I want Deputies to understand that up to the present the problem which has been most acute in respect of membership of harbour boards has been to secure the attendance of those who were appointed in sufficient numbers to enable the business of the boards to be carried on properly.  There are exceptions to that.  Dublin is an exception, Drogheda is an exception.  The busier ports were always able to ensure a fairly large attendance of members of the harbour boards.  The smaller ports, and the ports where trade was declining, had a greater difficulty, and in many cases the persons who were least regular in their attendance were the representatives of public bodies, <Col N="109" /> those who had no personal business interests associated with the ports and were chosen to safeguard the general public interest.  In many cases the harbour boards with an effective membership were those whose businesses were associated with the ports.  They were naturally affected either for good or ill by the adequacy or otherwise of the facilities provided by the port authorities.  Any tendency to unduly enlarge the membership of harbour boards by the appointment of persons who might represent some general interest and have no direct and immediate concern with the management of the port would, I think, be a mistake.  It will tend to secure that these new bodies will start off on a better basis than some of the old bodies and will become more in the nature of a forum at which views will be debated rather than a business executive with a job to do.</P>
      <P>I had originally intended to adhere strictly to the recommendations of the tribunal which were, in fact, designed to give specific power to put persons on a harbour board, but gave no indication or direction as to the type of representative they should choose.  I still think it is wise to maintain that principle as closely as possible, but I have, in consequence of representations made to me, proposed to depart from it somewhat in respect of the four main ports, and to allow the nomination of persons to the authorities of these ports who will be representative of particular interests.  I must agree that, having breached the position which I had intended to take up in that respect, I am not as well able to resist the proposal to give special representation to labour interests as I might otherwise have been.  I still have considerable doubts as to its wisdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that I had put in the Bill a provision which was not contained in the recommendations of the tribunal and which limited the discretion of the Minister in respect of his appointments, in one respect by requiring him to have one person chosen by him because he was representative of, or was familiar with, labour interests.  I might have withdrawn that proposal again if we had maintained the proposed constitution <Col N="110" /> of harbour boards as recommended by the tribunal, on the grounds that the nomination to be made by the Minister should be used solely for the purpose of making good any deficiencies in the representative capacity of the harbour boards resulting from the appointments made by other bodies. Conceivably, but not probably, all persons nominated by a local authority might be labour representatives in which case it was clearly unnecessary to add to the number of such representatives by any other method.  But, on the other hand, it is conceivable that none of them would be representative of labour interests, in which case it would be clearly desirable that the power of nomination by the Minister should be exercised to secure that there should be such representation.</P>
    <P>It is clearly desirable that there should be representation, but how to get the best type of representation is the problem.  It is a particular problem at the present time.  If we were to give the power of direct representation to labour interests on the boards of a number of harbours as we are giving representation to live-stock interests and manufacturing interests, we would have to adopt a device somewhat similar to that which I have adopted in relation to the live-stock interests, the device of giving the Minister power to nominate a body which would exercise the power.  I think it is true to say that the Dublin Trades Council at present has lost the affiliation of unions, if not the most representative, certainly of unions that are very representative of the type of workers who find a livelihood at the port, and I think that the Cork Council no longer contains representatives of the only union which caters for labour at Cork port.  That situation may end, and I hope it will end.  It may provide an argument for those who want to end it to show that the mere existence of it prevents us getting a simple method of securing direct representation of labour interests in a case such as this. But should there be such representation, the harbour authority will not merely be an executive authority managing the business of a port, it will also be an employer, and in a matter <Col N="111" /> of this kind it may not merely be an embarrassment to the harbour authority but an embarrassment to those bargaining with it on behalf of labour interests, if there was a conflict of responsibility.  I think that those who go on a harbour authority should go on with one purpose only, and that is to do the business of the harbour properly.  They certainly should not have the idea that they are already briefed on behalf of some particular interest.</P>
    <P>However, I would like Deputy O'Sullivan and other Deputies who spoke in favour of the amendment to give direct representation on harbour boards to trades councils to consider the matter again between this and the Report Stage.  I ask them to remember that I could not accept at all an amendment which would name an existing trades council in circumstances where there may be two such bodies at the moment. The one named in the amendment may, in fact, have no representative of the type of labour which should be represented and would be entitled to claim that representation on the harbour board.  I think that would involve some other method of securing such representation.  I propose a method myself in the Bill.  I say that the Minister shall appoint at least one person who shall be representative of labour interests.  There may be many more such persons, but there will be at least one nominated by him, and he could, if he thought the circumstances required it, nominate all four.  Alternatively, you could say that instead of nominating one of the four the Minister would have the further right of nomination confined to representatives of labour interests, or, alternatively, that the Minister would have the power to designate&mdash;in present circumstances I would not like to have it&mdash;the nominating body.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy and other Deputies spoke about the representation given to chambers of commerce on harbour boards.  I emphasised, when speaking before, that these harbour authorities are local bodies.  I want to qualify that in relation to the four main harbours, and what I said in relation to <Col N="112" /> the representation for labour interests applies only to the four main harbours. The representation which we are proposing to give to the live-stock trade and the Federation of Irish Manufacturers is confined to the four main harbours.  I think it can be argued that the principle of purely local representation can be departed from in the case of the four main harbours because their business is of national concern and the adequacy of the facilities provided by these four main harbours has repercussions far outside the areas in which the harbours are located but, leaving aside these four main harbours, and speaking of the secondary harbours, I would strongly oppose any suggestion that would include in their membership persons who could not be described as representative of local interests only.  These harbours are, in the main, in competition one with the other.  The development of these harbours, the improvement of the facilities, the lowering of the rates, the attraction of trade to them, is a matter in which all the local interests are concerned and they should be allowed to develop their harbour and attract trade to it, if necessary in competition with a neighbouring harbour, by the improvement of their facilities, the increase of the efficiency of their administration, or otherwise.  I think we should not have in relation to these smaller harbours any other provision in their constitution except the designation of the authorities who are going to appoint members on their boards.</P>
    <P>The chambers of commerce were chosen because, of the various commercial organisations that exist in this country, only the chambers of commerce could be said to be representative of purely local interests in the case of these harbour boards.  The Federation of Irish Manufacturers is a national organisation.  It has no local branches.  Other similar commercial organisations are constituted on a national basis or on a regional basis. The chamber of commerce is a body which is composed of the local commercial interests, designed to foster the local commercial interests and, clearly, they are the persons who should have the right to nominate upon <Col N="113" /> the harbour authority which is concerned with the management and development of a local institution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to the fact that in some of these areas there is no chamber of commerce.  I am proposing to add, by way of amendment to the Schedule, provision for representation of the chamber of commerce in some additional centres&mdash;Ballina and Dundalk were mentioned.  The recommendation of the Harbours Tribunal was to confine representation to chambers of commerce which were affiliated to the central organisation, what they call the Associated Chamber of Commerce.  I decided to depart from that and to give power and representation to a chamber of commerce where it is obvious that such an organisation exists.  The Minister must decide that and provision exists in the Bill, or will be inserted in the Bill, to provide that in any case where it does not appear there is a chamber of commerce, the moment such an organisation appears which is thoroughly representative of local commercial interests the Minister may add it to the list of bodies entitled to representation on the harbour board. On the other hand, if in any particular place a chamber of commerce ceases to function and by becoming inactive loses the claim to be representative of local commercial interests, then the Minister may remove it from the Schedule and deprive it of its right of nomination or substitute some other chamber for it if the other chamber appears in fact to be the more representative body.  That machinery will avoid a recurrence of what has happened to harbour authorities in the past, where certain people were given powers of nomination or certain organisations were given rights of membership, where either the individuals failed to exercise their right or the organisation disappeared and, in the case of one harbour authority, an arrangement was made for the election of the original members and apparently no arrangement was made for any subsequent election so that the original members or persons co-opted by them have continued in unbroken membership for some time.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dockrell complained about the cutting down of the representation of shipping interests. Let us be quite clear again that this Bill does not cut down the representation that is given to any interest. There is a provision that two members of these harbour boards will be elected by persons who are qualified electors by reason of their shipping interests, but there is certainly nothing to prevent the Dublin Corporation, in the case of Dublin, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, or the Minister, putting other persons associated with shipping or having shipping interests on the harbour authority.  Clearly, it would be a matter of concern to the chamber of commerce in each case to ensure that those who had shipping interests in the ports or who might bring shipping business to the ports or develop the use made of the facilities provided should be represented on the harbour board.  What we are doing is providing a different method of choosing the members from that which existed in the past.  In the past, the person chosen by the shipping interests or by the importers of goods through the Port of Dublin had the great majority of the Dublin Port Board.  The Dublin Corporation, which was the only other nominated body, had a minority representation. I do not think that is desirable.  I think it is always undesirable that the control of a harbour authority should pass entirely into the hands of shipping interests.  I think that wherever that has happened the efficiency of the harbour administration has suffered considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan inquired why we adopted the device of having the Minister for Agriculture nominate the organisation that is to have the right of representation on behalf of the cattle trade while we did not adopt a similar device in the case of the Federation of Irish Manufacturers.  In the first case, I should like to point out <Col N="115" /> that the Federation of Irish Manufacturers stand in particular relationship with the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It has received something approaching official recognition, which recognition goes to the extent of having an officer of the Department of Industry and Commerce on the council of the federation for liaison purposes.  The distinction made, however, is not intended to be to the detriment of the cattle trade. Quite the reverse.  As the amendment stands, the requirement will be to have representatives of the cattle trade secured through some organisation designated by the Minister for Agriculture.  If one organisation disappears, he will designate another.  If the Federation of Irish Manufacturers disappears, nothing will take its place and, what is more, if it did, I do not think anything should take its place. I think the arrangements made to secure representation of commercial interests otherwise would be adequate. While it exists, we are giving it that right of representation.  I do not think it will not continue to exist, but if a situation should arise in which it ceases to be active, then it would either lose that right of representation altogether or that right, under another provision, would be exercisable by the Minister who would, in consequence of the failure of the federation to exercise it, have the responsibility of nominating persons who were representative of manufacturing interests.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to secure any special representation for other agricultural interests.  I think it is a mistaken idea that those who produce eggs, butter or certain other agricultural products are ultimately concerned with the method of their disposal.  The person who produces eggs sells them to a trader in eggs, an egg exporter; a person who produces milk, sells it to a creamery and at a very early stage in the process of production and distribution these commodities pass into the hands of traders.  We have, I think, taken adequate steps to secure representation of these trading interests on the harbour boards and they are the persons <Col N="116" /> who should be represented because they are concerned with the efficiency of the harbour administration and the adequacy of the facilities provided.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry said that only one of the 19 members of the Cork Harbour Board would be from Cobh.  So far as the Bill is concerned, all 19 can be from Cobh.  There is certainly nothing in the Bill to prevent it and if the Cork Corporation, the Cork Chambers of Commerce, the Cork shipping interests or the Minister believe that, Cobh has not got sufficient representation at any particular election then they can be given additional representation.  What we are providing for is that, of the five local authority members, one at least must be a representative of the Cobh Urban Council.</P>
    <P>Neither was it correct to say that, in the case of Dingle, we are depriving the fishermen of representation. The Dingle Harbour Board is at present constituted on a special basis which gives representation to fishing interests.  These fishing interests may be entitled to elect their representatives as qualified electors in respect of the payment of tonnage dues.  But, in any event, it is to be assumed that the Kerry County Council, or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, will choose persons who will be representative of those who are using the Dingle harbour, and there is no reason to fear that the fishing interests will not be represented on the harbour board.</P>
    <P>A Deputy asked me to indicate the type of representatives I may appoint on the harbour boards.  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when considering the appointment of representatives, would have the duty of choosing persons who were representative of local interests or personally suitable for membership of the harbour board but who, for any reason, failed to secure that membership through one or other of the bodies.  That is certainly what is intended; that when the local authorities and the chamber of commerce have made their nominations, the qualified electors have elected their <Col N="117" /> representatives, the Minister for Industry and Commerce will get a list of those who are, at that stage, members-elect, and will consider to what extent any particular local interest has failed to get adequate representation or whether some individual, who is specially qualified for membership, should be added on.  That certainly has been the practice which I have endeavoured to follow in the case of harbour authorities where I have the power of nomination at present.  It is also certain that that is the practice which we will follow in the future. Very frequently, the problem is to get the persons who are the most suitable for membership to agree to act. Frequently, such a person will hesitate before allowing their names to go before a local body or a local council for fear they might not be successful in their candidature, but he will accept nomination from the Minister because there is then no element of doubt as to whether the person will be appointed or not.  In my experience, most of the persons who have agreed to accept membership of a harbour board on Ministerial nomination are the most active and useful members of these boards.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy referred to the absence of any reference in the Bill to Berehaven and Bantry.  There are a number of harbours not referred to in the Bill and which were not dealt with by the tribunal because they were not mentioned in the tribunal's terms of reference.  Provision is, however, made in the Bill to elevate any harbour into the Class B category if the trade of that harbour develops sufficiently to justify the creation of a separate harbour authority.  Generally, the set-up will be, Class A harbours constituted as proposed here; Class B harbours, that is smaller harbours which are doing some fairly considerable trade; and smaller harbours which, in the tribunal's and in my view, should be managed by the county councils, but which may, because of some development of business, be graded up to Class B harbours, just as Class B harbours can be graded up to Class A harbours.  Provision is made in the Bill to enable a harbour of the <Col N="118" /> Class B type to be graded as a Class A harbour and for county council harbours, or other local harbours not at present mentioned in the Bill, to graduate into Class B, if their trade develops to an extent which would justify that.  In my view, Berehaven and Bantry and smaller ports, which are not at present doing sufficient trade to justify the creation of a special harbour authority for them, should be managed by the county councils.  But county councils are not always willing to take over the management of these smaller ports and to accept the financial responsibility involved in their management.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy and Deputy Corry referred to the fact that Cork County Council is not getting representation on the Cork Harbour Board.  It is not, any more than is Dublin County Council getting representation on the Dublin Harbour Board.  There is, however, power in the Bill to enable the Cork County Council to be given representation on the Cork Harbour Board if the Cork County Council undertakes any financial responsibility or obligation in relation to the development of Cork Harbour.  The same thing applies to other cases.  An additional local authority may be given representation on the harbour board by reason of the fact that it guarantees a loan or otherwise accepts some financial obligation arising out of the development of the harbour.  I hope the Cork Deputies will not think that leaving the Cork County Council off the Cork Harbour Board is in any way intended to be detrimental to Cork interests.  We are, in fact, putting Cork Harbour in the position of being a Class A harbour and constituting the board in precisely the same manner as the Dublin, Limerick and Waterford boards.  It is only in the case of smaller harbours, which are regarded as not being of national importance, but only of local importance, that special provision is made to secure county council representation, and then again, in the case of these smaller harbours, the county council must, in fact, come to the aid of the harbour authority financially when a special development work has to be undertaken. <Col N="119" /> I think that to adopt Deputy Corry's and Deputy Murphy's suggestion with reference to Cork Harbour might be interpreted as putting Cork Harbour back into the Class B category, which would, I am sure, offend Cork sentiments.</P>

I think the very fact that labour members are on the board is regarded by the board as a whole as being a certain influence for good, so far as purely labour matters are concerned.

      <P>It is provided that a member must live within 20 miles of the harbour, unless he is an appointee of the local authority.  Deputy O'Neill wants to make that residence condition apply even to a local authority appointee.  I do not think that is desirable.  I can mention as an example the specific case of the Galway County Council, which has guaranteed a substantial loan for the Galway Harbour authority and is on that account entitled to representation on the harbour board.  However, there are many parts of Galway more than 20 miles away from the harbour and it would be clearly unfair to deprive the county council of the right to put on any person it thought fit from its membership to safeguard its interest in the harbour board, particularly when the payment of interest on that loan is a county-at-large charge.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that a man lives more than 20 miles away, but might have very considerable interests in the port.  In that case it would be unfair to debar him from being on the port board.  We do not know in the future what mechanical improvements will come about; people may be living considerably more than 20 miles away from <Col N="128" /> their place of business and that is my reason for moving the amendment.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the limitation was not so much to confine representation to persons with business interests in the port area as to confine it to persons who could conveniently attend and who could be expected to attend board meetings. The case was raised more specifically in relation to Foynes Harbour, where local business interests are represented by oil companies which are very intimately concerned with the development of the harbour and which bring most of the trade to the harbour.  It seemed desirable that the persons who accept membership of the harbour authority should reside in the harbour area and should be able to attend harbour board meetings with reasonable regularity.  The experience has been that, where members secured election or accepted nomination to the harbour authority, but lived a considerable distance away, they did not attend and it is a repetition of that circumstance that we are trying to avoid.  Perhaps the Deputy will leave this amendment over.  I should like to consider it and I might go some distance towards meeting him.  In the case of the Dublin area it is possible to have a different rule to what might apply elsewhere.  There is a special problem at Foynes.  It could be argued that if a man had a place of business he might be likely to attend meetings sufficiently frequently.</P>

      <P>I see the Deputy's point, but I am anxious to keep all the provisions of this Bill that relate to the proceedings of harbour boards in conformity with the legislation that relates to the proceedings of local authorities.  It is desirable that we should use precisely the same words, and have exactly the same provisions, so that not merely will the members of the harbour board and local authority be familiar with the procedure, but any interpretation placed on the relevant provision in the Local Government Acts will apply in this case.  There are many advantages in having the various provisions of this Bill which govern the proceedings of a harbour board the same as those in local government legislation which apply to local government authorities.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's point is that there is need for an amendment of the Local Government Act.  It may be the Local Government Act could be improved in that respect.

      <P>(4) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, no officer of a harbour authority shall be removed from office unless with the consent of two-thirds of the members of such authority present and voting at the meeting of such authority at which the question of such removal is decided.</P>
      <P>I think that attention was drawn to the point covered by this amendment by the Dublin Port and Docks Board. It is that certain employees were covered to the extent that they could not be finally dispensed with except by a certain majority of the board and it is to ensure a continuation of that cover that this amendment is moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am aware that certain officers of the Dublin Port Board enjoyed that very special status, I think it would be undesirable to give a similar status to all employees of all harbour boards.  The Bill as framed empowers a local authority, with the sanction of the Minister, to remove an officer, and I think the need to obtain Ministerial sanction is sufficient safeguard.  While I can understand that some officers of the Dublin Port and Docks Board may feel that their situation is affected because they have this very special right, I do not think that would be a justification for giving similar rights <Col N="134" /> to all officers of all harbour boards. Having regard to the possibility of abuse, and I suppose that is the only thing the officers may have in mind, that is, the possibility that they may be unfairly or wrongly dismissed by a chance majority of the harbour board, I think the danger of that is minimised, if not eliminated altogether, by the necessity to obtain Ministerial sanction before it becomes effective.  I therefore could not agree to accept the amendment.  It would be wrong to provide that, once a person becomes an officer of the harbour board, he can in practice never be dismissed, no matter how justified his dismissal may be.  A majority of a harbour board, which will be always slow to act except upon a very definite case, supported by Ministerial sanction, is sufficient and is an adequate safeguard for the officer concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are laying down a general law which will apply to all harbour authorities and getting out of the position in which every authority had its own law.  That general law must determine the position in relation to the Dublin Port and Docks Board. There are certain officers of that board with special privileges of one kind or another who no doubt will continue to enjoy them at the discretion of the Dublin Port and Docks Board which could, in any event, have withdrawn them, if they had wanted to do so, at some time in the past.  They got these rights by decision of the board, which conceivably could have changed its mind and taken them away again, rather than by legislation.  The new situation, which requires a harbour board to get Ministerial sanction before dismissing an officer to whom the section applies is a sufficient safeguard and, taken on balance, is probably as good a safeguard as the two-thirds majority required in respect of some of these officers at present.</P>

    <P>As the section stands, all members could be removed from committees, and <Col N="136" /> I am anxious to ensure that at least such members as could reasonably be termed useful on these committees would be available for service and that they shall not be removed unless designated in the removal order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Deputy's point.  Again, my argument against the amendment is that the local government legislation, which is the precedent I am following, does not provide in that way.  In the case of a local authority which is removed, the subsidiary bodies appointed by it cease to function, and their members cease to hold office.  In fact, the Local Government Bill now before the Dáil has some provision to remove certain doubts in that respect, and while it is probable that a commissioner appointed in lieu of a harbour authority would be glad to get the co-operation of people familiar with the work, I doubt if it is desirable to make a statutory provision in the manner suggested by the Deputy.  Deputies will understand that there is a difference between a harbour board and a local authority in this way, that the trouble with harbour boards is that sometimes they will not work.  The local authority will go on.  It may do wrong things or mismanage the affairs of a local area on the penalty of being removed and a commissioner appointed in its place.  The trouble with a harbour authority is that it cannot cease to function without very serious consequences arising in some cases. That would not apply in Dublin or in the case of the larger ports.  But in the case of some of the smaller harbour authorities they do cease to function, due to the fact that members do not turn up to meetings or that a quorum cannot be secured.  In such a case there may be no alternative but to appoint a commissioner in order to ensure that the work of the harbour will be carried on, that the staff of the harbour is paid, that the dredging of the harbour is kept up and so on.  It is very unlikely that this power to remove a harbour authority would be exercised except in cases where the work of the harbour was not being done.  Consequently, the commissioner who would go in there would be looking for people to help him to do the work rather than to <Col N="137" /> remove people who were doing it the wrong way.</P>

      <P>When the stage was reached whereby the harbour authority was suppressed a commissioner would be put in.  That might arise from incompetency, corruption or any other cause.  But, even in that situation, there would at least be a minority of the members who were giving service on the board, and who, I suggest, should not suffer.  They might be members of various committees of the board and have special knowledge of the work of the port.  I am anxious to ensure that even during the reign of the commissioner their services should be available, and that they should not automatically go out on the suppression of the board.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 71:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After sub-section (3), in page 22, to add the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) Every Order made by the Minister under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if a resolution annulling the Order is passed by either such House within the next subsequent twenty-one days, on which that <Col N="138" /> House has sat after the Order is laid before it, the Order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the amendment that was discussed to-day on the question that regulations made by the Minister should have the force of law.  The Minister, in the course of the debate, said that there was one way open to the House by which they could put down amendments to specific sections. I think members would desire that precautions are taken to ensure that an opportunity is afforded to the House of discussing in the ordinary way any regulations that are made.  I would refer the Minister to the debate that took place in the Seanad last Thursday on this matter, in which the Taoiseach gave expression to a particular point of view.  So far as these regulations and Orders are concerned, the people who are affected say that it is almost impossible to get hold of them at present. Therefore it is desirable that safeguards and precautions should be taken in relation to them.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that there is a special case to be made requiring that Orders made under the section should be tabled before the Dáil.  The proposal in this part of the Bill is that where a harbour authority fails to do its work, and is shown by a local inquiry to have failed to do its work, it may be replaced by a commissioner appointed by the Minister. He can hold office for certain periods, the maximum period being four years. A commissioner having been appointed, it is clear that a number of the provisions of the Act will not be applicable to the circumstances in so far as they relate to the harbour board.  They cannot be made fully applicable where a board has gone out and a commissioner is acting in its place.  All that the section does is to give the Minister power to do such things as are necessary or expedient to enable the harbour authority, which is now the commissioner, to function effectually, and generally to enable this part of the Act to have full force and effect.  It provides for the exercise <Col N="139" /> and performance, by a deputy, of the functions of a commissioner who becomes ill.  Having accepted the principle that the Minister should have the power to depose a harbour authority from office, as the result of a local inquiry for neglect of duty, it seems to me to be foolish at that stage for the House to start drawing back: to say that it may take back this power and thereby make it impossible for the Minister to exercise it in a case where a commissioner has been appointed.  I would not agree that that should necessarily be made the subject of motions in the House.</P>
      <P>The power of the annulment of Orders seems to me to be one which should be exercised only where there is some suggestion that the Minister might use his power to alter the effect of the legislation, to use the legislation in a manner that would achieve a different purpose from that which the Oireachtas had in mind when passing it.  It seems to me to be going too far to apply it in cases where the power can only be used in such a manner as to give effect to the intentions of the Legislature.  Clearly, the words in this section make it quite obvious that the Minister's Orders made under it must be and can be only such as to give effect to this part of the Bill.  It is always a difficult matter to argue against an amendment of this kind, because there is the temptation to say that this issue may never arise, and that, consequently, there is not much point in opposing an amendment of this character in relation to some sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But I do think there is a wider issue involved, and that we should clearly distinguish between the different classes of circumstances and limit the powers of the Dáil in relation to them. In respect of many provisions in legislation there are minor matters of administration which can best be left to be dealt with administratively and which the Dáil may not concern themselves with.  These matters relate to the prescribing of the form in which people may make application for various matters, prescribing the manner <Col N="140" /> in which they may do it, giving the Minister certain minor powers of adjustment to ensure that the intentions of the Act are brought into effect.  There are times when legislation provides that the Minister may have power to suspend the operation of the Act, or to modify its operation in some way which would be related to circumstances that the Dáil had not in mind when enacting it, and in such cases it seems desirable that the Dáil should have the power to countermand the Minister's decision if the Dáil regards it as contrary to the public interest. There are other cases where the Minister's power is so definitely one of altering the purpose of the legislation that he should not be allowed to exercise it at all until prior approval of the Dáil has been secured.  There is, in fact, in this Bill, provision for harbour works Orders which cannot come into effect until the Dáil has passed a Bill giving positive approval of it.</P>
    <P>In this particular case I would not agree that the Dáil should concern itself at all.  It seems to me that, having accepted the principle, having decided that the Minister should have this power, it is reasonable to say: &ldquo;What is more, we will give the Minister that little freedom of action which will enable him to make it effective.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is something to be said for Deputy O'Sullivan's contention.  The Minister argues that this is only to be used in questions of detail.  If, as the Minister says, this is so rarely to be operated, there does not appear to be any objection to inserting it.  It is a safeguard, and, as the section stands and as Section 36 stands, not alone is there no safeguard, but the Orders, whatever they are, are not laid on the Table of the House, nor is there any obligation on the Minister to publicise them in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Sullivan says, anybody affected by an Order may not be able to get a copy of it, and it is possible that a person may commit some offence or may be involved in some serious change in his position before he becomes aware of the terms of it.  I think it is bad practice.  It got through <Col N="141" /> in the earlier section when there might have been an amendment put down.  I think that the report which was submitted and which recommended that the Minister should have that controlling interest in harbours never intended that the Minister should have that controlling interest without being subject to the control of the Dáil by laying his reports or regulations on the Table.  I think the Minister should accept this even if it is only so as to allow those affected by an Order to become aware of its terms.  I think there are only one or two Orders in respect of which a motion to annul was made in the last two years, but it does not follow that in future or at any time if a Deputy deems it necessary or desirable to put down a motion annulling an Order that it should not be considered.</P>

I think it is extending the power of the Minister just a little bit too far, to ensure that in addition to any other enactments, we are also to give him a certain amount of free play in respect of the Bill we are now discussing.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the motion and to say that I think it is long past the time when we ought to have had a thorough examination of proposals for social security, proposals which would be calculated to give us a better code of social services and, incidentally, a measure of security from the adversity which, under our present <Col N="144" /> system of society, is inseparable from life itself.  His Lordship the Bishop of Clonfert, with commendable enthusiasm and an energy well worthy of the cause to which he devoted his talents, presented proposals to the nation and to the Minister for Local Government which, in his view and, I think, in the view of every enlightened citizen, would be calculated to give us a code of social services adequate to our requirements, a code of social services suitable to our peculiar needs and the type of agricultural-industrial balance we have here, and, at the same time, give to ordinary citizens that measure of economic security which ought to be the God-given right of every citizen.</P>
      <P>I think that every reasonable person will regret the manner in which these proposals by His Lordship were received by the Minister for Local Government. One could scarcely imagine a more intemperate display of pettiness and petulance than was exhibited by the Minister in his tirades in connection with these proposals.  I venture to say that in that respect the Minister probably did not speak for the Government, many members of which, I am sure, felt in their hearts, even though it might not be convenient for them to say it publicly, an appreciation of His Lordship for the painstaking care which he bestowed on an examination of the problem of necessary social services in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the mere fact that the Minister for Local Government has seen fit to engage in what can only be regarded as a disorderly harangue, so far as he was concerned, with His Lordship the Bishop of Clonfert, is no reason why His Lordship's proposals in respect to social services ought not to hold the stage, and is no reason why these proposals ought not to get the careful examination to which they are entitled on their merits.  Indeed, I think the least the Taoiseach ought to do in the matter is to remove the humiliation to which His Lordship was subjected by being removed from the position of Chairman of the National Health Insurance Society and that His Lordship ought to be restored to the position so as to indicate that the Government did not share <Col N="145" /> the rather belligerent views with which the Minister for Local Government usually enshrouds himself when the occasion calls for tact and delicacy.  As His Lordship rightly pointed out in the document which he submitted to the Government, there is need here for a code of social services, not merely as a matter of economic sanity, but as an essential of social justice.  His Lordship took care to sift and to weigh the case for the establishment of these services and he submitted to the Government proposals which were at least worthy of careful consideration.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for Finance in his last Budget speech told us that the Government had examined the cost of the Beveridge proposals so far as their application to this country was concerned and intimated what the cost of the application of those services to this country would mean.  It seems to me rather a strange thing that the Government could examine the Beveridge proposals for social services and not be able to devote some time to a careful examination of the proposals submitted by Dr. Dignan.  At all events, so far as the Government's public utterances are concerned, I think the only thing we do know definitely is that the Government have been able to find time to estimate the cost of the application to this country of the Beveridge proposals, while we have not yet been able to get from the Government any indication of the cost of the application of Dr. Dignan's proposals, which, I think, are generally admitted to take cognisance of the agricultural and industrial peculiarities of this country to-day.  I would urge on the Taoiseach, as this motion does, that the whole question of social services ought to be thoroughly examined by the Government, and, in that connection, Dr. Dignan's proposals afford an opportunity of examining the matter over the range of insurance schemes and medical services set out in his very comprehensive and very commendable scheme.</P>
    <P>Two things strike anybody who has given any thought to the question of social services and social security in this country.  One is that our present code of social services is grossly inadequate <Col N="146" /> and, in the main, makes available what, in our circumstances to-day, can only be described as a beggarly scheme of allowances, allowances which make no provision whatever for the set of adverse circumstances for which these allowances are supposed to provide.  No matter what service you take; if you take, for instance, the first in the form of old age pensions, which goes back to 1908, or the latest in the form of children's allowances, which is about a year or 18 months old, you will find the same characteristic in both.  Not only are our social services utterly inadequate for the requirements of our people, but the administration of the schemes rivals in chaos the inadequacy of the services.</P>
    <P>For instance, instead of having a Ministry of social services, or a Ministry of public health, concerned with the administration of social services, we appear to have gone deliberately out of our way to avoid the application of any co-ordinated plan to the administration of our social services.  To-day we have a situation in which old age pensions are administered by three authorities.  In the first instance, a person makes an application for a pension to the local authority.  When the application has been considered by the local authority, the case is then remitted to the Department of Local Government and Public Health to see whether the pension ought to be allowed.  Then, when you come to the granting of the pension and its administration proper, the administration is carried out through the Revenue Department.  Can anybody imagine a more unsatisfactory method of administering old age pensions than to start with an application to the local authority, relay it to the Local Government Department, and then bring in the Revenue Commissioners, in case the matter would be plain sailing and in case it would run smoothly?</P>
    <P>Then we have unemployment insurance, administered through the Department of Industry and Commerce. There is, however, a scheme of workmen's compensation, which surely ought to be related to employment, but it is not administered by a State authority at all, not even by the National Health <Col N="147" /> Insurance Society, but made a sort of profit to private insurance companies here.  A workman's misfortune in the course of his employment turns out very frequently to be a profitable source of income to the insurance company which carries insurance of that kind.</P>
    <P>Then we have national health insurance, not administered by a State Department, nor by any of the existing State organisations, but administered by a kind of autonomous National Health Insurance Society.  Whilst that society is empowered to deal with applications from insured persons in respect of hospital treatment, dental treatment, optical treatment, convalescent home treatment, it is not at all empowered to deal with any of these disabilities where they affect the wife or child of the insured person.  It concerns itself solely with the insured person.</P>
    <P>So far as the society is concerned, his wife may need dentures, but she does not get them, as the scheme does not extend to provide for the health of the insured person's wife or children.  This scheme of national health insurance, which provides merely for the insured person and is unconcerned regarding his wife, whose place the Constitution says is in the home, and takes no notice whatever of the disabilities of the children, is not worthy of the description of a national health insurance scheme.  It is not &ldquo;national,&rdquo; and it is obviously not &ldquo;health,&rdquo; as no one could describe it as a comprehensive scheme.  Yet it is part of the code of social services set up in this higgledy-piggledy manner to look after the national health and it masquerades as a national health insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I do not want to say a single word of disparagement of the excellent men and women who are concerned in the administration of the society.  One has only to talk to them to realise the breadth of vision they have in respect of our social services and to realise, too, how clearly they appreciate the deficiencies in the present scheme and how passionately anxious they are that that scheme should be improved, so as to make the provision which they think is necessary <Col N="148" /> and vitally necessary for extending this scheme until it is entitled to be described as a national health insurance scheme.  My main point in making reference to the society was to call attention to the fact that that society administers in a way quite unrelated to the activities of other Departments a scheme of health services of a limited character, not for the citizens of the country but for the limited number of persons&mdash;approximately 500,000 out of 3,000,000&mdash;who are insured under the scheme.</P>
    <P>When we come to the question of children's allowances, we find that that is administered also by the Department of Industry and Commerce. One can scarcely understand how a Department so described comes to administer a scheme of children's allowances, but there you have it.  The scheme of widows' and orphans' pensions is administered by the Department of Local Government, but when you come to a scheme of children's allowances the administration is handed over to the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>What children's allowances have to do with either industry or commerce is not at all clear to me, and those who assigned the administration of the scheme to that Department might well let us into the secret which induced them to assign the administration of that particular Act to a Department which ought to be concerned with the development of industries and the promotion of commerce, rather than with a social service such as the provision of allowances for children under 16 years of age.</P>
    <P>Then we pass to the maternity services, and here all it is necessary to do is to note that it is probably the most inadequate service in Europe to-day.  Whatever it may be in the future under the new Public Health Bill, certainly in the past it has been an appallingly bad maternity service, producing deaths that might very easily have been avoided, if only we had the intelligence to apply to our administration of maternity services the up-to-date methods which enlightened countries of Europe have long since applied to them.  Is there <Col N="149" /> any wonder that such carnage goes hand in hand with maternity in this country, that this city to-day has probably the highest mortality rate for young children than any other city in Europe?  As long as you have the present inadequate maternity services, how can you have anything but the unenviable record of having the highest infantile mortality rate in Europe, which is what we have to-day? When we come to its administration, we find it is not done by a State Department.  The State looks after old age pensions&mdash;persons going out&mdash;but coming into this life you have to go to the local authority, which is concerned with maternity services.  Unfortunately, these maternity services in many cases go hand in hand with the wretched poor law system, which still operates in this country, notwithstanding the fact that we have embellished the system with a new, and, perhaps, an Irish name.</P>
    <P>Then we come to blind pensions. One would have thought the blind pensioner had every possible facility for exercising his right to claim the pittance to which he is entitled under our blind pensions legislation.  Here again we find that a simple thing such as providing some assistance for a blind pensioner is wrapped up with all the obligations associated with the administration of old age pensions.  The person has first to go to the local committee. Frequently he has to attend a hospital and have his sight tested or wait until one of the two of the nation's only travelling ophthalmic surgeons calls to see him to test his eyes.  When he is certified as having defective sight, his case goes to the local committee, which having considered his application adjudicates on his claim to a pension.  Then it goes to the Department of Local Government and Public Health and from there it has to be administered and the payments made by the Revenue Commissioners.  After all that procedure has been complied with, the blind pensioner gets his pittance of 10/- a week to help him to make his lot in this life easier and happier.  If he wants to get a supplementary amount, he has to go back to the local authority and <Col N="150" /> there, if he is lucky and if the local authority is not hopelessly immersed in the dark recesses of the past, he may get a maximum of 4/- a week, to supplement the miserable 10/- he gets from the State.</P>
    <P>One has only to dwell on these services to realise how utterly inadequate they are.  Unless we are to contemplate the continuance of a situation in which our people are to be compelled to tolerate for another generation scales of social services which are not even related to subsistence standards, something must obviously be done by the Government to introduce proposals for legislation calculated to give us a decent standard of social services here.</P>
    <P>I think what I have said is sufficient to indicate that the scales of benefit provided are utterly inadequate for the requirements of modern life.  Our medical services cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be said to be satisfactory. Anyone who has any knowledge of hospitalisation in this country knows that it is harder than ever to-day to get into a hospital, and harder to get into a city hospital than ever it was in the lifetime of anyone now living. Even when you get into some of the hospitals, the admission is through the infamous red ticket, administered by the local authority, the red ticket which, in the British days and in our days, is still a stigma of poverty for those who have to apply for it as a passport to hospital treatment.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that illness and disease were the enemies of the nation, and that, as such, the whole nation would make war on illness and disease. The nation does nothing of the kind. So far as wealthy people are concerned, their cheque books give them admission to any nursing home they want to go to, and the best medical attention that can be got.  Another class of the community can manage to pay fees in hospitals.  But there is a very large number of people, for instance, agricultural workers, who produce the food on which the nation depends; road workers, lowly-paid artisans, small farmers, and persons in that wage grouping, who are compelled to rely on the detestable red <Col N="151" /> ticket as the only means by which their physical disabilities will be attended to in our hospitals to-day.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that that concept of illness on the part of a citizen is a pagan concept of our responsibility to our citizens, and that we ought without any further delay to get away from the detestable poor law system introduced originally by the British, carried on by two Governments in this country, and still in our midst, notwithstanding our efforts to disguise it.</P>
    <P>If we are ever to get away from the taint of the poor law system in our public services, we can only do it by insisting that there must be a national scheme of hospital services.  Why should people in Merrion Square be entitled to get the best medical attention? Why should any gouty old man or dyspeptic old lady in Merrion Square, simply because he or she has a cheque book, be entitled to get the best possible medical service, whilst a poor man or woman in the alleys behind Merrion Square, possibly with six or seven children to maintain, is compelled to wait until such time as he or she can get a red ticket and hope to get a bed in a city hospital?  Surely the nation should see to it that a woman with six or seven children, or a father supporting a wife and six or seven children, should get every preference in the matter of hospital treatment.  Under our system there is nothing of the kind.  The gouty old man or the dyspeptic old lady are told: &ldquo;If you have a cheque book you will get the best attention, and the devil take the hindmost as far as the others are concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I challenge the whole constitution of our social services under which certain people can get the best medical treatment and the others the worst, if they get any at all.  If we are to eliminate the present taint of our poor law system we can only do that by demanding the introduction of a national hospital scheme under which every man, woman and child who is sick and who wants hospital treatment will be able to get it from the best medical authorities available without any means test such as is imposed through <Col N="152" /> the medium of the present system.  If we have the courage to demand the introduction of a national hospital scheme which will provide treatment without a means test for every citizen desiring it, then we shall have taken a very radical and vital step on the road towards improving health in this country.</P>
    <P>One of the characteristics of our social services is the fact that we make no provision for a variety of things and the introduction of such provision is long overdue.  We have to-day a very serious problem in the spread of tuberculosis. It is true that commendable efforts, though belatedly undertaken, are being made to deal with the ravages of that dreaded disease, but it is equally true that we have not been able, so far, to evolve a sound scheme simply because we are too mean and too lazy.  We should have some scheme whereby a breadwinner undergoing treatment in a sanatorium for tuberculosis and unable to follow his normal occupation, would be enabled, by means of State allowances, to make provision for his wife and children.  So far as the State is concerned, a man stricken with tuberculosis, who has a wife and four or five children to maintain, may go into a sanatorium and anybody may look after his wife and children.  The State does not care.  It makes no provision for the maintenance of the wife and family, unless on the basis of outdoor relief.  That is the only responsibility of the State.  It is not otherwise concerned with the sufferings of these unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>It is well known by every local authority that cheerfulness of outlook and brightness of mind are essential in order to bring back the health of tubercular persons.  How can you bring back health and vitality and vigour to a sufferer from tuberculosis if, whilst he is incarcerated in a sanatorium, he is wondering how his wife will pay the rent, the grocer, the milkman, and how to get food, clothes and boots for the children?  As long as we do not make adequate provision to help to cultivate that cheerful outlook by the payment of reasonable State allowances, while the sufferer is undergoing treatment, we are only tinkering with the problem. <Col N="153" /> Every unfortunate victim of that disease at present detained in sanatoria is only too painfully aware of what the absence of a decent means of livelihood means to him when he is fighting the ravages of tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in respect of old age pension legislation, one can hardly imagine a more unsympathetic outlook towards the aged and deserving sections of our community.  The allowance they get is approximately 10/- a week.  They may get a little more after they undergo a means test carried out by a local authority and some not very broadminded home assistance officer.  To imagine an old man or woman living in a cottage in rural Ireland on an allowance of 10/- a week is to realise how hollow are the pretentions enshrined in Article 45 of the Constitution.  No old age pensioner could possibly live on 10/- a week.  In case many of them would get the full 10/- a week, there is an inquisition into their means.  They are interrogated in a manner that shows there is very little concern for them in the winter of their lives.  Those old people in the spring and summer and autumn of their lives have given the best of their physical and intellectual powers to the nation.</P>
    <P>The whole scheme of old age pensions in this country and its administration is nothing short of a scandal.  We probably pay to old age pensioners a lower scale of pensions at a later age than in any other country in Europe, or indeed in the world.  Many other countries have found it possible to give pensions of 25/- a week to aged people and in those countries the cost of living is lower.  These pensions are given to persons of 60 and 65 years.  Our taxation has risen from approximately 21 million pounds to 52 million pounds, yet the most we have been able to give our old age pensioners is a beggarly pittance of 10/- a week. If those who want to defend scales of that kind will attempt to get their relatives to live on such inadequate incomes, they will realise how indefensible it is to continue paying such paltry allowances.</P>
    <P>There is another class in the community for which no provision is made and that is the person who is born an invalid and who remains an invalid all <Col N="154" /> his life.  In many other countries provision is made for such people.  An invalid gets sufficient to maintain himself.  Here, if a person is unlucky to be born an invalid, crippled from birth, that person goes right through life without any provision being made for him by the State to help him because of the physical disability with which he is inflicted.  Many other countries have provided persons of that kind with something which makes life something better than the unrelieved misery it would otherwise be for such unfortunate sufferers.</P>
    <P>Similarly, there should be some provision made for elderly spinsters. Many women at 50, 55 and 60 years of age find it impossible to secure employment, so keen is the industrial and commercial demand for young and vigorous people.  When people reach 50, 55 or 60 years of age they find it extremely difficult to secure employment in many of our industries, and where they have employment, they very often find that they must relinquish it at 50, 55 or 60 because of the demands of unemployment and because those who employ them find they require younger persons for the work. A number of countries have recognised the problem of providing for the middle-aged spinster and they have recognised it by providing allowances for persons so circumstanced, but in this country we have not yet even begun to talk about the problem much less to make an early approach to its solution.</P>
    <P>I notice, too, that in the legislation of some of the newer countries and some of the States which have now got enlightened Governments, an approach is being made to the question of providing a universal superannuation scheme, so that those who can no longer get employment in industry may be enabled to retire on an allowance capable of maintaining them in some degree of comfort for the remainder of their unemployed lives. Here in this country we have not even begun to think of the problem, much less consider the application of a comprehensive scheme of universal superannuation. But these are issues which concern the people of this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> Many of the tens of thousands of our people who have gone to Britain in the last five or six years and who have gone to the Six Counties will now and in the future be getting the benefit of these schemes, in so far as they are applicable to them, and many of them, when they come back here, will come back to a country in which these schemes are not operative and in which they will find very inadequate provision made for adversity as compared with that made in the country in which they were temporarily employed. If we are not to be a kind of Balkan State, with a low standard of life and living, with the kind of philosophy crystallised in the principle of the survival of the fittest, there must be an examination of the social requirements of our people, with a view to devising a scheme of social services calculated to satisfy the Christian and human demands of our people.</P>
    <P>I will concede at once, and only a fool would deny, that any scheme of social services must be financed out of production, that the standard of social services in this or any other country will be measured by the standard of production, and it is a necessary corollary of the introduction of a scheme of social services on a decent scale that we should increase our productivity to the maximum possible level.  We cannot increase our productivity to the maximum when we sit idly by while tens of thousands of our people are unemployed&mdash;able to work, willing to work and clamouring for an opportunity to get away from the detestable employment exchange, from the workhouse and from the home assistance officers, but still unable to get that opportunity to work in their own land.  Nor can we increase our productivity by giving permits to our people to work in other countries, to create wealth for these other countries, while neglecting the possibility of utilising their brains and their brawn to create wealth which would finance an extended scale of social services in this country.</P>
    <P>Any examination, therefore, of a scheme of social services and the introduction <Col N="156" /> of a scheme which will provide an adequate standard of security for our people must go hand in hand with an examination of the productivity of the country and of the possibilities of extending that productivity and utilising to the fullest every creative power possessed by our people, and particularly by our unemployed people to-day. That brings me to this point: if we are to have an adequate scheme of social services, it must go hand in hand with a scheme of full employment, because it is nothing short of criminal waste to have, in a relatively undeveloped country, men and women clamouring for the opportunity to work, and denied that opportunity to work, in their own land.</P>
    <P>This motion is reasonably phrased. It asks for an examination of the problem and the introduction of a unified and co-ordinated scheme of social security.  I commend an examination of the problem of social services in this country to the Government, and say, in conclusion, that they should do the scheme of Most Reverend Dr. Dignan the honour of examining it, because I believe it contains within it the basis of a scheme of social services which could do much to raise the standard of life of the masses of the people of this country.  If we fail to examine these proposals or fail to find some substitute proposals, we will have, during the next ten years, what we have had during the past ten years &mdash;large-scale unemployment at home, large masses of our people living below the poverty line and large sections of our people looking for the emigrant ship in preference to the economic depression and insecurity which, unfortunately, is the all-too-common lot of tens of thousands of our citizens to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone who considers reasonably and fairly our social services must admit, in the first place, that they are inadequate; in the second place, that they are degrading; and, in the third place, that a very large section of our people are debarred from benefiting by the existing social services.  Old age pensions, home assistance, the dispensary system&mdash;all the various forms of relief which have been provided&mdash;<Col N="157" /> carry with them the stigma of degradation. It is impossible to consider social services generally without reference to the statement issued by the Most Rev. Dr. Dignan and here is his comment on the dispensary system:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The dispensary is the core, the hub and the heart of the degrading poor law system.  To understand the system you have only to visit a dispensary. Most of them have no proper accommodation, no sanitary arrangements, no waiting rooms and from the medical point of view they have few conveniences or appliances to help the doctor to diagnose or to treat.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Grouped around the dispensary system you have the relieving officer, the home assistance officer&mdash;call him what you like&mdash;the man to whom the person who is in need must go and claim relief. You have the old age pension system under which an applicant must prove that he has been thriftless, that he has not accumulated any savings, that he has absolutely no means of living in order to benefit by this small and inadequate relief.  Most Reverend Dr. Dignan sought to make a complete break with the existing system of social services.  He sought to set up an independent national insurance body to which citizens would contribute and from which they would derive benefit, and, as contributors, would not have to bear the stigma associated with home assistance and the other forms of relief.  It might be said that every citizen of this country is a member of a big society, the society known as the State, and that since every citizen has contributed to that society there is no stigma associated with drawing benefit from the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must, however, consider the tradition under which we work, a tradition which has grown up and dates back to the very origin of the poor law system of relief.  Because of that it is necessary to make a complete breakaway from that system, as the Most Reverend Dr. Dignan has suggested. In a national insurance society such as he envisaged, practically every citizen of this State would be a contributor. The worker and the employer would make a contribution, and <Col N="158" /> to their contributions would be added one made by the State.  Under such a system a large section of our people who are at present debarred from any relief would benefit.  We have, for example, the smallholder, the small farmer and the small business man, but with all the various services which we have at the present time, the small owner of property finds that he is completely excluded from benefiting under them.  If a small farmer or a member of his family becomes ill he is faced with two alternatives.  He is faced with denying himself the institutional treatment which he urgently requires, or with bankruptcy&mdash;the complete loss of his farm, shop or whatever small business he possesses.  Individual cases of that kind have come to my notice.  Small farmers, when advised by their medical officer to avail of institutional treatment, have simply declined to do so, because their means did not permit, with the result that they eventually lost their lives. Surely, it should be possible to devise a system under which a smallholder, a small farmer&mdash;even a large farmer&mdash; and a small shopkeeper could make an annual or weekly contribution, and thereby derive the right to the benefit of free institutional treatment or free medical assistance.</P>
    <P>We have another evil which has grown up in this country in connection with workmen's compensation. Deputy Norton said that the workmen's compensation legislation tended only to make profits for the insurance companies.  I am doubtful about that, but I do know that it provides a very substantial income for the members of the legal profession, and, to a considerable extent, for the members of the medical profession.  I think that if the amount of the compensation paid out by the insurance companies was investigated it would be found that a substantial portion of the total goes not to the workers but to the members of the legal and medical professions.  Deputy Norton informs me that 11/- out of every £1 goes to the workers.  There you have something which urgently needs reform, something which I think should be embodied in our social services.  We should have some adequate <Col N="159" /> machinery by which the worker would obtain compensation without having to put himself into the hands of so many professional racketeers.</P>
    <P>I think this motion deserves careful consideration and attention.  I am not sure that I entirely agree with the complete wording of it, but I think that at the present time we must devise a united, co-ordinated system of social services.  We must get away from the disjointed, unorganised and unco-ordinated system that we have, and from the confusion and chaos which exist in the entire administration. At present you have practically every Department of State taking a hand in the administration of the various services&mdash;medical, unemployment relief, home assistance and the others.  These services are administered by different Departments which act independently of each other without any co-ordination or sense of unity.  In any system which we devise we should give special attention to that important section of the community represented by the small property owner, because this State, and every other State, depends for its security and for its progress on having as large a percentage as possible of its population owning property in a small way: in having property distributed over as large a number of people as possible.  The position at present is that it is the small property owner that is being crushed out and discouraged. Even where the Land Commission divides land and creates small holdings, the people who obtain the holdings frequently come to Deputies and tell them that because they have obtained these small holdings they are debarred from availing of many of the social services which they hitherto enjoyed. Consequently, they feel a sense of discouragement in their ownership of property, and often desire to go back to the condition in which they were previously.  I think that is undesirable, and that it would be well if the Taoiseach carefully considered the Most Reverend Dr. Dignan's report from beginning to end.  If he does, possibly with his knowledge and with the co-operation of his Ministers he may be able to improve upon it in certain <Col N="160" /> respects and find in it a foundation on which to build a sound social policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T.J. Murphy Mr. T.J. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to see the Taoiseach, as the Head of the Government, here for this very important discussion.  This is a matter that certainly deserves his personal attention. No matter how I may differ with him on many other questions, I think that he will probably take a sympathetic interest in this question.  Therefore one could expect that, having got to that point, he would take a personal hand in doing something effective towards bringing about a change in the present position with regard to social security in the country.</P>
      <P>It seems to me inevitable that, sooner or later&mdash;and the sooner the better&mdash;we must take a fairly strong and effective step in this connection. We cannot be unmindful of the fact that in Great Britain, during the last two or three weeks, a national insurance scheme was introduced, and will be given effect to in a short time, that will completely revolutionise the position there.  It has been stated also that in Northern Ireland a scheme at least on somewhat similar lines will be introduced in a short time.  We cannot possibly ignore action of that kind and allow the present position to continue. It would be an extraordinary position if certain people in County Derry, for instance, were benefiting under a scheme of national insurance, while, a few miles away, in our State, no such provision was made.  I do not suggest that we can hope to do anything exactly on the lines of the British scheme.  We must be realists and have regard to our resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A scheme of this kind should be introduced for a number of reasons. One particular reason is that it would be good for the dignity and morale of our people, and the feeling of contentment it would give them because they were not getting anything in the way of charity, but as a right and in return for their contributions.  I think it is all too depressing a fact that in recent years we have had an ever-increasing number of people forced to seek assistance of one kind or another.  It is deplorable if we have no other remedy <Col N="161" /> in our time than the continual reference of all problems of destitution and poverty to local government, and no other hope for our children than the prospect that many of them will start life getting free boots, provided partly by the State and the local authority, vouchers, free milk, and all those things, the necessity for which I regard as extremely regrettable.  While I appreciate that these methods have to be employed for a certain time, they should certainly be regarded as items of a situation that should be as short and as brief as possible.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Norton and Deputy Cogan, and I make a special plea in regard to the question of hospital benefit.  I live in a constituency where the small farmers are very numerous.  The average valuation of land in West Cork probably would not exceed £12.  I think the average in the county does not very largely exceed that figure.  I know the real and terrible problem that is represented by the lack of means, and thereby the lack of facilities in getting hospital treatment for many of these people.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that it is no exaggeration whatever to say that life is very often endangered, and I think I can add sometimes lost, because of the fear of the expense involved in hospital treatment.  The Cork County Council makes contributions to the voluntary hospitals in the city and there is a certain unwritten law, which is very generously observed by the authorities of the hospitals, that gives members of local government authorities on the committee of management, and others, the privilege of making recommendations in favour of the admission to the hospital of patients of the kind I have mentioned on the basis of a reduced contribution.  I should like to take this opportunity of saying how generously this is done.  The provision of hospital treatment is a tremendous difficulty for many people who are not aware of facilities of that kind and who would be reluctant to utilise facilities of that kind.  I am quite satisfied that there is a very urgent need in regard to that particular class.  I am quite satisfied also that the sooner we alter the poor law system, or dispense with as much of it as we can, in regard to the admission <Col N="162" /> of ordinary people to the hospitals, the better.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most eloquent words used by the Most Reverend Dr. Dignan in his outline of a scheme of social insurance are, that the poor law system as we know it in this country ought to be not alone blotted out from the Statute Book but from the memory of the people.  Every person of goodwill in this country will subscribe to that dictum and be glad that we have had the lead we have had in that particular matter from such a very distinguished and responsible quarter.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the whole position in regard to national health insurance ought to be revised.  I am of the opinion that a scheme of insurance providing for hospital and other benefits on the basis of subscriptions from the people and, therefore, a scheme that would embrace the bulk of the people would be to a large extent a scheme that would meet its own requirements.  I am quite satisfied that the co-ordination of the various social services should result in very considerable economies, which could be applied to the support of the scheme.  A Poor Law Inquiry Commission was set up in 1925 and, as far as I know, a number of their findings were never given effect to.  No attempt has ever been made to give effect to their findings in regard to institutions known as county homes and places of the kind. There is a real need now for a reexamination of the whole poor law system as we know it in this country and to dispense with a number of features of that service and apply the money thus saved to the support of a central and national scheme of insurance.</P>
    <P>I also subscribe very heartily to the suggestion made by Deputy Norton that there ought to be some contributory scheme in respect of retiring allowances or superannuation allowances. The position for many people who reach the age of 65 and who are no longer regularly employable and whose services, having regard to the position that a great many younger people are without employment, are not in great demand, is a very distressing one.  The bleak years from 65 to 70, when such people qualify for an old age pension, represents, to my mind, <Col N="163" /> the most cheerless period in the lives of many people who have been estimable and hard working people during all the years they were able to work.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the position in regard to tuberculosis ought to be examined in this particular light.  I do not know whether the view would be generally accepted or not but it is my opinion as a lay man, who does not claim to have any specialised knowledge of this subject, that tuberculosis in this country is largely a poverty disease. Admittedly that is not universally the case but I think that, in the main, the disease is due to poverty conditions, insufficient food of the right kind and the unhealthy surroundings that are the result of poverty.  I remember that in a former national health insurance scheme, before the amalgamated societies were formed and before the centralisation of the present scheme, there was provision for what was called sanatorium benefit.  A special type of benefit was provided for tuberculosis sufferers.  There was a special type of benefit to enable domiciliary or home treatment and support to be extended to the particular sufferer in the period after discharge from an institution.  For some reason that I have never heard fully explained that benefit was withdrawn. The benefit was operated through what were then known as county insurance committees.  The withdrawal of that benefit has been a serious injustice to many people.  A scheme on those lines would be of great assistance in the present circumstances.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a scheme of social security inaugurated, not alone from the point of view that it would promote good health in the country and foster a feeling of reasonable security and contentment as far as the future is concerned for the masses of the people but also because I believe it would be good for the dignity and self-respect of the people and would help them to get out of the rut into which the masses of our people are being driven by having to hold out their hands more frequently every <Col N="164" /> day for State charity in one form or another.</P>
    <P>The sooner we set our faces against that and provide a Christian alternative, the sooner we will get back to the foundations of self-respect and dignity from which we had departed. I earnestly urge the Taoiseach to give his personal attention to this matter as one of the most important matters requiring consideration.</P>

      <P>There were many things said in this debate which would, if time permitted, justify a rather detailed comment from me.  But I think the House will realise that time will not permit of anything of the kind.  I hope, however, that some member of the Government will have an opportunity of dealing with some of the points raised on another occasion. Deputy Norton is always pleased to have a general subject to deal with.  As a rule, he does not care to come down to detail.  On the airy heights he has much more liberty.  It is not surprising, therefore, that he should find difficulty in understanding a person whose whole training and responsibilities over a number of years have accustomed him to consider matters in detail.</P>

      <P>It is the same engineer who wants details before he can cost them.  If you want costings done, it is not enough to talk about them in airy terms or in broad outline.  You need to get down to detail.  Unless you can get down to detail you cannot give a bill of costs.  Deputy Norton always finds an occasion to attack the Minister for Local Government.  He spoke just now of tirades.  I have here a report of the proceedings on January 24th last year on which the question of Dr. Dignan's proposals was first mentioned in this House.  I see a question here by Deputy Norton and the Minister's answer.  I find no tirade in it. Deputy Norton's question was:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he will authorise an inquiry into the cost of providing the proposed social benefits set out in the memorandum sent to him by his Lordship the Most Rev. Dr. Dignan.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The answer of the Minister was:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The memorandum to which the Deputy refers is, presumably, the paper entitled &lsquo;Outlines of a Scheme of National Health Insurance&rsquo;, which was read by the Most Rev. Dr. Dignan, chairman of the National Health Insurance Society, at a meeting of the Society on 11th October, 1944, and, by order of the committee, released to the Press.  The daily newspapers carried a report of the paper on 18th October, 1944, and on the same day I received a complimentary copy of the paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had the paper examined in my Department.  The examination revealed that the paper in general did not take due cognisance of the <Col N="166" /> several very complex fundamental difficulties which the author's proposals involved, that many of these proposals were impracticable, and that accordingly no further action on the basis of the paper would be warranted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton pursued the matter and asked:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Would the Minister say whether an estimate of the cost was prepared in his Department?  Can the Minister now, as a matter of information on a subject which is exciting widespread discussion, give the House and the country any indication as to what the cost of providing those benefits would be?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he had nothing to add to the very comprehensive answer which he had given.  I see nothing in that in the way of a tirade.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy gives me any speech, I will read it.  I believe I will not find in it anything in the way of a tirade.  As I understand it, the Minister's position was a very simple one.  He, as Minister, had Parliamentary responsibility and local responsibility in connection with the National Health Insurance Society.  In view of these responsibilities, he was given, by law, the right to nominate and the responsibility for nominating the chairman, trustees, and certain members of the society.  He believed that that established between him and the chairman of the society for the time being, whoever he might be, a certain intimate relationship, and he felt that the publication of the very far-reaching proposals dealing with this service before he had time to have them properly examined did not appear to be consistent with the relationship which was intended, by law, to exist.</P>

      <P>I am sure there were other people present who will confirm that.  Now, the Minister was quite impersonally fulfilling what he regarded as his duties and responsibilities.

      <P>He did not pretend to be infallible.  He made a very simple statement.  The document was published on the same day on which he received a copy.  I have read out the Minister's reply as to the date of publication, and the sending of the complimentary copy to him.  However, he had it examined, and he gave quite objectively the result of that examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to have an opportunity to reply at length to some of the points raised in this debate.  Every one of us, naturally, would like to make life as comfortable as possible for every citizen in this land.  As far as I remember, only one Deputy&mdash;the Deputy who spoke just before I stood up&mdash;adverted to the fact that it is not a question merely of our wishes but of what it is possible to do.  If there is to be a complaint made, let it be made on the basis: &ldquo;You could do this, our resources would enable us to do this, but you are not doing it&rdquo;.  Once we get down to argue on that basis, we get somewhere.  If we are simply met by people who build up the sort of heaven <Col N="168" /> we would all like to create here on this earth and take no cognisance of the hard facts of the situation, we can get nowhere.  At any rate, we on this side of the House have to proceed with this question in the same way as the engineer who is asked to build a bridge.  Assuming we want a bridge, we must calculate whether we have the means which will enable us to build it.</P>
    <P>As the time is so short, I think, perhaps, the best thing I could do with the remainder of it would be to make a short statement, showing in general what the position is as far as the Government decisions are concerned.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Everett pointed out when moving it, this is a double-barrelled motion.  It asks for the establishment of a scheme of social security and also for the setting up of a Ministry of Social Services, under which all the existing social services would be unified and co-ordinated.  It is clear from the Deputy's speech that, in referring to the existing social services, he has in mind not only old age pensions, blind pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, national health insurance, unemployment insurance and unemployment (intermittent) insurance, unemployment assistance, food allowances, children's allowances&mdash;what may be called the income maintenance services&mdash;but also the public health and medical services, for which the Minister for Local Government and Public Health with his Parliamentary Secretary is at present responsible.</P>
    <P>I think it will help somewhat to clarify the whole matter if I deal first with the question of the health and medical services.  For a considerable time this matter has been the subject of a great deal of public attention.  Two sets of proposals have been put forward&mdash;those associated with the name of the Most Rev. Dr. Dignan, Bishop of Clonfert, and the scheme prepared by the Medical Association.  Both schemes have been exhaustively examined by the Department of Local Government and Public Health, and have been carefully considered by the Government.  The results of the consideration given to them will be found in a White Paper which will shortly be published.  On the whole, the conclusion <Col N="169" /> which the Government has arrived at is that neither scheme is at all satisfactory.  I do not propose to state now the reasons on which that conclusion is based.  These will be set out fully in the White Paper, which will also contain certain other proposals intended to form the basis for consideration of the reorganisation and extension of the existing public health and medical services.</P>
    <P>In a Parliamentary Question addressed to me on the 29th November, 1944, I was asked whether any decision had been arrived at as to the establishment of a Ministry of Health under a separate Minister.  In my reply, I pointed out that there is a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who devotes himself almost exclusively to public health and associated matters, and to whom have been delegated by an Order made by the Government certain powers, duties and functions of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health under the Public Health Acts, the Public Assistance Acts, the National Health Insurance Acts, and so on.  I referred also to the fact that many of the public health services carried out by local authorities, and supervised by the Department of Local Government and Public Health, are closely interlinked with questions of general local administration, and that it would be a matter of considerable practical difficulty to separate them completely.  I said, however, that the Government considered that the new arrangements made in 1944 should at any rate be given a full trial before any further action was contemplated.</P>
    <P>Those arrangements have now been in existence for almost two years and, on the whole, the experience which has been gained suggests that a separate Department of Public Health will have to be established at no very distant date.  It has become clear that the needs of the community demand a reorganisation and an extension of the existing medical services.  This and the administration of public health and medical services when they have been more fully developed will probably require the whole-time attention of a <Col N="170" /> member of the Government, assisted by the staff and organisation of a Department of State.  It would not, I think, be practicable to assign to such a Department, in addition, the functions and duties which relate to the administration of the income maintenance services.  In other words, I think it will be necessary to have a separate Department of Public Health.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to the income maintenance services themselves, the question of unifying and co-ordinating their administration has also for a considerable time been engaging the attention of the Government.  Deputy McGilligan, in his speech on this motion, indicated that in his view a case for unification and co-ordination could be based on the ground that money would be saved by cutting out over-lapping and waste and extra expense and that with such saving the money available would, to quote his own words, &ldquo;eventually reach in a more liberal way the beneficiaries under these schemes than it does at the moment&rdquo;.  I do not agree with the Deputy that the case could be made on this basis.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question by Deputy Norton on the 17th February, 1944, I said that as a result of an investigation which had been made in some detail the general conclusion would seem to be that the present system of administration of the social services is efficient and economical.  I pointed out that the services are already co-ordinated in the sense that each of them makes full use of any of the machinery of the other services that is suitable for its purposes and that there is no evidence of over-lapping or duplication.  I made it clear that the Government had taken no decision adverse to the setting up of a Department of social services, but that we were at that time of opinion that there was no urgent need for any closer investigation of the matter.</P>
    <P>It is now nearly two years since I made these statements.  Recently the whole matter of the administration of the income maintenance services has been closely examined by the Departments concerned and the results of their examination have been considered by the Government.  The conclusion reached is that a new Department <Col N="171" /> should be established under a separate Minister to administer these services.  This conclusion, however, is not based on the ground that any saving in expense will be effected.  In fact, the Government is satisfied that a very high degree of co-ordination already exists between the various Departments administering these services and it is quite certain that any saving in expenses which might be effected by placing all the services under the control of a single Minister would not be sufficient to provide for even the smallest increase in benefits.</P>
    <P>The real basis for the decision that a new Department should be established to administer the income maintenance services is that if future developments of social services of this character are to be envisaged and adequately planned, supervised and co-ordinated, the Government should have at its disposal the specialist advice of a Minister and a Department established for that purpose.  Such a Minister, with his Department, would be a centre of informed opinion, abreast of modern trends and capable of formulating a policy which will maintain a satisfactory balance between modern developments and our own domestic problems, needs and resources.  The task of examining the existing services, co-ordinating them and removing any anomalies that may exist would be one to which the new Minister would naturally devote his earliest attention.</P>
    <P>I would not like it to be thought, however, that in deciding on this step the Government take it as a matter of course that a considerable extension of the existing social services is practicable.  I myself and other members of the Government have frequently pointed out that social services involve expenditure, and often substantial expenditure, from the public funds raised by taxation and that the extent to which we can develop them must accordingly be related not only to the needs of the community but also to our resources; that is to say, the productivity of our industry, the amount of employment which can be provided, the state of our trade and other such factors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" /> The scope of our social services must be determined by our own domestic circumstances.  We could not, for example, accept as a principle of our policy the automatic adoption of schemes deemed suitable by other countries whose needs and resources in no way correspond with our own. Broadly, it may be said that no further considerable expansion of the social services will be possible without an appreciable expansion of our national wealth.  It is only by keeping these considerations clearly in mind that we can hope to apply effectively the principle contained in the provision of the Constitution in which the State &ldquo;pledges itself to safeguard with especial care the economic interests of the weaker sections of the community, and, where necessary, to contribute to the support of the infirm, the widow, the orphan and the aged.&rdquo;  In any future development of the social services we must take care also to avoid measures which would weaken individual initiative and responsibility, the foundation on which the social and economic welfare of the community must ultimately rest.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan also appeared to take the line that social insurance should be removed as far as possible from a Government Department.  His arguments in favour of this were, apparently, that Departmental schemes were administered harshly and unsympathetically and that the administration of a scheme of social insurance or security by a Government Department would involve undue interference with the rights of the individual and of the family.  There is no evidence, of course, that social insurance schemes would be administered more sympathetically by independent bodies than by Government Departments&mdash;that is, if these bodies had any responsibility for getting the money&mdash;and, in any case, the ordinary individual has a much more effective means of calling attention to and remedying his grievances against a scheme administered under the control of a Minister responsible to Parliament than he would have in the case of a scheme administered by a body without any responsibility to a Minister or any public authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="173" /> I have given to the House the position as it stands.  Summing up, it may be said to be this, that, having separated, to a large extent, the administration of public health from the other functions and duties of the Minister for Local Government, and having tested it out, we think that the time has come&mdash;very soon in any case&mdash; when we can establish a separate Department of Public Health with a Minister in charge.  With regard to the income maintenance services, we must also set up a Department, and the reason for setting up that Department is not in the hope that any greater amount of co-ordination between the existing services will be got, or any great economies effected, but that in view of the general movement in the world to-day, it would be desirable that the Government should have one Minister who would be constantly looking at these problems and getting the necessary information upon them, so that we would be able to get some view presented to the Government by a member of the Government who would be a specialist, and who would have special information on the whole subject.  To a certain extent that will meet the views of members of the House.  I must say for myself that I have been very slow about acceding to the demand to establish new Ministries.</P>

      <P>Most of the institutional services of the county are under the control of the public assistance authorities.  The public assistance district is not in every case coterminous with the county health district and it is not possible to set out separately the number of doctors and nurses appointed or authorised in the county health districts.  Neither is it possible for the same reasons to segregate the staff applicable to county boroughs solely.  The following statement gives the numbers employed in public assistance districts in the several counties and county boroughs.</P>

    <P>The number of beds for fever cases in these institutions has been substantially the same since 1941 except in the case of Dublin where the number increased from 148 in 1941 to 301 in 1944.  Accommodation in Cork Street Fever Hospital, Dublin or in other institutions not under the control of local authorities is not included in the return.  Additional alternative accommodation for about twice the existing number of fever beds is being provided in Wicklow at present.</P>
