      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, in connection with statements (Volume 102, number 5, columns 725-7) made in the Dáil by a Deputy, on the 11th July, 1946, imputing corrupt practices to officials of Government Departments, and alleging that they were feathering their nests, any information has since been made available by the Deputy concerned in support of his charges; and if so, whether the charges have been investigated and with what results.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative. I wrote some letters to the Deputy who made the statements referred to and I have had some replies. As the correspondence is rather lengthy I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the correspondence:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Right">&ldquo;1ú Lúnasa, 1946.</P>
      <P>A Chara,</P>
      <P>You will remember that during the adjournment debate in Dáil Éireann on the 11th July you said (Official Report, columns 725 and 726):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;There is the temptation everywhere in these matters&mdash;and I am going to say here that that temptation has crept into official circles and, furthermore, that the officials in the various Departments are feathering their nests.&rsquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1772" /> A little later you said: &lsquo;I have information which might perpetrate another crisis in this House&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>In reply to my suggestion that you should give me any information at your disposal in this regard, you referred to the question of getting &lsquo;immunity for some of the people who may speak&rsquo; and you also said (column 727):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;If the Taoiseach will give me permission to interview certain people. I will place the information at his disposal, provided I am given the opportunity of getting written statements from these people.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>I then repeated my request that you should get the statements.</P>
    <P>I should be glad to know if you are now in a position to give me the information required.  In view of the serious nature of the statements I am sure you will agree that you should make available to me any information in your possession or procurement in regard to the matter so that I may be in a position to consider what further steps should be taken.</P>

    <P>A Dhuine Uasal,</P>
    <P>I am in receipt of your letter of the 1st August.  In reply thereto I would refer you to the full Official Report of the debate on the subject matter of your letter.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the appropriate place for the discussion of the matters involved is the Dáil.</P>

    <P>An Taoiseach.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Speaking in the Dáil with all the weight of authority which should attach to your position as a Deputy and a member of the Front Bench of the principal Opposition Party, and availing yourself of the privileges <Col N="1775" /> of the House, you made statements, quoted in my letter of the 1st August, clearly and unequivocally implying that you had information showing that officials of Government Departments are guilty of corrupt practices and, to use your own words, &lsquo;are feathering their nests&rsquo;. Such allegations are of the utmost gravity not only from the point of view of the public interest and public confidence in the integrity of the Civil Service, but also from the point of view of justice to the members of the Service as individuals.  In maligning civil servants in general terms, as you did, you, in effect, maligned every individual civil servant of responsible status.  You left each such officer in the position that he could clear himself of the general imputation only by positively proving himself innocent.</P>
    <P>If you did not appreciate the full implications of your statements at the time you must surely be aware of those implications now.  You cannot but realise also that if, in fact, your statements were based on any <i>prima facie</i> evidence you are bound in the public interest and in common justice to follow them up by producing such evidence for full and impartial investigation.</P>
    <P>When you spoke in the Dáil I immediately pressed you to produce this evidence.  I have since written to you three times urging you to do your plain duty in this matter as a citizen and a public representative. Your only reply is that &lsquo;the appropriate place for the discussion of the matters involved is the Dáil&rsquo;.  I cannot believe that you do not realise the truth of the statement in my letter of the 16th August&mdash;a statement which you have not attempted to deny&mdash;that what is involved is not discussion but the investigation of alleged facts.</P>
    <P>The only reasonable inference that can be drawn from your failure to place information before me is that your allegations had no basis that would bear investigation.</P>
    <P>If, as I must now assume, you are unable to substantiate your charges or even to bring forward <i>prima facie</i><Col N="1776" /> evidence in support of them, it is your duty to withdraw them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether it is a fact that basils, or dressed sheep skins, are so extensively used in the manufacture of leather handbags that this material is not now available to the harness trade; and if he will take appropriate action to divert the limited supply of this essential material to that trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that basils or dressed sheep skins are being diverted from the harness trade to the manufacture of leather bags.  There was a general decrease in the production of leather from sheep skins in recent months, due to a shortage of pelts, but steps have been taken to regulate pelt exports to ensure adequate supplies for the production of sheep-skin leathers and it is expected that supplies of basils will improve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the serious results to industries, workers, farmers and the community generally, of the strike at the sugar beet factories, he will state what steps, if any, he has taken or proposes to take to bring about a settlement of the strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The functions formerly exercised by the Department of Industry and Commerce, in regard to conciliation in trade disputes, have been transferred to the Labour Court, following the coming into force of the Industrial Relations Act.  This Act provides adequate means for the settlement of such disputes.  Under the auspices of the Labour Court, an agreement was made between Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Teo. and the trade unions of which the sugar factory workers are members.  It is a first principle for the settlement of rates of wages and conditions of employment, by negotiated agreements, that such agreements should be honoured.  There can be no intervention on behalf of workers who strike in repudiation of agreements made by the trade unions of which <Col N="1778" /> they are members.  If this principle is accepted by the sugar-factory workers who are on strike, there is no reason why the claims of the men cannot be amicably settled, without delay, by negotiation between the company and the trade unions concerned or through the medium of the Labour Court.</P>

      <P>The late Private Cornelius Troy served in the Defence Forces from the 9th June, 1941, to the 26th December, 1945. He was, therefore, eligible for a short service gratuity of £4 10s. 0d. under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme, 1937, in respect of that period of service. A payable order for £4 10s. 0d. was issued to him on the 3rd May, 1946.  This payable order was returned by his father who stated that his son had been accidentally killed in the previous January and requested that the order be reissued in his name as next-of-kin. As there is no provision in the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme, 1937, for the payment of a gratuity to the next-of-kin in such a case, Mr. Troy's request could not be complied with.</P>
      <P>Amendments to the scheme are at present under consideration and it is proposed to make provision for the payment of gratuity in this type of case to a dependent relative.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that would be a solution of the problem.  The fact is that the reports have to be very abbreviated and have to deal mainly with decisions and official statements as being the most useful and important for the public.  If any particular matter arises, I invite Deputies to make representations to the Director as to their dissatisfaction.  Such representations have been made very occasionally to him, I may say, from different parts of the House&mdash;as much perhaps from our side as from any other.  They occur very occasionally.  I do feel that there is something lacking in the broadcasting system but it could not be treated as a news item.  What we really should have is a feature describing the work of the Dáil for the benefit of the public.

The news section of broadcasting would then be run from this House, instead of being run from the station.

      <P>In the period from 1st April, 1932, to 31st March, 1946, the Land Commission acquired 347,326 acres from 1,290 owners by obligatory <Col N="1792" /> proceedings under Section 24, Land Act, 1923.  In the same period they purchased 103,511 acres from 475 voluntary vendors pursuant to Sections 35 and 36, Land Act, 1923.  During that period also, the Land Commission resumed 50,146 acres from 426 tenants pursuant to Section 29, Land Act, 1923.</P>

It provides, according to the marginal note, for the establishment of a Department of Health.  It points out that the Government may by Order appoint a day, to be the appointed day for the purposes of this section, and then goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) On the appointed day a Department of State to be styled and known as An Roinn Sláinte or (in <Col N="1802" /> English) the Department of Health shall stand established.</P>

    <P>(4) The following enactments, that is to say, the Ministers and Secretaries Acts, 1924 to 1939, and the Act of 1925, shall apply to the Department of Health and the Minister having charge thereof as if that Department had been established by Section 1 of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>(5) For the purposes of sub-section (1) of Section 6 of the Amending Act of 1939, the Department of Health and the office of the Minister for Health shall be deemed to have been established immediately upon the passing of this Act, but any Order which is made, in relation to that Department or that Minister, under the said sub-section (1) before the appointed day, shall not be expressed to come into operation on a date earlier than the appointed day.&rdquo;</P>

I asked in a Parliamentary question to-day for information as to how the Department of Local Government and Public Health had inflated itself with personnel since 1932 and how it was proceeding at the present time.  In reply to-day, the Minister told us that, taking a certain number of sections in the Department&mdash;firstly, the Department of Local Government and Public Health, secondly, the National Health Insurance and the widows' and orphans' section and then some minor sections such as the General Register Office, Dundrum Asylum and a special section dealing with the establishment of sanatoria for tuberculosis purposes &mdash;the staff under the Department increased from 181 established and 70 unestablished persons, making a total of 251, on the 1st January, 1932 to 285 established and 105 unestablished, <Col N="1803" /> making a total of 390, by the 1st January, 1945; and that it had increased by the 1st January, 1946, to 306 established and 115 unestablished, making a total of 421.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for the establishment of a new Department of Health. We had a very full debate on that matter on the Second Stage in which the whole ground was covered categorically and in great detail by those who support this Bill.  In that connection I should like to emphasise that those who support this Bill are drawn not merely from the majority Party in the House, not merely from this Party which has a majority over all other Parties in the House, but that it is supported by the Labour Party and by the Irish National Labour Party as well, so that there is no question of steamrolling, nor is there any doubt as to what the representatives of the people who sit in this House want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been acknowledged, even by a Deputy who sits as a colleague on the Front Opposition Bench with the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;<Col N="1805" /> Deputy Mulcahy&mdash;to be vitally necessary for the preservation of the health of the people, and one might almost say for the preservation of our population. We cannot afford to carry on with an overloaded Department any longer.  It requires some clarity of vision to see that.  The decision which the Government has taken has been approved not only by the majority of this House on the Second Reading of this measure, but has received the emphatic endorsement of the medical profession and of other interests which are concerned with the health of our people.  That is the justification for the establishment of the Ministry of Health.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>They are relevant to this extent, that he expressed gratitude that the Minister might have heard from any section in the House that the setting up of a Ministry of Health arises out of the hope that people have that, by going to the expense of doing that, they may take matters affecting public health out of the catacombs of the Custom House, and remove them away from the futility and incompetence that has characterised the operations in the Custom House for so many years past.  I do not think that is a sufficiently good reason, or the only alternative that we have, for the setting up of a new and expensive Ministry, in view of the fact that not so long ago we were told there was sufficient competence and sufficient staff to deal with these matters without exciting any fears in the minds of the people for the safety of their health.</P>

I suggest that if anything may be discussed on this stage, even within the strict limits laid down, it is how this machinery of a Ministry of Health will <Col N="1808" /> affect the administrative machinery throughout the country&mdash;how it will react on the work of the local bodies. I suggest we should have some statement in that regard.</P>

      <P>The position we are in with regard to this section is exactly the same position that we were in in regard to the last section.  We are not going to be told to what extent this new Ministry will be removed from the area of the Custom House. We are not going to be told in what way the machinery of the new Ministry will dovetail in with the local machinery and the local services.  In particular we are not going to be told any of the reasons at the back of the Taoiseach's mind when he stated that he was going to set up this Ministry, not for the purpose of giving better service and not for the purpose of making any economies in the existing administrative machine but for the purpose of having these matters brought under the control of a Minister expert in such matters.  Evidently we are going to be told just as little about it here to-day.  I think the Minister might, therefore, get his voting machinery into operation once more in order not to waste Parliamentary time. There are a number of Private Members' motions which must be discussed before we rise for Christmas. We wasted sufficient time on certain matters at Easter without wasting time unnecessarily here again before Christmas.</P>

      <P>This Bill is in standard form and its purpose is to confirm an Order made by the Government under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1932&mdash; Order 129&mdash;which imposed duties of customs on wireless telegraphy apparatus and component parts thereof. The House is probably familiar in a general way with the history of the duty on wireless apparatus and component parts.  In 1926 that duty was imposed for the first time.  The duty then imposed was a flat rate duty of 33? per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> on wireless apparatus and component parts of wireless apparatus and was intended for the sole purpose of raising revenue, which was regarded as required at that time to finance the establishment and the operation of the broadcasting station. In fact, a couple of years later the revenue from the duty was diverted to the general fund of the Exchequer and since then there has been no segregation of the proceeds of the duty or no specific allocation of it to wireless broadcasting purposes.  The duty had no protective effect.  Subsequently, the duty was altered so as to encourage the assembling of wireless sets here. In effect, the full rate of duty upon assembled sets and upon certain assembled components of sets was increased to 50 per cent., while the duty upon the parts of sets was reduced to 25 per cent.  That alteration in the duties was intended, as I have said, to encourage the assembling of wireless sets here, while at the same time yielding a revenue for the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>When did that take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That took place in 1932 <Col N="1814" /> and various changes in the duty were effected by different Finance Acts up to 1937.  The purpose of the change effected by this Order is to consolidate the protective effects of the duties and to eliminate the revenue-raising aspect of them entirely.  The duty upon components of sets, such as wireless valves, which are not made here and are not likely to be made here in the near future, has been removed and the duty upon assembled sets has been reinforced by a specific duty irrespective of the value of the set or component imported and supplementary to the <i>ad valorem</i> duty.  The reason why it is necessary to have a specific duty in addition to the <i>ad valorem</i> duty is that the practice of the trade before the war was to give very substantial discounts to traders so that the declared value of the set for customs purposes was very much below the price at which the set was sold to the purchaser.  That position permitted importers to pay the duty upon the low declared value and still make a substantial profit on the sale of the set at the price fixed by the manufacturer.</P>
      <P>In fact, the protective duty in operation before the war did not succeed in securing the assembly or partial manufacture of sets here to the extent that was hoped.  In the immediate pre-war period, only 25 per cent. of the total number of sets purchased in a year were of Irish assembly and manufacture, the balance being imported. Experience during the war, however, showed that it was possible to contemplate the manufacture here of components of sets which were previously imported and used in the assembly of sets here and the new range of duties is intended to give maximum encouragement to that development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The duty came into operation some time ago and since then there has been substantial development in the industry. One firm has established a new factory of substantial size and two other firms have come into production. Employment in these firms has increased during the past year from roughly 100 to about 350 at present. There are some 20 different makes of sets being produced.  I understand that three other firms are about to come into the industry.  The process <Col N="1815" /> of assembly has been considerably extended and a number of parts, including loud-speakers, are now being manufactured here.  It is hoped that the expansion of the industry which is going on at present will continue. Roughly, the pre-war demand was about 40,000 sets per annum.  It is assumed that when supplies become available the post-war demand will be somewhat larger, particularly with the development of the rural electrification scheme.  The present production of the factories operating here is at the rate of 25,000 per annum.  That rate of production can be considerably improved upon when supplies of materials become available in greater volume.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At that rate.  The firm which was first to resume manufacture after the emergency and which is now in the business to the largest extent is selling sets here at the same price as they are sold in Great Britain, exclusive of purchase tax.  I am referring now to sets of the same design produced by an associate firm in Great Britain.  The other two firms, which are only getting into their stride, are at present selling slightly above the British price but expect to sell at the British price when the full production stage has been reached.  Because of the incidence of the purchase tax in Great Britain, the selling price here is actually lower than in that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industry is obviously a desirable one to encourage.  It is one that has considerable potentialities and requires an amount of skill on the part of the operatives and it has been demonstrated that it can be successfully operated here on an entirely economic basis.  I think, therefore, that the Dáil will generally approve of the principle of giving reasonable protection to this industry and will certainly approve of the change in the duties which were effected by this <Col N="1816" /> Order, the primary purpose of which, as I have said, is to eliminate the revenue-raising aspect of these duties so as to make it possible to produce wireless sets here more economically than previously.</P>

      <P>We would be all anxious to see the radio manufacturing industry established here but I am entirely opposed to this Order as a means of doing it.  If we are going to establish the radio industry here in a secure way I do not think we should discuss it with bated breath.  I think we should know what firms are really established here, what firms are considering engaging in the industry, what the general effect will be on the type of services available here in the line of radio receivers and the type of employment that will be given.  This Order is rather a different thing.  The Minister has indicated that the purpose of the Order is to protect a developing industry here and to eliminate revenue-raising. I think the Minister will find it very hard to convince us that he is going to eliminate revenue-raising, apart altogether from the industry, by the way in which he handled the Order after it was issued on the 17th May. There are at present, I suppose, 100,000 or 110,000 licence holders in this country.  The great majority of the sets are seven or eight years old and as a result of this Order any repairs that will have to be carried out to them, will be carried out at an enormously increased cost because every bit of material required for the maintenance or repair of these sets is going to be subject to the duties the Minister speaks about here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place, the Minister has inflicted a very serious injustice on a number of people who, after correspondence with his Department and the Department of Finance, very early this year, or perhaps in the end of last year, made arrangements to import certain <Col N="1817" /> items required for the assembly or maintenance of these sets and of wireless telegraphy apparatus generally. With the difficulty of getting supplies and getting them shipped, even though dealing with the Minister's Department, the Department of Finance and Irish Shipping, we had the astounding case of the Minister's refusal to waive this customs duty on a substantial import of condensers that was arranged by a Cork firm and which arrived 24 hours after the Order had been issued. That was one notorious case that was discussed here but there were other cases throughout the country of the same type of injustice.  That was an injustice to the firms themselves but the firms themselves will get their own back in time by raising the charges to the general public.</P>
    <P>The general public, in the circumstances of this Order, find themselves in the position that any repairs that have to be carried out to their present apparatus will have to be done at an enormous cost.  Taking some of the provisions of this Order No. 226, we find that in the case of a transformer with a core wholly or partly of metal, the average cost will be about ¼, but there will be a duty of 7/6 on it.  Again, a wire wound resistance, the average cost of which would be 8d. or 9d., will have to carry a duty of 3/-, and a small resistance, classified as a coil, which costs about 2½d., will have a duty of 3/-.  There you have duties ranging from something over 500 per cent. to over 1,400 per cent. The Minister has indicated that he allowed certain people to import these parts, but I understand only for the purpose of making up new sets.</P>
    <P>I had a number of questions drafted to be put down after the Second Reading, but I understand the Minister will be looking for the Committee Stage of the Bill to-morrow and there will not be an opportunity of putting the questions. By the time we discuss these matters to-morrow in Committee the Minister might have information in regard to some of these things.  I wanted to ask the Minister for Finance who, under Section 6 of this Order, can, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, authorise the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1818" /> to issue a licence to particular persons for the import of these parts without the payment of duty, if he will state the names and addresses of the particular persons to whom a licence was issued by the Revenue Commissioners to import free of duty the articles referred to in Section 4 of the Emergency Imposition Order No. 226, from the 18th May, 1946, up to the last date for which information was available, if he will state in respect of the articles referred to under paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of the section, the number and value of the articles for which a licence was issued to each particular person.  I wanted to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce himself if he will state in respect to the articles referred to in each of the paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (f) the number and value imported from the 18th May up to the last date for which information was available and for which the duty set out in the Order was paid, the amount of such duty and the number of such articles imported without duty under Section 6 of the Order.</P>
    <P>I think it is a most undesirable practice dealing with the setting up of an industry here which it is considered worth while to establish, that we are not given information as to what company is setting up this industry and what company is getting the facilities that are provided for under the Order. I think it is an undesirable and a shady way of doing things.  I think when a Bill like this is put before the House, nearly six months after the issue of the Order, we should be given full information as to where, how and through what particular bodies this industry, if it is worth establishing at all and worth giving these facilities to, is being established.  I think that there should be no withholding of information as to who they are.  There should be no withholding of information as to who are getting facilities for the import of these articles, facilities which are being denied to other people.  It is imperative that we should develop and extend our manufacturing arm in this country but it is also imperative that it should be done in such a way that we should all know the circumstances surrounding it.  It is <Col N="1819" /> equally imperative that, in arranging to develop an industry of this particular kind, we should not do it in such a way as to penalise over a long period people who have already got machinery of one kind or another. Owing to the way this Order has been framed and is being worked, the people who already have wireless sets which are not of the standardised type which will be made here&mdash;and there are large numbers of such people&mdash;will be penalised year after year in the cost of their repairs.  Table No. 1 of the Order refers to &ldquo;a cabinet or other light container for wireless telegraphy purposes&rdquo;. The duty is 21/-.  Many people have wireless sets with cabinets of bakelite or other composition.  If any of those cabinets happen to get damaged the owner will have to pay 21/- straight away for an article which ought to cost only quarter of that sum. The Minister is saddling a section of the people with very high and unnecessary charges for the maintenance of apparatus of which they are already possessed.  The Minister speaks of the 25,000 sets that are being manufactured yearly at present.  No doubt, certain standard types of limited range will be made here and will be good enough for the general use of our people, but they will be very restricted in relation to the types at present in use, which will have to be maintained for many years.</P>
    <P>There is then the matter of which I previously complained&mdash;the shocking injustice that took place, on the imposition of those duties, in respect of people who were carrying on their business in a progressive, enterprising way and had stuff on order which was &ldquo;caught&rdquo; by this Order.  If the Order was issued for the purpose of aiding and setting up of an industry here, surely stuff that was on the seas at the time should have been dealt with under some scale which would have meant that they would not have to pay a greater duty than they would if it had been landed 24 hours before the issue of the Order rather than 24 hours after its issue.  For these reasons, I am against this Order.</P>

      <P>I have no objection <Col N="1820" /> whatever to giving the Deputy information as to the firms which are receiving the advantage of duty-free importation of component parts.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the licensing provision was inserted so as to provide for the admission of specified component parts free of duty to firms engaged in the manufacture or assembling of wireless sets in this country to the degree approved from time to time.  As in the case of motor cars, an approved degree of assembly has been notified to the firms interested in the trade and those who manufacture or assemble in that degree are entitled to the privilege of receiving the components, which are for the time being imported, free of duty&mdash;and only such firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>And only for manufacturing purposes, not for repairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal subsequently with the question of repairs. The firms at present entitled to import components free of duty are Pye (Ireland) Limited, which has a factory in Dundrum area, Electrical and Musical Instruments, Limited, which has a factory in Waterford, and Brownlee Brothers, who are in the Dublin area. These are the three firms which are producing wireless sets at the moment. I mentioned that other firms were contemplating coming into the industry but I do not think that their names should be mentioned until they secure some advantage under the law&mdash;either the advantage of protection or the advantage of duty-free importation of component parts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Deputy misunderstands the position concerning parts for the repair and servicing trade.  I mentioned, in introducing the Bill, that the original duty on wireless sets and component parts was imposed solely for revenue purposes.  When <Col N="1821" /> the broadcasting station was established, it was decided to finance its activities partially by a duty on wireless sets and parts of wireless sets. For some years after the duty was imposed, the revenue from the duty was earmarked for the wireless broadcasting service.  That practice ceased in 1929 and, from that year onwards, the revenue from the duty on wireless sets went into the Exchequer account and was used for general Exchequer purposes.  When, subsequently, it was decided to encourage the assembling of sets here, we modified the duty so as to give an advantage to firms which assembled sets here, but the Minister for Finance was unwilling to sacrifice the revenue which he had been enjoying from that revenue-raising duty imposed in 1926.  Consequently, the new duty was a two-tier arrangement. A full-scale duty of 50 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> was imposed on completely assembled parts and the duty of 25 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> was retained on unassembled parts of sets, so that, at all times since 1926, the repair and service trades have been obliged to pay duty upon the imported components required by them.  The position is, to some extent, being eased for those trades by this duty, because, in respect of certain components of sets, which, we are satisfied, it is not practicable to make here, that revenue duty is being removed.  The most important of the parts affected by the change are wireless valves.  Since 1926, wireless valves have had to pay an import duty.  They will now be free of duty.</P>
    <P>The position of the repair and service trades in the future will be that they will be expected to draw from the factories operating here, which are now manufacturing parts of wireless sets, the supplies of components required by them to the extent that those firms can meet their requirements. Admittedly, there will be some people who will still desire to obtain wireless sets of a design or make not produced here.  They will have to pay duty on those sets and duty on the replacement parts of them but there will be a wide range of sets at different prices and of different performance available for <Col N="1822" /> purchase.  The three firms I mentioned are at present producing 20 different varieties of sets.  With the advent of new firms into the business, the number of varieties will be further increased.</P>
    <P>The most notable change which has taken place in this industry is that the attempts of the firms engaged in it during the war to carry on by devising methods of production in circumstances in which a supply of component parts from outside was stopped have shown that the complete manufacture of various components is practicable, and is, in fact, now being undertaken here. That is an important development, first, because it increases considerably the number of people who will find employment in the industry, and, secondly, because it raises the status of the labour employed in the industry.  A greater degree of skill will be required for these manufacturing operations than was needed for the assembling operations carried on previously.  I do not know what the prospects would be of obtaining supplies of radio sets from abroad at present, but I do not think they would be very strong.  At any rate, the supply would be limited and probably erratic.</P>
    <P>If we can, as is being demonstrated now, produce wireless sets here under this system as cheaply as they are being produced abroad and sell them at the same price or lower prices as compared with the prices at which they are sold abroad, we must regard the industry as deserving of encouragement.  That is the position.  The increase in employment in the industry since operations were commenced following the revision of the duty has been quite remarkable. I have mentioned that when operations were resumed after the war 100 people were employed.  That number has now increased to approximately 350, and is still increasing, because only one of these firms I mention has as yet got into full-scale production.  The others are only now stepping up their production to the point at which they will manufacture on a completely economic basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be all right now in relation to the industries which are developing, but, in the <Col N="1823" /> meantime, these duties are hitting a lot of other people and putting people out of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No; they are certainly not doing that, because people who have wireless sets for which parts have to be imported are being required to pay duties on these parts on which they have always had to pay duty. They were never free of duty since 1926, and, whatever their chances are of getting components at present, I think they are just as likely to get a full supply at an early date from these factories operating here as from factories elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>But to-day the duties are substantially increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  The Deputy raised the case of a firm in Cork which was caught with some component parts in transit when the duty went on.  I explained the principles which applied in that case to the Deputy at the time. In a matter of this kind, the axe must fall some time.  If duties have to be paid by people importing certain classes of goods, obviously, as from some date which is known to the public, the duties must be paid by everybody.  If you start to make exceptions to meet the firm which had goods on order or goods in transit on that date, you are giving them an advantage over other firms which, in the normal course of business, would be importing these goods and might have them on sale here in competition with the goods imported by these other firms.  If, in one case, the duty is paid and, in the other, not paid, the firm which got exemption would have an advantage, an advantage which I think would redound to their own revenues rather than to the benefit of their customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be better to announce a date on which the duties would be imposed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be possible to do that in present circumstances, with international trade in the sluggish condition in which it is, but everybody knows that in the past if we were to announce in advance the date on which a duty would come into operation, <Col N="1824" /> everybody would be rushing to get in goods prior to that date, and some would succeed and some would not. For that reason, the Government has been given and always had power to impose duties by resolution of the Dáil or by Order, and to make them effective as from the date of the resolution or Order, subject only to subsequent confirmation by legislation, as we are doing in this case.  No doubt, there is more likelihood of abnormal conditions prevailing in the trade at present, because not merely are supplies scarce but there are some firms selling some makes of sets who cannot get supplies at all and other firms supplying other kinds of sets who can get supplies fairly freely.  That, however, is the outcome of chance and nothing very much can be done about it.</P>
      <P>I will put the proposition to the Dáil in this way: if we are to have protective duties on wireless sets at all, if we are to encourage the development of this industry, the changes made by the Order we are now asking the Dáil to confirm are desirable.  The system of protection which that Order provides for is a better system than the system we had previously.  The previous system involved, of necessity, that the cost of sets produced here would be higher than the cost of similar sets produced elsewhere, because on every part which had to be imported, a duty was paid, a duty which was collected by the Exchequer for revenue purposes. The revenue aspects of the duties have now been eliminated, and if we succeed in the effort to ensure that all the wireless sets used here are manufactured and assembled here to the extent we consider practicable, no revenue will accrue to the Exchequer, and if that manufacture is on an economic basis, the sets will be much cheaper than they would have been under the old system, and certainly as cheap as they are available in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that there is no reason whatever why any of these firms manufacturing sets which are of a type which is sold elsewhere as well should not, once they get to the stage of full production, be able to sell these sets here at the same price as <Col N="1825" /> that at which they are being sold elsewhere.  I have stated that in one case, where full production has already been realised, that has been achieved. In the other cases where full production has not yet been realised, the firms are confident of their ability to do it when full production has been achieved.  In any event, with these three firms in the industry producing 20 different varieties and new firms coming in to make other varieties of sets, there should be ample competition, which is by far the most effective way of ensuring economic production and reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>The firms in the business are not yet in a position to supply the full requirements of the repair and servicing trade.  It will be some time yet before they will be able to do it, but it is part of their programme to step up their production of these component parts so as to meet not merely the needs of their own production but also the full demands of the repair and servicing trade.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be set up with power to send for persons, papers and records to inquire into and report on the work of the Land Commission in regard to the following matters:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  the method of selection of allottees;</P>

    <P>(3)  the size and nature of the minimum holding which, as a result of experience, can be regarded as economic; and</P>
    <P>(4)  the extent to which allottees have failed to make good and the reasons for such failure.&mdash;(Deputies Hughes and Coogan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with this motion under the four heads set out therein, the first being the method of selection of allottees.  Deputy Hughes, in moving the motion, has already dealt fully with the Minister's statement on the Second Reading of the recent Land Bill, and I do not want to reiterate what he said on that occasion.  To my mind, the Minister's statement was an indictment of the policy of his Department over a period of years.  I assume from what he said on that occasion, from the facts which he gave us and from the powers which he has taken unto himself in that <Col N="1829" /> measure, that he has now abandoned the policy which he had announced in 1943.  The present Minister for Lands, at a Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis, stated that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The fruits of Government policy should go, other things being equal, to Government supporters.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My quotation is from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of September 29th, 1943. On another occasion in this House&mdash; on the 7th April, 1943&mdash;an extract was read from a letter signed by the present Minister in which this statement occurs:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;From the list certified as competent I was bound to appoint the person best suited to the position from a political point of view.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister was, of course, then speaking in another capacity, and not as Minister for Lands, but I take it that the recent measure, and particularly the Minister's speech on the Second Reading of it, indicates that in future allottees will be selected not because of their being Government supporters, not because of their holding a particular political point of view, but rather on the grounds of their capacity to work land, of their experience and training in farming operations, and generally speaking, on the grounds of their financial capacity to provide the necessary equipment by way of machinery efficiently to work the land.  Therefore, I do not propose to delay the House on that aspect of the matter, or to go back on certain aspects of the present administration in the allotment of land.  I assume that we have seen the end of that type of administration, and that in future the allotment of land will be based strictly on impersonal and impartial grounds, and, as I have indicated, on the capacity of the individual who is seeking land for allotment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second head of the motion&mdash;the standard of living attained by those to whom allotments have been granted&mdash; raises a rather big field of inquiry, and it is difficult, in the absence of figures, to indicate present-day conditions on the land.  We do know that a big <Col N="1830" /> number of people who got land failed to work it themselves and sublet it. For that reason, it is rather difficult to advance to the Minister any arguments by way of statistics which would strengthen the demand for this particular sub-head.  On this side of the House, we feel that it is essential that a public investigation be made on the standards of living on the land from the point of view of ascertaining whether our present system of holding and working land is best in the interests of the nation as a whole.  I know there will be many viewpoints on what I have to say, but I feel that the principle of sub-dividing land into very small holdings has already gone too far, and that we have to approach this problem on a broad national basis.  It is questionable whether it is a wise policy to give a small parcel of land to a man, particularly a man with a family who cannot hope to raise a family solely out of the land.  It is also questionable whether it is wise to put landless men on the land who have no hope of gaining an economic livelihood from the land.  That particular aspect of the problem raises the question of whether or not land should be given to people who have at present an alternative means of livelihood and do not intend to take land and work it as a whole-time occupation.  For that reason, we feel that that aspect of the land problem is one worthy of very serious consideration, and one which would properly form the subject of such an inquiry as is envisaged by this motion.</P>
    <P>On the next heading&mdash;the size and nature of the minimum holding which, as a result of experience, can be regarded as economic&mdash;that is to a certain extent tied up with sub-head 2 of the motion.  According to the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> for 1945, we have something like 383,735 holdings in the country.  Of that number, 241,809 holdings are of less than 15 acres.  I question very seriously whether any man with a family can hope to make a living out of a holding under 15 acres in existing conditions.  In addition, you have 89,311 holdings between 15 and 30 acres and 62,786 between 30 and 50 acres.  When we get to the larger holdings, the figures begin to dwindle. Of holdings between 50 and 100 acres, <Col N="1831" /> there are 50,594, and of holdings between 100 and 200 acres, there are 21,316.  Over the 200 acreage there are 7,230 holdings.</P>
    <P>We hear in this House from time to time persistent and, if you like, importunate demands for the further division of land.  It seems to me extraordinary that after 25 years of native administration, and after something like 70 odd years of native and foreign administration, we are still confronted with a land problem.  One would have thought that the area of land in this country is so circumscribed in relation to the number of uneconomic holders or landless men seeking land, that we had already disposed of this problem in so far as the State could dispose of it. I think every member of the House will agree that it is a physical impossibility to allot land to every uneconomic holder or to every landless man.  We simply have not enough land to go around them all.</P>
    <P>On that point, I would like to quote from the Report of the Banking Commission of 1938, page 313, paragraph 506, in which this question was discussed. It states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The area of available land sets a limit to what is possible in this direction, and a point must be reached when further intensification of efforts to procure land for division will be possible only at the cost of inflicting injuries on the agricultural system generally which, in the light of the interests of the country as a whole, would more than offset any beneficial results.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, in paragraph 507, Mr. Deegan, who gave evidence before the commission, is quoted as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is now comparatively little land left outside the purview of the Land Commission, but large holdings previously vested in tenant purchasers under the Land Purchase Acts can be acquired for division.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, of course, obtained since the Land Act of 1936 and it is questionable &mdash;it was seriously questioned by the Banking Commission &mdash; whether the Minister would be well advised in seeking to acquire land which is already vested in tenant purchasers.  The view taken by the Banking Commission was <Col N="1832" /> that pursuance of a policy of that kind was likely adversely to affect the credit of the farmer and also to have a depreciating effect upon the value of land. There can hardly be any doubt in the minds of Deputies who have given any thought to the matter that, if a persistent policy of acquiring land already purchased and handed over to tenants were to be pursued, the effect throughout the country would be very serious indeed.</P>
    <P>I do not presume to have any expert knowledge of what is or is not an economic holding; I leave that to the agriculturist who has experience of these matters.  I do say that in present circumstances no holding should be regarded as economic which is not sufficient to enable the proprietor not only to pay an economic rent for the land, but to make a sufficient livelihood that will enable him to rear his family in decent comfort.  If we take it from that angle it should be apparent that anything under 15 acres of average good land would be insufficient for that purpose.  On that point again I would like to quote the Banking Commission Report, paragraph 508:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the first place, the size of a farm is a factor which in itself may affect the character of agricultural output.  If the division of large holdings is carried so far that a high proportion of the total agricultural area is eventually composed of small holdings, it is possible that such a result might profoundly affect the agricultural output of the country as a whole.  This is particularly true as far as the live-stock industry is concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, further down in the paragraph, they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether farming is best conducted in large or small units is a question that does not appear to admit of a simple answer on one side or the other, and the balance of advantage may vary according to times and circumstances.  Variety in the size of the unit may itself provide a form of insurance for the country as a whole should it happen, for example, at any time that market conditions are less favourable to the typical output of one size of farm than to that of another.  Especially <Col N="1833" /> in the matter of efficiency, to which we have referred elsewhere, the large holdings may present important advantages, and it would be taking a grave risk, by enforcing legislation of too rigid a character, to deprive the Free State of the possibility of reaping these advantages.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To my mind, when we view market conditions elsewhere and when we view the agricultural developments that are taking place elsewhere it seems to me that we shall have to revise our whole policy, particularly in relation to foreign markets.  In the foreign market we are, if you like, confronted with collective production and with the large-scale production which obtains in the United States and Canada.  Sooner or later the question we shall have to face in this country is whether or not under our present system of land tenure we can hope to compete with the large-scale production elsewhere whether it is based on private proprietorship or on the principle of collective farming.</P>
    <P>Again, on the question of compulsory acquisition, the Banking Commission said in their report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A feature of the compulsory powers which is open to special objection is that they can be exercised even in relation to land which has already passed under the Land Purchase Acts and, as already indicated, these powers seem likely, as matters stand, to be invoked more extensively in the future for this purpose.  If the work accomplished under earlier Land Acts were to be liable to be reopened indefinitely under later Acts, possibly in reflection of different views of successive Governments, there would be no finality to land purchase.  Moreover, the sense of insecurity must be much greater if the Land Commission is given liberty to undo arrangements which have been carried through by the State itself in comparatively recent times.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I mention this point particularly because I feel, having listened to certain demands made for the further <Col N="1834" /> acquisition and division of land, that we are rapidly approaching a point at which the Minister and this House will have to decide when there is to be finality to land purchase.  I think that the Deputies who raise this question from time to time, whilst they may undoubtedly have a very good case from the purely local point of view, they have not fully considered all the implications of their policy if that policy were to be envisaged as a national policy.  Whilst undoubtedly&mdash; particularly in the west&mdash;there is grave concern in the congested areas the question for us and for the Minister to decide is, when we must finish the job. As I have already said, it is not possible to give more land to all the men on the land in the congested areas and it is certainly not possible to give land to all the landless men who are seeking land.  We are circumscribed in our activities in relation to the amount of land which we have got to give and by reason of the fact that there are more people looking for land than there is land available for them. Sooner or later a decision must be reached on the question of finality to land division.  Having made our decision we can then decide the bigger issue as to our agricultural policy.  For that reason I think this motion is deserving of support in this House in order that all the facts of the whole economic problem of land division may be fully investigated and a final decision made.</P>
    <P>On the question of the extent to which allottees have failed to make good and the reason for such failure, I do not propose to go into that matter now.  That question is tied up with sub-head No. 1 of the motion.  The Minister has already indicated to this House the measure of the failure of allottees in this matter.  On the Second Reading of the last Land Bill he gave us a full and frank statement of the position obtaining on the land. He has given us the number of failures of allottees working the land.  He has given us the number of failures of allottees to reside in the houses provided for them on the land, and he has given us the number of cases in which the land was sublet.  In that connection all I have to say is that we on this <Col N="1835" /> side of the House hope that the Minister will exercise the powers that he has got under the last measure to ensure that the conditions obtaining before that measure was introduced will be put right in the future and that whatever defects have been discovered in the administration of the land policy in the past will be remedied in the future.</P>
    <P>I think the motion before the House is a reasonable one.  I think it is deserving of the serious consideration of the House.  I think that the Minister should try to find a way of meeting us on this acute problem because it is one that reflects our whole agricultural economy.  I think the time is now opportune for such investigations to be made so that we may, once and for all, decide what is to be our eventual land and agricultural policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a motion which, I think, is very inopportune.  I have not had an opportunity of hearing the mover of the motion, though I did hear a little of what he had to say when the matter first came before the House.  We have not been told what benefits we are going to derive from such a commission if it is set up. We have not been told what advantages are likely to accrue so far as the division of land is concerned.  Do we not know the method of selection of allottees?  Have we not reasonable knowledge of the size of the minimum holding?  In introducing the 1946 Act, the Minister told us the number of allottees who have failed to make good. I could understand the Fine Gael Party tabling a motion of censure on the Minister, but I cannot understand them tabling a motion of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mover of the motion is well aware that the activities of the Land Commission have been almost nil for the past six years.  We were told that that was due to the war in Europe, that there was a shortage of engineers and the necessary staff required for the allocation, acquisition and division of land.  Of course, that explanation would only be accepted by the Minister's own Party.  It certainly is not accepted by the Clann na Talmhan Party.  We maintain that the war <Col N="1836" /> should not have affected in any way the allocation of land in the hands of the Land Commission in many areas. There are many areas where, if the land had been divided, there would be no necessity for the erection of houses, because the houses already existed. But the Minister or his Department did not do that.</P>
    <P>Are the Fine Gael Party not aware that the activities of the Land Commission are practically nil?  Why then put down a motion asking for a report on the work of the Land Commission? After listening to Deputies on these benches for the last four years calling on the Minister to proceed with land division and addressing question after question&mdash;sometimes as many as a dozen on the one day&mdash;in relation to land division, they should know that nothing whatever was being done by the Land Commission.  There was therefore no need to ask about the activities of the Land Commission. They should see that there was no activity whatever on the part of that Department which costs a considerable sum to the taxpayer without any return for it.  I could understand asking for a report on the cost of that Department; asking upon what the money was spent, and why it was spent on a redundant and obsolete Department.</P>
    <P>As to the method of selection of allottees, we know what that method is.  The Minister admitted when introducing the 1946 Act that a considerable percentage out of the number selected had failed to husband their land properly, had failed to make the holdings pay, had sublet them and gone to work on the roads and the bogs, or had closed their doors and emigrated to England.  The fact that the Minister admitted that showed that the selection of these allottees was not done in a proper way.  They did not take into consideration whether the men selected were the proper type of men, whether they were capable of farming a holding, whether they were deserving of a holding, but what their politics were.  That was the one qualification necessary. That is why these men failed to utilise the land properly which was given to them at the expense of the taxpayers. That is why they closed the doors and went away or let their holdings in conacre. The selection of allottees is a very <Col N="1837" /> simple matter if politics are left out. It is not so simple if politics enter into it.</P>
    <P>The next matter that the tribunal is to report on is: &ldquo;The standard of living attained by those to whom allotments have been granted.&rdquo;  If I got a holding of 20 or 30 acres, I would not like to have officials coming around making inquiries as to how I was getting on or how I was making ends meet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Then you must bring these people before the tribunal.  If I got 20 acres of land in Kilcock or Gibbstown, do you think I would tolerate the idea of being brought before a tribunal to say how I was making ends meet, the profits I had made out of my holding, or the money I had in the Post Office or in the bank?  It would be ridiculous.  The next matter refered to in the motion is: &ldquo;The size and nature of the minimum holding which, as a result of experience, can be regarded as economic&rdquo;.  That is the only sensible part of the motion.  That is one thing that demands careful consideration in the future and which, I think, has not been examined sufficiently in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the holdings allotted to migrants from Mayo, Donegal, Galway, Roscommon, Kerry, West Cork, Clare, Leitrim, Louth, and other counties where you have congestion are not economic.  In my opinion, anything less than 40 acres of arable land cannot be described as an economic holding.  The Minister may well say that if we were to adopt Deputy Cafferky's suggestion, and give 40 acres to every man, even those that Deputy Cafferky is desirous of migrating from Mayo, we would not have sufficient land.  I believe that at this stage of land division, you could place thousands of young men on the land because there are thousands of <Col N="1838" /> acres of land which could be acquired. There are farmers who have land far in excess of what they can work.  There are large estates, a certain amount of which could be acquired for division. The argument put forward by the Minister time and again is that there is not enough land.  Deputy Coogan said that sooner or later land division would have to stop, that we were almost at an end of land division.  Does Deputy Coogan mean that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">

      <P>I certainly do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that Deputy Coogan, from the position he held some years ago, travelled a good deal of Ireland and knows the country.  I maintain that there are thousands of acres for division and thousands of tenants who could be put on the land, in an economic way, and given 40 acres.  If Deputy Coogan believes that one man is entitled to as much as 5,000 or 3,000 or 2,000 or 500 acres then the Constitution is a bottle of smoke.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe in free sale but if there are farms of 2,000 acres or 500 acres put up for sale on the public market let the Land Commission purchase them.  Is not that what the Land Commission is there for?  In particular, if it is for sale in a congested area, if that holding has been untenanted for a considerable time, if it has been worked by the tenants for 40 or 50 years, and if it is put up for sale by the owner, who may be living in West India or in England, does Deputy Coogan suggest that I am opposed to free sale because I ask the Minister to acquire it for the tenants at the market value?  Is that something that is opposed to free sale?  May I not acknowledge the right of free sale and at the same time prevent something being done to the detriment of the tenants?  Have not the tenants first right and first claim there?</P>

      <P>The question of the extent to which allottees have failed to make good, and the reason for such failure is a very important matter.  In my opinion some allottees were selected who were desirous of making good.  Others were selected who had no knowledge of working the land. Farming was not their vocation.  They would prefer to go fishing or to work on the road or the bog or to emigrate for certain seasons.  The reason for failure in the case of some of those who were desirous of working the holding and of making a living on it was that the holding was too small and that the tenant had no capital.  Farming is a business.  If the Minister for Lands presents me with a large building in O'Connell Street and if I have not the money to purchase stock, that premises is no use to me.  I will not be able to pay my rates.  If I am presented with that building on certain conditions, namely, that I cannot sell it or sublet it, and that I must pay rents and rates, and if I cannot out of my own resources purchase the stock and if I cannot go to the bank and borrow money on the property, of what use is that business to me?  The only alternative is to break the law and try to sublet it.  It is the same with the tenant of a Land Commission holding.  That is the answer to the motion, as far as I am concerned.  That is the reason for the failure.  The holding is too small and the farmer has no capital.  The Government has made no provision for that.  They may give the tenant a cow, a harrow, a plough and a horse.  He has to get other things.  His first year may result in a dead loss.  His cow may die, his plough may get broken or he may get sick and may have to pay labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this motion were a motion censuring the Minister and his Department, <Col N="1840" /> if this were a motion calling for an explanation of the Minister's incompetence, laziness, inefficiency, lack of knowledge, I think it would be generally accepted.  The Minister may smile. He has reason to smile because he seems to get away with it.  He and his Party seem to be quite capable of kidding the people of this country. Admittedly, they have succeeded in doing so up to now, but the day will come when that kidding will not continue. If this were a motion of that kind, Deputy Coogan and his Party would have the wholehearted support of this part of the House.  But I cannot see that any good will be derived from setting up the commission asked for or the expense that would be attached to it.</P>
    <P>One would expect that no matter what kind of motion was tabled in relation to this Department, we would file into the division lobby to oppose the Government because we have reason to do so.  We have reason to be prejudiced and reason to oppose the Minister because of his incompetence, but we cannot go into the lobby in support of this motion because we do not see that it will have the result of getting any information that we have not got already.  We have, therefore, to abstain from supporting it.  I think the Opposition should withdraw the motion and table one demanding an explanation from the Minister as to how it is that his Department costs so much annually while there is no return from it, how it is that for the last six years it has failed to discharge its duties in relation to land division without any explanation which is satisfactory to the House and in particular to this Party, how it is that the Department has land on its hands for upwards of 30 years without being allocated or divided, some of that land being situated in congested areas where the valuation of some holdings is as low as three shillings, how is it that the Department can charge fabulous prices for that land when it is let in conacre, and how it is that land which has been taken over since 1911 and even before that, has not yet been vested.  That is the type of motion I thought we should see <Col N="1841" /> coming from Deputy Mulcahy and his Party.  Then, perhaps, we should have the Minister getting up and attempting to give an explanation but not the explanation or the answer which we know is the correct one&mdash;that all these things are due to his incompetence, his laziness and his failure to carry out his duties to this House and to the people of the rural areas.  The Minister is well aware of that.  The Minister can smile, for he knows this is an empty motion which gives him ample room to defend himself when he gets up to reply.</P>
    <P>If the main Opposition are dissatisfied with the Department and the Minister, let them table a motion of censure and ask for the resignation of the Minister.  Then they will have the backing of this side of this House and the backing even of many Deputies in the Minister's own Party, if he will only call off the Whips and allow these Deputies vote according to the dictates of their conscience.  He would then be told in no uncertain manner where he stands with the people of the country and, if he were not so told by these Deputies, they would not be doing their duty to their constituents.  They would not be living up to the principles on which they were elected.  They would not be living up to the very terms in which the Constitution was enacted, either in the letter or the spirit.  I want to say that the Constitution is not being implemented either in the letter or the spirit.  As far as we can see, the Constitution is nothing but a bottle of smoke so far as the tenants are cncerned.</P>

      <P>There is an Article in the Constitution which speaks very strongly in regard to placing tenants on the land and this is a motion dealing with that particular matter.  There may be other Deputies who would like to speak on this motion.  I arrived from the country only this evening and I had made no preparation to speak on it, but it is not a subject that calls for any great preparation as there are so many things one can say, as far as this <Col N="1842" /> Department and Minister are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not much faith in motions, their chief value being that they give rise to a lot of discussion which is often helpful to a Minister and his Department.  This motion is necessary for the purpose of focussing attention on land division, as we have seen it in operation for the last 25 years.  I am satisfied that land division has been one of the greatest benefits conferred on the country since we got control of our own affairs 25 years ago.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied further, that if the Minister studied the position closely, so far as my county is concerned, it would enable him to formulate a policy for the whole country because in that county there are all types of farmers from the biggest to the smallest.  It would enable him to arrive at a happy medium which would give good results under all conditions.  I am satisfied that the Land Commission has done an immense amount of good, that they have broken up large tracts of land which were more or less left to the herd and the dog while the landlord was frequently absent in foreign lands, not caring whether the land was being properly cultivated or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have agitated for land division, but I am not one of those irresponsible men who want every man's land divided.  I want to see ranch land broken up and a type of farmer placed on it who will make good.  Many things have happened in the last 25 years to upset land division.  We had many political upheavals, and we had two Governments in power.  We had different parties claiming land for their followers.  We had the members of the old Republican Army claiming that they had the first title to the land and with some justification, but I hold that no matter what a man's service may have been to his Party or to his country, if he is not a proper man to put on the land he should not be put there.  I believe a man is entitled to compensation for national service but compensation can take many different forms and unless a man is fit to work land, he should not be given a holding.  I believe I have the Minister 100 per <Col N="1843" /> cent.  with me in that statement.  I know he is satisfied that what is wrong at the present time is that we have got a number of misfits who acquired land by hook or by crook.  I am not going to say why they got it but they did get it and many of them are absolute failures.  In fact they were failures before they were put on the land.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons why men fail on the land and why so many who got houses and land must be dispossessed under this new Land Act.  There is one man whom I would dispossess and that is the waster.  I am glad to say that that type is in a minority.  I should not stand for a moment for the man who makes no effort to work his land, whose place is an eyesore to his neighbours and who is a nuisance to himself and to the Land Commission.  Now that land division is more or less in abeyance, waiting for prices to become normal so that the Land Commission can function in the ordinary way, I hope the Minister will have an inquiry into the position because I am of the opinion that we have not much land left for division.  In my county, we have had a vast amount of land division.  I am satisfied that there can be a fair amount of reasonable division still but I do not want to see our county torn up into small patches.  That would be bad for the country.</P>
    <P>The county to which I belong is one of the few counties which have a special property which renders them an asset to the nation.  I am referring now to the live-stock trade.  The greater part of our trade is derived from that type of land.  The cattle we export come mainly from Meath, Westmeath and Kildare.  We ought to be proud that we have such land.  It is a gold mine and we should preserve and conserve it and utilise it to the best advantage for both internal and external purposes.  Before the Minister continues his migration policy, I ask him to inquire into the position.  I am not against migration if carried on on normal and decent lines with the goodwill of the local people.  I do not want to see every local man who applies for land getting it but I want to see farmers' sons in the vicinity of land which is to be divided being treated fairly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1844" /> If a farmer's son has been able to acquire £200 or £300, he is immediately in a position to work a farm of, perhaps, 30 acres and, with the help of his people, he will, probably, make good. There are men applying for land who have not a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; in their pockets and their people could not induce the banks to give them assistance.  That type of man will not make good on the land. The land will be a burden to him.</P>
    <P>As regards land division over the past 25 years, I am satisfied that the Land Commission have been working on wrong lines.  They cut up an estate into small parcels and reditch the whole area, so that almost a quarter of the estate is divided into ditches.  A man is then given a long strip of land with a well at the end of it, so that he has infinite trouble in drawing water to his cattle.  A farm should not be cut up into small, scanty patches.  There is no reason why there should not be farms of mixed sizes. There is no reason why the Land Commission should not give a man 50 acres and his neighbour 30 acres, with, perhaps, another man getting 40 acres and another 22 acres.  The present policy of cutting the land into small parcels of from 22 to 25 acres is unsatisfactory and, when a poor man is left to fend for himself, he cannot succeed. It is in that connection I should like to see an inquiry held.  The men on the small farms are doing reasonably well at present but that is because they are not living solely by their farms.  Some of them are working on the roads or in the pits or under the Land Commission, and some of them have members of their families sending home money from England. These small farmers will one day be put to the pin of their collars to live on their farms and they may have to get back to the bogs from which they came.  It is better to do a job well than to half do it.  What has occurred in the past cannot be remedied.  The only solution I see in connection with the colonies around my locality is to have every third house taken up and given as a cottage to the board of health, the farm attached being divided amongst the two neighbouring farmers. That would mean that you would have two farms where you now <Col N="1845" /> have three.  I speak the mind of all the migrants who came to County Meath when I say that their farms are too small.  They cannot live on them. I hope these small holdings will be vested soon because that would give a man the chance of raising a couple of hundred pounds in the bank on the security of his land, but I am sorry to say that my opinion is that, when they are in a position to do so, 50 per cent. of those allottees will cash-in, by public auction.  The same vicious circle will be re-established.  Some of the strongest men amongst the farming community will buy those holdings. You will have a new rancher and the small farmers fleeing to hell or Connaught.</P>
    <P>I am surrounded by people who got land from the Land Commission.  Some of them are doing very well.  Some of them who had cash have obtained additional land and are now strong farmers.  Some of them are in a position to acquire more land if they could get it.  But I am satisfied that you are making of County Meath an economic slum.  I do not say that it is an economic slum in the sense that Mayo is, where a man with an acre or two is called a farmer.  Meath is different from Mayo.  In Mayo, they can live by poteen-making or fishing, but in County Meath&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They are down with you.  It is a bad thing to have these small, scattered patches.  The farmers of Galway and Mayo, Roscommon, Waterford and other counties derive their living from the Meath and Westmeath farmers.  I defy contradiction of that.  Deputy Cafferky will not object to a Meath rancher going to County Mayo and paying good cash for the stock there.  They are always very strong in the West on sending people to County Meath but, if we proceed on the same lines for 20 years, the farmers who come to Athenry, Ballinasloe and other fairs will not be smiling because there will be no buyers from Meath there.  Clann na Talmhan speak with two voices.  When they are in Meath, they speak of the terrible way things have turned out there.  When in Galway, <Col N="1846" /> they speak of the rich lands in County Meath on which tens of thousands of men from Galway could get a decent living&mdash;at other people's expense. That is hypocrisy.  They should not speak with one voice in Mayo and with another in Meath.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want a change in land division but in the type of land division.  I am satisfied that land division is one of the best things that came out of our gaining our freedom and I want to see more of it, but on proper and better lines.  There is a vast amount of land in my county which can be broken up and I believe that any man who has 300 acres of land has quite enough.  Any man who has more than 300 acres should not be allowed to retain a perch of it.  It is a crying shame that our people should have to go to Britain while there are men with 600, 700 or 800 acres.  I believe, however, in leaving many of the decent farms of 200 and 300 acres in County Meath because one of the greatest assets to a county is a variety of farms.  The businesslike man with a fair amount of land in County Meath is a valuable asset to the small farmer in the neighbourhood, because the 300-acre farmer buys his oats, straw, store cattle and sheep from his nearest neighbour and makes the fairs lively and so gives the small farmer a chance of getting a living on his little holding. If you divide the 200 and 300-acre farms into 25 and 28-acre plots, you <Col N="1847" /> kill the small farmer's economy and create congestion.</P>
      <P>In regard to land division in Italy, Mussolini&mdash;Lord rest his soul, and I give him credit for many good things he did&mdash;adopted the plan of having 300-acre, 100-acre and 50-acre farms all in one vicinity&mdash;a big farm in the middle circled round by small farms of 30 to 50 acres.  The big man was not allowed to till any land at all.  He was forced to buy the produce of the small and uneconomic farmer and that was a very good principle, because it created a market for the small people. The big man could not carry on his farm unless he bought from the small farmer, with the result that there was competition and an opportunity for the small farmers to get a living.</P>
      <P>I should like to see the Minister where he has a big estate of 600 or 800 acres making at least one or two farms of 80 or 100 acres and putting competent men into them who will work the land to better purpose than that of acquiring money to go to every race meeting and dog-fight in the country. We have too many of these idle rich gentry who have money to burn and a vast amount of land, while at the other end, we have too many of these small farmers living in misery and desolation and often in hunger.  It is better to speak out boldly and plainly and not to shelter behind anybody.  I should be one of the Deputies who would shelter behind somebody for the sake of politics.  It would suit me well to say nothing about the very big farmers because there is scarcely one of them but will vote for me whether he likes it or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>One matter into which I should like the Minister to inquire is the vesting of holdings.  I am satisfied that he should not vest any allottee for at least seven years because many of them will cash in on their holdings immediately.  I know an estate not 20 miles from where I live which was fairly well divided.</P>
      <P>The only objection was that the holdings were rather too small, but they were vested in the allottees and almost 75 per cent. of them sold out inside a year or two years.  The thriftiest man in the locality&mdash;all credit to him because he started at the bottom&mdash;bought up all the small farms and he is a big man to-day.  I think he was formerly a herd on the estate.  After seven years, it is reasonable to assume that the allottee will remain for the rest of his lifetime and I suggest that, after that period, his holding should be vested in him so that, if he has not got money to stock his land, he can go to the bank with his papers and get the necessary accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing a man hates more than having to ask a neighbour to back him in the bank and a man would require nearly 20 neighbours to back him if he wants £100.  I should prefer to see a man being his own security and not having to crawl into the bank.  I should prefer to see him able to go into the bank and say: &ldquo;I want money and here is my security.  I intend to work my land as it should be worked.&rdquo; I want to see independence and manliness, but what can you expect from <Col N="1849" /> the man on 22 acres whose holding is not vested for 18 or 20 years?  He is one of the most unfortunate creatures in the country.  He has to crawl to everybody in order to get a little work in a gravel-pit or to get his neighbour to take his land on the eleven-months system.  He has to appeal to his neighbours to buy his store cattle at what is for him the wrong time of the year or beg his neighbours to go security for him for a loan of £50.  We cannot expect land division to make progress on that basis and that is the position in County Meath in hundreds of cases.</P>
    <P>If their land was vested, many of these men would be able to get £300 which, on a small holdings, makes all the difference, provided it goes into some tangible asset, such as a plough, a harrow, a cow or a horse, and not to clear a debt or something of that kind.  I should like to see both the vesting of holdings and the size of holdings inquired into and I ask the Minister to have a full inquiry into the migration policy in my county.  I am not against that policy, and, while some of the men who came up there were of no great value to the county, the majority were good, hardy, thrifty men who are making good.  They have a businesslike attitude and can do a good day's work.  Some of them work for me and are a credit to themselves and the country.</P>
    <P>When the migration policy starts again, it should be thought out on better lines.  Let the Minister not be bringing up a whole crowd of people and putting them on a patchwork quilt with 22 or 25 acres of land to a man, with a long strip and a drop of water&mdash; or even no water&mdash;at the end of it. Let them be given a decent, square holding.</P>
    <P>Before they are brought up, however, let there be fair play for the people of County Meath.  Let the Minister make sure that the herd there is not thrown into a corner, on a swampy holding of 25 acres, which he has to take or leave.  In 99 per cent. of the cases, they got only a scraggy corner with rushes and sedges.  They may have got a house, but hardly ever got a pier built for them.  For the <Col N="1850" /> migrants, a pump was put in, piers were built and backyards made, so that they walked into something worthy of them&mdash;a farm and holding balanced on proper lines.  The Meath farmer who was not lucky enough to be able to pull the political wires or who could not get there on his own merits was thrown a bit of land, often without a house and very seldom with the amenities given to the migrants. They are equally entitled to good treatment.</P>
    <P>That gives rise to grievances and we find the Meath fellow down on the western fellow.  We do not want that, but wish to see them all given properly balanced holdings.  Most of the trouble is caused by putting too many colonists together.  It is bad for themselves and bad for the county.  There is something in common between the lot of us, but when you put 20 or 30 young families into one colony, where they go to the one school, they are inclined to group together.  When they go to the fair, they group there and when they go into the publichouse on the fair day they group there also.  Then one man &mdash;it may be a Meath man or a western man&mdash;gets too much liquor, says something across the floor to the other fellow and you have a mêlée on the spot.  You can go to the fair at Kilcock or the fair of Athboy and you find that after nearly every fair this trouble occurs.  I spoke strongly before about Athboy and Rathcarne and I am right about them.  Some of the people should not have been brought up there at any time, but should have been left where their forefathers lived, as they do not understand the people of Meath and do not understand Ireland&mdash;and do not want to.  All they want is a row on a Saturday night.</P>

      <P>The trouble in County Meath is due to the people being put together.  Every other man should be a Meath man and a westerner, so that they would grow up <Col N="1851" /> in friendship, in harmony and cooperation. The Meath man is a fine fellow and Meath is the most law-abiding county in Ireland.  If all the migrants were shoved into Cork, the Minister would need to go down there again with a gun or a petrol tin.  We took things lying down and I am glad we did, as it shows that we believed in the law and respected the law.</P>
      <P>In future, we should not have these vast colonies, which give rise to trouble in each generation.  The Minister should review the position.  There were Ministers for Lands in the past and I had confidence in them&mdash;and I have confidence in the present Minister, who is a decent, honest, straightforward man, who calls a spade a spade.  That is the type we had in the Old I.R.A., and but for them the country would not be where it is to-day. In future, since land division must go on until it comes to its logical conclusion and the land has been allotted reasonably amongst the people, the Minister should try to see that there are more balanced holdings.  I do not want to see the big man at the top and the poor beggar at the bottom working night and day.  I want to see progressive farms of 60, 70 or even 30 acres, in decent patches, with proper amenities.  If that is done, the Minister will receive not only the blessing of every man in County Meath but my blessing&mdash;and that is a big thing.</P>

      <P>Although there has not been much land division in recent years, there is no harm in our examining the question, as raised in this motion.  Some Deputies blame the Government for not acting more speedily in allocating land.  We have gone through an emergency and it would be hard to expect the Department to deal with land division more rapidly during that time.  There are many young men throughout the length and breadth of the country who are available with capital and who would be quite suitable as allottees.  I hope the Land Commission will embark on a better scheme than in the past.  It has been said here that men from Government clubs were selected, but that has not been my experience in my own area.  I do not think that politics <Col N="1852" /> played any part in selection of the allottees&mdash;and I like to be fair and reasonable.  In some cases, there may have been a political taint, but that is always the case.  In my neighbourhood the division did not have that taint, although we had not much land division in the area.</P>
      <P>Certain things should govern the area of the holding.  A holding of 20 or 25 acres is too small, unless it is exceptionally good in its productive capacity and is near a market.  Land that is adjacent to a town or a good market could be parcelled out in that way, but in the remote areas, or where the land is of a lower value in production capacity, the area should be much larger.  In the smaller holdings you can concentrate on a ready market, but in the other case you have to go back on the ordinary routine of tillage and the area must be greater. This matter should be given very careful consideration by the Minister and the Department.</P>
      <P>Deputy Giles referred to long strips of land with some water at the end. When the Land Commission is taking over land, it should not follow that all the plots must be made of equal size. Amenities such as water should be taken into consideration and the holdings divided so as to give those benefits to all the allottees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very ugly taint about acquiring land and the selection of allottees.  That, as the last speaker has said, may lead to faction fights and to what, as he said, happens at certain fairs.  I think the Land Commission should not acquire land unless asked to do so by the owner of it.  Instead, it should go into the open market and buy land that would be suitable for sub-division, and do so in areas where it would be likely to get suitable applicants. The Government would be wise in allocating a sum of money to the Land Commission for that purpose. Recently I addressed a question to the Minister with regard to a list of holdings in the County Waterford that were being considered for acquisition and sub-division.  I suggest to the Minister that such holdings should be purchased by the Land Commission in the open market.  Surely, the owner of land is entitled to the benefits of <Col N="1853" /> free sale.  If my suggestion were adopted I think it would have the effect of overcoming many of the difficulties that prevail at present in connection with the acquisition of land, and would eliminate, as I have said, the ugly taint that attaches to it. Under the present system, when allottees go into an area that is strange to them they sometimes feel that they are intruders either on the local people or on the relations of the owners from whom land has been acquired.</P>
    <P>The selection of allottees should be carefully considered.  The Minister in discussing this question with me seemed to have the idea&mdash;and I agree with it&mdash;that he does not believe in giving land to people who are not in a position to work it.  I think that is a sound and a wise policy on his part. The allottees should be selected from among those who have enough capital to stock the land they get and enable them to go into production.  I do not mean to convey that it is all farmers' sons who should be selected.  I know a number of young unmarried labouring men who, I believe, would make very good use of any land that might be given to them.  During the years that they have been in constant employment they have accumulated a little bit of wealth which would enable them to make a good start if allotted a holding.  They keep a few sheep and take an acre of beet, and by their industry have accumulated a little money.  These men, as well as farmers' sons, should have their claims considered by the Land Commission when allotting land.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cafferky seemed to think that the only place that needs to be looked after is the County Mayo.  In the County Waterford we have quite a good number of young men who, by reason of the capital they possess and their experience, would be well fitted to go into occupation of a holding in the morning.  The position that farmers will be faced with in the future is going to be very different from that which obtained prior to the outbreak of war. In the future, it will be necessary to have economy and speed in the matter of production.  The methods that were followed in many areas prior to the <Col N="1854" /> war will have to be forgotten in the post-war period.  Farming in the future will have to be highly mechanised.  For that reason, I suggest to the Minister that in the sub-division of land in the future the area of the new holdings should be at least 50 or 60 acres.  The tractor, and not the horse, will have to be used for farming in the future, and therefore the Minister should cater for the methods of husbandry that will have to be utilised by the would-be tenants of the future.  I appeal strongly to the Minister that, in the future, instead of acquiring land, the Land Commission should go into the open market and purchase it so that it may be enabled to give a decent allocation of land to the tenants.</P>

      <P>I had hoped, as a result of this discussion, that at least the mover of the motion and the seconder of it would give me some light of what their intention was in regard to the proposals which they have made.  Deputy Hughes made a long and very delightful speech on the matter, but none of it had any relation at all to the motion.  The seconder of the motion and Deputy Cafferky apparently understood the motion to be one of censure on the Minister.  Deputy Cafferky said that the Minister was lazy, inefficient, incompetent and ignorant, but none of us is as energetic as he would like to be, and none of us is quite as competent as perhaps he thinks he is, and the more we know the more we understand the depth of our ignorance.  I plead guilty to all the charges made by Deputy Cafferky against me.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coogan took another line, and I congratulate him on his industry. He read through the Banking Commission Report, through the <i>Statistical Abstract,</i> and through all the statements that I had made during nearly all my political life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coogan, in effect, charged me with corrupt use of my office in nominating allottees.  Everybody who knows anything here in politics is aware that allottees are selected by the Land Commission and the Minister has nothing at all to do with it.  Time and again in this House I have assured Deputies that there is no political influence used by the Minister in the <Col N="1855" /> selection of allottees.  Representations have been made, and rightly made, to the Land Commission by members of every Party in regard to allottees. That is the right and duty of members of the Dáil.  It is the right and duty of the commissioners to examine carefully the recommendations made by members of the Dáil, because they are public representatives; but that is as far as political influence goes in nominating those who are to be allottees.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan raised an old hare about a statement of mine on the placing of men in jobs.  Those who spoke here&mdash;and it has been often spoken of &mdash;about the spoils system do not seem to know what the spoils system is.  For the benefit of the House I will repeat what the spoils system means.  It means the removal of men in office when a new Government come into power and the replacement of those removed by supporters of the incoming Government.  Everybody knows that has not happened in this country, and it is about time the talk of the spoils system should stop.  In Ireland 95 per cent. of the public posts are filled by competitive examination.  At least 4 per cent. of the remaining 5 per cent. are filled by way of an independent selection board and less than one-half of 1 per cent. are filled by direct action of the Minister.  It is no advantage to the Minister to have this one-half of 1 per cent. of all appointments in his own hands, because for every man he appoints he makes ten enemies.</P>
    <P>Where minor appointments are placed in my hands, when I have to make one of these appointments, which come under the heading of patronage, I shall do everything possible to find a man who is fully capable of filling the post.  I shall put his capacity and his character to the fullest scrutiny and if I find a secretary of a Fianna Fáil club who has the qualities for filling the office, and he wants the job, I will give it to him.  If Deputy Cafferky ever stands in my place here, I do not think his views will be quite the same, of course, when he reaches this office, but I think he would be a very poor, political type if he had a little patronage in his hands and he would not utilise it to strengthen his own Party. <Col N="1856" /> Those who pretend they would do otherwise are just hypocrites.  I make no apology for my view on that matter.</P>

I have no reason to disbelieve Deputy Hughes's statement, but I will say to him that in the long and excellent speech he made he never once referred to the terms of the motion any more than Deputy Giles pretended to refer to it.

      <P>That is the trouble&mdash;the motion speaks for itself and every Deputy who spoke seemed to think he need not refer to it at all.  Deputy Hughes said the motion spoke for itself.  What inquiry is needed into the selection of allottees?  What inquiry is needed into the working of the Land Commission?  Not only is the Dáil responsible for legislation, but it is responsible for seeing that the Departments entrusted with the carrying out of the intentions of the Dáil do carry out those intentions and it is the business of Deputies when matters affecting any Department come before the Dáil to give these matters their fullest attention and a complete scrutiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every year each Department comes before the House at Estimate time and it has to account for its expenditure under every head and sub-head.  There is a full opportunity for members of the Dáil to criticise and inquire, in the smallest detail, into every action of the Department.  Not only can this be done at Estimate time, but it is also done when occasionally a Department has to bring a Bill before the House.  It was the practice in the Dáil, when the Land Bill was before the House, not merely for Deputies to concern themselves with the particular matter contained in <Col N="1857" /> the Bill, but to range freely and widely over the working of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>How are allottees selected?  The Land Commission decides to examine a farm or an estate with a view to acquisition and sends its inspector there.  Immediately there are representations from everybody who lives in the locality where that estate is expected to be divided.  There are representations from people asking to be considered for portion of the estate. Deputies and other public men make representations to the Land Commission. There is not a single application, no matter how, on the face of it, it may look unsuitable, which is not listed by the Land Commission for consideration.  The inspector is supplied with a list of all the applications. He makes the fullest inquiry into the circumstances of every applicant. Sometimes Deputies say that inspectors going around looking for information of that character are acting as spies.</P>
    <P>They ask for information from this, that and the other person.  How else are they going to get real and sound information?  Inspectors are experienced men with a knowledge of human nature as well as a knowledge of land, and they are quite as competent to reach a conclusion about a man's character and capacity as anybody else.  The inspector reports to his divisional inspector and he again examines the matter. Finally, a scheme of recommendations is prepared.  This scheme includes the most suitable recipients of land according to the viewpoints of both the inspector and the divisional inspector.  It excludes none of the applicants.  The whole scheme, with the name of all the applicants, is then put forward for examination by the commissioners. Now, the commissioners are entirely independent of the Minister and of the Government.  Under certain conditions the Government may decide to disemploy them but, so long as they are employed in the capacity of commissioners, the Government may not interfere with them in their work and neither can the Minister interfere with them in their work.  No commission and no tribunal will find a better system of <Col N="1858" /> selecting allottees than the system that obtains at present.</P>

I am convinced that no idea&mdash;however dogmatically held by Deputy Hughes&mdash; will produce a better type of tribunal for the selection of allottees than the present tribunal.</P>
      <P>In regard to the standard of living obtained by those to whom allotments have been granted, I would like to be assured that all the people who have received allotments have achieved a reasonable standard of living.  I do not understand how, without tremendous interference with the people concerned and without tremendous expense and great difficulty, we could prepare in any reasonable period of time data as to what the standard of living is which has been reached by the various allottees.</P>

Like the man in the County Meath public house, I can take the rough with the smooth; but when I give it smooth I expect it back in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The standard of living attained by any allottee does in some measure depend upon the character of the allottee.  One man makes good where another man fails.  Like the Dáil, I think the allottees are a cross section of the Irish people and, just as in the Dáil so in the allottees, you find them good, bad and indifferent.  If we have <Col N="1859" /> any knowledge of the standard of living that has been gained by farmers generally we can, I think, accept it as an average of the standard of living gained by the allottees.</P>
    <P>With regard to the size and the nature of the minimum holding which, as the result of experience, can be regarded as economic, there is a great divergence of opinion.  In one particular county, one type of holding is regarded as the ideal.  In another county a different sized holding is regarded as the proper thing.  As regards the size of the ideal holding, I think in the last analysis there would be very little difference between my point of view and that of Deputy Hughes.  I begin to see the glimmer of an understanding between myself and Deputy Cafferky even on this question of the size of the holding.  I do think that most of the Land Commission holdings are really too small. That is my own opinion.  If we were to try to place as many people as possible on the land with the limited amount of land at our disposal, it would be very difficult to put people on what I would consider to be ideal holdings.  I notice in a few newspapers that I have been condemned by people, who seem to be very much concerned for the social welfare of our people, because I have said on a few occasions that there are too many people on the land.</P>
    <P>Let me again&mdash;as I did about the jobbery&mdash;make open confession.  I do believe there are too many people on the land.  I think it was Deputy Coogan who pointed out that we had too many holdings of under 15 acres and that when the holdings are under 15, ten and five acres we have too many people on the land.  There is no advantage in trying to create what Deputy Giles described as &ldquo;agricultural slums&rdquo; and when the holdings are too small then you have an agricultural slum.  Deputy Cafferky came into notice recently in regard to the division of a farm in County Mayo.  I believe that farm is roughly about 200 acres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit it is better than what they have, but my argument is that there are still too many people on the land when they are living on holdings from which they cannot make a living.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Cafferky that a man does need 40 acres of arable land.  I find it difficult to understand how a farmer can make a living on less.  I cannot understand how you can hope to retain a farm of that size for generations in the hope of stabilising our society.  I fear that if the man on the 20-acre farm is vested that the 20-acre farm will then be purchased by the man with a bigger holding.  Therefore, the good we are trying to do on the one hand will be undone by the natural economic law on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the extent to which allottees have failed, I brought in a Land Bill here some time ago to deal with the failures of allottees, not so much to deal with men who, through no fault of their own, had failed, but men who had not made any use at all of the land given to them.  I pointed out then that this was a great evil; but I pointed out also that it was a limited evil; that it only existed within a certain limit and that the average allottee had done his duty by the State and his fellow-man by <Col N="1861" /> working his land properly.  But it would be an evil example and an evil thing if men who got land from the State at the expense of the people were permitted to utilise that land in a manner prejudicial to the public welfare.  These men had to be dealt with and the Land Act was brought in to deal with them. The Land Act will be utilised in the mildest manner possible.  We do not want to be harsh with them.  We want to &ldquo;lesson&rdquo; them, rather than to punish them.  But, certainly, we must destroy the evil that existed of men who refused point blank to utilise properly the land they got from the Land Commission at the public expense and who did not live in the houses that they also got at the public expense.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is any real need for the tribunal that Deputy Hughes has proposed.  In his speech, Deputy Hughes contented himself with saying that the motion spoke for itself and then immediately went away from it and spoke very fluently of a lot of other matters.  The seconder of the motion read endlessly from the Banking Commission's report, and, incidentally, quoted the Cassandra-like prophecy of the Banking Commission&mdash; that land prices were bound to be depressed in the future in this country. The Banking Commission was wrong in that and in many other things, and so was Deputy Coogan.  But Deputy Coogan did not give us any real enlightenment on the nature of the tribunal he proposed, how it would go to work, or what the consequences would be.  I thought Deputy Cafferky would bring some enlightenment into the debate. But I think I never heard a worse speech or a more halting speech from Deputy Cafferky.  When Deputy Cafferky is really convinced of the depredations of the Minister, he is full of pep.  But to-night he was halting, slow and not the least bit convincing on this particular matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cafferky stated that if you give a man a shop in O'Connell Street and expect him to pay rent <Col N="1862" /> and rates when he has no capital or stock, you do a very foolish thing.  The example was perfect.  If you give a house and land to a man who is incapable, because of physical or financial disability, of making a going concern of it, you are doing wrong.  It was all very fine for Deputy Davin to talk about landless men in Laoighis and Offaly.  I have, in my experience, met a lot of these landless men in various parts of the country.  All of them have perfectly new deposit receipts to show the Land Commission how much money they have saved so that they will be entitled to land because they will be able to make it a going concern with the new deposit receipt.  But the new deposit receipt disappears immediately they get the land and that is only a form of deception that is played on the Land Commission.  It is no wonder that mistakes are made in regard to the selection of allottees, because the Land Commissioners and the inspectors cannot be as wise as the Banking Commission in regard to the price of farms, or as wise as Deputy Coogan.  They do make mistakes now and again.  Even Deputy Cafferky will admit that.</P>

I think that every Department of State and its work should be subject to the closest scrutiny.  I think that a Minister and his Department should be glad of every criticism.  The opportunity is offered to Deputies, than whom there are not any more able or informed critics, to examine the working of the Land Commission every year at Estimate time. Every penny is accounted for under one sub-head or another.  Deputies are entitled to ask any questions they like and must get an answer.  I see no useful purpose that could be served by the setting up of this tribunal, and, therefore, I will oppose the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to say all I have to say about the motion and the debate in five minutes.  This would have been a very useful motion if the Deputies who put it down had stopped at the end of the first two lines and if they had proposed simply to set up a commission to inquire into and report on the work of the Land Commission.  By the terms of reference which they added to the motion, they tied up this tribunal in a manner which would render it futile. The most important function of the Land Commission in regard to land division is the acquisition or purchase of land.  The Land Commission does not create or manufacture land.  They have to get it from somebody.  No tribunal can sit down to consider the question of land division without first deciding on what land the Land Commission is going to obtain and how they propose to obtain it.  There is no use in considering the type of allottee or any of the other things until you know how much land you are going to deal with.  That is the first question you have to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most people assumed when the landlord's interest was purchased that the land question was more or less settled. I think the Land Commission to a great extent laboured under that impression. They considered that their work, after the purchase of the landlord's interest, was merely the clearing up of small details.  But, when you get down to the position under the existing Land Acts, you find that there is absolutely no limit to the work that lies before the Land Commission. There is absolutely no end to the policy of land settlement, resettlement, and further resettlement.  Unless the Land Commission obtain from this House or <Col N="1864" /> from somebody some guiding principles, they will continue to be a blundering, useless, inefficient Department, because they do not know how much land they are to obtain and, therefore, they do not know what categories of people are to be provided for.</P>
    <P>If you confine land division to uneconomic holders there is a huge proportion of our people to be catered for, but if you go a little further and bring in landless men you have the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh son of every farmer and the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh son of every agricultural labourer as well as every agricultural labourer and I suppose the people in the towns could also regard themselves as landless men. You create a position in which there is no limit to the operations of the Land Commission.  That is why I say the motion would be very acceptable if it had been confined simply to a request for the setting up of a tribunal to inquire into the work of the Land Commission. I would say definitely that the Land Commission has failed.  It has proved itself incompetent and inefficient and it has proved itself a very dangerous institution because, while it is at present a slow, lumbering institution, if public pressure were brought to bear on it, it might very easily become an institution that would be a menace to every farmer in the country and to his security of tenure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I can conclude by dealing with the last speaker first.  He suggested that we should have confined our motion to the first two lines.  I would remind the Deputy that the work of the Land Commission is not confined to land division.  It did far more important work under the Land Acts in buying out the landlord's interest and vesting the ordinary tenant farmer in his holding.  We were not anxious to have that side of the Land Commission's work investigated.  There was no necessity to have it investigated and, so far as acquisition for land division was concerned, we had no fault to find except on the question of paying a fair price.  We have made our views on that sufficiently clear.  We were concerned with how land was divided.  The <Col N="1865" /> motion is not in opposition to land division.  Its purpose is to ensure that land is used in a certain manner.</P>
      <P>I was rather disappointed with the Minister's approach to this whole problem. I expected that he would approach it in a calmer and more enlightened way.  He got very heated about it.  I was particularly calm when I was moving the motion.  It is important that the House should appreciate that we were stressing the national aspects of this matter.  The very name of the Land Commission ought to imply its interest in the care and utilisation of our most precious asset, the efficient working of the land, its economic use, how the use of the land serves the national interests, whether its disposition makes for maximum production.</P>
      <P>We talk a good deal about increasing production.  We talk a lot about the low incomes of our people.  We were greatly impressed by the White Paper on national income which indicated that only 290,000 of our people have an income of £3 a week and over and that the vast majority of them have low incomes, incapable of giving them decent standards.  Bound up in that problem is the question of the utilisation of the land because, in the last analysis, we all live out of the productive capacity of the land.  We have been trying to stress to this Minister&mdash;and he seems to have missed the point completely, because he replied in a puerile fashion&mdash;the importance of this question.  I had expected that he would be broader in his approach to the motion.  I merely said that the details were set out and that I was not going to waste time in labouring them but that I was emphasising the big issue so far as the national interest was concerned.  If we want to raise the standard of this country, we must increase production and, in that connection, the disposition and utilisation of the land is the first and major consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The low output per man per acre, stagnation in production&mdash;has that no relation to the problem raised in the motion?  Is this House satisfied that the man who presides over the activities of this Department has attempted to approach this important subject in a constructive way or that <Col N="1866" /> he realises the importance of the subject so far as the nation as a whole is concerned, or that he realises how other countries approach this question?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked him how he believed that.  He then changed his tune completely and said: &ldquo;I think most of the holdings are too small.&rdquo; He was going to make an open confession here that he thought most of the holdings were too small.  Yet he has complete confidence in the machinery that selects allottees and decides what is an economic unit.  Will the Minister tell the House how many agriculturists, how many men who might be regarded as experts on this question of agricultural economy, are employed by his Department?  I am doubtful if there is a single man in the Department who could claim to be that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet the Minister has the effrontery to tell this House that the machine is perfect but he is doubtful whether the holdings&mdash;the slum agricultural holdings that we have being creating with public moneys&mdash;are satisfactory, and that it is in the national interest to continue to create them.  I stress this point, that after a quarter of a century, during which we have been pursuing a policy of land division, it is time to call a halt.  A halt was called because of the intervention of the war and the slowing up of land settlement and our case is that now is the time to make an examination but that the examination should not be carried out by the Land Commission, that they are not the right people to inquire into their own affairs, that an independent, impartial tribunal should be set up to inquire into the manner in which the selection was made, to inquire into <Col N="1867" /> whether the unit of land was economic or not and whether the people who have worked these holdings for the last 25 years have made good.</P>
    <P>So far as the selection of allottees is concerned, is anyone satisfied that the selection is a proper one?  &ldquo;A lot of new deposit receipts are presented to the inspector going down there but they soon disappear when the applicants get allotments of land,&rdquo; was another statement made by the Minister.  If there was any local machinery or any local knowledge used in the selection of allottees, would the new, clean deposit receipt impress the local man who would have full knowledge of the allottee's capacity to use land or what he had done in the way of accumulating a little cash for that purpose?  What do we do now?  We send down an inspector who lives in the locality perhaps for a few months. He then goes out to Johnny Murphy's, sits down in the kitchen and says: &ldquo;We are going to divide land round here. You are an applicant for it and what use are you likely to make of it?&rdquo; The prospective allottee, of course, praises himself and says he is going to make great use of it.  The inspector then says: &ldquo;What about Johnny Nolan? Would he make good use of it if we gave him an allotment?&rdquo; Of course this man, fearing that if Johnny Nolan gets an allotment, he may be left out in the cold, tears his neighbour to bits and says that he would not be any use for land.</P>
    <P>That is considered a satisfactory method of selection, a selection made by a junior member of the staff! A senior inspector may O.K. the work of that junior man, it finally comes up to the Land Commission and the commissioner sitting in an office in Merrion Street decides whether the scheme of allocation is satisfactory or not.  That system has resulted in a high percentage of failures, according to the statement made by the Minister when introducing the Land Bill a couple of months ago, but he has the effrontery to come into the House now and to say that he is quite satisfied with it.  No matter how land may be dissipated under a scheme of that sort, no matter what effect it will have on the national <Col N="1868" /> income or on the income of the particular individual settled on the land, we are told it is not worth examining. I am not so much concerned about the individuals at the moment; the individual is ephemeral and he will pass, but it is the long-term consideration in which I am interested&mdash;that if the land is utilised to the best advantage nationally, production may eventually be stepped up.  So far as the small holdings that have resulted from the activities of the Department are concerned, when Deputy Giles was speaking he talked about slicing up the land and the thought came into my mind that you might describe the Land Commission as bacon slicers, and the slices they are making are very thin indeed, such as no man could live on.  The Minister himself has admitted that now but he has quite casually decided that they can do no wrong although they are not quite right about the size of the unit, which, in the Minister's opinion, is not economic.  He said that I do not know what I am talking about. I know much more about the use of land than the Minister does and I know infinitely more about what I am talking than the Minister does.  He certainly cannot teach me anything about land.</P>

I suggested that it was not a simple problem.  I suggested, and I still hold, that the time is now opportune for an examination of this whole question.  The Minister described those who were being selected as a fair cross-section of the people, and he said that you could decide the standard of living of these allottees by the standard of living of the farming community generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is that not pure childishness?  The Minister should have, as I am sure he has, grown up by this.  Does he not know full well that you cannot judge the standard of an allottee by the standard of agriculture in the country? Does he not know that in a very high percentage of these allotments, fertility is completely ignored, that the land <Col N="1869" /> very often is being raped and depressed and that if you allow that sort of thing to continue its effect will be very bad nationally?  The Minister looked for powers in the new Land Act to try to rectify this evil behind closed doors over there in Merrion Street.  We suggest that this matter should be examined in the open daylight by a tribunal and leave it to them to say what should be the policy, as far as future land <Col N="1870" /> division in the country is concerned. I am sorry that the Minister did not see fit to agree with us in the matter.  It was an absurd defence of his policy to suggest that we had not discussed the terms of the motion.  Of course we discussed the terms of the motion.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Derating of Agricultural Out-Offices&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That, in order to encourage the provision of better housing for live stock and better storage for farm produce and equipment, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that all out-offices on agricultural holdings should be completely exempt from rates. &mdash; (Deputies Blowick, Cogan and Beirne.)</P>

      <P>I do not think it would be fair for the House to allow a motion of this nature to be disposed of without further comment, and, in view of Deputy Maguire's absence, I should like to make a few brief remarks.  This is a motion the adoption of which would be welcomed by the farmers.  Representations have repeatedly been made to the Minister's Department with regard to grants for the repair and erection of out-offices, and I understand that there is no scheme, other than the farm improvements scheme under the Department of Agriculture, by which <Col N="1872" /> such buildings can be repaired.  If a motion of this kind were put into effect, it would represent a considerable relief in rates to many of our farmers.  Many of them would have more up-to-date out-offices and would probably have extensions built on to existing buildings if they could have an assurance that the local authority would not levy additional rates on them as a result.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of our farmers have not got suitable out-offices.  The Minister's Department has prescribed regulations whereby it is necessary for farmers to have suitable out-offices for such live stock as cattle, and, under the dairying regulations, the county medical officer will take a very serious view of any farmer who does not keep his cowsheds in accordance with these regulations.  It is very hard to expect farmers to have their out-offices up-to-date for the reason that they are not exempt from rates.  If they were exempt, I believe there would be a considerable improvement.  The storage of farm produce and equipment is very important, and we know how difficult it was during the emergency to secure supplies of agricultural machinery.</P>
      <P>We know also that to a farmer a good mowing machine, a good plough or reaper or binder, is his means of livelihood and the means by which he produces food, and our farmers should be enabled to have accommodation for such essential machinery without rates being imposed upon them. In addition, farmers should be encouraged to have lofts for the storage of grain and so on, and for that reason this motion should be put into effect.  It deserves the support of every Deputy and I hope it will be adopted.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cogan, in moving this motion on the last occasion on which it was before the Dáil, pleaded, in extenuation of the very inadequate arguments which he adduced in support of it, that he was taken by surprise.  I do not know whether it is surprise or discretion which has emptied the benches of Clann na Talmhan this evening, but, at any rate, if one may judge by the attendance in the House, it would <Col N="1873" /> look as if they themselves were not fully convinced of the wisdom of this proposal.  Deputy Cogan, in moving it, seemed to have been prepared, if he had had more timely warning that it would be taken, to support it by citing the conditions under which Danish farmers carry on.  He said at column 1602 of the Official Reports:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I had intended to produce in this debate, if I was aware that it would be taken this week, figures showing the extent of farm buildings in Denmark as compared with this country.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Any person who listened to Deputy Cogan making his speech on that occasion must have asked himself: what do they know of Ireland who only Ireland know?  For those who sit beside Deputy Cogan, every prospect charms so long as it is a distant prospect.  For them every field is green, so long as it is a far-off field.  Deputy Cogan bases his case on Denmark. Denmark is, for him, the farmer's paradise, a country studded with farm buildings. Perhaps it is true that we have too few buildings on our Irish farms.  Most authorities, I think, do say that, but other authorities&mdash; authorities on Danish agriculture&mdash; take the view that some Danish farms, an appreciable number of them, may have too many.</P>
      <P>Did Deputy Cogan ever hear of a gentleman called Einar Jensen?  He is the principal agricultural economist in the United States Department of Agriculture.  He has made a study of Danish agriculture&mdash;which I am afraid Deputy Cogan has not&mdash;and in 1933 he published a book entitled <i>Danish Agriculture: Its Economic Development.</i> Here is what he says, on page 136 of that authoritative study of agricultural conditions in Denmark:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Both these factors&mdash;the free ownership of farms which ensures future benefits from whatever investments are made, plus easy access to long-term credit&mdash;have encouraged the farmers to invest large amounts&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and this is the significant comment, <Col N="1874" />&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;sometimes too large amounts, in land improvements and especially in buildings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are three significant statements in that short sentence.  First, that Danish farmers have been encouraged to invest by reason of the free ownership of farms.  Our Irish farmers enjoy now practically free ownership.  It is true that, as tenant-purchasers, they are paying an annuity, but that annuity represents merely one-half, or to-day even considerably less than one-half, of the market value of their farms as real estate.  Accordingly, the Irish farmer in that regard is in as good a position as any Danish farmer.</P>
    <P>The other condition which the Danish farmer enjoys, and which is significant also from the point of view of the case which has been made for this motion, is that he has easy access to long-term credits.  We here have the Agricultural Credit Corporation, which extends long-term credits to farmers.  Most of our farmers have enjoyed what are, in effect, long-term facilities from our banks.  Many Irish farmers, in fact, so far from wanting credit, have lying fallow in the banks large amounts of capital which could be suitably invested here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is in debt, then he differs from the vast majority of his colleagues.  The third significant fact which we can glean from this judgment of a person who has studied agricultural conditions in Denmark at first hand and who is competent to form a sound opinion in relation to them is that the farmers have invested sometimes too large amounts in land improvements and especially in buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1875" /> In this same publication&mdash;to which I would advise Deputy Cogan in future to devote some study&mdash;the Deputy will find published representative Danish farm accounts and will see that, so far from land being derated, the Danish farmer, in respect of a representative and not very large farm, has to pay taxes on his estate amounting to about £32 per annum in our money and that his mortgage interest&mdash;in 1929, remember&mdash;was £57.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for Deputy Cogan, Deputy Flanagan and others with no sense of responsibility to the community, to put down on the Order Paper motions which appeal to the cupidity of one section and, when such motions come to be debated here, fail to support them by any single argument that would convince a rational man.  We know, of course, what the political technique in these matters is.  Clann na Talmhan and Deputy Flanagan and others like him are not concerned with the practicability or the reasonableness of anything they put down on the Order Paper.  On the contrary, the more unreasonable it is from the point of view of the general community, the more ardently they will support it, because the higher the bribe which they dangle in front of those uninformed people&mdash; and the mere presence of these Deputies indicates that we have a substantial number of such uninformed and short-sighted people in certain constituencies&mdash;the greater will be its appeal and the more the simpletons will fall for the bait.</P>
    <P>We have, however, to consider a motion of this sort from the point of view of its reactions upon the community at large.  If we were to admit that a complete exemption from rates is justified, in order that the construction of farm buildings may be encouraged, then it must follow that all other forms of desirable buildings should also be free from rates, that factory buildings and shops, that houses even should be free from rates in order that the erection of all these structures may be encouraged.  If we are proposing to relieve farm buildings of rates, and if we have to go further in justice, as we must, to relieve other buildings which <Col N="1876" /> are used for productive purposes also from rates, then we are faced with the dilemma which Deputy O'Connor posed to the House: if you derate a particular type of building in order to encourage the stock owner to provide adequate shelter for his stock, and if you go further and derate an industrial building in order to encourage the industrialist to provide a building to shelter his workers and to shelter the processes which they work, what is going to be your answer to those who say: &ldquo;Well, are you going to put the human being in a lower category than the farm animal or than the industrial machine; are you going to derate houses which are built to house cattle and horses and pigs and at the same time impose a heavier burden upon houses which are built to shelter human beings and to provide homes for families?</P>
    <P>Of course, there can be no answer to that.  Once you proceed to derate any building, to relieve it of its just share of the burden of expense which is involved in the maintenance of local services you are driven back to this position, that you must derate all buildings. Then, in order to enable the local services to be carried out you must find some alternative means of raising revenue.  You have either got then to provide revenue for the local services out of central taxation, in which case one may well ask: what justification is there for a local authority at all?  If you are going to provide the cost of these services out of taxation&mdash;if you are going to provide the £8,000,000 or £10,000,000 or £12,000,000 which is raised in rate revenues in one form or another&mdash;what taxes is the central authority going to levy in order to provide the money to finance the local services?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had not reached the use of reason in 1934, and I doubt whether he has reached it yet. I was asking, what taxes are you going to levy in order to raise money to finance the local services if you derate buildings, and if you decide <Col N="1877" /> that the money must be provided out of the Central Fund?  Everybody knows&mdash;I think it is generally admitted; it is certainly admitted in Great Britain by no less than the Labour Chancellor&mdash;that direct taxation has reached its limits, and that it has now become a deterrent to enterprise and is tending to yield a dwindling return.  For that reason the British Chancellor has indicated that he proposes to adopt new expedients for raising revenue, and that he is satisfied that income-tax, super-tax and the other direct taxes on incomes have now reached such levels that they are defeating themselves because they are curbing and stultifying enterprise. He has introduced a new tax, a purchase tax, which is the most oppressive of all taxes and which falls with the utmost severity on the poorest classes of the community.</P>
      <P>Our position in this country is better than it is in Great Britain, undoubtedly from the point of view of taxation, but here, too, everybody is beginning to realise that the level of income-tax and of the other taxes upon profits is acting as a brake upon industry and as a brake upon enterprise.  Accordingly, if we have to provide these huge sums which are now necessary to finance the local services we shall have to provide them out of some form of indirect taxation, and that indirect taxation must in its very nature, since it must be a tax upon commodities or a tax upon services which are in general use&mdash;or it may be a tax upon business transactions &mdash; ultimately fall most heavily upon the poorer sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the alternatives which confront those who have made themselves responsible for this motion.  If they are going to proceed to develop their principles to their logical extreme they must derate all buildings, and they must find an alternative method of raising revenue.  One of these alternatives is to raise that revenue out of indirect taxation by taxing the food of the poor.  This is what I am putting to the Clann na Talmhan Party: do they wish to substitute taxes upon the food of the poor for taxes upon the possessions of the property-owning class?  That is one of the alternatives <Col N="1878" /> that lies before them.  Are they going to take it?  The Leader of the Clann na Talmhan Party will perhaps be replying to this debate.  I say to him that his motion is, in essence, a motion to relieve the property owner of what is a just imposition upon him.  I am asking him, does he propose to relieve that property owner by putting an additional charge on the Central Exchequer, and does he propose that that charge should be met by taxing the food of the poor in order to relieve the aforesaid property owner?</P>
    <P>Another alternative, and it is an alternative which has been chosen elsewhere, as I shall show, is the alternative which has often been argued in this House over the period from 1933 to 1938.  During that period there were several motions put down by members of the Fine Gael Party advocating this alternative in one form or another.  The alternative is this: if you are going to derate buildings, and if you are not going to provide the revenue which is necessary to carry on local services out of the Central Fund by indirect taxation, are you going to put a tax upon land?  That is another way.  Land is a fixed property; land is undiminishable and, therefore, the value of land is easily determined.  It is a very suitable tax, if one likes to impose it, for the purpose of raising local revenue.  It does not fall immediately upon the poor.  I am not prepared to say that it might not ultimately fall upon them in the form of increased prices for their food, but it is an alternative form of raising local revenue which has been adopted in other countries, notably in Deputy Cogan's earthly paradise, Denmark.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that Deputy Cogan was taken at such short notice in moving this motion; it is a great pity he was not able to dilate at length upon the joys of the Danish farmer.  I am not asking the House to take anything I say upon my authority.  I shall give some quotations from a very recent article dealing with conditions in Denmark, that blessed State to which Deputy Cogan and, apparently, his colleagues in Clann na Talmhan, aspire.  The article is an extract from <i>Land and Liberty,</i> for August and September of 1946.  It is headed &ldquo;Denmark <Col N="1879" /> Revisited&rdquo;.  I am giving only some quotations from that article, the significant ones.  The article states that the national land value tax&mdash;mark that, the national, the State, land tax&mdash;is now at the rate of 6d. per mille, corresponding to 1½d. per £ capital value or, say, 2/9 in the £ of annual value.  That is imposed on all land in town and country alike.</P>
    <P>Is that what Deputy Cogan proposes as the alternative?  It would be one way of finding the money to derate buildings; it would be one way of finding the money for the national Exchequer if the burden of the local services were to be cast back on the national Exchequer.  Are Deputy Cogan and Deputy Blowick, in this motion, leading up to the blessed position which obtains in Denmark of having a national land value tax at the rate of 2/9 in the £ of annual value? The writer of &ldquo;Denmark Revisited&rdquo; goes on to say that also over the whole country and on all land the local taxation of land values applies.  In Denmark, this far-off field which so appeals to Deputy Cogan, not only have they a national land tax, a State land tax, but they have in addition, a local land tax.  The writer goes on to say that the local taxation of land values applies to all the land, bringing in, on the average, 40 per cent. of local revenues in counties and rural parishes, but in towns considerably less.</P>
    <P>We see this, therefore, in this motion, one of the concealed objectives&mdash;because I take it that the Deputy is quite logical in what he proposes to do, and fixed in his purpose&mdash;of Clann na Talmhan is to institute not only a local but a national land tax.  In Denmark, where the urban population is relatively much greater to the agricultural population than it is in this country and where, accordingly, the value of urban property is relatively greater in proportion to the value of the agricultural land than it is in this country, the position is such that the local land tax brings in more money in the rural than it does in the urban areas.</P>
    <P>That is not all of it; that is not the only boon and blessing that the farmer in Denmark enjoys.  In addition to the national tax and the local taxes on <Col N="1880" /> land values, there is a special increment tax which takes some part of the increase of the value of any land.  The datum line is the 1932 valuation, and the increase is determined on each subsequent periodic valuation.  It is not charged once for all but is an annual tax levied on that part of the land value which is shown to have increased in the interval.  We must ask ourselves how happy the Irish farmer would feel if he were in the position of the Danish farmer, the Danish farmer with his land studded with farm buildings, if every year or two his land were re-valued and if any increase which had taken place in the valuation of that land in the meantime were subject to a tax.  The unfortunate farmer in Denmark gets no compensation if, over the period between one valuation and another, the valuation of his farm has gone down; he does not get any refund but is merely taxed as long as the value of the farm is going up.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the position of Clann na Talmhan would be if we were to introduce the Danish tax-system into this country.  I suppose if we were walking down Grafton Street we should see there in one of the shop windows spectacles such as the populace of Copenhagen witnessed a week or so ago.  I have here in my hand a photograph. I do not know whether we can include this photograph in the records. It would be a very beneficial thing if we could do so, because when Deputy Cogan began to sigh for the Danish heaven he could go to the appropriate volume of the Official Reports and he could look at this pathetic picture.</P>
    <P>The picture shows a little pig enclosed within a child's play-pen, complete with ball-frame, and I read that behind it in the shop window there is a placard which declares: &ldquo;When I grow up I will be sent to England for the price of 20 kroner and instead you will receive roller skates, transfer pictures and other utility goods for which the English demand outrageous prices.  How long are we going to put up with it?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that, instead of describing the fanciful benefits and conditions which they imagine people overseas are enjoying, it would be much better for us, and much better for the country as a whole, if those who profess to be the leaders of the people, and those who try to shape and mould public opinion in this country, would point out to our people the very real advantages which they are enjoying in this country, under this Government.</P>
      <P>This motion cannot be justified by what has happened in Denmark; nor can it be justified by what has happened in any other country where building of any description has been derated.  Those of us who study these things know very well that in Great Britain the derating of certain classes of buildings has created very difficult problems indeed for the local authority there and particularly for those local authorities who happen to be responsible for the poorer communities in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same difficulty would arise in this country.  As Deputy O'Connor and Deputy de Valera pointed out, it is not a case of relieving property, in the form of structures, of their share of the local burden and leaving it at that.  You must go a step further and provide an alternative source of revenue.  It may be that you will say: &ldquo;We will put it on <Col N="1883" /> other houses; we will take it off buildings that house the animals and put it on the buildings that house the family&rdquo;.  I think that would be most unwise.  I think the social consequences would be bad.  It could be challenged on the grounds of equity, though that challenge might be weaker than it would be in the case where you said: &ldquo;We are going to derate the farm buildings altogether and we are not going to put those charges on the farmer; we are going to ask the urban communities to bear these charges&rdquo;. That might appear to be a very simple matter.  To those who are endeavouring to curry favour with the agricultural population, it might appear to be a very advantageous thing to do.  I do not know whether any of them have considered what the ultimate consequences of such tactics might be if we had one political group exercising their political power in order to extract advantages for their political section at the expense of every other section of the community.  Under such circumstances, how long would this community hold together?</P>
    <P>The only basis upon which you can hope to have a happy, contented and united community&mdash;as we are, whatever the differences may be upon minor issues&mdash;is to ensure that everybody in the community gets equitable treatment. Therefore, if you are going to tax the property belonging to one class, you must tax the property of all classes who hold the same type of property.</P>
    <P>It may be that Deputy Cogan does not believe that rates are a suitable form of taxation.  He has committed himself to somewhat equivocal statements on the matter on one or two occasions.  I am not certain that he has committed himself to such a statement precisely on this occasion.  It is important, therefore, in dealing with his motion to consider the nature of rates and the advantages which attach to them as revenue-raising instruments.  If we propose to abolish them and do not propose to defray the cost of the local services&mdash;by way of taxation&mdash;out of the Central Fund, if we are not going to provide the necessary local revenue by the imposition of rates and taxes upon agricultural land, then we must <Col N="1884" /> provide that revenue by some other form of local taxation.  The fact of the matter is that there is no other form of taxation so suitable for the purpose of raising local revenue as are the rates.  In order that a tax may be suitable for the purpose of raising local revenue it must fulfil certain very stringent conditions.  The first of these is that it must be a definitely stable source of revenue&mdash;that is to say, that the produce of it must not be subject to any very wide variations so long as the rate of tax remains unchanged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that a tax for the purpose of raising revenue for a local authority must have, as its first quality, stability.  Rates are a very stable source of revenue.  No matter how feloniously inclined a man may be and no matter how destructive he may be he can never destroy or run away with a piece of land or the building which is sited on it.  As a rule in peace time buildings last very much longer and have a more useful life than those who occupy them.  Once their value has been ascertained and definitely noted a tax can be levied upon them without very much trouble. We have decided that the persons who occupy these buildings ought to pay this tax and the fact of occupation is easily ascertainable as a general rule by the local rate collector, who is the local tax-gatherer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another tax that might be thought to be stable would be a consumption <Col N="1885" /> tax.  But a local consumption tax has this disadvantage as compared with a tax upon permanent property, upon real estate, that it can be easily evaded.  If we were to put a tax, say, upon produce coming into a town, if we were to put a tax upon produce sold within the town&mdash;cigarettes or vegetables or anything like that&mdash;it would be possible for persons to purchase these commodities elsewhere and in that way evade payment of the tax which had been imposed for the purpose of raising local revenue.</P>
    <P>A local income-tax has sometimes been suggested as an alternative method of raising local revenue.  In that case, however, what would happen would be that, unless the tax were levied, so far as towns are concerned, at a uniform rate on every part of the country, levied upon every individual in the country, including farmers, it could be easily evaded, because the wealthy classes, the people who would be counted on to pay the greater part of the income-tax, need not live in the towns at all.  If the rate of income-tax were to vary between one town and another, they would leave the more heavily taxed town to settle down in the more lightly taxed.  As a rule, by reason of the fact that the social services fall most heavily upon the poorer communities and are more largely required by the poorer communities, it would happen that the rate of income-tax in the poorer community would be higher than the rate in the wealthier community.  Therefore, if we were to raise our local revenues by levying income-tax upon inhabitants, we should find that very shortly the taxable capacity of the poorer communities would be exhausted.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we come back to this position, that if we are not to ask the central authority to bear the cost of the local services, and if the only suitable way of raising those revenues is by means of the rates, then as I have shown, if we relieve any class of building from bearing its fair share of the rates, we shall inevitably be driven back to the position in which we shall have to relieve every other class of building as well.  We will put ourselves in the happy position in which the Danish farmers are, who have <Col N="1886" /> their lands not only taxed by the State, but taxed by the local community as well.</P>
    <P>That is what this motion is leading us to.  Once we accept the principle of derating buildings, there is no logical point at which we can stop short.  We may say that we know it is unfair to derate buildings belonging to one section of the community, but, because we are politically powerful, we are going to insist that that particular concession will be given to our particular class in the population and we will expect every other class in the population to grin and bear the share of the burden which ought to be ours. As I have said, as a community we cannot hope to live happily and to prosper if that attitude of mind is to become the dominant factor in shaping our political decisions.  We can live and thrive as a community upon a basis of equal justice and equitable treatment.  Accordingly, since this motion is, in essence, inequitable and unfair, I hope that the Dáil will reject it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this motion should commend itself to every Deputy, especially after the very feeble case the Minister made against it.  As a matter of fact, he has made no case against it.  He has taken us to Denmark and told us how the farmers there are suffering.  I notice that the Minister failed to mention the kind of Minister for Agriculture they have in Denmark.  He took great care to steer clear of that.  He avoided mentioning what the Minister for Agriculture here and his Party have done for agriculture and the farmers since they got into power.  He just touched on the economic war and then shied away from it like a startled horse.  He knew that that would not go down very well with the people of this country, particularly the farmers who have been salted to the tune of something like £82,000,000, as has been admitted by members of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He did not tell us that the Danish Government, if not actually a farmers' Government, is more than sympathetic to the farmers' interests and not diametrically opposed to the farmers' interests, as the Fianna Fáil <Col N="1887" /> Government has proved itself to be since it took over office.  He did not mention, for instance, that the Danish Government have built up and organised an export trade which we would do very well to copy in this country, instead of wrecking our industry, as has been done here.  He did not mention that in an intensely agricultural country like this, owing to the bungling and incompetence of the Government, a position has now been reached where the most plentiful item of produce from our farms formerly has to be rationed, where town and city people have to be cut down to six ounces of butter, where sugar is done away with altogether, although the beet is lying in piles all over the country rotting and the farmers are being compelled to feed it to the cattle, because the Minister for Industry and Commerce has refused to handle the situation and the Minister for Agriculture to-day disclaimed all responsibility for it.  I wonder what we would think of the Danish Government if they were treating the farmers there in the same way as we are being treated by the crowd of gentlemen on the other side of the House who call themselves Ministers.</P>
    <P>This motion was tabled, not for the purpose, as the Minister stated, of asking some section of the community to carry a burden for the farmers, but to increase the output from every farm. Fianna Fáil have proved more conclusively than any other source, inside or outside this country, that agriculture is the basic industry of this country and will remain so.  It has taken them a long time but they are beginning to see that although they are not doing anything about it.  That being so, there is nothing wrong in trying to get the industry on its feet after the murderous blows it has sustained in the last 15 or 16 years.  The Minister may offer a view to-day and may come along with the relief that is asked for a few months later, as the Minister for Finance did in February last.  We are asking in this motion for relief of approximately £200,000.  The rateable valuation of farm buildings in this country is about £300,000.  £200,000 would be a very fair figure to take.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1888" /> The Minister was asked by Deputy Cogan to-day for the poor law valuation of the farm buildings in this country.  With all the staff at his disposal and all the machinery of Government, the Minister was unable to tell us.  He could tell us what is the poor law valuation of the land and all the buildings but, although they are taxing them very highly, he could not tell us the poor law valuation of the farm buildings.  A few men working for a few weeks in the valuation office ought to be able to provide that information.</P>
    <P>Out of the 380,000 farmsteads in this country there is scarcely one homestead where there are sufficient out-offices. The Minister has quoted Denmark as a country where they ran wild and sank a lot of capital into farm buildings.  I do not think any farmstead could have enough farm buildings.  It is absolutely necessary, and the Minister knows it, that, in the particularly wet climate of this country, crops, both hay and corn, should be housed.  In not one out of 50 cases is corn housed.  The corn is built in stacks with resultant loss in damage and waste.  The farmer has to take the threshing-machine on whatever day it comes and on wet days has to strip his stacks.  There is always a certain amount of damage.  There are tremendous losses in wheat, barley and oats.  The chief operations on any farm are the production of the crop and the harvesting and husbanding of it.  Owing to lack of buildings, the crop has to be stacked in the open. The cause is obvious.  We have in the rating of agricultural buildings a relic of the landlord system.  That question has been shelved in this country by two successive home Governments. Let the Minister say what he likes, the day will come when it will not be shelved.  He may not do anything about it but we will, or some other Party will.  It is part of the old landlord system under which when a farmer improved his land, by draining, fencing, or increasing the fertility, the landlord or his agent came along and doubled his rent.  If he improved his house by fitting a door or a window, he was taxed for his industry.  We have the very same system existing to-day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1889" /> The moment a farmer improves his farm, by adding a building, the reviser comes along and claps on an extra rate.  The result is that many farmers are thinking of diminishing the number of their farm buildings.  Last year there was a by-election in Kerry. While I was there, a farmer admitted to me that he had dismantled a building 45 ft. by 25 ft., simply because he could not pay the rates.  He admitted that his stock and equipment had to be left out in the open because he could not afford to pay the rates.  That is a nice state of affairs.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about a property class.  How many of the so-called property class are there in my county? How many are there in any county along the western seaboard from Donegal to Kerry?  Is the man of five or six acres of bog, or even 10 or 20 acres of bog, a property man?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>How many farm buildings would the man with 10 or 20 acres of bog build?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Take off the valuation, take away the fear of the reviser coming, and that man will build as much as he wants to house his crops, his farm equipment and his stock.  He is entitled to do that.  What right or authority has the Minister or his Government to put a brake on the activities of the farmer, as the landlord did in days gone by?  Have they no higher outlook, after 25 years of self-government, than to put a tax on the industry of the hardest working section of the community?  If that is their outlook, it is a poor one, of which they should be ashamed.  The Minister quoted from a book dealing with Denmark and gave us facts and figures.  I shall not go so far afield.  I will take the Report of the Committee of Inquiry on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy.  At page 220, the Report says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Housing for farm animals is both inadequate and unsuitable.  From the point of view of animal health, labour economy in feeding and milking, as well as in the interests of hygiene, new cow byres are necessary on the great majority of farms...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...It is being assumed, therefore, that new accommodation would <Col N="1890" /> need to be provided for 500,000 cattle.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, speaking of the pig population and the management of the pig industry the Report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To facilitate feeding and management, new pig houses would be a universal need.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In connection with poultry they say the very same.  For all this work they put down huge sums&mdash;for cow byres £30 millions, for the accommodation for the 500,000 cattle £3.5 millions, for proper pigsties, and so on, £15 millions, for proper poultry houses £10 millions.</P>
    <P>We do not propose to spend all that. No Government in this country could face the gigantic task of equipping every farm with proper housing accommodation.  All we ask is, take off the brake and the farmers will do the building themselves and will be only too glad to do it.  We have 380,000 farmsteads and we must take into account the loss through crops not being housed, the loss in tools and equipment and the biggest loss of all is that there is not enough stock housed during the winter to provide sufficient farmyard manure.  During the period of the war the principal difficulty in carrying out compulsory tillage was that there was not sufficient farmyard manure to treat one-tenth of the land.  In 99 per cent. of cases there were not sufficient buildings to accommodate enough stock to produce the manure.  It is very popular to call on the farmers to steal the fertility of the soil and convert it into food in times of emergency but we should take time by the forelock and ensure that that fertility will be restored before the occurrence of another emergency.  It is within our power to do that and it should be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very sympathetic with the taxpayers and the poor people of the towns and cities and the poor people of the country.  He wants to know where we propose to levy the extra taxation.  We do not propose to levy it anywhere because that is a matter for the Minister for Finance and the Government.  The Minister for Finance did not ask this House or Clann na Talmhan where he would get <Col N="1891" /> the £1,000,000 for derating, on the 8th May last.  When he wants to effect economies and taxation and so on, what does he do?  He reduces income-tax by one shilling in the pound.  He reduces petrol by a certain amount. In other words he took every care to safeguard the big man's income but I did not hear him say a word about reducing the tax on tobacco or on any of the ordinary commodities which go into the small man's household.  It is plain to see that the Minister cannot see any class at the present time or that he has no fear of any class but the big propertied class.  I assure him however that they are a very small crowd in the country as a whole.  No matter what the Minister may say about the motives of Clann na Talmhan in putting down this motion, we know the Minister's tactics and outlook.  I have heard some of his outbursts in this House on certain occasions and they were disgraceful. They certainly should not come from the Ministerial bench.  However, that is beside the point.</P>
    <P>The Government is about to establish two new Government Departments and the Minister tells us that there will not be any expansion or any extra cost involved.  I hold that there will be extra cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall make the best use I can of the three minutes.  I have not much interest in this question of assessing people's liability in regard to rates.  I think that is the responsibility of the Government.  It is purely, as the Minister put it a while ago, a question of taxing the food of the poor but if the farmer has to bear a burden&mdash;and I do not consider with all due respect to my friends here on my left that the rates on farm buildings are any big burden&mdash;under the Bill that has been guaranteed to this House by the Minister for Agriculture, a Bill for which I have been fighting for the last five years and which will establish a tribunal to fix prices for farms produce, <Col N="1893" /> we can bring up our costings before that tribunal and get our cost of production plus a reasonable profit, the same as every other section in the community, the same as every other industry.</P>
      <P>There were some remarks made in the course of the debate with which I should like to deal shortly.  The Minister spoke about a land tax in Denmark. The Minister is Minister for Local Government, and I happen to be chairman of a board of assistance down in County Cork which embraces Cork City and the rural community.  Hear what is happening there in regard to lifting the burden off the town and shifting it on to the shoulders of the rural community.  The rural population pays three-fourths of the total levy for home assistance in that area and the City of Cork one-fourth but, in the distribution of home assistance, the city gets three-fourths and the country boys get one-fourth.  That is the manner in which the game is worked to suit the plutocrats who pay income-tax and surtax in Cork City. The unfortunate farmers have to pay three-fourths of the home assistance distributed amongst the poor of that city.  I think that is one of the items the Minister might study if he thinks of levying a land tax such as they have in Denmark.  He will find that the two are very nearly related.</P>
      <P>We hear a lot about another matter to which the Minister alluded to-day&mdash; it seems to be a common practice all over the country&mdash;namely, the amount of money which the farmers have in the banks.  That is trotted out on every occasion but I would invite the Minister to go down the country and see how the farmer and his family eke out an existence.  Farmers' children generally are stopped from school at the age of 14, and they are brought into work on the land as unpaid labourers. They get their clothes, their bed and perhaps they get a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; on Sunday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall take the case of a farmer with four such boys who broke off from school at 14 years of age.  I often see the old lad shaking himself and saying: &ldquo;I will be soon getting the gorsoon of 45 married now.&rdquo;  I shall take the farmer with four sons who <Col N="1894" /> work from the age of 14 up to the age of 30 on his farm and I allow them £1 a week for their services.  The Minister would be rather surprised to know that that goes into what is known as the pool, to give a fortune to Mick or Thady or to provide them with some means of livelihood, but the Minister will hardly be surprised to hear that the total earnings of these four boys from the age of 14 until they reach the age of 30, at £1 per week, amounts to £3,328.  That is not the farmer's property. It is the property of his family who gave their unpaid labour during all these years in order to produce cheap food for the aristocrats of the country.</P>

      <P>I am rather glad that I gave way to Deputy Corry to the extent of a few minutes.  He has answered one point that was made against this motion, perhaps better than I could have done myself.  He has shown that this old cry of the farmers' money in the bank is a delusion and a fraud.  The exact figure of the total amount that farmers have in the banks has never been accurately ascertained or stated.  The deposits of business people in co-operative societies have been mixed up with the deposits of farmers.  In addition, Deputy Corry has shown that the so-called large deposits of the farmers in the banks are merely the hoarded earnings of the unpaid members of the farmers' families.  Undoubtedly, there are farmers of about 70 years of age&mdash;men who worked since they left school and never married&mdash;who have small deposits in the banks.  This is a cry which is frequently raised against the farmers and it is one which should be exposed on every possible occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's case against this motion was so pathetically weak that one felt that it would be almost unkind to refer to it at all.  King Brian Boru defeated the Danes at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014.  The Minister for Local Government thought fit to waste <Col N="1895" /> the time of this House carrying out some mopping-up operations.  His attack on the Danes is unworthy of a Minister in dealing with a friendly nation.  It would be amusing, if it were not so humiliating, to find a Minister of an Irish Government attacking the Danes because they sought to make a case for a better price for their produce in the British market.  That was the subject of the quotations and illustrations from the <i>Sunday Express</i> to which the Minister treated the House.  He was simply showing what efficient propagandists the Danes are when it comes to fighting for a better price for their agricultural produce and what a hopelessly incompetent Government we have which does not seek to obtain a better price for our produce in the British market.  Instead of learning a lesson from the progressive Danes, the Minister tried to bolster up a hopeless case.  The hopelessness of his case must be recognised when we remember that he did not deal with the main argument I advanced in support of this motion. He did not deal with the fact that the valuation of agriculture is excessive. I pointed out that it was right that every citizen and section of the community should contribute to the upkeep of the State and the local authorities, according to their means.  In introducing the motion, I pointed out that the farmers received one-third of the total national income while the valuation of agriculture is two-thirds of the total valuation of the State.  The Minister knows that there is no answer to those figures.  Because there is no answer to them, he roams over Europe and concentrates upon the unhappy Danes.  There may be something radically wrong in the State of Denmark but I think that the Minister for Local Government should be the last man in the world to undertake a remedy&mdash;the man who, on this motion, displayed a mentality so prejudiced, so biased and so muddled as to show that he is incapable of understanding a clear-cut and logical argument.</P>
    <P>The Minister spent some time quoting the views of some economist who said that the Danes had invested too much money in their agricultural buildings and out-offices.  Does the Minister and this so-called economist <Col N="1896" /> dare to suggest that agricultural economy in Denmark is inefficient because of the high standard of Danish agricultural buildings and equipment?  Does the Minister not realise that Danish output is more than double the output of the agricultural industry here?  Does he not think that the equipment and the facilities which the Danish farmers have secured, through the assistance and encouragement of an intelligent Government, have contributed in large measure to the efficiency of Danish agricultural economy?  The Minister should engage in a little more study before he sets out to oppose a motion of this kind.  There is nothing unfair or unjust in this proposal.  The arguments used by the Minister in regard to the shifting of the burden to other sections of the community were used by the Minister for Finance when we tabled a motion for the derating of agricultural land.  A few months later, the same Minister had to eat his words and provide £1,000,000 towards the derating of agricultural land.  He realised that the case we made was unanswerable.  When he consulted the people down the country, they made him realise that the case we had put up was unanswerable. When the Minister for Finance, who is perhaps a more intelligent man than the Minister for Local Government, goes down the country and consults the intelligent people of his constituency, or any other constituency, he will find that it is their verdict that the small concession we ask must be granted.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about this proposal as a bribe to the farming community. The Minister should be a good judge of bribes.  We all remember when the farmers were promised complete derating of agricultural land and buildings.  That was the promise made by Fianna Fáil when seeking office.  That was the bribe held out by them when the Minister was seeking his present position. That was a promise which was shamelessly broken, like many other promises.  The Minister should not have the audacity to come in here and taunt this Party with offering bribes to the farming community.  We offer <Col N="1897" /> no bribe to any section of the community. All we ask is fair and equitable distribution of the burden of <Col N="1898" /> taxation and this motion will be a step in that direction.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Compensation for Beet Growers&mdash;Adjournment Debate.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the House this afternoon, I asked the Minister for Agriculture:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whether, arising out of the strike at the sugar beet factories, it is proposed to compensate beet growers for losses and deterioration in their crops; and if he will advise farmers and growers of the terms of the compensation to be offered.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The question was a very straight one. In the Minister's absence, his colleague, the Minister for Finance, replied:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I understand that this question has been raised with Cólucht Siúicre Éireann by the Beet Growers' Association on behalf of the growers&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been compelled to raise this matter to-night because of the vital importance of this question to the beet growers.  There is not the least sign of a guarantee in the Minister's reply, nor is there any hope in it of compensation to the farmers for the loss of the beet crop, nor is there any information in the reply as to how they are to dispose of it.  Surely the Minister is aware that in 1945 there were 84,500 acres under sugar beet and in 1946, 78,200, showing a decrease of 6,300 <Col N="1899" /> acres.  Surely there would be no reason for that decrease if the farmers were not treated with the same contempt to-day as in the past.  If I am not very far out, there will be no beet whatever next year.  The farmer who would put it into the ground under present circumstances would be fit for a lunatic asylum.</P>
    <P>It was a crime and an offence if a certain amount of ground was not put under root crop.  In my part of the country beet is the principal root crop. If they did not sow it, they were branded as criminals and compelled to do so.  Now, when they have it ready to go into the factories, the conditions in the factories have resulted in the beet being left on their hands.  It has been pulled and crowned and left by the roadside to rot, or where it is available for all live stock to eat it; or it is on the railway station platforms, open to all kinds of weather.  Sugar is a necessity of life, and when the people were called upon by the Government to grow beet, the least they should be offered is a guarantee of some return for their sweat, their labour and their time.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Martin Corry is in the House, as he is chairman of the Beet Growers' Association.  If he is sincere&mdash;and I believe he is, where the interests of the beet growers are concerned&mdash;he will have the courage to stand up, if this treatment continues, and advise the farmers not to grow beet until they are guaranteed better conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>One condition of the Deputy's question is that they be compensated for loss&mdash;not general conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Every year these growers&mdash;who are not only big farmers, but cottage tenants, with cottage plots, in very many instances&mdash;ask the Land Commission not to press for the half-yearly annuity instalments until the beet cheques arrive, before Christmas or in January.  Yet you will see sugar beet allowed to rot in the fields, belonging to every beet grower in County Laoighis and Offaly and all over the country.  I asked the Minister a fair and straight question, and I hope he <Col N="1900" /> will be good enough to give a fair and straight answer here to-night.  In all sincerity, on behalf of the growers, I have raised this question here to-night, to find out what compensation will be given.</P>
      <P>This year, owing to the unfortunate weather conditions, the hay crop has been a complete failure.  Feeding stuffs are scarce and short and the beet pulp was always of very great assistance. How is live stock to be catered for in January, February and March?  There is a shortage of hay, of feeding stuffs, and now there will be a shortage of beet pulp, as the whole crop is lost.  I am sure the Minister realises the gravity of the situation.  It concerns every beet-grower, and I hope he will make a statement to the effect that their hard work, time and labour have not gone for nothing.  The price they are getting for beet does not meet the cost of catering for the crop.  They pay labour for pulling and crowning the beet and drawing it to the railway station.  I hope that this request will meet with sympathetic consideration and that the Minister will give the House information as to what the future for the crop this year is to be. That is the question on the lips of every farmer.  They are wondering what is to become of the beet and would welcome a statement, so that they may know exactly where they stand.</P>
      <P>The reply stated that the Beet Growers' Association were taking this matter up with the Sugar Company. That is a very vague reply.  The Minister is responsible for the Department of Agriculture and responsible for the appeal made to those farmers to grow beet.  He should know what the Sugar Company intend to do about it before this hour.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us if he has been in touch with Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, and what they are prepared to do?  Are they prepared to compensate the farmers and assist them in the very grave and serious situation that has arisen at the present time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to say anything further on the matter because I understand that Deputy Donnellan wishes to avail of a few moments of my time to speak on this very important motion. I hope the Minister will answer the points that I put to him to-day.  I <Col N="1901" /> pointed out that there was a decrease in beet production as between 1945 and 1946.  In my opinion the production will be less unless the farmer is catered for on a far more generous scale in the future.  Unless that is done, we will have no beet at all next year, and in my opinion the farmers would be right not to grow it.  That is the advice I would give them unless I can get some ray of hope from the Minister that the appalling, horrid and dreadful state of affairs that exists is going to be remedied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We want no interference from any Minister, as far as our business is concerned.  I say that, as representing the beet growers of the country. The question of an increased price, due to increased costs of production on this year's crop, the question of compensation for the deterioration of the beet due to the strike, and the question of compensation for the beet that remains on the farmers' hands&mdash;all these matters are at present being negotiated between the representatives of the Beet Growers' Association and the Sugar Company.  We want no interference. It is a matter purely between the elected representatives of the beet growers and the Sugar Company.  We do not want the taxpayers of the country to be burdened, nor do we want well-meaning persons to be running in <Col N="1902" /> and saying that the Government should do so-and-so.  It is a matter purely for the Sugar Company, and one that can very well be handled for the beet growers by the men whom they have elected to deal with it.  I deprecate interference by outsiders in a matter that is at present the subject of negotiation between the Sugar Company and the representatives of the growers.  Well-meaning individuals who interfere can do more harm than good.  It is this kind of jack-in-the-box jumping in, wherever one can see that one is going to collar a vote; this kind of manoeuvring that is responsible for the strike and for its continuance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of very grave concern for the farming community to have £3,000,000 worth of their property on their hands and to see it deteriorating every day.  That position is not going to be benefited by well-meaning individuals who jump in to give hope that the strike will be settled this week or next week. Neither are they going to help when they talk about the Government compensating the farmers.  This is a matter between the beet growers and the Sugar Company with whom they have contracts.  The interference of outsiders in this is to be deprecated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent I do not agree with the way in which Deputy Flanagan has approached this, and to a great extent I do not agree with certain things said by Deputy Corry.  I quite agree that the elected representatives of the Beet Growers' Association are doing their duty as best they can, but to my mind there is <Col N="1903" /> a feeling throughout the country, amongst the growers, that nothing is being done.  To a certain extent I congratulate Deputy Flanagan, because it is only right that the growers should know that there are people looking after their interests.  As I have said I agree that the Beet Growers' Association are doing that at the moment.</P>
      <P>What is the use in Deputy Corry saying that it is all a matter for the Sugar Company in view of the fact that when the growers approach the company they are told it is a matter for the Minister for Finance and the Government.  The Minister for Agriculture is the man on the spot, and it is up to him to see, regardless of the Sugar Company, the Beet Growers' Association or anybody else, that the raw material of £3,000,000 worth of very necessary food for the people is not allowed to rot on the roadside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that for the sake of catching votes.  That will not catch any votes for me.  The Minister's reply to-day was: &ldquo;it has nothing to do with me&rdquo;.  I think he should not have treated the matter in that way.  I say that it is up to him to deal with it since <Col N="1904" /> the Sugar Company is being subsidised by the Government.  I think I am right in saying that the Sugar Company depends on the Government, and that very often when the growers approached them their reply was: &ldquo;go to the Minister for Finance, that is his job&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister to hold out some hope to those people.  This very necessary food for the people should not be allowed to go to waste.  I will not go into the matter of the strike because it is not in the question.</P>
