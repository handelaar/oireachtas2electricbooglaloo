      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been called to a public statement, on behalf of the Dublin and District Sand and Heavy Haulage Contractor's Association, indicating that, because of lack of petrol, supplies of sand for building schemes may be cut off, and if he is prepared to make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen Press reports of a recent meeting of the association to which the Deputy refers but, otherwise, I am not aware of any public statement made on its behalf.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties of the petrol supply position, sand and gravel hauliers have received substantial allowances of petrol throughout the emergency and I am satisfied they have been equitably treated, having regard to the supplies available and the rights of other petrol users to a share of those supplies.</P>
      <P>There is no ground for the suggestion that supplies of sand to building schemes may be cut off because of lack of petrol for haulage.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Clare Phosphate Deposits.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether representations have reached him regarding the alleged proposal to suspend work on the phosphate deposits in County Clare; and, if so, what action, if any, he contemplates taking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>For some time past I have had under consideration the policy to be followed in regard to the Clare phosphate deposits when normal conditions of supply obtain, and other Government Departments concerned are being consulted.  No decision on the matter has yet been reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand that full working on the deposits will continue pending that decision or is there any proposal to restrict operations now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No decision on the matter has yet been reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been told by interested persons that operations on those deposits have already been reduced and that men are being dismissed. I wanted to inquire from the Minister if it was his policy to encourage full exploitation of the deposits for the present or if he had indicated that it is now a matter of indifference to him whether they are fully exploited or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to answer that question briefly.  In some areas, the deposits have been exhausted.  In any event, the extent to which it is possible to use Clare phosphate rock in an admixture with imported phosphate rock is determined by a number of circumstances.  It is not merely a matter of deciding the extent to which Clare phosphate rock will be used.  The quantity which can be used is dependent on productive capacity and the supply of imported rock available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it then that it is the mixing of the imported rock with the domestic rock creates one of the difficulties.  If that is so, will the Minister consider directing the manufacturers to manufacture two separate articles&mdash;(1) from the foreign rock and (2)  from the domestic rock&mdash;and requiring persons distributing that commodity to take a quota of each product&mdash;(1) the highly soluble foreign product and (2)  a fair proportion of the less soluble home product?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The superphosphate fertiliser which is being produced is of standard quality.  The Deputy may be assured that the full productive capacity of the undertaking is being utilised and will be utilised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was stated in the Clare newspapers that 150 persons who had been employed in mining those rock deposits had been paid off.  In view of the fact that the Minister does <Col N="565" /> not appear to have arrived at any definite decision as to the future of this phosphatic rock, will he arrange with the Mineral Company that the services of employees will not be dispensed with until such time as a definite decision will have been arrived at?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My information was that 350 men had been disemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of men employed must be determined by the operations of the company.  What has happened is that portion of the area in which rock was being quarried is exhausted.  There is no more rock and men cannot be employed if there is no work for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is alleged that work was discontinued precipitately and that men are now employed filling in the site on which they had been previously working for rock.  Will the Minister read the letter on the subject from the Bishop of Galway which appeared in, I think, last week's issue of the <i>Clare Champion,</i> in which he will see that grave fears are expressed as to the future of the Clare phosphate industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that, if men are engaged in clearing up the site, work was not stopped precipitately.</P>

      <P>A children's allowance in respect of the Butterly children was awarded to their father for the third payment period which ended on the 28th January, 1946.  On the qualifying date for the fourth payment period both parents of the Butterly children were dead.  A claim in respect of a child who has neither a parent nor a step-parent living can be maintained only by the head of the household of which such child is normally a resident <Col N="566" /> member.  Claims in respect of the Butterly children were decided on that basis for the fourth payment period.</P>

The special arrangements for assisting demobilised members of the Defence Forces to secure employment are dealt with in the White Paper on the Demobilisation and Resettlement of Members of the Forces, and the facilities indicated are available to all demobilised men irrespective of place of residence before enlistment.</P>

      <P>If I can submit facts to the Minister which go to show that a man normally resident in County Down left County Down at the beginning of the emergency for the purpose of offering his services to the National Army in Ireland and, on being discharged, was informed by the authorities in Northern Ireland that he would require a residence permit to return to his native place and that they will not vouchsafe one, will the Minister consider <Col N="567" /> taking special steps to accommodate persons who find themselves in that situation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>Surely the Minister recognises that a native of Dublin, Cork or Kerry has a natural background which he can fall back upon to secure employment on his discharge, apart altogether from the special measures for the relief and rehabilitation of discharged soldiers, but the fellow from County Down, whose very accent proclaims that he has no business or family associations with this part of the country, finds that the only assistance he can look to comes from the rehabilitation scheme to which the Minister has referred.  Persons normally resident in Northern Ireland are under a distinct advantage in that respect.  If I submit particulars of such cases to the Minister, perhaps he will look into them?</P>

      <P>During the emergency when there was a shortage of supplies and costs were subject to variation during the period of contracts, it was necessary to take powers by means of Emergency Powers Orders to allow variations in contract prices when increases were shown to have arisen in consequence of the European War.  By doing so contractors, who were appointed as official contractors to local authorities, had an assurance that their claims would be treated fairly and it was largely as a consequence of the action so taken that local bodies were enabled to obtain their proper share of supplies throughout the emergency.  My Department rendered valuable help to local bodies in this respect by determining variations in contract prices and assisting in the delivery of supplies which were urgently needed.  The position has not yet rectified itself sufficiently to warrant the dispensing of arrangements which were so successful during the emergency period.  It is, however, the intention to bring the provisions of the 1939 Act into operation as soon as the commodities required by local bodies are in regular supply and normal competition may be expected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall avail of the occasion of the Deputy's question to outline, very briefly, the arrangements regarding the Local Defence Force which have now been completed to give effect to the scheme which I outlined in a general way in a statement in the House on the 11th October last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Defence Force Regulations will be issued very shortly setting up, under the Defence Forces Acts, as a part of the Reserve and as from a current date a body to be known as the Local Defence Force.  The Government has, by Emergency Powers Order, altered the name of the present force with effect from the 1st instant to that of &ldquo;The Local Defence Force, 1941 to 1946&rdquo; and provided for the revocation of the Emergency Powers Order under which it is constituted with <Col N="573" /> effect from the 1st April next.  This arrangement in effect means that there will be two forces, the new&mdash;The Local Defence Force&mdash;and the old&mdash; The Local Defence Force, 1941 to 1946 &mdash;existing for approximately two months concurrently until the 1st April next when the old force will cease to exist.  Such an arrangement is necessary in order to facilitate the setting up of the new force and the recruitment into it of members of the old organisation who wish to continue.</P>
    <P>Certain members of the old force who held appointments of officer status therein up to the 1st November last and who have been approved by selection boards which have been operating for some time past, will be commissioned in the Reserve of Officers to serve in the new organisation. Prospective members for other than commissioned ranks will be required to enlist for a period of five years.</P>
    <P>The officers, in common with all other commissioned personnel of the Defence Forces, will have the right to tender the resignation of their commissions to the President but no machinery for resignation has been provided for other ranks.  I would like to make it clear, however, that training in the force is entirely voluntary; that there is no compulsion on a member to attend parades or annual camps and that provision is being made for the discharge, at the discretion of the officer commanding the command concerned, of a member who applies for discharge on compassionate grounds. Where a member who, without reasonable excuse, fails to attend the necessary number of parades, which consists of 24 parades of two hours' duration each, per year, his name merely will be placed on what will be called a noneffective list and he will be struck off the strength of his unit.  Unless he applies to have his name removed from that list to become again an active member&mdash;which request may be granted&mdash;no further action will be provided for.  In the event, however, of circumstances arising which would necessitate the calling out of the <Col N="574" /> Reserve on permanent service, he would be liable to be so called out.</P>
    <P>Provision has also been made in the regulations for the granting of permission to personnel to reside outside the country for periods, in the case of officers, up to nine months at a time, and, in the case of non-commissioned officers and men, up to six months at a time.  On return within these periods no question of reinstatement would arise, as the membership of the force of the individual concerned would not meanwhile have been affected.  The Deputy may take it that it will be the policy to facilitate as far as possible members who may find it necessary to leave the country for seasonal employment.</P>
    <P>I would like also to say that members of the old force who do not become members of the new organisation will be allowed to retain the boots and ground sheets issued to them as members. It will be necessary, however, for them to return all other articles of uniform, as it would be contrary to the best interests of the new force that there should be any possibility of the wearing in public of its uniform by persons who were not members and over whom no control in the matter could be exercised.  All concerned will, I am sure, in the circumstances, appreciate the necessity for this decision.</P>
    <P>Details of the conditions of enlistment and service in the new force are set out in the appropriate Defence Force regulation, copies of which will be laid on the Table of the House in due course.</P>

      <P>I should like to add that it is well to remember that, whilst we have a telephone trunk network of 21,000 miles, we require an increase of 12,000 miles to provide adequately for the present trunk traffic.  That is due, of course, to the emergency problem in the last six years.</P>

The circumstances prevailing during recent years as regards supplies of wire netting and of plants have greatly slowed up replanting operations.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state, in respect of each of the years 1932 to 1945 inclusive (a) the total area of arable land acquired for purposes of afforestation by the Forestry Division of his Department, and (b) the average price per acre paid for such land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The areas acquired for afforestation are not recorded as arable or non-arable but as plantable or unplantable.  With the exception of occasional areas required for nursery purposes, it is not the practice of the Forestry Division to acquire arable land.  Where an offer of land for sale to the Forestry Division includes any appreciable area of arable land, the matter is referred to the Land Commission to ascertain whether the arable portion is required for the relief of congestion, etc.</P>
      <P>It would be a matter of considerable difficulty to go over the details of every purchase of land made since 1932 to ascertain what small proportions of arable land (if any) are included in the annual totals and I do not think it would serve any useful purpose commensurate with the amount of work involved.</P>
      <P>The maximum price paid for forestry lands is £4 per acre and this may be taken as the price paid for any arable land coming into the hands of the Forestry Division.</P>

      <P>This provides for the deletion of sub-section (7) of Section 3.

    <P>This concerns a matter about which we had a lot of discussion here in this House, and that is the right of a customs officer to seize books.  We had the discussion again in the Seanad, and so I am providing that an officer of customs and excise shall not detain a book, not being merchandise, which is carried by or forms part of the personal luggage of an incoming traveller.

      <P>With regard to amendment No. 11, Sir, may I put a question to the Minister?  I found it rather difficult to follow him.  I understood him to say that the new provision is that an appeal in respect of a book at <Col N="588" /> present banned may only be brought within 12 months from the date of this coming into operation, but the Minister cannot appoint his appeal board until the Act comes into operation.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan) Seán Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to deal with all the sections of the Bill when I have dealt with the various irrelevancies of the Deputy and his colleagues on the opposite benches.  When the Dáil adjourned last evening, I was referring to certain remarks made by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Blowick in relation to the land war and the sacrifices made then.  I wanted to stress that the land war was won by the Irish people and not by any section of them, and that the sacrifices made were made by the Irish people and not by any section of them, because Deputy Blowick seemed to desire to claim a proprietary right for his various parties in the winning of the land war and an heirship more or less to the sacrifices that were made then.  The Irish people made the sacrifices and won for the occupying tenants of the land those benefits which Deputy Dillon waves like a banner from the opposite benches. The Irish people won the three F's, won security and independence for the occupying tenants of the land who had been subject to rack rent and indignity and who had been reduced to virtual serfdom on the land.  The three F's were won for those tenants who occupy those holdings and who not only occupy the holdings, but whose families had been rooted in the soil for generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy Dillon says about the three F's in regard to those tenants of the land war period is not at all applicable to allottees.  So far as they are concerned, the three F's are out of date.  As to fair rent, they are asked to pay what is, after all, only a very attenuated annuity, which is a purchase <Col N="591" /> annuity, and will end in the year on which the annuity expires and the land becomes their absolute property. They are given fixity of tenure.  The land is theirs for ever.  No one can disturb them, if they will face up to the written contract which they have signed with the Land Commission. Eventually these lands are vested in them and they can do what they like with them when they are vested.  The morning they are vested they can immediately put these lands on the market and sell them in the freest market in the world.  They are completely different from the tenants of the land war.  These are men who are beneficiaries, chosen arbitrarily by an independent tribunal, secure in its office, protected legally in its acts, independent of any Government or any political Party.  They are provided with a valuable gift of the most fundamental property in this State &mdash; the land of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick, the Leader of one of the Farmers' Parties, says that people are in a desperate plight for land.  That is true in the Deputy's constituency; I know it.  Is not that all the more reason for taking powers to dispossess those who have got a free gift from the State under a signed contract, if that contract is not carried out?  Deputies talk about the crowbar brigade and seem to be under the impression that the Minister and the Land Commission want to pursue every man who had got an allotment over all the years.  Deputies often complain in this House of the slow motion of the Land Commission, and in this particular case undoubtedly the Land Commission has acted very slowly, has given every opportunity to those tenants, will give them every opportunity and, in cases where non-fulfilment of the contract is due to disability, the Land Commission has never and will never take action against those people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon waves his hand benevolently over the Fine Gael benches and says: &ldquo;We, on this side of the House&rdquo;.  Deputy Mulcahy, the Leader of Fine Gael, looks for approval to <Col N="592" /> Deputy Dillon and says: &ldquo;We, on this side of the House&rdquo;.  Deputy Dillon complains very often that information is withheld from the House.  I think also that information is being withheld from the House.  In view of Deputy Mulcahy's statement and Deputy Dillon's statement, I think we are entitled to know if, during the Recess, there has been a coalition, if the Deputies opposite have all got together again and if the cloak of Deputy Dillon's benevolence extends to cover the orphans of the storm, the various Farmers' Parties in the Opposition Benches.</P>
    <P>I said last night that the business of the Opposition was to oppose, to prepare the way for the downfall of the existing Government.  That is the business of every Opposition.  They should use every legitimate means they have at their disposal to destroy the Government and get it out of office.  Pursuing that idea, which should be foremost in the minds of the Opposition, I think they should not only accept this measure but should urge the Government with all their powers to put it into effect immediately.  According to Deputy Giles, Deputy Cafferky and some other Deputies, the Government used the powers of the Land Commission corruptly to hand over a huge acreage of the land of the State to their own supporters and these are the people who have proved to be failures in working the land.  &ldquo;Those whom the gods are about to destroy, they first make mad.&rdquo; I suggest that Deputy Dillon should take full advantage of Fianna Fáil's insanity.  Fine Gael has no organisation&mdash;we are told that at the Fine Gael Árd-Fheis. Fianna Fáil has a magnificent organisation and now the Government, in its madness, proposes to sling out, neck and crop, all the Fianna Fáil supporters to whom they have given land everywhere in the country.  Is there a better method of disrupting an organisation, no matter how powerful, than the action Fianna Fáil is taking under this Bill, if what the Deputies say is true?  All the Deputies who object to having the present Government in power should utilise this measure for the purpose of smashing <Col N="593" /> the organisation that has put it into power.</P>
    <P>I said yesterday evening that there was no political interference of any kind with the Land Commission.  I said that it is a duty and privilege of Deputies of every Party to make representations to every Department of State and I insist very strongly that it is the duty of officials of every Department to take particular cognisance of the representations of Deputies, because they are the representatives of the people. I said&mdash;and again I say it&mdash;that there has been no political interference.  But Deputy Cafferky has repeated the statement that migrants from the West have been selected on purely political grounds.  There is no truth in the statement and if Deputy Cafferky or any other Deputy will bring to my notice any case of which he has knowledge, I can assure him that the matter will be rectified.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cafferky says that the Land Commission has in County Mayo 6,000 acres of land in its possession.  The Land Commission has not a shadow of desire to retain land, but land in the possession of the Land Commission is for the relief of congestion, particularly in the West.  We cannot try putting any immature scheme into operation, as we cannot stand over the idea of perpetuating the rundale system in the West, which is a great evil.  That is the reason we have to retain, over a certain period, a certain amount of land, so as to try to remedy that great economic evil in the West.  He also says that there is sufficient land in County Mayo to solve the problem of congestion there.  According to Deputy Giles, the supporters of Fianna Fáil are that very respectable portion of the community, the people of no property. Deputy Giles reminds me somewhat of Tennyson's farmer&mdash;the gentleman we know is well-off, he has very little use for the poor man.  If I have any pride in being a member of the Fianna Fáil organisation, it is because it stands for the man who has very little property, the ragamuffins of Fianna Fáil who never had any land, never had any property, never had any capacity. These are the men that Deputy Giles says are supporters of Fianna Fáil.  But <Col N="594" /> Deputy Commons, I think, showed to us a completely different picture: it was the immensely rich men who were backing Fianna Fáil, who were preventing the division of land and the relief of congestion.  I wonder which is right?  My predecessor in office&mdash;a tremendously able man, Deputy Patrick Hogan&mdash;pointed out that one of the great difficulties of the relief of congestion was that the land was in the wrong places and it was difficult to deal with it because of the conditions that obtained.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cafferky also talks about a five-year plan.  Deputy Blowick says &ldquo;Finish the job; take over the annuities for a couple of years and buy out all the land and straighten it out in a few years.&rdquo;  According to my reading of the newspapers, in some of the countries taken over by Russia they have solved the problem by an immediate division of land, but it has been a tremendous mess and no success. Deputies read the newspapers as well as I do.  The work of the Land Commission is necessarily slow and those who talk about taking over the land annuities and utilising them for the settlement of the land question have very little idea of the history of the land question in this country.  There will always be need for a tribunal like the Land Commission to deal with the question of land and we cannot solve the problem swiftly and easily.  Deputy Cafferky used the phrase, I was glad to hear, &ldquo;we are not land grabbers&rdquo;.  Deputy Dillon throws that vile and odious word very often at Fianna Fáil.  No matter how powerful a Government is, no matter what majority it has, it has always to take into its purview the question of public opinion.  Deputy Cafferky says that we are a very conservative people in regard to land.  Any Government or Land Commission that would do unorthodox things about land in this country would very soon hit the snag of public opinion, which is very powerful yet.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keyes raised a question about the allocation of land, and he suggested that the distance from an estate about to be divided should be <Col N="595" /> increased.  Since I came into this office I have consistently argued that the distance should be lessened.  I think the further away a man is from the land which he ultimately gets from the Land Commission, the less likely he is to make a success of his work.  I think the distance should be shortened rather than lengthened.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister want to make it less than half a mile?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think half a mile should be the outside.  The Deputy also suggested the setting up of a tribunal in relation to decisions about good husbandry.  His suggestion is that the county committees of agriculture should be the tribunal to make the decision.  I do not know, in my native County Limerick, what kind of people compose the county committee of agriculture; but I do know the men who compose the County Committee of Agriculture in County Cork.  Deputy Corry, whose faults are only an exaggeration of his virtues, is a member of the Cork County Committee of Agriculture, but I would not trust Deputy Corry to make a decision in regard to a matter of that sort.  Deputy Corry would argue&mdash;and he would believe in his argument&mdash;that no man who was not a supporter of his was capable of running a farm.  Deputy O'Driscoll is another member of the Cork County Committee of Agriculture. Deputy O'Driscoll would never believe that any man who was not a supporter of Deputy O'Driscoll&mdash;and he would quite honestly believe this&mdash;would be a suitable allottee of a Land Commission holding.  I know the Deputies' minds, and they are typical of the minds of members of county committees of agriculture generally, and, therefore, it would be useless to try to put that suggestion into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not an expert on rugby, but I remember Deputy Keyes was a very rough member of very virile roughnecks in Garryowen many years ago. Recently we had an international rugby match between France and Ireland.  It was not an Irishman or a Frenchman who was the referee.  We got a neutral referee, somebody who <Col N="596" /> was aloof from both countries, because no matter how honest or sportsmanlike a Frenchman or an Irishman might be, he would be always the object of suspicion.  The Land Commission has been compared here, by implication, I think, with the Irish Rugby Football Union.  In the newspapers recently there was a tremendous protest because the Irish Rugby Football Union has slung out on his ear the man that most rugbyites believe is the best three-quarter in Ireland.  Nobody has suggested that the powers of the Irish Rugby Football Union should be curbed no matter how much people may disagree with their decisions.  We are compared with a completely irresponsible body like the Irish Rugby Football Union.  They can do what they like with regard to putting men in or out.  We do not do that, and we cannot do that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Commons asked for certain figures.  These figures are available in the Land Commission Reports every year.  He referred also to a certain statement of mine made here some time before he came into the House. Deputy Dillon has been insisting on the three F's, and I agree with Deputy Dillon that the principle of the three F's must be maintained.  If a man who owns a piece of land cannot go into the market and sell that land, if he so desires, then it is not really his property.  If a farmer with three or four sons wishes to go into the market to purchase a holding for one of them, and if we take action to prevent that, then we shall do a tremendous wrong.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission has been set up to help people to do things and to secure things that they could not do or secure on their own strength.  But it would be far better for the country if we could do without the Land Commission, if the State had not to purchase land for division, if small farmers were in a position to buy holdings for themselves.  If we try to prevent farmers from buying holdings for their sons, if we try to prevent a man, who has earned the money hardly, from setting himself up as a farmer, then, I think, we would be doing wrong.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> Deputy Morrissey made a very sensible speech on this Bill.  He pointed out that the work of the Land Commission was not directed to the benefit of individuals as such, but was a great social, economic policy, intended to strengthen the social fabric of the State.  We in this country are believers in a wide distribution of private property, particularly private property in land, and the justification of the Land Commission is that they have made such an idea possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan said that this Bill was brought in hastily.  The Land Commission never acts in haste&mdash;that is the charge made against it time and again. The conditions which this Bill is brought forward to remedy have been under observation by the Land Commission for quite a long period, and many complaints have reached the Land Commission from all Parties that men have not been working the land and that the Land Commission has not taken powers to deal with them. Deputy Giles and Deputy O'Sullivan again stressed the idea of the possible dispossession of people who could not fulfil their contracts with the Land Commission because of disability. Again, I want to say that the Land Commission has never dispossessed, and does not propose to dispossess, any person who, through genuine disability, has been unable to fulfil his contract.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell makes very interesting speeches.  He is widely-read in history and general literature.  I am afraid his wide-reading has made a poet of him.  Every speech he makes here is a palindrome&mdash;it could usefully be recited backwards.</P>

      <P>I thought he said he was a member of no political Party. We will deal with the Farmers' Party then.  Deputy Cogan argued that the Land Commission had acted hastily.  It has not.  I was on this question of heroics.  Deputy Blowick, the leader of the Farmers' Party, has said that he and his Party would oppose everywhere in the country the operation of the Bill, if it becomes law.  Deputy Giles will go to Mountjoy and Deputy O'Donnell, a member of the Farmers' Party, will bring out the guns in Tipperary against it.  Now, I know what a four-flush is just as well as anybody else and I can see a &ldquo;busted&rdquo; flush a mile off.  We have this poignant picture of Deputy Giles in Mountjoy suffering for the Fianna Fáil supporters whom Fianna Fáil, in its madness, is ejecting, and the picture of Deputy Blowick mobilising his forces to prevent a statute from being put into operation and Deputy O'Donnell arming the serried hosts of Tipperary, as if Ballycohey was not ancient history.</P>
      <P>The very poignant picture is painted for us by Deputy Giles of the man with ten and 11 children being evicted by the crowbar brigade and a kind of sad picture painted for us by Deputy Dillon of this man with his 11 children leaving the home, in which he never lived, to go back to nurse his poor paralysed father.  I wonder is there any relationship between fecundity and paralysis? If there is, I see a tremendous danger to the Fianna Fáil Party.  We may hope to see coming here from the Fine Gael Ard Fheis large families of young, virile politicians to look at their paralysed progenitor, the Fine Gael Party; but, in actual fact, 2.8 is the average number of children in County Meath families and the deaths from paralysis and allied diseases in the whole Twenty-Six Counties last year were something around 2,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> I do not think there is any real definite colour or form in the picture which Deputy Giles and Deputy Dillon have painted for us.  The Deputies ranged over every particular point they could think of in relation to the land code and the land administration.  They roamed in the gloaming of their misconceptions about the Land Commission and the land code, and I had perforce to follow them.  Having done that, I want to say that I had hoped to speak here without insulting anybody, and I do think that, when a man gets up in this House and pokes a little gentle fun, the skin of politicians ought not to be so thin that it is penetrated immediately.  I give Deputy Dillon credit for having a very thick skin.</P>

      <P>Not in a million years, except with an atomic bomb.  Section 2 of the Bill provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Land Commission may, whenever and so often as they think fit, give a direction to the purchaser to reside continuously to their satisfaction in the dwellinghouse, as on and from such date (not being less than three months after the date of the direction) as the Land Commission think fit and specify in the direction until the holding or parcel is vested in him;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission selects an allottee and gives him a piece of land that may be worth £500&mdash;it may be worth £1,000&mdash;and builds, at the public expense, a house on that holding for the allottee.  Is it not reason and commonsense to say that not only the Land Commission should demand, but that the public should demand, that the man who gets that farm and house should live in the house?  The Land Commission inspector visits the house. He finds nobody living in it.  He finds the grass growing up to the door.  None of the people in the locality will give any public evidence in regard to non-occupation. That is understandable. The Land Commission will receive many anonymous letters in regard to non-occupation, but there is only one test and one piece of evidence and it is this: the Land Commission inspector <Col N="601" /> makes repeated visits, at different hours, in the hope of sometime finding the allottee living in the house.  Some of these houses are unoccupied.  Some of them are actually sub-let.  In the case of others, there is the pretence of occupation: a few chairs, a bed and a curtain.  But by adding to the administrative cost of the working of the Land Commission, an inspector makes repeated visits to the house and fails to find anybody in occupation. Where are we going to get a certificate of non-occupation, a satisfactory certificate, other than from the Land Commission through the work of their unbiased inspectors?</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  an agreement or undertaking to purchase a holding or parcel of land from the Land Commission, whether entered into before, on or after the operative date, contains a condition whereby the purchaser agrees not to sublet or part with possession of the holding or parcel or any part thereof until the holding or parcel is vested in him, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the purchaser makes, on or after the operative date and before the holding or parcel is vested in him, a letting in conacre or for the purposes of agistment or for the temporary depasturage or meadowing of the holding or parcel or any part thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello, above all Deputies, directed his mind to the terms of the Bill.  He pointed out, in regard to the contract, that the contract was void because of the existence of the Deasy Act of 1860.  I do not know how the conditions of 1860 would meet the situation of to-day, but I think the Deasy Act was directed towards a different situation altogether.  I have a note on Section 3 which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Though a letting of a holding or parcel in conacre or for agistment or depasturage does not in law constitute a breach of a condition in a purchase agreement against subletting or parting with the possession of a parcel or holding it has never been intended that land provided for allottees should be let in conacre, etc., and I have already <Col N="602" /> said that the policy of the Land Commission never envisaged a mere change-over from big landlordism to little landlordism, but was intended to put genuine working small farmers on the land.  I make no apology whatever for the section, although I admit that it alters the law in relation to these allottees in a purely technical way.  The letting in conacre year after year of a parcel is, in fact, indistinguishable from subletting, and the section merely makes the law accord with the realities of the position regarding the allottees use of their land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, because we believe in the wide distribution of personal property, particularly in land: because we believe, as I said before, it strengthens the social fabric of the country, we cannot permit any allottee to defeat the purposes of the various Acts.  If we are to take cognisance of the attitude of the courts to the existing law, we should have to admit that an allottee from year to year, continuously and for ever, could let all his land in conacre for the purposes of agistment or depasturage or meadowing.  A man may live here in Dublin for ever, for his whole lifetime, and hold an allotment from the Land Commission and during all that time he may never see the land, and yet his letting in conacre, or otherwise, is not regarded as a breach of the law or of the intentions of those who framed the law.  If there is a contravention in the contract of the Deasy Act of 1860, and if the law needs amendment, this is the Legislative Assembly which is entitled to amend the law.  The courts of this country are not a third legislative chamber.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where an agreement or undertaking to purchase a holding or parcel of land from the Land Commission, whether entered into before, on or after the operative date, contains a condition whereby the purchaser agrees to work the holding or parcel in accordance with proper methods of husbandry to the satisfaction of the Land Commission, a certificate under the common seal of <Col N="603" /> the Land Commission certifying that the purchaser has not so worked the holding or parcel shall be conclusive evidence for all purposes of the fact so certified.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I will not admit for a moment that this Dáil ever had the temerity to regard itself as a judicial body in that sense.  I have tremendous sympathy with the point of view of Deputy Costello.  I hear a good deal about bureaucracy and about centralisation. I know the evils of bureaucracy and of intensive centralisation and I should like that whatever democratic powers this State has should be preserved. If men, whether they are members of Fianna Fáil clubs, as alleged, or otherwise, have been given parcels of land and houses built on them in pursuance of a great social economic policy, and if they are not living in the houses, if they are not working the land, is there, on any side of the House, any defence for their action?  Must not the Land Commission or whoever deals with them get adequate powers so to deal with them?  This again, as I say, is not a punitive measure: it is a reform measure.  I am not wedded to the particular words that the section contains but I cannot find any other form of words which will give me the power needed to deal with them.  If Deputy Costello, as a brilliant lawyer and an ex-Attorney General, will give me a form of words that will meet the particular case and give me those powers&mdash;not even 100 per cent. &mdash;if I can get a 75 per cent. cure with the form of words to be given to me, possibly by Deputy Costello, I shall be glad to accept it.</P>

      <P>No.  I do not know if there was very severe criticism of Section 5 but this section is directed <Col N="604" /> really to secure rights of ownership and rights of devolution.  The devolution of parcels of unregistered land on the personal representatives of deceased allottees has never been questioned so far as the Land Commission are aware by anyone, lawyer or layman, and the Land Commission have acted on the assumption that these parcels of unregistered land did so descend, but recently a doubt arose in the minds of the commissioners' advisers as to whether the hitherto generally accepted view was correct and it was considered, in the general interest, advisable to put the matter beyond doubt.  I do not think it is contentious.</P>
      <P>Sections 6 and 7: A man has a holding of land.  It is uneconomic. The Land Commission gives him a further allotment of land to make his holding economic, for instance, to destroy rundale.  It does not propose to permit him to pass this on in a divided state.  The land given and the land he had must be kept together as an economic holding.  You would destroy the work and the purposes of the Land Commission if any other attitude were taken.  I think that is very reasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move, that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  In this Bill, the Army Pensions Bill, 1946, there are contained four proposals which may be described as &ldquo;major&rdquo; in that they immediately affect large groups of persons; four proposals which may be termed &ldquo;minor&rdquo;, because they will immediately affect only a few individuals, and two proposals which may be called &ldquo;administrative&rdquo; in that they are intended to achieve a more speedy and economical administration of the Army Pensions Acts.</P>
      <P>The major proposals are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  To provide an increase of pension for married men with children (Section 4).</P>
      <P>2.  To provide gratuities for persons who were partially dependent on deceased Army personnel (Section 10).</P>
      <P>3.  To provide pensions for persons who, on discharge, were suffering from tuberculosis aggravated by but not attributable to service in the forces (Section 12).</P>
      <P>4.  To extend the grant of special allowances to all persons who were awarded a medal for three months' continuous membership of the pre-Truce forces ending on the 11th July, 1921 (Section 14).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the first major proposal to increase the rates of pensions, I must recall that before the emergency the maximum basic pension for men was 26/- a week, with an extra 5/- if the man was married.  Under the 1943 <Col N="607" /> Act, this rate was increased for emergency personnel to 42/- a week, with an additional 10/- in the case of a married man.</P>
    <P>For officers the pre-emergency rate related the pension to a percentage of their pay.  That worked out favourably for the higher ranks but unfavourably for the lower because, for instance, the maximum basic pension for a second lieutenant was £109 and the minimum £87 a year.  The 1943 Act prescribed £120 a year as a minimum for all commissioned ranks and raised the married pension from £20 to £30 a year.</P>
    <P>When the 1943 Bill was before the House it was criticised on the grounds that the rates did not differentiate sufficiently between married men with and without children, and it was suggested that the money made available for the increase by the Government would have been better spent by making provision for the disabled man with children.  Recently the Government decided to make more money available for pensions and I have, therefore, decided to meet that criticism by using the money now made available to help those soldiers with families.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, in Section 4 proposes that the maximum basic pension should remain at 42/- a week for men, and that if the pensioner be married he should have a choice of either the old rate of 10/- a week, irrespective of children, or of a new rate of 7/6 a week for his wife and 4/- a week for each child.  For the married man without children it is obvious that the old rate is more favourable, but if he has even one child the new rate will be better by 1/6 a week, and by another 4/- a week for every child after the first. For the married officer without children or even with one child, it is also clear that the old rate is the more favourable, but if he has two children he will benefit under the new rate by £10 6s. a year and by £10 8s. a year for every child after the second.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives this choice of rates to every married person in receipt of an emergency period pension who was enlisted or commissioned before the passing of the Bill but not to those enlisted or commissioned thereafter, <Col N="608" /> and such persons will only be entitled to the new rate.</P>
    <P>The second major proposal covered by the Bill relates to the dependents of deceased Army personnel, that is dependents such as parents, grandparents, brothers or sisters as distinct from widows and orphans who are already provided for under the Act of 1927.  Here, therefore, we are dealing principally, though not exclusively, with the dependent relative of single men.  The Acts of 1923, 1927 and 1932 distinguish between total and partial dependency.  Where a person was wholly dependent on a deceased person an annual pension, technically called an &ldquo;allowance&rdquo;, was granted, but where the dependency fell short of total, it was deemed to be &ldquo;partial&rdquo; and a capital sum, called a &ldquo;gratuity&rdquo;, was payable.  The amount of the gratuity paid varied with the degree of dependency with the result that some dissatisfaction was caused by the award.  To get over this difficulty I decided in the 1943 Act to drop the term &ldquo;partial dependent&rdquo;, and to introduce a new category of dependency, called &ldquo;main dependency&rdquo;, which provided for a reduced annual allowance in such cases.  But unfortunately the plan did not work out in the manner hoped for.  We were advised that to establish main dependency a person's income from all sources should be less than the contribution made at the date of his death by the soldier to the dependent.  This had the effect of operating against the majority of claimants.  If there is evidence of any degree of dependency, then the dependent should be entitled to some compensation by reason of the soldier's death, and to provide such compensation there seems no alternative but to revert to the old scheme of gratuities. Section 10 of the Bill, accordingly, distinguishes between three types of dependency&mdash;whole, main and partial. For wholly dependents it provides an allowance of £52 a year in the case of a deceased officer and £25 a year in that of a deceased soldier, and there may be granted as many allowances as there are total dependents; for main dependents, the allowances will be the same, but there will be only one <Col N="609" /> allowance even if there are many main dependents; for partial dependents there will be a gratuity to one or more dependents but the gratuity or gratuities payable may not exceed in the aggregate a sum of £112 10s. 0d.</P>
    <P>The third major proposal deals with ex-members of the forces who were discharged suffering from tuberculosis but who failed to obtain a pension, because the disease was regarded by the Army Pensions Board as not being attributable to service.  The chief and the clearest problem here is that of tuberculosis. About 350 men have to date been discharged from the Army medically unfit suffering from one form or another of that dreadful disease, and about 260 have been awarded pensions, the remaining 90 failing because their condition was not regarded by the board as being attributable to service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The emergency.  This Bill deals with the emergency period. It may be urged that many of these men were physically fit when they joined the Army, and that, consequently, their condition on discharge must have been due to service.  But here we must remember that when these men were being recruited in 1940, the medical authorities had to examine the very large body of men who were responding to the national call.  They were, therefore, under considerable pressure, and apart from that they had not the necessary equipment to carry out final tests.  They had, therefore, perforce to rely on a general clinical examination, with the result that many men who were actually suffering from the disease were passed medically fit.  Whatever the explanation, the problem remains, and as far as tuberculosis is concerned we are making a genuine effort to deal with it in Section 12 of this Bill.  The rates of pension payable in such cases are those already provided by the 1937 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fourth major proposal of the Bill concerns the extension of special allowances.  The Act of 1943 dealt, for the first time, with the very special <Col N="610" /> problem of men and women who fought during Easter Week, 1916, and who are incapable of self-support by reason of age or permanent infirmity of mind or body.  It has been urged that a case exists, though not, perhaps, with the same degree of urgency, for the extension of this allowance to all persons in receipt of pensions under the 1924 and 1934 Acts.  Now, if the allowance be extended from the very special and restricted 1916 category of pensioner to the general Pre-True class, we shall have, at some stage, strong representations for the extension of the allowance to persons who can prove effective, though not pensionable, Pre-Truce service.  For that reason, the Government has decided to deal with the whole problem now, instead of doing so by stages, and, in reaching that decision, they were influenced by the fact that, under the 1924 Act, the Board of Assessors reported membership even when there was no active service and, therefore, no pension; while, under the 1934 Act, the Referee confined himself to the active service aspect exclusively, so that many members with good service, but short or active service, received no acknowledgment of the part they had rendered in the struggle.  The Bill, therefore, in Section 14, provides that the allowance may be granted to any person incapable of self-support by reason of age or permanent infirmity of body or mind who has been awarded a medal for continuous membership of three months ending on 11th July, 1921, of the various forces set out in the 1932 Act.  In other words, as the title for pensions, under the 1924 and 1934 Acts, is the possession of a military service certificate, so the title for a special allowance under the present Bill will be the possession of a medal. Hence, this proposal may, to a certain extent, solve the problem often raised in this House of doing something for men who are incapable of self-support and who are not in receipt of pensions, although they may have rendered good and efficient service to the country in the struggle for Independence.</P>
    <P>The proposal to make the qualification for a special allowance the possession <Col N="611" /> of a medal, rather than a military service certificate, would seem to be somewhat far-reaching.  I want, however, to assure the House that neither the allowance nor the medal will be given without clear recorded proof of service.  In the first place, both the 1916 medals and the medals with bars are issuable only on the basis of military service certificates granted by the Board of Assessors under the 1924 Act and the Referee, with the Advisory Committee, under that of 1934.  I can assure the House that the utmost care has been, and is being, exercised in the award of these medals, and, as a further precaution before any allowance may issue, this Bill provides that the evidence on which the medal was awarded may, in case of doubt, be reviewed. Again, in order to qualify, the applicant must be incapable of self-support by reason of age or of permanent infirmity of mind or body. That incapacity must be proved to the satisfaction of another statutory and, therefore, independent body, the Army Pensions Board.</P>
    <P>Coincident with these major proposals, we are extending the date of applications for would and for disability pensions, and for the dependents of deceased persons.  Under Section 8, the date for dependency applications will now be 12 months from the death of the soldier or before the 26th April, 1946, whichever is the later: that for wound pensions, under Section 11, will be 12 months from the date of the soldier's discharge or before the 26th April, 1946: and that for disability pensions, under Section 13, within four years of the soldier's discharge or before the 26th April, 1946.</P>
    <P>We now come to what I have called the &ldquo;minor&rdquo; proposals of the Bill which will immediately affect only individuals rather than groups.  The proposals are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  To abolish the restrictive clause of the 1923 Act whereby dependents of deceased pensioners cannot receive allowances unless the pensioner died within four years after receiving the would for which he obtained a pension.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="612" /> 2.  To provide that where a person received compensation in respect of death or injury independently of an award under the Army Pensions Acts, the Minister, in making such award, may take into consideration not only (as at present provided) compensation received before the award but also compensation received after the award had been made.</P>
    <P>3.  To abolish the restriction of the 1927 Act whereby a person who receives a would pension or gratuity under that Act may not receive another pension or gratuity in respect of another disablement contracted during the emergency.</P>
    <P>4.  To modify the restriction of the 1927 Act, as amended by the 1943 Act, whereby certain officers are deprived of a married pension because, for certain definite reasons outside their control, they ceased to draw lodging, fuel and light allowance immediately prior to their discharge.</P>
    <P>As regards the first minor proposal, the Act of 1923 provides allowances for the total dependents of deceased pensioners, subject to the condition that the pensioner died solely from the wound in respect of which he was in receipt of a pension and also subject to the restriction that death ensued within four years from the date of the wound.  In the 1927 Act and, later, in the 1932 Act, the condition remained but the restriction was removed, so that the dependents qualified under the 1927 and 1932 Acts no matter when the death occurred, provided it was due to the disablement for which the deceased had been receiving a pension. There is, therefore, a wide disparity between the provisions of the 1923 Act, on the one hand, and the 1927 and 1932 Acts, on the other, and a recent case has brought to notice the injustice of the restriction.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware, the case referred to is the only one involved at the moment.  There are, however, 49 pensioners under the 1923 Act similarly circumstanced, but as 34 of these have pensions based on a disablement of 50 per cent. or under and are not, therefore, likely to die solely from their <Col N="613" /> wounds, it is estimated that only about 15 will be affected in the course of time.</P>
    <P>Another minor proposal deals with the question of double compensation in respect of the same death or injury. Under the Act of 1923, if a person be entitled to a pension, allowance or gratuity under the Army Pensions Acts and if that person receives from an independent source compensation for the same death or injury, then the Minister, in fixing the amount of pension, allowance or gratuity, may take into consideration the compensation awarded.  If, for instance, a soldier in the course of his duty be involved in a motor accident and if he obtains damages against the owner of the vehicle, then such compensation may be taken into consideration when fixing the amount of his pension under the Army Pensions Acts.  What usually happens in practice is that the soldier's degree of disablement is first determined by the Army Pensions Board, but if the Department knows that a civil action is pending, it withholds the award of pension until the result of the suit is known.  If damages are awarded, it makes the award of the pension appropriate to the degree of disablement subject to the condition that it will not be payable until the amount of damages is worked off by reference to the assessed amount of the pension.  This position has obtained since the Acts began to operate, but recently we have been advised that as the Acts stand we may take such compensation into consideration before the grant is made, but if the pension, allowance or gratuity be awarded and paid before the compensation is awarded, then we cannot consider it or alter the grant in any way.  This leads to the anomaly that the claimant whose award of compensation is known beforehand suffers in comparison with the person who does not disclose that an action is pending or that compensation has been received.  The section, therefore, provides that, in making the award of pensions or allowances, the Minister may have regard to any compensation granted in respect of the same death or injury even if that compensation be granted after the award <Col N="614" /> of pension.  In other words it empowers the Minister to review his original award.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 7 deal with the same problem: that of the Army man who on discharge received a would pension or gratuity for disablement incurred during his service, and who, on subsequently re-enlisting during the emergency, contracted a fresh disablement. There are four such cases but only three have so far been investigated. In the first case, the ex-soldier had a small wound pension for a fracture of the right clavicle, and during his emergency service fractured his right elbow, so that his disability has increased from 20 per cent. to 60 per cent.  In the second case the soldier had received a small gratuity in respect of a gun-shot would in the left hand, but during his second period of service he contracted rheumatism so that his present disability is 100 per cent.  In the third case the soldier had also received a small gratuity for injuries to his right hand and during his second period of service he incurred a fracture of the left knee for which he is entitled to a pension.  Now in these three cases, the pension in respect of the second disablement cannot be paid because under Section 20 of the Act of 1927 no pension or gratuity could be granted to any person to whom a pension or gratuity had previously been granted.  This is obviously unjust, and it is due to the fact that the framers of the 1927 Act did not or could not contemplate the circumstances which have arisen during the last few years.  It dealt exclusively with peace-time contingencies and not with war-time emergencies.  Hence in Section 5 we are remedying the defect in the case where originally there was a wound pension in existence, and in Section 7 the other cases where a gratuity was originally granted.  The Bill provides that where an old wound pension exists it will merge in the new pension, and where a gratuity was received, if the fresh disablement be due to disease and reaches the minimum degree necessary, the man will receive a disability pension, and if the new disablement be due to a wound, the man will receive a wound pension <Col N="615" /> or a gratuity according to the degree of the disablement.</P>

      <P>A fourth minor proposal deals with the case of officers who, having been discharged medically unfit, obtain a personal pension but who, though married, cannot receive a married pension because of the technicality that, immediately before their discharge, they were not in occupation of married quarters or were not in receipt of lodging, fuel and light allowance.  This allowance ceases when an officer has been absent on sick leave or has been undergoing treatment for a period of 12 months.  After that time and for a further period of six months, he receives half his normal rate of pay without any allowance. Hence it can happen and, in fact, has actually happened that an officer is discharged after 18 months' sick absence and as he was not in receipt <Col N="616" /> of lodging, fuel and light allowance at the date of his discharge as required by Section 10 of the 1927 Act, as amended by the Act of 1943, he did get a personal pension but he was not entitled to a married pension.  This bears hard on the officer but it is still harder on his dependents because even if he died from the disease in respect of which he was drawing a pension his widow and orphans would not be entitled to any allowances under the Army Pensions Acts.</P>
      <P>It does seem unjust that both the officer and his dependents should be thus deprived because of a technicality in the Acts, and I am, therefore, in Section 6 of the Bill, remedying this defect.</P>
      <P>Finally, there remain two administration proposals introduced for the better and more expenditious administration of the Acts.  The first deals with the payment of travelling expenses and subsistence allowance to applicants under the Army Pensions Acts.  Section 21 of the Act of 1927 and Section 20 of the Act of 1932 restrict the payment of these expenses and allowances to claimants who attend before the Army Pensions Board in Dublin, because both Acts contemplated that all claimants would be examined by the board in Dublin.  Last year, however, as I have already informed the Dáil, I was forced in the interests of the many persons claiming under the 1943 Act to appoint pensions medical officers throughout the country so as to expedite the determination of claims and to overhaul the arrears of work before the board.  By means of these officers, we cleared up all claims outstanding in Cork, Limerick, Clare and Kerry, but we were unable technically to reimburse the expenses of the claimants. Section 9 has, therefore, been introduced to enable us to pay such expenses and thus to expedite the determination of the claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another proposal to speed up the administration of the Acts is contained in Section 15 of the Bill.  As the Acts stand at present, every application for a pension or gratuity, however unmeritorious on its face, must be referred to the Army Pensions Board, unless it is frivolous, <i>mala fide,</i> or <Col N="617" /> otherwise fradulent.  This means that many claims which do not fall within those three categories but which, nevertheless, have not <i>prima facie</i> any chance of succeeding must be referred to the board, and this, in turn, involved travelling expenses of the claimants, the cost of maintenance and investigation in hospital, and waste of time and energy by the medical officer concerned. In Section 10 of the Act of 1943 the Oireachtas empowered the Minister not to refer an application for an allowance to the board where he was of the opinion that the investigation by the board was not necessary for the purpose of enabling him to decide whether or not a grant should be made.  Hence all that is sought in this particular section is to extend similar powers to the Minister in claims for gratuities and pensions as distinct from dependents' allowances. The applicant will not be prejudiced by the proposal, because if he appeals his case will be sent to the board.  The powers sought will only be used in cases which have obviously no chance of succeeding, and, by not sending them forward, the board will be set free to deal more fully and expeditiously with the claims of genuine applicants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill, particularly as one who, for a considerable time, has advocated the provision of pensions for men who have had tuberculosis aggravated, excited, or in any way increased by Army service but which disease was not directly attributable to service during the emergency period.  The Minister was justified in bringing in this Bill to deal with that evil.  Deputies of every Party are familiar with the case of a soldier who had the misfortune to contract, say, a severe cold ten or 11 years ago, prior to the emergency, and who subsequently engaged in service, and later contracted tuberculosis.  In many of those cases, when the soldier <Col N="618" /> applied for the pension which was normally payable to ex-Army personnel, he found himself ineligible for a pension because of the fact that the tuberculosis was not contracted during the emergency period.  I think the Minister deserves the gratitude of the House for this amendment.  Very many soldiers are affected, and up to the present those unfortunate victims had no means of livelihood other than what they might get as outdoor relief. Of course, under the proposed Public Health Bill they would now be eligible for contributions from the rates, either directly or in the form of employment from the local authority.  Apparently, we either have a feast or a famine, because once this Bill goes through those men will automatically qualify for a pension.</P>
      <P>I imagine that the success of this Section 12 will depend largely on the sympathy with which the board approaches the examination of those cases.  It would appear to a layman, at any rate, that if a soldier got, say, pleurisy as far back as 1930, subsequently recovered and engaged in service, but later contracted tuberculosis, up to the present the disease would not have been attributable to emergency period service.  I hope that under the conditions which will prevail under this Act a soldier so affected will not need to have any doubt whatever about securing his pension.  Looking at the matter from the point of view of one who has no medical knowledge, I imagine that the sympathy with which the board will examine applications of that kind must largely govern, in certain border-line cases at any rate, the decision as to whether a soldier will get a pension or not.  In connection with Section 12 also I should like to ask the Minister if it will apply to a soldier who contracted tuberculosis prior to the emergency, and who was discharged prior to the emergency, or whether he would be already covered by the 1927 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to one other matter which is not in the Bill, but which, as it is a wide, amending Bill, might well be in it, and that is the question of a gratuity payable to the widow and <Col N="619" /> children of a deceased officer.  I raised this matter with the Minister some time ago and he said it was being considered. That comes under the 1937 pension scheme, and, as only a small number is affected by it, I should be glad if the Minister would expedite consideration of the matter, and would also ensure that it be retrospective.  As he is aware, under that scheme, unless an officer has retired before his death, his widow and children are ineligible for gratuity.  A number of officers found themselves in the unfortunate position that they were seriously ill, possibly on their death-beds, when they had presented to them for signature a form of resignation from the Army.  As the Minister is aware, the condition of people in that state is considerably aggravated by such procedure. It really amounts to putting a pistol to their heads.  I should be glad if the Minister would consider that matter.  I do not know whether, under this Bill, he proposes to amend that pension scheme.  It affects only a few. Of course, as time goes on, unless it is amended it will affect a greater number.  In fact, in the last 12 months, there were a few cases in which officers' widows and children were ineligible for the gratuity.</P>
    <P>Another favourable aspect of the Bill is the fact that it gives to officers and soldiers the right to choose whether they will opt to take the old marriage rate or the new.  I would again impress on the Minister the necessity for a sympathetic approach in the case of personnel suffering from tuberculosis.  Perhaps he would also tell us, when he is replying, the number of officers and men&mdash;irrespective of the emergency period&mdash;who have been affected by tuberculosis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with the Bill, I should like to call the attention of the Minister and his Department to the fact that a very desirable practice has grown up in this country, at least, in regard to other Departments, of giving an explanatory memorandum or having a White Paper circulated in conjunction with a Bill.  That makes life very much <Col N="620" /> easier for Deputies.  It is a practice which grew up first on the other side of the water, and it was found to be so successful and so popular that it was extended to all Bills.  Now, we got three or four Bills in our post last week: one of them was this Army Pensions Bill that we have before us, and three of them came from other Departments, which presumably were just as busy as the Department of Defence.  Each of the other Bills was accompanied by an explanatory memorandum, although in fact, I think that none of the other Bills was as difficult or as tedious to follow as this particular Bill.  This is a small Bill.  It does not claim to do a tremendous amount.  What it is doing, certainly, is beneficial and will be welcomed by every Deputy, but this small Bill either amends, extends or relates to seven other Army Pensions Acts.  Now, the fact that this the eighth Army Pensions Bill&mdash;and if you take in the Army Service Act and the other Army pensions scheme, this is the tenth, in 20 years, dealing with a tiny Army&mdash;is doing a lot of harm to Army interests, because the outsider, the man in the street, measures the volume and degree and extent of pensions by the multiplicity of Acts passed affecting that particular service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a little bit farcical when we consider that both the State and the Army have only just about come of age&mdash;they are just a little over 21 years old&mdash;that we should be handling at the moment our tenth pensions Bill for a force that in numbers would not equal half an average parish.  In addition, I may say that we have had, I think, 23 Defence Forces Bills.  Of course, it might be said that they are continuing Bills, but however that may be, I think it is about time that we got away from the introduction of a temporary Bill every year, and that it is about time that we got consolidated into one Act all these comparatively minor Army Pensions Acts.  Take the case of an ordinary Deputy who has to earn his livelihood, even though he may be a lawyer, he would find it very hard to study this Bill properly.  Put that Deputy face to face with this little Bill and say to him: &ldquo;Read that to-night&rdquo;, and he will find that he has <Col N="621" /> to delve back into seven other Acts dating back to 1923 before he can properly understand the contents of these four sheets of paper.  I think it would be better to bring in a comprehensive Act with amendments, and thus rescind all the previous Acts.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to the Bill itself, as I said earlier, I certainly welcome the new proposals contained in the Bill. It is an extension of allowances or pensions, and, in some cases, an extension of dates.  I tried, in reading this Bill&mdash;but I confess that it was only from recollection or memory&mdash;to get a picture of the pensionable position of members of our Defence Forces, and as far as I can piece together, from memory, the pension position from the first Act of 1923 to the one now before us, my view of the thing, which may be wrong, is that a soldier who is disabled as a result of a wound is definitely pensionable, no matter when he received the wound or when he was discharged; that a soldier disabled from disease is pensionable if that disease was acquired prior to the 1st October, 1924, or if that disease was acquired or aggravated by service subsequent to the 3rd September, 1939.  There is a lapse of some sixteen years during which if any soldier acquired a disease, became disabled from that disease and was discharged as a result of it, and if the disease was acquired subsequent to the 1st October, 1924, then as far as I can trust my recollection of the various Acts we have dealt with, that man's case is not covered except his disease was aggravated by service during the emergency.  I ask the Minister to correct me if I am wrong there.  If I am correct, then it shows a terribly serious omission: that we pension soldiers disabled from disease acquired prior to October, 1924; we pension soldiers disabled by disease subsequent to the 3rd September, 1939, and we accept no responsibility whatsoever for soldiers who were disabled or who died of a disease, which was attributable to service, between October, 1924, and September, 1939.  If I am correct, and if we are bringing in an Act to amend those previous Acts and to alter the dates contained in the previous Acts, then there is a glaring omission in this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> Now, I should like to get the Minister's direction with regard to soldiers suffering from tuberculosis or discharged because of tuberculosis attributable either to service or aggravated by service.  We are putting through another Bill in this House, and that other Bill provides for full pay and allowances for people suffering from infectious diseases including tuberculosis. At certain stages they will get full pay and allowances.  Am I to read into this section dealing with tuberculosis that that other Bill applies to everybody in this country except the soldier, and that the soldier is going to get somewhat worse treatment than every other individual in this country? I presume that the rights of pension given for partial disablement as a result of tuberculosis are not as big as full pay and allowances.  If that is correct, then we are discriminating in a very peculiar manner and in a very unjust manner against the man who developed tuberculosis in Army service, as compared with the man who developed the disease behind the shop counter, or out in the fields, or in a factory.  If we are doing that, then instead of giving anything by this Bill, we are taking away from the individual soldier who is suffering from that particular disease.</P>
    <P>Now, I believe&mdash;and I say this in no critical or controversial manner at all&mdash; that very many and continuing injustices are being done in the handling and assessment of claims put forward by disabled soldiers, whether the disability was due to wounds or disease. Very unsatisfactory verdicts are very frequently given, verdicts that on their face at least any medical man, reading the claim, sizing up the evidence, would disagree with.  I believe that such verdicts are being given because every individual member of the board is doing his work too well and too honestly.  That is a peculiar thing to say.  But how is the board constituted? It is a board of three persons.  One of them is a medical man, nominated by the Minister for Defence, with no restrictions or reservations.  It is more or less obviously his duty to see that the claimant gets a fair crack of the whip.  Professionally, he will do his <Col N="623" /> work honestly, but he is there to look after the ex-soldier.  There are two other members of the board.  One of the other members is also a doctor. But there is a difference when you come to the second man&mdash;he can only be appointed by the approval of the Minister for Finance.  That does not apply to the first man.  Then, when you come to the third man, the man whom you may regard as the Referee, he again can only be appointed by the approval of the Minister for Finance. In practice, it amounts to two watchdogs on behalf of Finance, and one with regard to the Army.</P>
    <P>That is the view I take of it, and it is certainly an explanation for the very unsatisfactory decisions that every one of us, as Deputies, handles from time to time.  There may be some other explanation.  But every one of us is coming in contact with cases, or our attention is being called to cases in which most of us are thoroughly dissatisfied with the verdicts given.  It may be that the dice is loaded in the manner I say, or there may be some other explanation.  But one thing is certain, that there is a growing need and there has been a growing need in this country for the past 18 or 19 years for some such Department as exists in other countries under the name of Soldier's Friend Office.  Elsewhere, if a man feels he has a grievance, that he has not got justice, that his claim has not been very fully explored, that the verdict is an unsatisfactory one, there is a State Department, a State-paid officer with a staff to whom he can go, who looks into the case and, if he thinks the ex-soldier has not got simple justice, he has the right, over the head of the board and everybody else, to bring the case directly under the Minister's notice, and the Minister very frequently reopens the case and sends it for review.</P>
    <P>The very form that a man has got to fill up if he is claiming a pension in this or in most other countries is entirely too intricate, too detailed, and too definite for the ordinary ex-soldier. He is not trained to know what is of importance or not in filling up the claim, and some Department, such as <Col N="624" /> exists elsewhere, is unquestionably desirable.  It is not a very big office, and it is not a very expensive project. But, from my own knowledge in the Minister's Department, I know that such an office is required.  When I was Director of Medical Services in the Army, I spent one-quarter of my time getting reviewed by the Minister unsatisfactory and unjust decisions with regard to disabled claimants.  In most of the cases reopened and reviewed, the verdict was reversed, and the applicant got his pension.  I remember one case of an officer who was dying of tuberculosis in a workhouse in South Africa, and it was turned down as not being attributable to service.  Although it was no part of my duty, and I could have been reprimanded for butting in on such matters, I consistently and regularly did it.  In that particular case I was able to show that, out of some 14 officers and nurses who had carried out duty in that particular post, seven or nine of them had gone down with tuberculosis.  The decision was reversed and that man died in comparative comfort rather than in absolute destitution.  I do not intend to mention them here in public, but I can recollect dozens of cases which, by that kind of officious interference, I got reopened and the decisions reversed.</P>
    <P>Since my time everything in the Army has become more militarily efficient, more highly regimented. Nobody can go outside of his own Department and butt into another person's Department.  But there is nobody pressing or bringing to the Minister's notice for review, for reference back, cases where unsatisfactory or apparently unsatisfactory findings have been arrived at.  Officers, agents, functionaries of one kind or another, are being appointed in this country <i>ad lib.</i>  Money is being spent very freely in and by all the Departments. That modest office is surely an office that is well overdue.  If it was for nothing else than to prevent being made the type of speech I am making, it would be worth the money expended upon it, because, if there was such a tribunal there, with such an officer and <Col N="625" /> such a staff to handle the assessments, to refer a case to the Minister if it struck them that it was a case which should be reviewed, then we would be perfectly satisfied with that tribunal and with the Minister reviewing the case later on.</P>
    <P>It may be said that every case comes up before the Minister.  Of course it does.  It comes before the Minister with a verdict.  But, when cases are referred back to him a second time, with somebody pointing out that there is something further to be looked into, that there is apparently an unjust decision, then the very same Minister or any Minister would ensure that there was a review and that the decisions were reversed.  I think it is a terrible thing to think that there is even one person disabled in the service of the country, crippled to a high degree in health, directly as a result of that service, who is not receiving an adequate or reasonable or just pension under any or all of our pensions schemes.  Speaking conscientiously, as a person with a certain connection with that class of work in the Department of Defence, I assure the Minister that there are very many cases of unsatisfactory verdicts.  I am not criticising the way in which any individual did his work, but I am urging that a small Department of State, a soldiers' friend department, be set up to assist those unfortunate men in filling up their claims or, where that special department considers an injustice has been done, to act further by having the right to place the verdict directly before the Minister and ask for a review.  We all would be perfectly satisfied with the result of such a review.</P>
    <P>I do not like the constitution of a board dealing with the result of disease and disabilities, where there are two doctors and a layman.  Speaking from a professional point of view and certainly not in any offensive way, I would say you have the most ignorant of the three deciding the case, when the two doctors divide and take opposite views on a professional matter, on a matter of the physical condition of some organ of a person's body.  The layman, who does not <Col N="626" /> claim to have any expert medical knowledge, is the deciding man in such a case.  If there is to be a board of three, there should be a medical officer, appointed by the Minister for Defence, a second medical officer appointed, perhaps, by the Department of Finance, and a medical chairman appointed by some neutral association such as the Medical Association of Ireland.  Then there would be two medical opinions and no quarrelling with regard to the results.</P>
    <P>My view with regard to this Bill is that it is well conceived, generous and a step in the right direction.  However, if my conception of the gap between October, 1924, and 3rd September, 1939, is correct, then there is scope in the Bill, by amendment, to extend the previous Acts, so as to cover the cases where disease is acquired to a certain degree of disablement between those two dates and men were discharged from the Army prior to the 3rd September, 1939.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister and the Department on having the courage to bring it forward so quickly after the emergency.  In principle, it deals with cases of soldiers who incurred tuberculosis during service or had it aggravated by service and it is necessary to make immediate provision for them. We heard various complaints here from time to time about soldiers discharged from the Army suffering from tuberculosis and thrown on the rates, unemployed and destitute.  Deputies throughout the country know that representations were made to them on various occasions by such persons.  It is a source of great satisfaction to us now to see that that matter is being dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were also some men discharged from the Army suffering from cardiac disease.  Many of the older men rushed into the Army to give service when the emergency was declared.  After periods of strenuous training and manoeuvres, many of them were found to be suffering from cardiac disease and had to be discharged, and no provision was made for them.  I think the Minister should look into such cases.  Though at an advanced age, they were physically fit <Col N="627" /> on entering the Army, and therefore they deserve some consideration.</P>
    <P>Section 2 certainly remedies a great injustice.  The 1923 Act contained a proviso that, unless a man died within four years of receiving his wound, his dependents would not benefit.  That is not contained in the other Acts and it is certainly right and just that it should be removed from the 1923 Act.  There is a similar provision in all the Acts under which in the case of the death of an old I.R.A. man, a man with pre-Truce or post-Truce service, in receipt of a wound pension, his widow or family can be provided for only if he was married before he was wounded. The number of such men in receipt of wound pensions under all the Acts is about 1,000 and the number likely to die at this stage solely from the wound in respect of which the pension was granted is very small.  I would ask the Minister to consider whether, in justice, he should not also remove that clause and fix some reasonable date, before which a man in receipt of a wound pension should have been married. There are different dates in different Acts.  For instance, in the case of the death of a man in receipt of a disease pension, his widow and family can benefit only if he were married before the 1st October, 1928.  There is a fixed date which should be extended.  Disease takes some time to show itself and takes some time to kill a man.  Those two points I have mentioned should be dealt with in some reasonable way, to meet the very few cases which are likely to arise.</P>
    <P>Section 14 is certainly generous&mdash; most generous.  This section provides that any man or woman who holds a medal in respect of pre-Truce service in the forces will, if he or she becomes destitute by reason of infirmity or age, receive, if single, a pension of £78 per annum.  That means that if he holds a medal in respect of continuous membership during the period of three months ending on 11th July, 1921, he does not require to have a service certificate.  If he has a medal certifying membership, plus the usual service required for membership, he will, if he is destitute by reason of infirmity or <Col N="628" /> age, receive a pension of £78 per annum, if he is single; if married, he will receive a pension of £97 10s. per annum.  If he has a family under 16 years of age, the children will each get an allowance of £10 8s. per annum. That is undoubtedly the most generous provision that any Government could bring in to definitely ensure that any person who gave service to this country pre-Truce will not die destitute if he or she is infirm or incapacitated by old age.</P>

      <P>This legislation will ensure that that cannot happen again.  We have listened here for many years to complaints about inadequate treatment for these people. I made many complaints myself and Deputies on all sides of the House have made representations in connection with this matter.  We should be all very glad that our complaints were not made in vain.  We found the Minister ready and willing at all times to listen to us and now he has provided this very generous section.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that it is a laborious job for any layman to read all the Acts mentioned here and to try to interpret all the different amendments to the different Acts.  It would be very desirable if we could have one Act which would include them all and which could be read easily and interpreted by any Deputy.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister not to spoil a good job.  This Bill will be welcomed generally.  Some legislation along these lines was badly required.  As a matter of fact, this legislation is something that might be described as long overdue.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister should endeavour to make this Act the final one and, in that connection, it might be well to make the addition to Section 2 that has been suggested.  Under that section, as it stands, the number likely to benefit would be about 15. Of the 1,000 at the moment in receipt of these pensions, the number likely to die solely from wounds is so small that the Minister would be well advised to include them in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="629" /> From the point of view of the old I.R.A., this is a generous Bill.  It is generous also from the point of view of the Army and of the men affected by the 1923 Act.  I welcome it very heartily and I ask the Minister seriously to consider the points I have made with regard to the amendment of Section 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there will be general agreement that this is a very technical Bill and it is exceedingly difficult for the ordinary Deputy to see the Bill properly in perspective without reference to the variety of Acts amended by it.  Even then one may get a picture of this Bill which is not a true reflex of what the Bill is intended to contain.  I suggest to the Minister that if he has to come here again with Bills of this character he might, as Deputy O'Higgins suggested, emulate the example of other Departments and give us a White Paper which will explain the provisions of the measure.  The White Paper would be cheaper, because we then would not require a whole lot of wet towels endeavouring to find out what the Bill contains.  I venture to suggest that even the Minister, if he had not the benefit of highly technical advice, would find himself in difficulties trying to relate the provisions of the Bill to the various parent Acts and he would have some trouble in explaining what it will mean for the people who will benefit under its provisions.</P>
      <P>I should like to get some information on a number of matters.  Could the Minister tell us what number of claims for disability pensions has been received and at what rate are those claims being dealt with?  I know from experience that it is a rather slow process to get a decision from the Army authorities on a disability pension claim.  If you get a reply quickly it will mean you are getting nothing, but if the claim has any merit it seems to be a particularly tedious job to convince the board that there are merits in the applicant's case.  I shall be glad if the Minister will give us some indication of the number of claims received and the rate at which they are being disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> I think it is essential in the case of claims for disability pensions that an effort should be made to speed up decisions.  Many of the men discharged from the Army on medical grounds are usually in a physically imperfect state. At a time when it is difficult for a physically perfect man to secure employment, it is particularly difficult for a physically imperfect man to secure employment, with the result that a claimant for a disability pension is usually unemployed and his state of distress and impecuniosity is not made easier by the fact that he has to wait for a long period for a decision on his pension application.  Where the claimant is a married man with dependent children, his position is still worse, and I therefore ask the Minister, who, I know, has considerable personal sympathy in this matter, to do whatever is necessary and possible to speed up the adjudication on claims for disability pensions, particularly when they come from persons whose state of health is such that they cannot take up employmen and who, for one reason or another, are unemployed at the time their applications for pensions are submitted.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy T. O'Sullivan in welcoming the provisions in Section 14 which, I think, is probably the most useful section in the Bill and which will remove a very serious blot on our Army pensions legislation to-day.  We all know cases of old I.R.A. men, those who served pre-Truce, who during the past 25 years have been forced by economic circumstances here to emigrate.  We know of others who, through economic pressure at home, found it extremely difficult to keep the wolf from the door.  We know of unfortunate persons who were compelled to go into the county homes and spend the remaining years of their lives in these institutions, getting relief only when death claims them.  Many of these had no pensions whatever and others had such beggarly pensions that they provided no sustenance for them.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has seen fit to extend to pre-Truce I.R.A. men, those who gave three months' service <Col N="631" /> up to 11th April, 1921, the special scheme of allowances provided in the 1943 Act in respect of persons with 1916 service.  We can now be sure that those who served in the pre-Truce I.R.A. need not die penniless in the workhouses.  That, too often, has been the destiny of Irish soldiers.  We can now by the provisions of Section 14 ensure that old I.R.A. men, who, through ill-health, infirmity or economic adversity are reduced to a condition in which they are unable to provide for themselves, will get the scale of pensions provided in the 1943 Act for those who, up to now, could get it only if they had 1916 service.</P>
    <P>That is a very substantial advance on previous Army pensions legislation, and I am sure that not only will it be welcomed by those concerned but by the nation, as it ought to be, and, I am sure, will be welcomed by this House which is the product of the service and sacrifice of these men and by nationalist Ireland, because I feel sure that all Parties in this House are anxious to ensure that those who made these sacrifices and rendered this service should be treated decently by the State in the winter of their lives.  I am glad that the Minister has seen fit to incorporate this provision.  It will provide some solace for persons who, without the section, might have to look forward to an extremely bleak old age.</P>
    <P>A new section, Section 12, finds its place in the Bill relating to the cases of persons suffering from tuberculosis. The Minister will probably agree&mdash;the section is an admission that he does agree&mdash;that previously it was extremely difficult for a person suffering from tuberculosis on discharge from the Army to establish that he was entitled to the pension under the Army Pensions Act, because the legislation was so construed that the person concerned usually found it very difficult to show that his disability arose out of and was aggravated by his service.  The Minister is now easing the position in respect of discharge as a result of tuberculosis, but I think that even the easement provided in Section 12 can still give rise to considerable difficulties for applicants for pensions who are suffering from tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="632" /> The section provides that such persons, at the date of examination by the Army Pensions Board, must be suffering from a disablement not being less in degree than 80 per cent. due to tuberculosis aggravated, accelerated or excited by a wound attributable to service and received during the emergency, a disease attributable to service during the emergency or service in the forces during the emergency.  In the case of persons discharged from the Army suffering from tuberculosis, the very fact that a man has been discharged with that disease is itself a pretty severe shock to the man, and it is extremely difficult for persons suffering from tuberculosis to display that amount of energy necessary to get and to retain employment, so that the unfortunate soldier discharged and certified as suffering from tuberculosis, first, finds himself certified as suffering from what is generally regarded as a very grave disease, and, secondly, knows that his chances of getting and retaining employment are extremely poor.  If his discomfiture is to be aggravated by the fact that he has to go through a sieve to satisfy an Army Medical Board that he really has the degree of disability necessary to obtain a pension, one can understand his state of mental anguish.</P>
    <P>In other spheres and realms of activity in this country there is an awakening recognition that we must make war on tuberculosis in every possible way, and there is a widening disposition to recognise that there must be generous treatment in the form of maintenance for persons who are the victims of tuberculosis.  I suggest that, in that respect, the Army has a contribution to make, which can best be made by treating in a generous way, in an understanding and humane way, applicants for pensions who are suffering from tuberculosis, and that the State ought to recognise, in respect of soldiers discharged suffering from tuberculosis, that it has not a mere responsibility to work out a decision with machine-like precision but an obligation to ensure that the soldier is regarded as a human being, with a wife and children to maintain, and that he is precipitated into a world suffering from a disease which is at once a <Col N="633" /> handicap in the matter of obtaining employment.</P>
    <P>If it is established that he is suffering from tuberculosis, the Army pensions machinery ought to lean on the side of treating him as sympathetically as possible in respect of his disability and of recognising that, having served the State in the Defence Forces, a situation should not be created in which it can be said that a man was discharged from the Army suffering from tuberculosis and that he got no pension for his service in the Army.  I am sure that everybody would prefer that, so far as the administration of the Army pensions machinery is concerned, it should err on the side of generosity, even on the side of a tolerable, understanding extravagance in respect of claims for pensions from the victims of tuberculosis, rather than that it should operate with machine-like precision.  Its operation in the latter sense might result in considerable hardship being inflicted on those who served in the Army.</P>
    <P>So far as the general provisions of the Bill are concerned, I welcome them personally and on behalf of this Party. I said at the outset that this was a highly technical Bill.  When you multiply it by all the other Bills which have been introduced, and you then try to look up Defence Force Regulation No. so-and-so and get the various documents before you, you find yourself in a forest of pension legislation, so that it is not easy to see in what direction you should look for information.</P>

      <P>It is even worse than that.  The Minister might also give consideration to the fact that this Army pensions legislation has now become a rather tangled mass of pretty technical legislation.  In order to elucidate the position, so far at least as Deputies are concerned, the Minister might endeavour to produce a leaflet giving the main outlines of Army pensions legislation.  We can get them fairly clearly enough so far as service pensions are concerned, but the Minister <Col N="634" /> might endeavour to give us the legislation so far as it affects disability pensions and time expired persons, and set out for us what the position is in respect of persons who have had periods of less than 21 years' service. If the Minister were to give us the broad outlines of the provisions of existing legislation under these heads, I think he would be doing a very useful service for members of the House who are interested in this matter.  By giving them some informed opinion on the legislation which, paradoxically enough, they have passed, he might, at the same time, be able to give to the persons concerned some better understanding of their rights and something more hopeful to look forward to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of this Party, I should like to express approval of this Bill.  It is gratifying to see that an attempt is being made now to remove some of the grievances which exist both in respect of the men who gave their services for the freedom of this country, and of those who gave their services during the emergency. In common with other Deputies, I have received a good number of complaints from men who were discharged from the Army during the emergency as being medically unfit, of men who were certified to be suffering from tuberculosis, and failed to establish their case for a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the provisions in Section 12 are generous.  Like Deputy Norton, I feel that 80 per cent. disablement is difficult to establish in all cases.  There is no doubt but that men who have been discharged from the Army suffering from tuberculosis find it extremely difficult to obtain employment. Some of those men have been discharged for a number of years. During that period they have been unemployed during practically the whole time, and have thereby suffered grave hardship.  It is extremely doubtful if a person suffering from 75 per cent. disablement is in a position to obtain satisfactory employment.  While the provisions for those suffering from 80 per cent. disablement are generous, I think that something should be done <Col N="635" /> for those whose infection is not so great.  It might be possible, too, I suggest, to do something for men who joined during the emergency, and after a comparatively short period of service were discharged as being medically unfit, and have now almost recovered their health.  Those men, as a result of volunteering for service in the State, lost their health and their employment, and have since suffered considerable hardship.  Even though their health has now been almost completely restored, it must be remembered that they have made a very severe sacrifice owing to the fact that, due to their short period of service, they did not qualify for any gratuity worth mentioning.</P>
    <P>As regards tuberculosis in the Army, I have the feeling, which the Minister may be able to confirm or disprove, that Army service is conducive to tuberculosis.  At any rate, the statistics will show that the number of men in the Army suffering from the disease, or who have had to be discharged from the Army owing to the disease, is much greater than the number in the corresponding age groups in other occupations. This may be due, to a considerable extent, to the service which they had to give, to the strenuous nature of Army manoeuvres, and so forth.  I may be in conflict with medical opinion in saying that, and may be speaking out of the depths of my ignorance in regard to medical matters when I express the opinion that tuberculosis is caused mainly by exposure to infection.  Take the case of a man who goes into the Army.  He may be billeted in the same room with a man who, perhaps, is suffering from the disease, and, as a result of that close contact, contracts the disease.</P>
    <P>I think that far-reaching precautions should be taken to examine men, from the health point of view, on joining the Army.  The fact that a man is billeted with another man suffering from the disease renders him more likely to contract the disease than if, say, he were living in his own home. Personally, I am of the opinion that tuberculosis is caused mainly by exposure to infection.  This is proved <Col N="636" /> by the fact that we find that quite a number of people contract the disease from their close contact with some member of their families who is suffering from it.  For these reasons, I hope that the precautions which I suggest should be put into operation.  I join with all the other Deputies in welcoming the Bill.  It will be rather pleasant for Deputies and others to know that a very large number of deserving men can now feel that they have not been unfairly treated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to join with the members of all Parties in the House who have given a welcome to this Bill.  I regard it as a splendid gesture of goodwill which is characteristic of the Minister and of the Government in their desire to do justice to those who were wounded or disabled, or in other ways made sacrifices in the cause of national freedom. It goes a long way towards removing many injustices.  But there is one blot on the measure and I would appeal to the Minister and to the Government, in their generosity, to do their best to remove that defect.  I advocate no new principle because the principle is already incorporated in a previous measure.  I refer to the extension of pensions, in a limited way, to the widows and families of those who died as a result of wounds or disability incurred by reason of the sacrifices they made and the discomforts and trials they endured.  Under existing legislation&mdash;and this new Bill makes no further provision&mdash;if a soldier, volunteer or old I.R.A. man, who was not married before 1928, happens to die, leaving a young and helpless family, no provision can be made for the family.  While one such case of outstanding hardship or apparent injustice remains in any district, it is a reflection on the comrades of the man who has died, a defect in the ameliorative legislature and a reproach to the Legislature.  I would ask the Minister to extend the date, 1928, to a far later date because, as Deputies are already aware, those who from 1916 to 1924 devoted all their efforts to the achievement of freedom for this country and took all the risks attendant on that great cause, were, in 1928, unable to settle down and get <Col N="637" /> married.  In most cases they had no steady employment and, certainly, during the years they spent on national service they had not the necessary finance to enable them to take on the responsibilities of establishing a home.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I appeal to the Minister &mdash;I know his sympathies in the matter and I am sure he will reconsider it&mdash; to ensure that men who were unable to marry until a later stage in their lives should have this provision extended to them.  The fact that a man received a wound or suffered disability is no reason why the further sacrifice should be imposed upon him that he should not found a home of his own, that he should remain for the rest of his life in isolation, dependent on his relatives and friends, living with them, perhaps, and seeking whatever comforts the world otherwise would give him.</P>
      <P>That is the one defect in the Bill. In trying to remedy it, the Minister would have the sympathy of all sides of the House.  This Bill will, perhaps, end, once and for all, the many measures that had to be introduced to deal with various aspects of cases as they appeared from time to time.  I again welcome the general provisions of the Bill and, in particular, the extension of the provision, that was formerly granted to the 1916 men, to those who have certain service certificates or medals of membership which show that they served the cause of freedom.  They were all comrades.  This Bill goes a long way to provide for them in various ways and if the further extension that I recommend is made I am sure the last cause for serious complaint will have been removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the Deputies on all sides of the House in congratulating the Minister on the introduction of this measure and, particularly, that portion of the Bill which will bring the 1923 Act into line with subsequent Acts, in so far as it relates to dependents of old I.R.A. men who died as a result of wounds prior to the passage of those Acts.  I also welcome that portion of the Bill whereby the Minister intends to make a serious effort to deal fairly and justly with men discharged from the Army <Col N="638" /> suffering from tuberculosis contracted as a result of service.</P>
      <P>I should like to add my appeal to that made by Deputy T. O'Sullivan and Deputy McCarthy and to ask the Minister to reconsider the position in the case of a man who is in receipt of a wounds pension, who is a married man with a number of dependents and who dies as a result of wounds but, because he was not married before he received the wounds, his dependents are not provided for.  A similar position obtains in the case of a man who received a pension in respect of disease contracted while on service. If a man who is in receipt of a disability pension is married and has a family, unless he contracted the marriage before the 1st October, 1928, his dependents are not entitled to a pension.  Like Deputy McCarthy, I think that date is far too early.  I maintain that it should not be mandatory, in the case of a man who received a wound in attempting to obtain the freedom of this country, that, for his dependents to qualify for a pension, he should have been married before the 1st October, 1928, and that otherwise his dependents will not receive the necessary help from the State that they should receive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A man who received a wound between say 1916 and 1921, who was in receipt of a wound pension, and possibly was anxious to marry, but happened to be that type of individual who visualised the responsibility of doing so, might be influenced by the fact that, after a certain number of years of married life, when perhaps there were a number of children in his family, if he died his widow and children would be thrown on the rates. Perhaps a man in that position if he visualised his responsibility would not marry.  A man who was prepared to risk his life in the struggle for the attainment of the freedom of this country, might have received a wound which would obtain him a pension, under conditions which would compel him to remain a Benedict.  The same thing applies as far as disability pensions are concerned.  I join with Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy McCarthy in appealing to the Minister <Col N="639" /> to hold that wound pensions should not depend on the fact that a man had received a wound before his marriage. Neither should a disability pension be withheld from dependents following death.  The date there should be extended to a later period.  As Deputy O'Sullivan stated, the Minister has been generous in Section 14 and we all appreciate it.  We appreciate the fact that that section recognises the services of the old I.R.A., or those who can claim service in the I.R.A. Under the section, if a man who became a member of the I.R.A. on April 1st, 1921, had continuous service until July 11th, 1921, he qualified for a service medal and he automatically comes under the section.  That is a recognition of service in the I.R.A.</P>
    <P>I should like, however, to point out what I consider to be an injustice that still remains.  Going back to 1916, there were in the brigade to which I was attached a number of men who claimed 1916 service, who were out during Easter Week, but, unfortunately, were not able to prove the necessary qualifying service, and, therefore, did not receive a service certificate or the 1916 medal.  There are only a few such men.  It may be argued that they could have continued their service, and that if they had subsequent service, as far as the tan war is concerned, or even in the civil war period, they would qualify.  In 1916 a certain number of men were old in years, but they had a good national spirit, and were prepared to take their chance.  They did so in Enniscorthy. Some of them were arrested, but even that fact did not qualify them for the 1916 service certificate.  Some of them were even sent to England, but that did not qualify them.  In later years, during the tan war, not through any want of spirit on their part, but because they were getting on in years, they could not claim service with the I.R.A.  These men are few in numbers and I maintain that, when they were prepared to risk their lives in 1916, they are as much entitled to the benefit of Section 14 of this Bill as those members of the I.R.A. who, perhaps, joined on the 31st March, 1921, and had service to July 11th, 1921, and qualified.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> I ask the Minister to weigh the position of both types of men and the value of the services they gave.  I do not wish to decry in any way men who came in on March 31st, 1921.  I think any man who did so was a good man, but men who were prepared to go out in 1916 and take their chance and who, through no fault of their own, did not qualify for a service certificate, should be brought under Section 14 by some method.  Between this and the Report Stage I ask the Minister to give the matter consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his opening statement, said that 350 men in the Army were found to be unfit because they suffered from tuberculosis and that 260 had got pensions.  I wonder if those who are in their graves are included.  Young men, married and single, went into the Army after being passed as medically fit by the Army authorities but, after a year or two, some were found to be medically unfit. I raised the matter in this House during another debate.  Some of these men, before they were discharged, had to sign a form to the effect that they would not claim anything against the State.  I think that is the greatest injustice of all, because, when these men went into the Army, they were fit.  When discharged they were told that they had not contracted the disease in the Army.  That is surely wrong.  Either that or the doctor who passed them as fit on entry must have been wrong.  A case was raised in this House by the late Deputy Corish, in June, 1945, relative to John J. Breen, 12 Macken Street, Wexford.  He had been a member of the voluntary Defence Force and was discharged as medically unfit.  Here is what Deputy Corish said, in part:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I came across a case in Wexford recently of a man who joined the Maritime Inscription Corps on the 6th November, 1942.  When on manoeuvres, in May, 1944, he met with an accident which resulted in a compound fracture of the right leg. He was in hospital until July 7, 1944, and on crutches until December 5, of the same year.  He was out of work during that period and received no wages.  He has been offered 10/6 a <Col N="641" /> week to cover the period from 13th January, 1945, to 31st August, 1947. This man had a good deal of expense following the accident, and I cannot understand how the Department came to the decision to pay him only 10/6 a week from January, 1945, seeing that the accident occurred as far back as May, 1944.  Why is the period to the 13th January disregarded? This man was not eligible for work owing to the accident he met with on manoeuvres.  I wish the Minister would give some idea of Government policy in cases of this kind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was in contact with the Minister myself on behalf of the widows of soldiers who are not in receipt of the full widows' pension.  They are getting a pension of only 5/-.  The Minister regretted that nothing could be done in their case.  I hope that this Bill will serve the interests of widows and children of men who died from tuberculosis after leaving the Army.  Some of them, from my own county, died in sanatoria and their widows and children are dependent on home assistance.  That is a great injustice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan referred to the 1916 men.  At the last by-election in Wexford, the men with genuine records who took their stand in 1916 had something to say to the people by whom they were let down.  Men who took no part in 1916 but who came out to fight one another in the civil war got pensions simply because they belonged to a political Party, while others who went out in 1916 in the City of Dublin and Wexford were less fortunate.  I tabled question on behalf of some of these men who were the first to wear the uniform of the Volunteers and who were turned down as persons to whom the Act did not apply.  This Bill will require to effect considerable alterations in order to bring in those people.  I knew some of the 1916 men who died in the county home in my county.  They had a pension of 3/6 a week and, if they had to go to the labour exchange, that sum was deducted from them.  Others who were &ldquo;well in&rdquo; with the officers got through.  If you did not agree with the officers, you were turned down even <Col N="642" /> if you were the best man in Ireland. If they had anything against you or did not see eye to eye with you, they would not give you a reference.  They turned down some of the best of men. Enniscorthy and Dublin were the two main centres in the insurrection.  Some men and women who took their part then and who were in jail for months, with consequent loss of health, have to live on home assistance to-day. When some of these 1916 men died, the funeral expenses were not met by the authorities although the green, white and orange flag was placed on their coffins and shots were fired over their graves.  The widows and children were left on the waves of the world and had to depend on home assistance. Probably, the by-elections did good. They are waking things up and I trust that all these wrongs and injustices to <i>bona fide</i> persons will be rectified in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other members who have welcomed this Bill, especially Section 12 which deals with tubercular affections.  On that, I want to ask the Minister a question: Would it be correct to say that provision is made in this Bill for the widow and children of an individual discharged from the Army who subsequently dies, as distinct from the provision made under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act?  Happily, very few persons will come into that category but even if only one person was affected, there would be justification for covering the case in the Bill.  I had a case of that type in mind and I should like to know whether it is covered.  I associate myself with the plea made in connection with widows and dependents of officers who die in the service. I know of recent cases where officers died in the service and their dependents, being deprived by Army regulations of the gratuity which would otherwise be payable, found themselves in distressed circumstances.  I believe that the Minister will be sympathetic to a relaxation of the regulations in that respect and will consider cases such as that in which resignation forms are tendered to an individual who may be on the point of death.  That is obviously distressing, not only to <Col N="643" /> the individual, who is signing his own death warrant, but to his relatives as well.</P>
      <P>Since this is an Army Pensions Bill, perhaps the Ceann Comhairle will permit me to refer to a matter which might, perhaps, have been more relevant to the 1945 Act.  The Act dealing with the Connaught Rangers provided for an abatement of pension in the case of persons in Government service. That abatement operates up to date, while relief has been afforded men serving in the Army to the extent, I understand, of complete remission up to £250.  Only about a dozen individuals are affected, and I bring the matter to the Minister's notice in the hope that, if not now, in the near future, he will give attention to it.</P>

      <P>I cannot add much to the debate on this Bill, seeing that members seem to be unanimously in favour of it.  One thing which I should like to mention goes to the form of the Bill rather than to the substance. Deputy Norton referred to the difficulty which Deputies have in understanding the provisions of such a Bill.  The same thing occurred to myself.  Whatever about the question of an explanatory paper, Deputies are confronted with a grave difficulty when sections are framed in the way in which Section 11 of this Bill is framed.  It is, of course, from a legal point of view perfectly adequate but it makes it difficult for Deputies, who have to handle a number of these Bills in rapid succession, to appreciate the effect of a measure when they are simply told that something in a section of another Act is being deleted and that something else is being substituted instead.  That involves a regular piece of research and makes it very difficult for people who believe that they are to secure certain rights under the Bill to determine what these rights are.  Even trained lawyers whose business it is to make research into Acts of this nature, find it extremely difficult, especially when a whole code is built up, as a whole code is being built up, in reference to military pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not go into Committee points at this stage, but I would respectfully <Col N="644" /> suggest to the Minister that it would be preferable, taking Section 11 as an example&mdash;and the remark applies to other sections also&mdash;that instead of presenting it as it reads here&mdash;&ldquo;Subsection (1) of Section 11 of the Act of 1937 is hereby amended by the substitution for the words &lsquo;twelve months after the date of the passing of this Act of the words and figures `before the 26th day of April, 1946&rsquo;.&rdquo;&mdash;to take the relevant section of the 1937 Act and reprint it <i>in toto</i> with the amendments made.  It would only mean a little extra paper and then the section repealed could appear in the Schedule of Repeals.  I would suggest to the Minister that that would be a much more suitable way of amending a provision like that and then we should know what we were talking about.  I admit that my remarks do not apply with quite the same force to sub-section (5) of Section 12.  There it simply says that certain sections will apply in respect of pensions under the section.  There you have simply to read up the sections named, but in the case of a section such as Section 11&mdash;and there are others in the Bill&mdash;I suggest to the Minister that it would be an improvement if legislation were presented to the House in the way I suggest.</P>
    <P>As regards the remaining provisions of the Bill I have very little to add. These provisions do represent an advance although the Bill does not cater completely for the problems in respect of Army pensions that are outstanding, particularly with regard to what are regarded as normal pensions. This deals with disability pensions and it is an improvement and an advance that is welcomed generally.</P>
    <P>In connection with Section 12, I should like to say that cases have come to our notice of people who have been genuinely knocked up with tuberculosis but in a way that cannot be directly linked up with the present provisions.  These men are often destitute. During my short time in the House, I have had experience of a few cases of that sort.  I think that a sympathetic administration of the provisions of Section 12 should cater for these cases and that, I think, is certainly <Col N="645" /> a very fine provision on the part of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The only point that arises is that in the administration of these Acts we should bear in mind the circumstances under which men contracted these diseases.  It was not a case of normal ordinary State service.  I am referring now to men who gave service during the emergency since 1939.  It was not simply a case of ordinary service. It was a case where there was real danger to the country, where people took risks and joined the Army and in which the members of the Army took abnormal risks both to their health and to their circumstances of life, certain risks to their own financial circumstances.  There was a risk on their side and, of course, also a risk, it must be realised, on the part of the authorities.  The authorities had to risk exposing people because of that danger.  If we cast our minds back to that time, I think the country will have been prepared to pay for that risk as the people were prepared to pay for other things.  It was in circumstances such as those that these men were disabled and for that reason I think I am justified in recommending to the Minister a somewhat more liberal interpretation in regard to these claims.  Shall I say a little more sympathetic consideration of the provisions of the Bill in regard to these men than might be warranted in the ordinary routine cases of State service under normal conditions?</P>
    <P>Other matters to which I should like to refer would probably arise more appropriately on the Committee Stage but there is one matter which I almost forgot.  There have been cases &mdash;and this refers particularly to old I.R.A. men&mdash;from time to time, where men have been excluded from the benefits of earlier pensions Acts by failure to comply with some technicality in regard to dates.  Of course the legal view and the normal view&mdash; and the Minister can take no other view&mdash;is that there must be some rule if these Acts are to be properly administered. One rule must be to have a date within which all applications must be made, otherwise you cannot administer the Act.  On the other <Col N="646" /> hand, I have come across at least one case where people have claimed for disability arising from service which, if submitted in time, would have secured them the benefits of the earlier Acts.  In fact, they failed to comply with the time requirement; they were late.  In these cases, however, application was not made more or less from patriotic motives.  The man felt that he would carry on and it was only after a certain time had expired that the disability came against him and prevented him earning a wage.  I should like to see some type of provision inserted in the Bill that would enable the Minister to have some discretion in cases of that kind.  I know at least one genuine case of the kind which has occurred.  Other points which I should like to raise are more appropriate, as I say, to the Committee Stage and I shall not take up the time of the House in discussing them at any length here.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to dwell at any great length on this Bill but the first thing I must say about it is to repeat what other Deputies have said, that it is a very complicated Bill.  To peruse and understand it fully is a job that would strain the mind of any Deputy in this House.  There are sections in it that we all welcome, especially those whose object it is to provide better treatment for the old I.R.A. men who gave service in times gone by. We must all admit that were it not for the sacrifices made by these men from 1916 onwards we would have no freedom and, I suppose, no Parliament here to-day.  I am glad to see that even at this late stage&mdash;and it is a bit late; but better late than never&mdash;that some consideration is being given to them and that increased benefits and gratuities will be granted in certain cases to some of these individuals.  I find that in my area&mdash;and other Deputies have made the same remark in regard to their districts&mdash;that a slight technicality in the making of an application has frequently cut out an applicant and has deprived him of privileges to which he was entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Complaints have been made to me that, when junior officers and ordinary <Col N="647" /> volunteers approached their senior officers, those senior officers were a bit slow in making the right and proper recommendations. However, although the scheme will be criticised&mdash;and there is no doubt that it deserves a certain amount of criticism&mdash;this Bill, which provides for people who have been wounded, and for the dependents of those who have died of wounds, must also get the praise which it deserves. In the world to-day there are so many wounded and war-weary soldiers, and so many nations have on their hands ex-servicemen who have been wounded, nerve-wrecked and shell-shocked, that we should be proud to be able to provide at least for those who have lost their health in the service of our own country.  We were fortunate enough to avoid being forced into open battle, which would have left us with a larger number to provide for.  At the present moment, the Irish people are inclined to look at the word &ldquo;pension&rdquo; with a certain amount of disfavour.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Government gave pensions to a certain number of their own followers.  Then the Fianna Fáil Government came along and gave pensions to a certain number of their followers.  There is another section who, having followed one Party or the other, think that they deserve a pension too.  Those people are inclined to grumble and say: &ldquo;We did as much as so-and-so, but, because of the attitude of such-and-such an officer whose leanings were towards such a Party, our claims have not been allowed.&rdquo; Therefore, when this Act comes into operation, I should like the Minister to see to it that there is a thorough reexamination of all genuine cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <P>The Deputy is aware that this Bill deals with disability, and not with the general question of pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of applications for disability pensions, too, I hope the Minister will see to it that those who think they have a genuine claim will receive consideration.  On the other hand, it is desirable that the bill which will be presented to the <Col N="648" /> people should be kept down to the minimum because, unfortunately, when the burden of taxation is already so high, the people will look on a pension scheme as adding to that burden.  That may be a narrow-minded view, but we must all agree that that is so.</P>
      <P>I know one case in which a young man who was discharged from the Army because he was medically unfit did not ask for a pension.  All he asked was that he be afforded a chance to earn his livelihood by being allowed a permit to drive a hackney vehicle. Yesterday, I was in touch with the Department of Supplies and found that he had been refused that permit on the grounds that he was discharged from the Army prior to the date which would entitle him to that concession. I would ask the Minister to take the broad view in regard to all those matters, and to do his best to satisfy those who feel that they have a genuine grievance.  I hope all those who claim disability pensions, and those who have been disbanded from the Army as being medically unfit, will get the consideration they deserve.  In the case of the old members of the I.R.A., the Bill may be regarded as having come 20 years too late, but it is better that it should come now than not at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to offer my regrets that a White Paper was not issued in respect of this Bill.  If the matter had been brought to my attention after the Bill was issued, I might, if time allowed, have endeavoured to accede to that request.  Secondly, I want to say that I sympathise with every Deputy who has had to wrestle with this Bill, which in the main is a Bill by reference.  I can assure you that it has caused me much more perturbation than it has caused to any other Deputy in the House.  Deputy Norton asked about wet towels.  Well, I will not say that I had wet towels around my head, but perhaps I might have liked to have had them when endeavouring to elucidate some of the points of reference in this particular Bill.  However, I want to say this, and I am sure the House realises it just as well as I do&mdash;Deputy de Valera, <Col N="649" /> who himself is a trained lawyer, will agree with me&mdash;that when we issue what we think we require, we use the form which the ordinary man in the street uses; that is, we put it into the language used by the ordinary man in the street to convey his thoughts to his fellow-man.  But the lawyer, of course, has a different outlook on the matter. He wants to secure beyond yea or nay that what he puts into the Bill can be interpreted only in a certain fashion. That fashion is a principle which, I suppose, is embodied in all legal interpretations of language.  So I just want to say, without wishing to run away from my responsibilities, that the matter of the drafting of a Bill is something which neither the Minister nor the Department has any responsibility for, after they have given what they think they require to the Parliamentary draftsman.</P>
      <P>With regard to the statement which I made here in the initial stages of this debate, we went into the composition of that statement at very great length, and we went to very great pains to have it made as clear as it could possibly be made so that Deputies, when they would be referring to it later on in the Official Debates, would have little or no difficulty in interpreting the Bill in the simple language in which we ourselves would have liked to have put it. So I can only suggest to the members of the House that if they refer to the Official Debates when they are issued in the course of a couple of days, they will have there a clear exposition of this piece of legislation, which will, perhaps, be even more valuable from the point of view of information than the White Paper itself would have been.  I know that the White Paper would have been more valuable if it had been in the hands of Deputies beforehand, but that is the only explanation I can make in regard to the many references to the difficulty of interpreting the exact meaning of the Bill.  For instance, reference was made by Deputy de Valera to Section 11. Section 11 has a complicated form of words.  It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (1) of Section 11 of the Act of 1937 is hereby amended by the substitution, for the words &ldquo;twelve months after the date of the passing <Col N="650" /> of this Act&rdquo;, of the words and figures &ldquo;before the 26th day of April, 1946&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Now, interpreted in ordinary language that means that this extends the date of application for wound pensions to twelve months from the date of the soldier's discharge.  That is all it means, but that, however, is the way in which the legal draftsman feels that he must put it, and so, no doubt, it is necessary.</P>
    <P>There were several expressions of opinion in respect to the necessity for consolidating all these pensions Acts. I have no doubt that in the course of time there will be a consolidation, not alone of these pensions Acts, which, in themselves, are very difficult and very complicated pieces of legislation, but of practically all legislation which passes through this House.</P>
    <P>Reference was made also to the fact that we have to bring in here, from year to year, a continuation Bill&mdash;I think it is called the Army Continuation Bill&mdash;which empowers us to carry on the Army from year to year.  We have been doing that over a long number of years, the reason being that we have not got a permanent Act.  As a matter of fact, the permanent Act has been practically completed.  It was practically completed at the beginning of the war and, as a matter of fact, it was actually introduced by my predecessor, but the Second Reading was never taken for the simple reason that the emergency intervened.  That particular document is now to a very large extent obsolete by reason of the fact that so many changes have taken place in the course of the emergency years, and very much of that legislation will have to be altered and changed about.  I do hope, however, that in the course of time we shall be able to comply with the request which was made about consolidating various Acts, especially these pensions Acts.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins made reference to the Disability Board, the Military Pensions Board.  That board consists of a chairman, who is a civilian.  There is a representative of the Army on it, a military officer, and there is another, a civilian doctor, a man with a fine national record in former years. These are the people who investigate <Col N="651" /> the cases which come before them, and as far as I am aware there is no kind of dissension such as would appear to have been suggested by Deputy O'Higgins.  As far as I am led to believe, anyhow, the cases are usually agreed upon by a majority report, and if there is any difficulty, even in respect to the majority report&mdash;a matter about which, perhaps, there might be some doubt&mdash;the matter is referred to me.  So that I am brought into it from the point of view, perhaps, of deciding a particularly knotty issue.  We even go further than that.  If there is any doubt in the minds of the medical men from the point of view of the particular disease, they are empowered to, and in fact do, engage specialists who come in and examine the particular case and are in the happy position of being able to give a completely unbiased and neutral point of view.  Accordingly, I cannot see that any of these cases are dealt with in any particular fashion that could be regarded in any respect as being biased decisions.  The members of that particular board, like all persons who have to make decisions of that kind, are bound by certain regulations and certain terms of reference. We all know that if they go outside these regulations or these terms of reference there is going to be difficulty and, perhaps, trouble for themselves. I think&mdash;although I cannot say it with any assurance&mdash;that they could possibly be surcharged for any undue financial expenditure that might result from their particular decisions. So that they must be careful.  They just cannot allow their sympathy or their sentiment to be the main guide. We have not reached, and I do not believe we ever will reach, that kind of Utopia which the Deputies in this House would seem to like to have existing.  I say that by reason of the expressions of opinion which were made here regarding their desire to have much more generous treatment meted out to applicants than is meted out.  There will always be the position where there will be a group of individuals bound by these regulations and bound by laws, and they can only <Col N="652" /> come to their decisions within the particular restrictions by which they are bound.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been generally welcomed and I am glad that it has been welcomed.  I feel sure that it will bring a lot of relief and amelioration of suffering to a number of people, anyhow. But the position in respect to the men who were not married before they received the wound is one of very great difficulty.  It is not such a simple matter as might be imagined from the discussion this evening.  There is no doubt whatever that, where a married man was wounded while taking part in the fight for freedom, his life partner will be awarded an allowance in respect of his death as a result of that wound, whenever that death may occur.  But it would be very difficult to bring in an individual who, perhaps, marries very many years after the particular exploit in which he was wounded.  So far as I am given to understand, anyhow, the idea behind that particular piece of legislation was to ensure that the man and his life partner would not suffer as a result of his wound.  If the man was not married and, years afterwards, undertook the contract of marriage, that was a matter for himself.  It was a matter to which, I am sure, he gave ample consideration before he entered into the bond.  But he must have been aware, and I am sure he was aware, of what his position would be in respect of this Act.  I am presuming now that the man had a pension for the wound that he had received.  He must have been well aware that that wound pension would die with him.  Therefore he was fully aware of the fact that this particular pension would not be carried over to his widow.</P>
    <P>Then there is the further complication that there are many other Acts involved in any action which we might take in respect to amending this Bill in the manner suggested this evening.  I understand that the Workmen's Compensation Act would be involved, and, if the Workmen's Compensation Act was involved in any amendment which we might make in this particular Bill arising out of the discussion here to-day, while only a few persons might <Col N="653" /> be involved under this particular Bill, many thousands might be involved arising out of the Workmen's Compensation Act.  I undertake to have the matter examined.  I am only mentioning these points to show the difficulty. But, while I am undertaking to have the matter examined again, I am not holding out any hope that anything will be done.  If I can see any way in which the matter can be dealt with, I can assure the Deputies who have spoken that I have just as much sympathy with the object which they have in view as they themselves have.</P>
    <P>In regard to Section 12, which deals with the bringing in of cases of tuberculosis which were aggravated by service, fears were expressed, and perhaps rightly expressed, in regard to the high degree of disablement which is included in the section.  The section states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;such person is at the date of his examination by the Army Pensions Board suffering from a disablement (not being less in degree than eighty per cent.) due to tuberculosis aggravated, accelerated or excited by...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to say that, if my wishes are carried out by the board, and I shall put these wishes in the instructions, the fact that a man has tuberculosis at all will qualify him immediately for full pension.  The idea behind that is that whatever hope there may be for any man suffering from any degree of tuberculosis rests on the fact that he will get that amount of quiet and freedom from worry which the 100 per cent. pension can give him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as the result of the inclusion of the words &ldquo;eighty per cent.&rdquo;  I am assuring the House that the interpretation will be a generous interpretation and that the individuals who are now suffering from tuberculosis aggravated by service will get that type of help which, we hope, will <Col N="654" /> enable them to recover completely in the course of time.  I should also like to make reference to the fact&mdash;I gave the figures when I was making my opening statement&mdash;that about 350 men have been, to date, discharged from the Army as being medically unfit owing to suffering from one form or another of tuberculosis.  It was suggested at one time in this House that tuberculosis was rampant in the Army. I want to take advantage of the Bill we are discussing to say that the total number discharged amounted to only 350, and, in answer to the suggestion by Deputy O'Higgins that there could be a more generous interpretation given by the board, to say that, of these 350 men, 260 have been awarded pensions, leaving only these 90 who were regarded as not entitled to the pension, since the disease was not attributable to service.  These 90 men are being brought in now and any others who may desire to apply, who may be suffering from it between now and the end of the military emergency period.  Deputy O'Higgins also spoke about the &ldquo;soldier's friend&rdquo;, and I was somewhat amused to hear him say there was no person to bring these cases to the attention of the Minister. There may not be any official soldier's friend, but there are 138 Deputies, many of whom frequently write to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, apparently, misunderstood me.  I was not belittling the efforts of any Deputy, but was pointing out that it should not be the function of Deputies, that there should be somebody in the Department whose duty it would be to bring to the Minister's attention cases where there appeared to be an unjust decision.  Then Deputies would not be bothered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That may, or may not be so, and I would not be prepared to argue on that point.  The fact remains, nevertheless, that Deputies appear to me to take an interest in the welfare of such men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>But they cannot take a knowledgeable interest, when they have not the file available, with the <Col N="655" /> documents, and case-sheets, the reports, the X-ray photographs, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the fact remains that, when it is brought to my attention or the attention of the Department, it is also brought to the attention of the board, and the case is usually reopened.  On occasions, that has resulted in an actual addition to the pension or a reversal of a former decision.  I am not saying that Deputies should or should not take that particular interest, or that there should or should not be the soldier's friend the Deputy suggests.  However, we have in the Department of Defence a special section&mdash;set up, as a matter of fact, as a result of discussions with the Deputy himself, during the period of the Defence Conference&mdash;and that section is functioning now.  It has been added to, very largely as a result of the recent large-scale demobilisation of men; and it is doing very fine work. It is dealing even with this type of case, and men are going there now and discussing their problems with the officers in that particular section; and that is all to the good.  The men from the country still use the Deputy for the purpose of having their cases brought to the attention of the Department of the Minister.</P>
      <P>Deputy T. O'Sullivan seemed to be under the impression that men who were suffering from cardiac disease were not entitled to apply under this particular section.  They are: any disability that a man may suffer from as a result of his military service makes him entitled to apply.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that information would be available here at the moment.  We were not expecting to deal with disability cases in general, as it is only the tuberculosis cases which come under this particular Bill. Deputy Brennan spoke about 1916 men who were not entitled to pensions.  All <Col N="656" /> I can say is that, if they did not get pensions in respect of 1916, they can hardly be described as 1916 men.  We can only deal with those individuals who received certificates for that particular service.  The same thing applies in the case of the other service.  Every individual who gave service of any kind, who was a member of the Forces for the period specified in the Bill, will be entitled now to come in under Section 14.  As has been remarked here by some Deputies, there should not be, in future, any reason why any man should die in any county home or place of that kind, since any man who becomes incapable of self-support is now enabled to secure £78, if he is single, or £97 10s.  If he is married, which at least will give him a frugal way of life, if it does nothing else.</P>
      <P>I think I have dealt with most of the points raised.  I am grateful for the kindly references which were made by practically all Deputies to the various sections of the Bill which provide improvements both for the ex-members of the Army and for the Old I.R.A. men.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me that we are dealing in this section with powers of a very <Col N="657" /> wide order, which undoubtedly may be necessary to give effect to the decisions embodied in the Bill.  At the same time, I think we should place some limit both upon the period and upon the manner in which an Order may be made by the Minister.  A period of 12 months would be a reasonable time for the Department to become acquainted with the difficulties that might have to be dealt with by Order, either in existing statutory or other enactments, and I think we should amend the section to that extent.  We have a provision in Money Bills whereby the Minister can give effect to particular provisions, either by Order or by regulation.  Generally, it appears that where he is given such power, the making of the Order or regulation is particularly referred to.  It is based upon the definite authority set out in the Act.</P>
    <P>In this case we are dealing with statutory or other enactments in existence before the passing of this measure.  Many of them are of a character which even the Minister or the officials of his Department may not be fully aware of and they would only come to their notice when they are giving effect to the Act.  We in the House would be in the same position. We would be giving to the Minister certain powers to deal by Order with existing statutory and other enactments which do not come before the House and the character of which we might not be acquainted with.  Therefore, from that point of view, and because of the wide powers involved, I move this amendment limiting the period to 12 months.</P>

      <P>It is quite an unusual thing to endeavour to put a restriction on the exercise of this sort of power.  The power is not an unusual one; it has been granted to a Minister in other statutes which relate to very comprehensive and complicated codes of law.  The Deputy apparently has not any objection in principle to granting that power.  The only thing he feels is that it ought to be exercised within 12 months.  That would put us in the position that we should immediately sit down to consider <Col N="658" /> what adaptations might be required&mdash;not what adaptations experience would show to be required, but what adaptations might be required&mdash; and, on the surmise that some would be required, to make those adaptations whether, in fact, they were actually needed or not.</P>
      <P>I suggest that once the need for a power of this sort has been conceded, it would be swallowing the camel and straining at the gnat to compel the Minister to make all these adaptations within such a limited period as is here referred to.  I think the wiser course would be, if it is admitted that the power is desirable, to leave the Minister the power and let him make these adaptations as the need for them becomes apparent.  If the Minister, by any Order he may make, seems to act without proper justification, or upon grounds which do not commend themselves to any Deputy, that Deputy, of course, has the power to call attention to that Order in the House and he can, if necessary, take such steps as are open to any Private Member to revoke, or compel the Minister to revoke, his Order and to restore the law to the <i>status quo.</i></P>

      <P>I think this section is very objectionable.  We are told that this is an attempt to codify the local government laws.  If it is, then a provision of this sort is scarcely justified and I think there is very good reason why we should limit the power of the Minister to adapt sections out of other enactments whenever it suits him to do so.  We are either going to codify existing local government laws or we are not, and I suggest we will not do it if we leave this provision in which would enable the Minister to take bits out of other legislation any time he likes to do so.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (2), line 47, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;made&rdquo; to <Col N="659" /> the end of the sub-section and substitute the words &ldquo;but no such Order shall have any force or effect unless or until resolutions approving such Order have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that we ought to recognise the difficulties that will face the Minister in dealing with a measure of this kind, giving effect to it and utilising it to codify the local government law.  We have had during recent years indications of the efforts to find short-cuts by way of Orders and regulations to do things which, in other years, would have been dealt with by the Legislature.  We have observed the practice of regulations being made by the Minister, regulations which automatically came into force unless annulled by the Dáil within a period of 21 days.  It is quite true that every Deputy has immediate access to these Orders and has an opportunity, within the stipulated period, of having attention drawn to a particular Order and, if he receives the necessary support, he can have the Order annulled.  But in actual practice Deputies are aware that the spate of Orders and regulations put before the House was so great that it was difficult for the ordinary Deputy, or even a Deputy working in with a political Party, to deal with these Orders and regulations because he had not behind him the machinery that is so readily available to members of the Government.</P>
    <P>In this amendment I am suggesting that we should adopt a different procedure namely, that the Order will not become effective until it has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. I understand this is the practice in other countries and it is more in conformity with the nature of this House and the responsibility of the Minister to the House.  I do not see that any Order that will be made by the Minister under this Bill will be of such tremendous urgency that it could not be dealt with in the manner I suggest.</P>
    <P>There are, perhaps, some Bills in connection with which some delay might occur before the necessary Orders come before the House to be dealt with, and perhaps that might <Col N="660" /> give rise to difficulties; but, in so far as we are codifying existing legislation, it appears to me that it would not be imposing an intolerable strain on the Minister or his Department if he took the reverse procedure of coming to the Oireachtas and receiving sanction for an Order rather than first making the Order and then leaving it to the Oireachtas to decide whether or not it should remain in force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy's amendment arises from a rather exaggerated view of the powers of the Minister under this section.  If the Deputy will read sub-section (1) he will see that the only adaptations which the Minister may make are adaptations of any statutory or other enactment in force at the time of the passing of this Act; that is to say, adaptations of the existing law and in relation to any matter affected by this Act, so that the one Act will be brought into conformity with the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it not also mean that you can adapt any part of an enactment which you propose to repeal in the First Schedule?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No; any enactment in force at the passing of this Act. When this Bill passes, these enactments in the Schedule are repealed. I grant you that it is a very nice question which came first&mdash;the repeal or the enactment&mdash;but still we may assume that it will not operate to maintain in existence an Act which is repealed and, therefore, it can relate only to actual living statue law.  The purpose of that is to bring these two statutes&mdash;and there may be more than two&mdash;into conformity with each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes criticised this section because, he said, this Bill codified some section of local government law. That is quite true, but it is only a step in that direction. There are hundreds of statutes to be dealt with and we can only proceed in relation to this matter very gradually and very largely by experiment.  If we are to be denied the power of making adaptations the moment they occur, subject, of course, to review by the <Col N="661" /> House, there will be unnecessary delay, and we will not get the expeditious administration which I think the country wants.  I think the provision in sub-section (2) is perfectly reasonable, and that it is as much as might reasonably be demanded.  These Orders will be tabled, and, if a resolution is passed by either House within the next 21 sitting days, they become null and void. I think that is the best method.</P>
    <P>If the Order does not appear on its face to be wrong or to be unjustified, why not let it operate, because remember that these Orders in general come under the scrutiny of quite a considerable body of persons?  Apart altogether from members of the House, there are the members of local authorities and the officers of local authorities, and I think we may take it as reasonably certain that if an adaptation as such would appear to be contrary to sub-section (1) or would appear to be unnecessary and unjustified, the attention of members of the House will be brought to it and the matter can be raised here and disposed of.  The other way would only involve delay, and I suggest that the Deputy should not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am not altogether convinced by the Minister's statement.  I do not want to appear as putting difficulties in the way of a measure we welcome.  Any measure which will simplify local government law is very much to be welcomed, and the Minister is to be assisted in his endeavours in that respect, but some of the points he put forward do not carry very great weight with me.  He says that these Orders will be brought to the attention of a large number of persons, including members of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that recently we have had quite a number of Acts passed through the Dáil affecting the functions of the powers of local authorities in one way or another, and the Minister is aware that quite a number of amendments <Col N="662" /> which Deputies thought necessary were inserted, requiring consultation with local authorities on certain points.  I do not suggest that in making these Orders, and especially where this question of adapting existing enactments is concerned, local authorities will be ignored by the Minister; but I cannot see in the section any express obligation on the Minister to consult them.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Minister points out that we are dealing with a section confined both by existing statutes and this measure, so far as it is a matter of adapting existing enactments, to the provisions which we may approve and embody in this measure.  Is that not in large measure what we do at any time? When we bring in Bills of this character, we may repeal a certain section of an existing Act and find that another section will have to be amended accordingly.  We do that in this House. Here we give over completely that power to a Minister.  We will find sections in the Bill as we go through it in respect of which we will make the necessary adaptations, and to argue that merely because they are adaptations this very wide power, almost without restriction in regard to time, and further, in the peculiar atmosphere in which Deputies are undoubtedly labouring under great difficulties, should be granted to the Minister is an argument which must be considered very carefully.</P>
    <P>During the last two or three weeks. Deputies will agree that we have had a spate of Bills and White Papers which would require time to read, and to have to look through the Order Paper each day, check over all the papers made available and see what requires to be questioned, and, if necessary, brought before the House, is to place a tremendous strain on the ordinary Deputy.  This power will continue indefinitely, and, in the course of time, this Bill, which is fresh and new to us now, will become part of the existing statute law and will be something to which attention is no longer paid.  Still, an Order of this kind can be made, and, in the normal way, placed on the Table of the House, subject to review only if some wideawake Deputy happens to notice it and brings it to the-attention of the House.  I still feel that <Col N="663" /> the matter is not of such great urgency that the permission of the House should not be sought before an Order becomes effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support Deputy Larkin.  The normal procedure should be for these Orders to come automatically before the House for sanction.  I have had some experience in regard to county council matters which confirms me in this view.  Under the Management Act, a manager's orders are submitted to the county council, not for approval but at least for consideration. I found that the general practice was that these orders received very scant attention because they were simply laid on the council table when the council ment.  My own county council in Carlow decided to make it a rule that these orders would be considered as the first item on the agenda, and, prior to the meeting of the council, sent to each councillor.  The result of that change was that considerable useful discussion took place on the manager's orders in that county.  I think a similar situation might prevail here.  If Orders had to be submitted for sanction to the House, in many cases it would require only a few minutes of Parliamentary time to get them through, and the mere fact that they had to be submitted to the House would bring them to the attention of Deputies and might obviate the overlooking of some important matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself disagreeing with both the Minister and Deputy Larkin.  I admit that Deputy Larkin's amendment is some improvement, but I object to the inclusion of the section.  Would the Minister not agree that it is a bad precedent, in so far as it is a precedent, to include a section which more or less provides for bad draftsmanship and carelessness in the preparation of a Bill?  The Minister is seeking to provide for omissions which may have occurred when he was considering what repeals were necessary in previous legislation.  Does he not consider that a bad precedent to set up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main disagreement is based on this: that there is a very great difference between considering some particular <Col N="664" /> point in an Act which is affected by a Bill at the time the Bill is before the House and considering it later when put forward in the form of an Order.  It is difficult enough sometimes for Deputies to appreciate the precise force of a change in the law in a Bill in relation to the general body of legislation, but I think that to take a particular point which may turn up under an Order and try to get that discussed in a proper manner would lead to a difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that Deputy Sheldon is urging upon us a counsel of perfection.  After all, even Minister have a limited capacity, and I gather from what Deputy Larkin and Deputy Cogan have said that the capacity of Deputies is more limited still.  We are not able to foresee what precise amendments may require to be made in that vast body of law which bears on local government matters.  I think it is only reasonable that we should admit that fact to ourselves, and say that, in the course of experience, certain minor points&mdash;because they are minor points&mdash;will arise which will require that one Act be dovetailed into another, and that two statutes should be co-ordinated.  That is all the power that sub-section (1) of Section 6 gives to us.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue that is involved in the amendment to sub-section (2), it seems to me to be almost a case of Tweedledum and Tweedledee except for this: that Deputy Larkin has told us of the immense volume of work which falls upon Deputies.  I can tell the Deputy that the volume of work which falls upon Ministers and their Departments is not a light one either.</P>

      <P>And, of course, you have no Opposition to deal with.  The House very often, and from now on certainly much more often, finds itself faced with a vast mass of business to deal with, so that if our system is going to work we must find a way to make it work with reasonable efficiency <Col N="665" /> and expedition.  If Deputies are going to put upon the Government, not merely the onus which the terms of the section as it stands impose upon it but the onus of bringing to the attention of the Oireachtas, by tabling these Orders, anything which the Minister may do under sub-section (1) of Section 6 so that those who are interested in local government matters&mdash; there are some Deputies who are particularly interested in them&mdash;may have an opportunity of examining the Orders for themselves and, if they feel that the Orders are not justified, of drawing the attention of the House to that fact and persuading the House, if they are able to do so, to annual the Orders: if, as I say, you not only put the onus upon the Government of giving the House the opportunity of considering these matters in that way but you put upon it the heavier obligation of moving motions in the House in relation to every one of these Orders and of initiating discussions on each of them, I think you would so clutter the House up with business relating to minor matters of this kind that the much more important matters pressing on the House would not be attended to for the reason that there would not be time to deal with them.  I think, as I have said, bearing in mind that we have to make this system of ours work, when you put the onus on the Government of letting the members of the House know what is being done under the section, leaving them to take action in relation to any of these matters that they feel called upon to do so, that, in all the circumstances, you have imposed a heavy enough obligation on us, and that to go further in the matter would not be reasonable.</P>

      <P>I think this is a most objectionable section.  The Minister has told us that if we are to make our Parliamentary system work at all we must give him the sort of power he is seeking here.  I do not think that the House should stand for bureacratic power of <Col N="666" /> this sort.  If, at a later stage, the Minister wants to amend this measure in any way, there is the normal machinery of Parliament to do that. What I fear may happen if this section is left in the Bill is this: if there is some action pending, and if the Department of Local Government find that the action is inconvenient in any way, they will hunt through every piece of legislation on the Statute Book to find a section that will protect them, and the Minister will then make an Order embodying that section in this particular piece of legislation.  The action will then fall to the ground immediately.  I think that is most undesirable.  I think that is the real danger that is inherent in this section, and I do not think the House should stand for it.  We know that in certain litigation recently the Attorney General was beaten, and that a new Order, with retrospective effect, was made defeating the decision of the court in that particular case. That is a warning to the House, and for that reason I strongly object to the section.  If the Minister and his Department anticipate that anything is likely to occur in the future they are bound to hunt through every piece of legislation on the Statute Book and pick out a section that will protect them.  The Minister will then make an Order adopting that particular section.  I think that is most objectionable.</P>

      <P>I wonder would the Minister consider changing the sub-section and, instead of putting it in a negative way, put it in a positive way, which would, I think, probably meet Deputy Larkin's difficulty.  I suggest that the sub-section should be: &ldquo;Every Order proposed to be made under the section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and if a resolution annulling the Order is not passed within 21 days, it shall have the force of law.&rdquo;</P>

The Deputy says: &ldquo;Any Order which the Minister proposes to make&rdquo;<Col N="667" /> not &ldquo;any Order which he has made.&rdquo; I suppose you could say, if the House were to carry a resolution objecting to the proposal that within a stipulated period of time the Minister would be debarred from making the Order, but I am afraid that that would make normal administration quite impossible.</P>

      <P>I said administration. I did not say legislation.  I said that would make normal administration quite impossible.  I am sorry if the Deputy misunderstood me.  There is nothing abnormal about this proposal. It is not a new precedent. There is scarcely an Act of the Oireachtas that does not contain a provision of this sort for the making of Orders, the making of regulations, the tabling of them before the House, and providing that the regulations shall come into effect when they are made and shall only cease to have effect if the House passes a resolution annulling.

If such Order has been made it will be tabled here and the Deputy will have an opportunity of making a case against it, in the same way as he will have an opportunity of making a case, if he so desires, against any Order made under this section.  These Orders have been discussed in this House before, not merely during the period of the emergency, but prior to that and during the time of the administration of the Party to which the Deputy belongs.  It has been accepted as the only way in which you can really deal <Col N="668" /> with matters of minor detail and minor importance.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that a section like this, or something similar, is essential to enable the Minister to make necessary adaptations of previous legislation.  The only difficulty seems to be as to the method of preserving the control of the House and, in the meantime, without being obstructive, to do the thing the Minister requires.  We know that in many cases, even in the pre-emergency period, Orders were tabled and were discussed in this House but we have discussed Orders in this House that had been in operation for two or three months before they were tabled.  There is nothing to indicate when the Order will be tabled and when the 21 days start.  Taking into account absence from the House, there is, to my mind, a great danger that Orders may go through and there would be very little chance of surveillance or supervision by individual Deputies or Parties.  These may be Orders changing local government law, not period Orders such as we have been <Col N="670" /> dealing with formerly, but permanent legislation enacted into the code, and the question is whether it is desirable to give the Minister permission to make such enactments at any time he feels it is necessary, when it is quite possible that it will escape the vigilance of the House.  I think that is really the point at issue.  If it were going to entail serious delays that would hinder the Minister from achieving the purpose in mind, that is a serious matter, but can we visualise that the changes to be made from the old Acts would be of such an urgent character that they could not afford to wait so that they could be brought in the normal way before us and before the Seanad and have them passed formally in perhaps a few minutes if they were not of an objectionable character.  I think the Minister should devise some better means than he has.  He has not accepted the amendment and no more can be said about it, but I think the section as it stands leaves room for grave objection by the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) Rates shall be paid directly to the secretary of the local authority and may be sent by registered post, or lodged in any bank to the credit of the local authority.</P>
      <P>To put the matter in a nutshell, the object is to do away with the necessity of paying huge sums for the collection of rates all over the country. In Mayo £13,200 was collected in this way.  We have a precedent for this method in the manner in which the Irish Land Commission collects money from all parts of the country.  There is no flaw in that method of collection, and I do not see why there should be any flaw in the method suggested by this amendment for the collection of rates.  There would also be a substantial saving.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept this amendment because it would, as Deputy Blowick virtually stated, abolish the existing system of rate collection which, whatever may be said about some counties, has shown itself to be a cheap and efficient method of rate collection.  The Deputy would substitute for it a system which has already been tried in one county, and an approximation of which has been tried in another county.  In both cases it was attended with such ill success that, in the county with an approximation <Col N="672" /> to it, the system of collecting rates through the Post Office was abolished in 1926 and, in the other county, the abolition of the system and adoption of the more general system is under consideration.  This proposal by Deputy Blowick has already been tried in two counties, and found very unsatisfactory, and, so far as the present system of rate collection is concerned, in the vast majority of the counties, it operates very satisfactorily and with reasonable economy.  In the light of these circumstances, I think that we should not adopt the principle of the amendment at all.  Apart altogether from the question of principle, the amendment in its drafting is very unsatisfactory, and it would not be quite as simple, even it we did agree that the principle was a sound one, or that it would be as simple as the amendment implies, to put it into operation.  We should require a vast number of consequential amendments. I do not think we could undertake this at the moment.  Apart from that, we have tried in a couple of counties something very like this system, and in neither case has it been a success. Therefore, faced with past experience, the Committee ought to reject the amendment.</P>

I do not know where that was tried, but it seems to me to be a rather peculiar way of paying rates.  Another aspect was not mentioned by Deputy Blowick, nor was it referred to in the amendment.  I wish to know from the Minister if the custom of people having to attend in person at rate collector's offices between certain hours will continue, or will payment by cheque be recognised?  I wish to call the Minister's attention to that in order that in avoiding one danger we might not fall into another.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister's arguments against this amendment are not convincing.  He stated that the experiment was tried out by two counties, but we have now new evidence before us as to the manner in which it was conducted.  Much would depend on the machinery adopted to ensure that payment would be regular and punctual. We have had experience in regard to land annuities which are paid into the banks.  That has been found satisfactory and convenient to the annuitants as well as being inexpensive.  It might be contended that land annuities consist of the same sums being paid yearly or half-yearly, and that for that reason it is simpler than the payment of rates from year to year.</P>
      <P>If proper notification were sent through the post, clearly stating the amount of rates to be paid, and where they were to be paid, it would be sufficient indication to each ratepayer and the system should work fairly well.  In many counties, the ratepayer has to go into some town to meet the rate collector and give him the money.  I do not think that that was what was intended when rate collectors were appointed.  The intention in appointing rate collectors was that they should visit the ratepayer and personally collect the rates.  The opinion, no doubt, was that the visit of the rate collector would be so psychologically unpleasant that the ratepayer would be induced to pay up promptly.  That system has been departed from in many counties.  The ratepayer has to meet the rate collector at a certain town or village.  It would be just as easy for ratepayers to go into a bank with their rates as to go into a publichouse or hotel to meet the rate collector.  There is nothing objectionable in this amendment and the experiment has not got a fair trial.  It should be given a further trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Minister will not agree to accept this amendment. County councils would get very <Col N="674" /> little rates if this system were put into operation.  An experiment was tried in some part of the country by which rates were paid directly to the county council and it did not work out.  Deputy Cogan is not accurate in saying that it is not the duty of a rate collector to call on a ratepayer.  That is part of the terms of his appointment.  He is not, however, bound to wait for a week or a month for his rates.  If he calls once, he is entitled to take any action he thinks fit if the rates are not paid. But he is bound, under the terms of his appointment, to call and, so far as I know, rate collectors always to call. If they do not, it is the duty of the county council to compel them to do so.</P>
      <P>It is well known that rates are collected much more expeditiously than land annuities.  There is much less owing in rates in any particular county than there is in land annuities.  That is because there are rate collectors who call on the ratepayers and get in the rates.  That is why arrears of rates are less than arrears of land annuities in any county at any given date in any year.  I think that I am fairly accurate in saying that, even though rates are much higher in amount than land annuities in every county.  If there are efficient collectors, they will call on the people and get the rates.  The ratepayer is not bound to call on the rate collector until the collector has called upon him.  If the rate collector does not call on him, then he is not bound to seek out the collector.  If such a system as is advocated were adopted, county councils would find that there would be big arrears of rates.  It would be a bad system, and would not obtain the rates for the county councils.</P>

If you do pay, you need not pay the other moiety until 31st March. Perhaps what I am about to mention does not arise on this amendment.  If you go to a manufacturer for goods, you will get 5 per cent. discount if you pay cash within five days after delivery <Col N="675" /> or 2½ per cent. for payment within a month or 1¼ per cent. for payment within two months.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the Minister or with Deputy Allen that this amendment would not work.  The Land Commission, a responsible Government Department, has been collecting annuities for a long time and, if they had found the system advocated in this amendment as unsatisfactory as Deputy Allen would have us believe, they would have changed it and adopted a better system.  I do not agree that the amount of annuities outstanding is greater than the amount of rates outstanding.  The present system of rate collection may be fairly satisfactory from the collection point of view but it can scarcely be claimed that it is satisfactory from the expense point of view.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision in view of the fact that the Land Commission have collected annuities under the system here proposed for so many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though the amendment was not drafted by a lawyer, I do not think that the difficulties suggested by the Minister would arise.  It has been put forward as an argument against the amendment that, because of the varying amount of the rates from year to year, the minds of the people would become confused.  That would not occur.  From year to year, there is only one variation in rates&mdash;an increase. The increase may be heavy or light, but the people have a fair idea of what their rates amount to from year to year.  Most people are anxious to clear their way as they go along and it is immaterial to them whether they discharge their liabilities through the post or otherwise.  There are, of <Col N="676" /> course, slackers who will not pay rent or rates if they can get away with it, but the majority of people meet their liabilities and there is no necessity for a rate collector to call.  It is the precedent established by the Land Commission which induced us to put down this amendment.</P>

      <P>Experiments in both types of collections have been tried in the county from which I come.  I admit that it is a very large county.  We have rate collectors who go around in the ordinary way, and we have the office system by which ratepayers come to the courthouse, as they would come to a bank, to pay their rates.  We have found that that system does not bring any saving in expense.  A staff has to be kept there.  At certain times of the year, temporary hands have to be employed, and the rate collection in this way is much on a par with that of the ordinary collection throughout the county.  I do not think that there is any advantage in the system proposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that a good deal could be urged to show that the impersonal form of collection suggested in the amendment would not be a success, as Deputy Allen contends. Personal contact by the rate collector has tremendous influence.  There is the additional point that arrangements are <Col N="677" /> made between the payee and the collector in regard to instalments of the rates.  There is the important point to be considered, too, that if the amendment were adopted, it would mean the displacement of a number of individuals whom we would not like to see displaced.  I think I am correct in stating that the point of view expressed <Col N="678" /> by Deputy O'Donnell is not quite the law as it stands at the moment, that is, that he could manage to get away, so far as the legal point is concerned, by not paying his full rate until the 31st March.  If the law were enforced, he would find himself in trouble after the 1st October.</P>

      <P>The deletion of the sub-section would mean that the expenses of town commissioners would become a county-at-large charge, and <Col N="681" /> that the county council could not charge the commissioners for the cost of collection, and other expenses.  As the Deputy is aware, the purpose of sub-section (4) is to make the county council responsible for meeting the demand of the town commissioners, and for that purpose to enable the county council to collect the rate which is appropriate to the demand of the town commissioners.</P>
      <P>At the present moment, as the Deputy knows, town commissioners collect their own rate, which is limited, I think, to 2/6 in the £, except where they have special expenses arising out of housing undertakings or the provision of school meals.  At present, of course, the town commissioners strike their own rate and are responsible for its collection.  When the Bill becomes law, the town commissioners will demand what they require from the county council, and the county council will collect it with their rate.  It is intended to simplify the procedure from the point of view of the inhabitants of towns which are administered by town commissioners, and to rationalise the existing system of collection.  The demand will be made by the town commissioners in the first place on the county council, and the county council will levy the necessary town rate and will be responsible for its collection.

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> Before sub-section (5) to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Where the expenses of a council under the foregoing sub-section exceed 7½ per cent. the excess amount may with the consent of the Minister be recovered in the succeeding financial year by a levy on the area of the town.</P>
    <P>The Minister is anxious to rationalise the whole system of collecting local rates and to make it more economical in the case of a county council, where a rate collector calls on an individual living in a local town and where you have town commissioners.  I suppose that, from the Minister's point of view, it was ridiculous to send another man to collect the one rate, and that it would be better to let the one man do the job.  I do not know whether 7½ per cent. will cover the cost in the case of the administrative work that would be required.  The Minister has told us that 5 per cent. is the normal amount allowed to the rate collector for collection.  I am wondering whether the other 2½ per cent. will cover expenses and also cover whatever amount would be irrecoverable, that is, expenses of a county council which are incurred in meeting a demand made by the commissioners of a town in the county.  I am suggesting in my amendment that if you are going to throw this responsibility on the county council, they at least should not lose by it, and that if they are down in a particular year, they can make good the deficiency in the rate the following year.  I think that the Minister is attempting to deal with the matter of a deficiency in another way under Section 13, but I must say that I do not like the Minister's amendment.  However, my case is that if we are going to use the county council for this purpose, we can at least ensure that the county council will not lose anything by the transaction; and I am prepared to meet the Minister and say that they should not be allowed to benefit by the transaction either.  Certainly, however, we ought to ensure here that the county council will be in a position to recover whatever expenses are involved.  The Minister may not like my amendment, <Col N="683" /> but if he assures me that he will bring in some provision that will ensure the county council being in a position to recover their expenses, I shall not press the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, of course, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it is very difficult to estimate accurately in advance what would be the actual cost to a county authority of collecting town rates.  We have to have some figure, however, and we have suggested 7½ per cent.  I have pointed out that of the 7½ per cent., we may assume that at least 5 per cent. would be poundage and that the other 2½ per cent. would be to cover expenses such as the preparation of rate books, demand notes, and all these other things.  I think that, on the whole, it ought to be sufficient to do that.  After all, it amounts to only 6d. in the £, and it is difficult, I think, to expect that it will cost as much as 6d. in the £ to send out demand notes for everybody.  I am, in fact, rather surprised at the line which Deputy Hughes has taken in regard to this matter, because any criticism that I anticipated on this section was in the opposite direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That perhaps we might be allowing the county council too big an expense item.  However, it is not possible to fix this thing with any sort of definiteness, and I suggest that we should try it out at the 7½ per cent., and then, if after a few years it should prove to be too much or too little, as the case may be, I have no doubt that we can mend our hand. The objection I have to Deputy Hughes's amendment is that while it will allow a county council to recoup itself if the 7½ per cent. is too little, it does not make any provision requiring a county council to refund to the ratepayers any part of the 7½ per cent., if it is found to be too much.  I think also that Deputy Hughes will agree that it would hardly lead to prudent administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I can only say <Col N="684" /> that I am sorry that Deputy Allen is in the Chair at the moment because I feel quite sure that he would support me in this.  Why not fix the amount at 7½ per cent., provisionally, for the first year, and then, every year after that, fix the actual amount on the basis of the previous year?  The Minister admits that it is a rough estimate and that it is very hard to measure it accurately. Now, I do not want to see a county council losing money, or to have an extra job or extra work thrust on it.  Accordingly, I suggest making it provisional for the first year on a 7½ per cent. basis.  Then, every succeeding year, you can fix the actual cost of the preceding year and collect for the preceding year; so that your administrative expenses would be a year in arrears all the time.  The thing would be based on the previous year.  I suggest that you can get over the difficulty that way.</P>

      <P>Well, I do not want to be too steadfast in a matter of this sort, which is a matter of personal judgment rather than anything else, but there is a difficulty which I think the Deputy will appreciate.  Supposing you have, as we anticipate we will have, the one person collecting and the one staff issuing receipts and demand notes: how will you apportion their time as between the collection of what is actually due in the case of the town commissioners and what is a county-at-large charge?  The amendment would raise these difficulties, and I think that, as we are trying to iron out all the anomalies that exist in connection with the collection of rates, it would be better to prescribe a definite percentage in the Bill, and let us see how it works.  However, I shall think over what the Deputy has said and see if, between now and the Report Stage, I might find some way of dealing with the problem.  I admit the Deputy's point about the county-at-large charges and the matter of town charges, but it might be very difficult to get it to work.</P>

I am not altogether against that principle where it can be carried out with justice and fair play, as it makes for more ease and efficiency, perhaps, in administration.  At the same time, I do not think that county councils should be deprived of the right to strike a separate rate in a particular area where they think it is necessary and justifiable.

      <P>Before Section 13, page 8, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The following provisions shall apply in relation to any portion of the county rate made by the council of a county for the purposes of a deficiency in the county fund arising from town charges:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  such portion shall be assessed and made separately from the remainder of the county rate,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  for the purposes of such assessment, the valuation of a hereditament of any of the following classes shall be reduced to one quarter of the actual valuation <Col N="687" /> under the Valuation Acts of the hereditament:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  land used solely for one or more of the following purposes, that is to say, as arable, meadow or pasture ground or as woodlands, or market gardens, or nursery grounds,</P>
    <P>(ii)  land covered with water and used as a canal and any towing path to the same,</P>
    <P>(iii)  land used as a railway constructed under statutory powers for public conveyance,</P>
    <P>(c)  no assessment shall be made on any half-rent rateable to the poor rate under Section 63 of the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act, 1838, and the enactments amending the same.</P>
    <P>(2)  Nothing in this section shall apply to or operate to reduce the annual value with reference to which the tax in respect of any hereditament under Schedules A and B of the Income Tax Act, 1918, is ascertained.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this new section is to have town charges assessed on the same basis as the town rate levied by town commissioners is assessed at present. The rate levied for the purpose of the Town Improvement Act, 1854, is assessed on occupiers rated to poor rate, but in the case of land in the towns only on one-fourth of the valuation. The purpose of this section is to preserve that basis of assessment, as Deputies will see if they read the section.</P>

Paragraph (b) says: &ldquo;for the purposes of such assessment, the valuation of a hereditament of any of the following classes shall be reduced to one-quarter of the actual valuation under the Valuation Acts of the hereditament.&rdquo;  All the classes are set out.  They relate mainly to land. Sub-paragraph (i) says: &ldquo;land used solely for one or more of the following purposes, that is to say, as arable, meadow or pasture ground or as woodlands, or market gardens, or nursery grounds.&rdquo;  Under sub-paragraph (ii) you have: &ldquo;land covered with water and used as a canal and any towing path to the same&rdquo;.

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 13 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  In this section the expression &ldquo;the Act of 1939&rdquo; means the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1939 (No. 23 of 1939).</P>
      <P>(2)  The application of the agricultural grant in a county by allowances as provided for in the Act of 1939 shall cease to apply.</P>
      <P>(3)  For the purpose of the assessment and levying of the county rate on a tenement of agricultural land situated in a rural area&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the specified valuation as defined in the Act of 1939 shall be reduced to not more than 2/5ths of the valuation thereof under the Valuation Acts;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> (b)  where the valuation of the agricultural land exceeds £20, the excess shall be reduced to not more than 3/5ths of the valuation thereof under the Valuation Acts.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is in a mood to appreciate something which makes for increased efficiency and despatch in the conduct of local government affairs. Before I go any further I might say that there are a couple of omissions apart from the general sense.  I can appreciate that to produce the precise effect I want a great deal more elaboration would be necessary.  I bring this forward principally in the spirit of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps more money too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant to include the clause the Minister has in the section passed with regard to income-tax. That was an inadvertence on my part. Also I would be prepared to include that the precise fractions which I mention in paragraph (a) of sub-section (3) should be fixed by the Minister in order to take such affairs out of local polities.  A situation might arise where a candidate for a local election might say: &ldquo;I will reduce the fraction to one-fifth.&rdquo;  I would be prepared to allow the Minister to settle that by fixing it.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that my main purpose is to simplify the system of distributing the agricultural grant inside a county.  Anyone who is a farmer and pays rates, or anyone associated with the affairs of a local authority, realises that the present system under the 1939 Act is highly complex, and leads to a great deal of work in the offices of the various county councils each spring.  It also leads to some trouble to the individual farmer, as he has a long form to fill up each year, showing how many people are employed between the ages of 17 and 70. The next thing that happens is that these forms are all related to the amount of the agricultural grant in the county, and then each occupier of agricultural land has to be sent a form showing him how his relief is arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" /> This is the first point I would like to make.  Any landowner would realise that it is difficult enough for an ordinary person to check up from an ordinary demand and know whether it is correct or not&mdash;mistakes do occur occasionally&mdash;but it is almost physically impossible for anyone to make out whether or not he is getting the proper relief.  In my county the rates in the £ for the various grants&mdash;primary, secondary and supplemental&mdash;are shown to four places of decimals, and most people burk at trying to calculate the rate on £13 6s. 9d. at 9.3472d. in the £. I have had cases brought to my notice where mistakes have occurred.  It is a minor point, but has been the cause of quite an amount of annoyance to the individual.  In the office, this work is complex, too, though not complex as far as the actual calculation is concerned, once one has the figure.  I imagine there is a fair amount of complexity in arriving at the exact number of pence in the £ under the three headings which will absorb the agricultural grant in the county.  Presumably, the accountant and the staff must attempt to do that.  I admit freely that I do not claim any more credit than is necessary for what I propose.  I got the idea from the Minister.  He is providing something similar in Section 39 to deal with land in urban areas, and it struck me that that would be a very sensible way to give the relief on agricultural land and put the intentions of the 1939 Act into force without all the long complications every year.</P>
    <P>The only major change in policy which this will bring about is to do away with the employment grant which, as Deputies probably know, was an attempt to encourage long-term employment by giving relief from rates.  In fact, it does not give any encouragement whatever.  Most people are inclined to take the amount of the secondary grant&mdash;the number of pence in the £&mdash;and multiply it by £12 10s., to show the relief they get for employing a man for a full year.  That is not so.  It is the difference between the secondary grant and the supplemental grant which they must multiply by £12 10s., because he would get the supplemental grant anyway.  In Donegal, with a rate of almost 20/- in the £, the <Col N="691" /> precise amount of extra relief which is got by employing another man for a full year is something less than 36/-, and I do not think anyone would consider that a great encouragement.  I am not saying for a moment that it is a bad thing to encourage employment, but I do suggest that, in effect, the 1939 Act did not encourage employment.  If employment has increased since then, it is due to other causes.  For instance, in my own county, anyone can see that 36/- might encourage you to employ a man for 52 weeks instead of 51, but not for 12 months instead of two or three. However, I do not want to say too much until I hear the Minister's reactions, but I would like to put it very strongly that it would give simplicity. The first bit of work that would have to be done would be the finding of the figure.  After that, it would go on for year after year.</P>
    <P>In framing the thing and finding the fractions, I have another minor point in view, that is, partially to shift the burden of rates from the shoulders of the farmers to other property owners. I am not sure that the Minister will get up to defend the property owners, as I have heard him on the subject before and I think I am on fairly safe ground. The actual amount of shift that would take place would be a good deal less than might appear at first.  The drop in valuation which would take place in a county would mean that, if you have a good rate in the £, the county's income would drop and, therefore, a higher rate would have to be struck but that increase would bear more heavily on other hereditaments than on agricultural land, through the provisions of this proposed section.  I suggest that that is perfectly fair.</P>
    <P>Those with experience of business in rural areas know very well that, as compared with agricultural holdings, their valuation is a negligible matter. I have experience of that myself and I know that, taking a business in a village or a country town, the amount they have to meet in the way of rates is a very small part of their expenses; whereas to a farmer it is a very high part of his expenses.  If you take a farmer of £20 valuation of land&mdash;and I <Col N="692" /> am talking only about his land valuation&mdash;in my county he pays round about £12 in rates, as his relief is something like £7 13s. 6d. and our rate is almost 20/- in the £.  I do not know whether it is generally realised that, if you take someone with an earned income in a city or town who is paying in direct taxation about £12, he would have an income of over £500 a year, if a married man with two children. I have taken two children, to avoid any complexity in wandering into children's allowances when he has three.  Such a man with £500 a year would pay about £11 5s. 0d.  I am subject to correction, but I think that is fairly accurate.  I do not think anyone would suggest that a farmer with a £20 valuation of land was better off than a man with £500 a year.  They both pay about the same in direct taxation. That is a point not often realised.  I suggest it is quite fair that some slight part of the burden, at any rate, should be shifted, but I want to make it clear that my main intention is to secure for rural areas the simplicity which the Minister is seeking to bring in for urban areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a very interesting statement from Deputy Sheldon in support of this amendment, so interesting that I am rather sorry that, if he wanted to raise this matter at all, he did not raise it in a form which would allow it to be discussed in its full implications.  I do not know whether the Deputy is aware of it or not&mdash;though, having listened to his speech, I think there is scarcely an aspect of his amendment that has escaped his attention&mdash;but the effect of accepting this amendment would be practically to nullify the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act of 1939, and to wipe out the whole system which was brought into operation by that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If for no other reason than that, I could not accept an amendment which would have that effect on a Bill of this sort.  The proper approach to it would be to bring in a Bill to amend the Act of 1939 by substituting for it the principles on which his amendment is founded; or, if the Deputy did not wish to do it in that precise form, <Col N="693" /> to put down his amendment as a motion and have it discussed by the House.  The fact of the matter is that his amendment would not only nullify the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act of 1939, but would also, as the Deputy has admitted, result in the shifting of a very considerable portion of the burden of rates from land to other hereditaments; so much so that I think any caluculation would show that on the average there would be an increase of two shillings or more in the pound in the burden on other hereditaments.</P>
    <P>I think that is a matter the full implications of which would have to be very seriously considered.  It certainly will not be any encouragement to a farmer to improve his dwelling or the offices attached to his farm if we are going to have the already heavy rates, as the Deputy says, increased by as much as 10 per cent., or perhaps more in some cases.  For that reason, though I must say that I appreciate the attention which the Deputy has given to the matter and the scheme, apparently, is one to which he has given a great deal of consideration, I could not possibly accept an amendment of such a far-reaching character on a Bill of this sort.  I suggest to the Deputy that he ought to give the House another opportunity of considering his proposal.</P>

These would all disappear if the Deputy's amendment were passed and, not only would they disappear but, if it were desired, if it were the Deputy's intention, to prevent any heavy increase in the rates on hereditaments other than land, then the amount of the agricultural grant would have to be very considerably increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a good deal of what Deputy Sheldon has said, and particularly with his comparison as between the valuation of agricultural land and other hereditaments, such as a business premises.  There is no doubt that there is inequality as between the two types of valuation.  I think the principle he has outlined of reducing the valuation of agricultural land has a good deal to be said in its favour but, unfortunately, it does not go far enough, because there are at the present time quite a number of citizens who, by reason of the fact that they enjoy fairly considerable incomes and do not hold rateable property to any extent, avoid paying their fair share of contributions to the local expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel, however, that I would not like to see the principle of employment allowances abolished because only yesterday we were arguing that the employment allowance should be increased so as to provide for complete derating up to £15 in respect of each man employed. I would not like to depart from that principle.  I think that the failure of the employment allowance up to the present to increase employment has been due to the very meagre relief that it gives.  As a matter of fact, it is only £2 or £3.  The employment of an additional man gives relief to the extent of only a couple of pounds and it would hardly pay the health insurance <Col N="695" /> or workmen's compensation insurance of the employee.  It would not encourage a farmer to employ additional men.</P>
    <P>I think the amendment is too far-reaching in one sense, and it does not go far enough in another sense.  What we require is the complete abolition of rates on agricultural land.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 9, to add at the end of the section two new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  Where immediately before the commencement of this section there were two or more persons acting as rate collectors in an urban area, each of such persons shall be deemed to have been duly appointed immediately upon the commencement of this section to be a collector of the municipal rate in the urban area for such district as may be assigned to him and, for the purposes of any enactment relating to superannuation or compensation for loss of office, this Act shall be deemed not <Col N="696" /> to have operated to abolish his office or to alter his position materially to his detriment.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where immediately before the commencement of this section there was one person only acting as rate collector in an urban area, such person shall be deemed to have been duly appointed immediately upon the commencement of this section to be the collector of the municipal rate in the urban area and, for the purposes of any enactment relating to superannuation or compensation for loss of office, this Act shall be deemed not to have operated to abolish his office or to alter his position materially to his detriment.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make the poor rate and town rate collectors the collectors of the new municipal rate.  Sub-section (3) makes the existing rate collectors the collectors of the municipal rate.  It is necessary to do that so that they cannot retire and claim compensation on the grounds that their offices have been abolished.  Sub-section (3) deals with the position which will arise in urban areas where there are separate collectors for the town rate and the poor rate.  In that case, the collectors will remain, but, as there will be only one rate, the collectors will be given each a separate district.  It will be an easy matter to adjust the districts so that the collectors will have the same remuneration as before.</P>

There are already existing town rate collectors and poor rate collectors, and, as the Bill stands, we are making it a municipal rate, and unless we have a provision in the Bill to safeguard the <Col N="697" /> position, they could claim that their offices were abolished and could retire on pension.  It is to ensure that their employment will be regarded as continuous and that in the case where there happened to be two collectors in one town, we would be able to apportion the town area between them.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (1), page 10, and substitute the following sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  For the purpose of the assessment and levying of the municipal rate on a hereditament situated in an urban area which is a borough and included in a class mentioned in the second column of Part I of the Second Schedule to this Act, the valuation of the hereditament shall be deemed to be reduced to the proportion, specified in the first column of that Part of that Schedule in respect of such class, of the actual valuation under the Valuation Acts of the hereditament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  For the purposes of the assessment and levying of the municipal <Col N="698" /> rate on a hereditament situated in an urban area which is not a borough and included in a class mentioned in the second column of Part II of the Second Schedule to this Act, the valuation of the hereditament shall be deemed to be reduced to the proportion, specified in the first column of that Part of that Schedule in respect of such class, of the actual valuation under the Valuation Acts of the hereditament.</P>
    <P>(3)  Part II of the Second Schedule to this Act shall, in relation to a hereditament which is agricultural land within the meaning of the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1929 (No. 23 of 1929), have effect as respects the first six local financial years during which this section is in force subject to the following modifications:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in the case of the first of those years, the proportion of the valuation specified in the first column of the said Part shall be taken to be six-twentieths.</P>
    <P>(b)  in the case of the second of those years, such proportion shall be taken to be seven-twentieths,</P>
    <P>(c)  in the case of the third of those years, such proportion shall be taken to be eight-twentieths,</P>
    <P>(d)  in the case of the fourth of those years, such proportion shall be taken to be nine-twentieths,</P>
    <P>(e)  in the case of the fifth of those years, such proportion shall be taken to be ten-twentieths.</P>
    <P>(f)  in the case of the sixth of those years, such proportion shall be taken to be eleven-twentieths.</P>
    <P>This is probably one of the most important amendments to the Bill.  As the House may be aware, the powers of municipal councils in regard to raising municipal rates were not substantially altered by the Local Government Act of 1898, except for the provision in the Act for consolidating with the poor rate any municipal rate.  Unfortunately, this proved abortive, and the consequence has been that rates levied in towns which were then of an extraordinary variety have still remained in <Col N="699" /> a state of some confusion, because certain of these rates were raised under town statutes and a large number of local Acts.  They are, of course, based on the valuation for poor rate at the time of the 1898 Act, but they have differed in the proportions in which the rates are imposed on different kinds of property.</P>
    <P>The present system of rating is based on two principles.  One is that the ability of the occupier to pay the rates is roughly proportionate to the annual value of the property he occupies and the other that the cost of the benefits of local services should be distributed equally, according to the rateable value of the property.  I do not propose to contend that in every case these principles truly and accurately apply.  It has, however, been generally admitted that, in regard particularly to lands in towns, the principles do not accurately apply.</P>
    <P>One of the main purposes which we have been seeking to secure by the provisions in this part of the Bill is that rates will be levied upon more or less uniform principles in all our urban areas, and, for that purpose, in the Bill as originally drafted, we had a comparatively simple Schedule, fixing the proportions of the valuation upon which the hereditament was to be assessed. Since the Bill was circulated, this matter has been further examined, as a result of representations made from one source or another and we have come to the conclusion that it cannot be quite so simply dealt with as we had anticipated.</P>
    <P>We propose instead to divide the one-part Schedule in the Bill as circulated into two parts, Part I of which will deal with urban areas which are boroughs, and Part II with urban areas which are not boroughs, and in respect of each of these areas to fix the appropriate fraction of the valuation upon which the hereditament is to be assessed.</P>
    <P>If Deputies turn to the Schedule, they will see that, so far as Part I is concerned, that is, the part applicable to urban areas which are boroughs, the <Col N="700" /> assessment will be made upon a larger fraction of the valuation than in the case of urban areas which are not boroughs.  That arises from the fact that practically every borough has had its own level of assessment for the purpose of levying rates upon the various classes of hereditamnts, mainly, as I have said, lands, included in the Schedule.  It was generally intended that the borough rate should be levied uniformly over all properties in the same way as the poor rate, but, in Clonmel, Kilkenny, Sligo and Wexford, there were systems of differential rating.</P>
    <P>In Clonmel Borough, for instance, under a local Act of 1895 arable land was rated at one-quarter of the valuation to a consolidated borough rate. In Sligo, on the other hand, under local Acts land was rated on one-half of the valuation.  In Wexford there are six rates: poor rate, borough rate, a special rate, two water rates and an improvement rate.  A differential system of assessment operates on the special and on the two water rates, public and domestic.  In Kilkenny only one-fourth of the borough rate is levied off land.  In Drogheda, on the other hand, a local Act of 1896 put land on the same basis for rating as buildings, depriving occupiers of land of a right which, of little or no value at that time, would be of great value now. In Galway land is assessed at the full borough rate with a public water rate of 3d. in the £.  We have tried to bring some sort of order out of this state of confusion and to provide a uniform rate of assessment for land, principally land and half rents in all these boroughs.  The fraction which we have taken is, as I have already told the House, the fraction of three-fourths in the case of land, and of one-half in the case of half rents.  This will mean that the holders of land of the nature described in the second part of the column to the Schedule, that is to say &ldquo;land used solely for one or more of the following purposes: arable land, meadow or pasture ground or as woodlands, or market gardens or nursery grounds&rdquo; will henceforth be assessed at three-fourths of the valuation of that particular <Col N="701" /> hereditament.  This, in some cases, as in the case of Drogheda and Galway, will mean that land owners and occupiers will get some relief, and that in other places their burdens will be slightly increased, but, in view of the very varied methods of assessing land for rates in these various towns, we cannot avoid that position.  It would, of course, be very nice if we could allow every land holder to get relief at a uniform rate, but on the other hand, of course, that would simply mean that the burden of rates which these hereditaments should bear would be transferred to other ratepayers.</P>
    <P>Land in towns and in urban districts is, of course, in quite a different category from land in the ordinary rural areas, and whatever views either Deputy Sheldon or Deputy Cogan may have as to the desirability of complete derating of land in rural areas, I do not think they would be quite so zealous in urging that land inside a borough or in an urban district should be derated. Well, complex and confused as is the position of the law relating to the rating of land in boroughs, it is a simple matter compared with the condition of affairs in urban districts.  We have 21 urban districts where they get part of the agricultural grant and where land is, consequently, assessed at various rates.  In the case of urban districts we assume that, perhaps, the value of land is not so great as in the case of county boroughs, and we are therefore proposing that the proportion of the valuation on which it should be assessed should be only three-fifths. Once again, as in the case of the boroughs, that will mean that in some cases there will be a slight gain, and in other cases a slight loss to the general body of ratepayers or to land holders, but, as I have said, we cannot do anything better than to try to strike what appears to us to be a fair average.  The purpose of the amendment with which I am dealing is to provide that the provisions, in relation to the agricultural grant, will be framed to give effect to the provisions of Parts I and II of the Second Schedule.</P>

In order to enable us to do that, we are proposing not to proceed with Section 20 of this Bill until the Seanad has finally disposed of the Rent Restrictions Bill when we shall re-introduce this or some alternative provision on the Report Stage of the Bill.  In these circumstances, I do not think it will be necessary to proceed with the amendments to this section.</P>

      <P>Before Section 22, page 11, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Where, in the local financial year ending immediately before the commencement of this section, any part of the agricultural grant was payable by the council of a county to the council of an urban district, such council of a county shall, in each <Col N="704" /> subsequent local financial year, pay an amount equal to such part to such council of an urban district out of the agricultural grant and such amount shall thereupon be paid into the municipal fund.</P>
    <P>(2)  In this section, the expression &ldquo;the agricultural grant&rdquo; has the same meaning as it has in the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1939 (No. 23 of 1939).</P>
    <P>This Bill relates to those urban areas &mdash;and there are some which have been, I think, established since the Act of 1898 came into operation&mdash;in respect of which portion of the agricultural grant payable to the county council has become payable to the urban district council.  Under the Bill, as I have shown, agricultural lands and urban districts will get relief from the municipal rates to the extent set out in the Second Schedule.  In the boroughs, land will be assessed at three-fourths of the valuation and in other urban districts, at three-fifths.  Where the agricultural grant has been applied to the relief of rates in an urban district the assessment, it is proposed, will be, in the first year, on six-twentieths, rising gradually until the 7th year, when it will be twelve-twentieths, that is to say, three-fifths.  The reason of that is, of course, that existing land holders in certain of these areas receive the benefit of the agricultural grant and it is not proposed to deprive them of that immediately.  The agricultural grant will continue to be paid at the present rate to the county council, who will pay it to the urban district council, when it will go into the municipal fund and gradually, as I have said, land inside these urban areas will be assessed, in the first instance, in the first year, at six-twentieths of its valuation and will continue to bear an increasing assessment until it is brought into uniformity with land in all other urban districts, that is to say, it will be assessed at three-fifths of its valuation.</P>

      <P>(3)  A person who&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  immediately before the commencement of this section held the office of collector of rates under the commissioners of a town, and</P>
      <P>(b)  had held that office for not less than ten years, and</P>
      <P>(c)  is not entitled under any enactment other than this sub-section to compensation for the abolition of that office,</P>
      <P>shall be paid by such commissioners on account of such abolition a gratuity equal to either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  one-fifteenth of his yearly salary and emoluments, within the meaning of Part IV of the Local Government Act, 1925 (No. 5 of 1925), in respect of that office for each complete year of his service, or</P>

    <P>This is an amendment to provide compensation for loss of offices in certain cases.  It is meant, in fact, to deal with the point which was raised by Deputy Fogarty on the Second Reading of the Bill.  It was a point which was overlooked. It is a perfectly reasonable proposal, I think.  It may happen that in certain of these very small towns a <Col N="706" /> person who held office as collector of rates under the commissioners of the town should not be employed by the county council for the purpose of collecting the rates, and this provides that in certain circumstances, namely, that he had held the office for not less than ten years, and is not entitled under any other enactment to compensation for the abolition of that office, he shall be paid by the commissioners on account of the abolition a gratuity equal to either one-fifteenth of his yearly salary and emoluments, or such yearly salary and emoluments, whichever is the less.</P>

No matter how much we may feel for people who are, in fact, redundant&mdash;whose time has passed by&mdash; and no matter how sympathetic we may be, we must remember that we have obligations to the people who have to provide the money.  I think I have not been unreasonable.

There is another point of view to be put before the House. Every time we give generous terms on the abolition of an office we are, certainly, giving ground for increased demands in future, because, every time a question of abolition comes up, some one wants to do better than the last time.  We have simply to act with a sense of responsibility in these <Col N="709" /> matters.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 23, page 11, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The council of a county may, with the consent of the Minister, borrow on the security of the county rate for the purpose of lending, to the commissioners of a town which is not an urban district and is situated in the county, any sums required by the commissioners for the purpose of the exercise or performance of any of their powers, functions or duties.</P>
      <P>(2)  If a sum, which consists either of portion of loan advanced pursuant to this section by the council of a county to the commissioners of a town or of interest on any such loan, remains due and unpaid for a period of three months, the council may, without prejudice to any other remedy, raise such sum, increased by 7½ per cent. thereof, on the area of the town as if such sum, as so increased, were part of the town charges.</P>
      <P>(3)  A loan as respects which the commissioners of a town which is not an urban district are the borrower and which, immediately before the commencement of this section, stood charged upon a rate ceasing, by virtue of the repeal by this Act of Sections 60 to 65 of the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act, 1854, to be leviable shall stand charged upon the county rate of the county in which the town is situated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is to give a county council power to loan money to commissioners of towns which are not <Col N="710" /> urban districts.  At present, town commissioners have power to borrow on the credit of the rates and to mortgage the rates.  They have, in fact, borrowed almost £500,000, most of which is for housing.  Under this Bill, the town rate will disappear and the expenses of the commissioners will be provided out of the county rates.  What the new section proposes is that, in future, the county council will have power to lend money to commissioners in towns, and the existing loans of town commissioners will be charged on the county rates. The county council is given effective means of recovering in case of default, and the question of a charge on the rates, therefore, will be little more than a legal formality.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 31 (a):&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (1) and substitute the following sub-sections:</P>
      <P>(1)  If, at any time after the rate in the pound of the rate for a local financial year has been determined by a rating authority, it appears to the Minister that such rate at such rate in the pound is likely to be insufficient to meet the part defrayable out of rates of the expenses to be incurred by the rating authority in that financial year in&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  maintaining at a reasonable standard the public services for the maintenance of which the rating authority is responsible, and</P>
      <P>(b)  paying to any other body any sums which the rating authority are bound to supply to that body,</P>
      <P>the Minister, after holding a local inquiry into the sufficiency of such rate in the pound for such rate or authority either to revoke such determination and determine a new rate, may require the rating (if by reason of any steps already taken for the making, levying or collecting of such rate, such a course is more convenient) determine a rate in the pound of a supplementary rate for that local financial year.</P>
      <P>(2)  Within 14 days after the date of the receipt by the secretary or clerk of a rating authority of notification that a requirement has been made under sub-section (1) of this section, the rating authority shall comply with such requirement.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where a rating authority determine pursuant to a requirement under sub-section (1) of this section a rate in the pound of a supplementary rate, it shall be the duty of the rating authority to make, levy, collect and recover such supplementary rate.</P>
      <P>(4)  Where a rating authority in relation to whom a requirement is made under sub-section (1) of this section determine and make pursuant to the direction either&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" /> (a)  a new rate in the pound of a rate, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a rate in the pound of a supplementary rate,</P>
    <P>which in the opinion of the Minister is insufficient, the Minister may by Order remove from office the members of the rating authority.</P>
    <P>(5)  For the purposes of Part IV of the Act of 1941, an Order under sub-section (4) of this section shall be deemed to be an Order under Section 44 of that Act and the removal from office of the members of the rating authority concerned shall be deemed to be a removal from office under that section.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where a person or persons has or have been appointed under Part IV of the Act of 1941 to be a commissioner or commissioners for a rating authority whose members have been removed from office, such person or persons may revoke any determination by the rating authority of a rate in the pound of a rate for the current or the next local financial year as had been made before his or their appointment (whether it is the first determination of a rate in the pound, the determination of the rate in the pound of a new rate or the determination of the rate in the pound of a supplementary rate) and may determine the rate in the pound of such rate as if no earlier determination had been made or may determine a rate in the pound of a supplementary rate for such local financial year and make, levy, collect and recover such supplementary rate.</P>
    <P>This amendment is intended to make clearer the original intention of Section 23.  In the debate on Second Reading, sub-section (1) was criticised very severely by financial purists&mdash; people like myself who think there should be only one budget in the year. I think that there should be only one budget in the year but the Committee will agree that that budget should be sufficient to cover all the expenses of the year.  Where there is reason to believe that, wilfully and deliberately, a rate has been struck which would be insufficient to provide for the <Col N="715" /> reasonable, normal expenses of the public services and insufficient to enable a local authority to fulfil such obligations as it may have to any other body, the Minister should have power to step in and say: &ldquo;This is undesirable financial procedure&rdquo; and, accordingly, direct the local authority to strike a rate which would be sufficient.</P>
    <P>In any case in which the local authority, having received that direction, fails or refuses to comply with it, then the Minister should have power to remove members from office and to put in a commissioner who will ensure that the county services will be properly maintained, and that the necessary revenues will be raised for that purpose.</P>

      <P>I want to resist the idea that the Minister has obtained from some source a function to override the locally elected body.  I could appreciate the Minister taking that power if local authorities were elected on a restricted franchise.  Since the Minister's own Party brought in adult franchise for election to local authorities, those bodies are now as democratically elected as this House, from which the Minister derives his authority.  I do not see why he should have that overriding authority in respect of a democratically elected body. Surely the inhabitants of an area who elect their local authority have the right to determine how much they can afford to expend.  Whence does the Minister derive greater authority than members of the local authority, elected on the same franchise as members of this House?</P>

      <P>I thought that the Minister had the power which he now seeks.  He has decapitated local authorities in circumstances similar to those now contemplated.  Local managers were appointed under the control of the Minister.  In a recent Departmental circular, the power and authority vested in local authorities is stressed.  It has been said by somebody that the local authorities are in the saddle on one day of the 365 days of the year.  That is the day they strike the rate.  That is a mere fairy tale.  They are not in the saddle on that day, because, if they do not strike the rate which the Minister's manager thinks proper, the Minister has power to abolish those bodies.  This is a further encroachment upon the limited authority and freedom of the locally elected representatives of the people. Although it is an additional statutory power, the Minister has already been exercising it.  Whether the Minister has done so legally or illegally, he has scrapped county councils for refusing to strike the rate which he regarded as proper.  We had the case of Cork County Council.  It was held that the local authority was the body entitled to strike the rate but, despite the opinion of Mr. Lavery, the authority of the Minister could not be challenged and the council had either to bow or get out.  What is the purpose behind this amendment?  Would it not be decent to tell the local authority to get out completely and let the whole business be run from the Custom House? Why did the Minister go to the trouble of sending us a circular telling us all the things we could do when every Act restricts local authorities more and more?  County councils will strike a proper rate but, if they do not do things according to the Minister's views, they can be struck off.</P>

      <P>I think that the Minister should further consider this whole section. It is unjust to members of local authorities who are elected by the people.  The number of local authorities which refused, over a 20-year period, to strike an adequate rate would be very small.  The Minister was Minister for Finance for many years and I am told that he ran short of funds, as a result of his Budget estimate, on certain occasions.  He was not impeached because he had to borrow for a short period.  The same principle would apply here.  Governments have often to bring in supplementary budgets because they find themselves short of funds.  If a local authority deliberately sets out to strike a rate which will not meet the cost of local services, it is looking for trouble.  Most local authorities will, <Col N="718" /> according to my experience, strike a sufficient rate to meet the cost of services for the year ahead.  A large number of the charges on local authorities are statutory charges for which they must strike a rate.  There are, then, the charges for salaries.  Four-fifths of the charges which local authorities have to meet from year to year are statutory and cannot be altered.  The only discretion they have the Minister seeks to abolish, if they will not strike a rate sufficiently high, in his opinion, to cover one-fifth of the services of the county.  I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported.  Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>
